This securities case was brought\n\nagainst    Boston    Scientific,        a    publicly    traded   manufacturer        of\n\nmedical    devices    based   in    Natick,        Massachusetts.         The   appeal\n\nconcerns dismissal of claims based on the company's launch of a new\n\nproduct, the drug-eluting TAXUS coronary stent, and its eventual\n\nrecalls.    Plaintiff, a Mississippi pension fund and purchaser of\n\nBoston Scientific stock, alleges that company executives both\n\nwithheld material information about problems with the stent and\n\ndecisions addressing those problems, and made misleading positive\n\nstatements,    in    violation     of       sections    10(b)   and   20(a)     of   the\n\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a),\n\nand the attendant rules and regulations, including Rule 10b-5, 17\n\nC.F.R. § 240.10b-5.\n\n            Plaintiff     appeals           the   district      court's    grant      of\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(6).    The district court held, in a thoughtful decision, that\n\nplaintiff failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements\n\nimposed by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n\n(\"PSLRA\"), Pub.

(\"CAC\") ¶¶ 1, 15-23.\n\n            Plaintiff      sued    on    behalf      of    a   putative      class    of\n\nindividuals and entities who purchased equity securities in Boston\n\nScientific from March 31, 2003 to August 23, 2005.                           Id. ¶ 1.\n\nPlaintiff alleged that during that period, defendants made false\n\nand misleading statements and caused the market price of the\n\ncompany's securities to be artificially inflated, both harming\n\ninvestors and allowing the individual insider defendants to enrich\n\nthemselves in excess of $332 million.                Id.\n\n            Plaintiff's         original     complaint         divided      into     four\n\ncategories its allegations regarding defendants' statements about\n\na   civil   lawsuit    with      Medinol    Ltd.,    a     Department       of   Justice\n\ninvestigation      into     a     1998     product        recall,     the    company's\n\nintroduction of TAXUS stents to the market, and FDA investigations\n\nand warnings regarding Boston Scientific's plants.                    Only the TAXUS\n\nstent issue is before us on appeal following the dismissal of all\n\nclaims.\n\n            In particular, plaintiff advances these theories.                          By\n\nlate 2003 defendants became aware of serious problems in patients\n\nin Europe resulting from the insertion of the new TAXUS stent, not\n\nyet   introduced      in   the    United    States.         The     TAXUS   stent    was\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fintroduced in the United States in March 2004; American doctors\n\nreported similar problems.   In the spring of 2004 defendants made\n\naffirmative statements attributing the problems reported about the\n\nnew TAXUS stent to the unfamiliarity of doctors with the new stent.\n\nThey did not correct the statements even though they had become\n\naware that the problem was not doctor unfamiliarity, but rather a\n\nmanufacturing defect in the stent that caused the balloon to fail\n\nto deflate.   Defendants continued to withhold information about a\n\nmanufacturing change Boston Scientific had instituted in December\n\n2003 which would address the defect. They withheld the information\n\nto build up inventory, in order to preserve market share, before\n\nannouncing recalls of TAXUS stents based on the potential defects.\n\nMeanwhile, while withholding this material information, several of\n\nthe individual defendants traded on the open market in unusual\n\npatterns and unusual amounts.   When the material information was\n\nfinally and belatedly disclosed, the market price for Boston\n\nScientific stock plummeted downward.   The stock price dropped 7.6%\n\nafter the company announced an expanded recall and revealed that\n\nthree deaths and several dozen serious injuries had been connected\n\nto balloon deflation failure, and it dropped another 6.6% when the\n\ncompany expanded the recall of the TAXUS stent for a second time.\n\nCAC ¶¶ 100, 102.\n\n          The defendants' theory is that at the time the company\n\nreceived some thirty to forty reports of problems in Europe of\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fballoon non-deflation following stent insertion, it was unable to\n\nidentify anything about the device itself that would cause the\n\nproblem   and   attributed   the   problem   to   doctor   unfamiliarity.\n\nDefendants' brief argues that independently and\n\n           [i]n an effort to improve the device, Boston\n           Scientific tried completely to eliminate the\n           possibility of balloon non-deflation.       It\n           eventually identified a means to do so, by\n           changing the manner of bonding the delivery\n           catheter to the balloon and by implementing an\n           additional inspection test at the end of the\n           manufacturing   process.      These   proposed\n           modifications were submitted to the FDA for\n           approval in April 2004 and approved by the FDA\n           the following month.     In June 2004 Boston\n           Scientific began manufacturing the \"new\"\n           device.\n                   After it identified how to completely\n           eliminate what was already an infrequently\n           occurring issue, Boston Scientific was able to\n           re-analyze its \"old\" Taxus inventory.     That\n           process led to the identification of specific\n           lots that had the potential for non-deflation.\n           Out of an abundance of caution, Boston\n           Scientific voluntarily recalled a limited\n           number of specific production lots of its\n           \"old\" Taxus stents in July and August 2004.\n\n           It is the company's position that the changes would have\n\nbeen implemented \"whether it got a complaint or not.\"         The removal\n\nof the possibility that the balloon would fail to deflate by the\n\nmanufacturing change did not prove there was a defect, much less\n\nthat the company knew at an earlier date of a connection between\n\nthe manufacturing change and the problem that necessitated the\n\nrecalls, or that it was obliged to disclose it.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fA.            Plaintiff's Allegations\n\n              Plaintiff brought the suit as a putative class action.\n\nThe class period plaintiff claims is relevant to this narrowed\n\nappeal is December 2, 2003 to August 5, 2004.\n\n              In 2001, Boston Scientific decided to produce a drug-\n\neluting stent2 to compete with a similar product manufactured by\n\nJohnson & Johnson.       CAC ¶ 86.   Boston Scientific's product is known\n\nas   TAXUS®    Express   Paclitaxel-Eluting     Monorail®    Coronary   Stent\n\nSystem.   Id.\n\n              TAXUS debuted in Europe in January 2003.       Id. ¶¶ 87, 92.\n\nPlaintiff alleges that defendants felt \"tremendous pressure\" to\n\nintroduce TAXUS into the U.S. market because the company was losing\n\nmarket share to Johnson & Johnson.          Id. ¶ 87.   While in the process\n\nof obtaining final FDA approval for TAXUS, defendants allegedly\n\ndownplayed news that could delay the U.S. launch, such as failing\n\nto disclose in a timely manner an FDA major deficiency letter that\n\nthe company received in September 2003.             Id. ¶ 89.    Meanwhile,\n\n\n      2\n          Coronary stents are tiny tubes placed in patients'\narteries to ameliorate blockages and facilitate blood flow. Drug-\neluting stents (also called \"coated\" or \"medicated\" stents) slowly\nrelease drugs aimed at reducing restenosis, a narrowing of the\narteries that can occur after a stent is implanted. Stents are\nimplanted in arteries using a delivery catheter.\n          In 2002, Boston Scientific marketed a coronary stent\nsystem called the Express², which combined its highly successful\nExpress™ coronary stent and Maverick® balloon dilation catheter,\nwhich uses a tiny balloon to inflate the artery and permit the\nstent to be inserted. TAXUS uses the same delivery catheter as the\nExpress²; the systems differ in that Express² is a bare metal stent\nwhereas TAXUS is a drug-eluting stent.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdefendants \"provided to the investment community a drum roll\n\nleading up to the FDA's approval of TAXUS which was deafening.\"\n\nId. ¶ 90.    Plaintiff alleges that in anticipation of FDA approval\n\nand in response to positive comments made by defendants, analysts\n\nupgraded their rating of Boston Scientific stock, and by March\n\n2004, the price of Boston Scientific stock on the New York Stock\n\nExchange hit a new high, trading at over $40 a share.            Id. ¶¶ 15-\n\n23, 91, 100.\n\n            On March 4, 2004, the FDA approved TAXUS for marketing\n\nand distribution in the United States.           Id. ¶ 92.        Plaintiff\n\nalleges    that   Boston   Scientific   \"trumpeted   [TAXUS's]    immediate\n\nimpact in the Company's effort to take over market share for\n\nstents.\"    Id.    Meanwhile, defendants did not disclose complaints\n\nthey had received from doctors in Europe that the balloon used\n\nduring insertion of the TAXUS stent did not deflate.             Id. ¶ 93.\n\nDefendants also knew that the Express² metal stent, upon which the\n\nnew TAXUS stent was based, \"had a history of significant problems.\"\n\nId.\n\n            Despite   this    knowledge,   defendants    \"minimized     and\n\nmisrepresented . . . problems,\" including in the company's Form 10-\n\nQ for the quarter ending March 31, 2004, which Boston Scientific\n\nfiled with the SEC on May 7, 2004.         This report stated that the\n\ncompany was \"reviewing a limited number of reports related to\n\nballoon withdrawal difficulty during TAXUS angioplasty procedures.\"\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fId.   In meetings with analysts, defendants \"further downplayed the\n\ncomplaints\" by attributing the problems to doctor unfamiliarity\n\nwith TAXUS rather than balloon non-deflation.                Id.\n\n            Meanwhile,     plaintiff     alleges,     defendants     knew       \"the\n\nproblems with TAXUS were much more significant, based on the\n\ncomplaints they had received out of Europe and the complaints which\n\nwere rolling in as a result of the product rollout in the United\n\nStates.\"     Id. ¶ 95.      In December 2003 defendants allegedly had\n\nbegun planning a manufacturing change for TAXUS because they had\n\nbecome     aware   that   the   problem       with   TAXUS    was   not     doctor\n\nunfamiliarity      but    rather   a    \"manufacturing        defect.\"          This\n\nmanufacturing change, which according to defendants was approved by\n\nthe FDA in May 2004, related to the manner of the laser bonding of\n\nthe delivery catheter and balloon.             Defendants did not disclose\n\nthis manufacturing change to the public prior to July 2, 2004, when\n\nthey referred to it in a conference call with analysts.                   Id.     ¶¶\n\n95, 98.    Defendants also discussed the manufacturing change in the\n\npress releases announcing subsequent recalls on July 16 and August\n\n5.\n\n            Plaintiff alleges that defendants had an obligation to\n\ndisclose this manufacturing change to the public at some point\n\nprior to July 2 because it was necessary to correct defendants'\n\nearlier and continuing statements that the adverse reports related\n\nto U.S. doctors' unfamiliarity with TAXUS rather than to a defect\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fwith the product itself.      As plaintiff put it at oral argument:\n\n\"The disclosure that we are asking for is that as soon as they\n\nlearned that . . . the problems with TAXUS were not related to\n\ndoctor [un]familiarity . . . they had a duty to disclose that.\"\n\n            In the months following the U.S. launch of TAXUS, Boston\n\nScientific's stock price rose and defendants began to sell large\n\nquantities of their own stock.       CAC ¶ 96.    Plaintiff specifically\n\npoints to the following stock sales, all of which occurred within\n\ntwo months of the FDA's March approval of TAXUS: over $40 million\n\nby James R. Tobin; over $54 million by Lawrence C. Best; over $4\n\nmillion by Fredericus A. Colen; and over $3 million by Robert G.\n\nMacLean.      Id.    Additionally,   defendant    Paul   LaViolette      sold\n\napproximately $3 million worth of company stock in June of 2004.\n\nId. ¶ 18.     Plaintiff argues that these sales demonstrated \"unusual\n\npatterns\" and occurred in \"unusual amounts.\"\n\n            On July 2, 2004, Boston Scientific announced that it was\n\nvoluntarily recalling two lots of TAXUS stents (a total of 200\n\nstents), which had not yet been implanted in patients.            Id. ¶ 97.\n\nIn a press release announcing the recall, the company stated that\n\nthe FDA had received reports of one death and sixteen serious\n\ninjuries associated with balloon non-deflation, along with eight\n\nreports of balloon malfunction that had not caused injury.               Id.\n\nThe   press    release   explained   that   the    recall   was    due     to\n\n\"characteristics . . . related to a narrowing in the area where the\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcatheter and balloon are laser welded,\" a problem referred to as\n\n\"focal neckdown.\"      \"This narrowing resulted in the potential for\n\nimpeded    deflation   and   removal    of    the   balloon   after    stent\n\nplacement.\"\n\n            The manufacturing change that defendants had put into\n\nmotion in December 2003 addressed the problem of focal neckdown by\n\nchanging the manner of the laser welding of the catheter and\n\nballoon.   In a conference call with analysts on July 2, defendants\n\nasserted that this manufacturing change had been in progress before\n\nthe TAXUS launch and \"would have been submitted whether we got a\n\ncomplaint or not.\"     Id. ¶ 98.\n\n            Two weeks later, on July 16, defendants voluntarily\n\nexpanded the company's recall to 85,000 TAXUS stents and 11,000\n\nExpress² stents -- which use the same delivery catheter as TAXUS --\n\nand admitted knowing of two additional serious injuries associated\n\nwith TAXUS as well as two deaths and twenty-five serious injuries\n\nassociated with balloon deflation failure in Express² stents.              Id.\n\n¶ 100.     In a press release announcing this recall, defendants\n\nassured    the   public:   \"The   Company    implemented   review     of   its\n\nmanufacturing process, additional inspections, and an FDA-approved\n\nmodification to the manufacturing process for these products.              The\n\ncurrent and future production are not expected to experience\n\nsimilar balloon deflation problems.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f              After defendants announced this expanded recall on July\n\n16, Boston Scientific's stock price dropped $3.09 per share, or\n\n7.6%, to $37.40.      Id. ¶ 100.     Plaintiff connects the drop in stock\n\nprice to the revelations of the deaths and injuries associated with\n\nthe TAXUS and Express² stents.          Id.\n\n              Plaintiff alleges that during July and early August 2004,\n\ndefendants \"continued to try to reassure the market about the\n\nsafety of the Company's products through the issuance of public\n\nstatements which were false and misleading.\"                   Id. ¶ 101.         In\n\nparticular, during a conference call with analysts on July 26,\n\n2004, defendant Paul LaViolette responded to concerns about TAXUS\n\nby    saying,    \"[Y]ou   are   dealing      with   simple    lag    time   in   the\n\nmarketplace      conversion     of   newer    products,      not    necessarily    a\n\ncontinuation of complaints from the new issue product.\"                  Id.     At a\n\nmeeting with a local hospital official on July 29, LaViolette\n\nstated that the company had \"identified and fixed the problem.\"\n\nId.    On August 4, he stated that the problem was a \"nuisance.\"                 Id.\n\n              On August 5, Boston Scientific announced that it was\n\nvoluntarily recalling an additional 3,000 TAXUS stents.3                       Id. ¶\n\n102.       The press release announcing the recall stated that it was\n\nprompted by the company's \"ongoing monitoring\" and noted that since\n\nthe company had \"modified its manufacturing process, implemented\n\n\n       3\n          The complaint states the date of the third recall as\nAugust 4, but the press release announcing the recall is dated\nAugust 5.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fnew tracking software and introduced new inspection protocols,\" it\n\nhad not had any confirmed non-deflation problems caused by focal\n\nneckdown in the units made with these changes in place.           At this\n\ntime, the company's stock price dropped another $2.41, or 6.6%.\n\nId.\n\n            By the end of 2004, Boston Scientific had recalled 99,000\n\nTAXUS and Express² stents because of manufacturing defects that\n\nplaintiff alleges had caused three deaths and dozens of serious\n\ninjuries.    Id. ¶ 103.   The company spent over $57 million on these\n\nrecalls.    Id. ¶ 101.    Between July 2, 2004, when the first recall\n\nwas announced, and August 5, 2004, when the recall was expanded for\n\na second time, the company's stock price dropped 21%.          Id. ¶ 103.\n\n            Plaintiff's theory is that the investing world was aware\n\nof reports of patient death and injury involving TAXUS.          However,\n\ndefendants said that the problems with the TAXUS stents were caused\n\nby doctor unfamiliarity with the new product.        It was natural for\n\ninvestors to conclude the problems would disappear over time as\n\ndoctors became more familiar with the product, and there would be\n\nno    recalls.   Having    given   that   explanation,   the   defendants,\n\nplaintiff argues, were required to disclose as soon as they could\n\nthe connection between the patient problems, the manufacturing\n\ndefect, and the manufacturing change remedying this problem.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fB.        District Court Opinion\n\n          In   dismissing   the   TAXUS   claims,   the   district   court\n\nreasoned in a series of discrete steps.4     It first noted that there\n\nwas no violation in not disclosing the FDA major deficiency letter\n\nregarding TAXUS that Boston Scientific had received in September\n\n2003, before the U.S. release of the product.         Rather, the major\n\ndeficiency letter was simply \"a step in the FDA approval process\n\nwhich [Boston Scientific] had no duty to disclose.\"         In re Boston\n\nScientific, 490 F. Supp. 2d at 158; see also id. at 158 n.91\n\n(citing 21 C.F.R. § 814.37(b) (\"A major deficiency letter informs\n\nthe applicant that its PMA [Premarket Approval Application] lacks\n\nsignificant information needed for FDA to complete the scientific\n\nreview of, and render a final decision on, the PMA.\")).\n\n          The court next turned to the adverse reports from doctors\n\nthat defendants received prior to announcement of the recalls of\n\nthe TAXUS and Express² stents in July and August of 2004.              The\n\ncourt examined the company's statements that complaints received\n\nfrom American doctors in the spring of 2004 were comparable to\n\ncomplaints it had received the previous year from European doctors.\n\nPlaintiff asserted that these statements were false when made\n\nbecause the company knew that the problems in both Europe and the\n\nUnited States resulted from a product flaw rather than from the\n\n\n     4\n          We discuss the district court's opinion only as it\npertains to the TAXUS claims because only that part of the opinion\nis being appealed.\n\n                                  -15-\n\fstated reason of doctor unfamiliarity with TAXUS.                     However, the\n\ndistrict court concluded, plaintiff provided \"little in the way of\n\nfacts to support this claim.         Lead Plaintiff pleads no facts to\n\nsuggest that the complaints [Boston Scientific] received from\n\nAmerican   doctors    were   different     than    those   it    received       from\n\nEuropean doctors.\"     Id. at 159.\n\n           With respect to the manufacturing change which Boston\n\nScientific initiated prior to the U.S. launch of TAXUS, the court\n\nrejected plaintiff's allegations that this change was evidence that\n\ndefendants   knew    TAXUS   was   defective      and   that    the    change   was\n\nmaterial information that should have been disclosed.                   Id.     Here\n\nthe district court invoked the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. The\n\ncourt reasoned that a manufacturing change does not necessarily\n\nmean that a product is defective or that a company knows that a\n\nproduct is defective since \"[c]ompanies frequently adjust and\n\nchange their products, and no rule requires a company to inform the\n\npublic every time it modifies its manufacturing process.\" Id. The\n\ncourt pointed out that Boston Scientific's manufacturing change was\n\nconducted with the FDA's knowledge, at a time when the company had\n\nreceived only a limited number of complaints from European doctors,\n\nwhich had been tapering off.          Id. at 160.          Plaintiff did not\n\ncontest that the manufacturing change was set in motion before\n\nTAXUS's release in the United States and would have been made\n\nregardless of whether the company received complaints from U.S.\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fdoctors. Id. The district court further noted that \"[t]he recalls\n\nwere limited, and only applied to a fraction of the TAXUS stents\n\nreleased on the domestic market.\"            Id.   Thus, the court concluded,\n\nwhile \"[i]n hindsight . . . it appears that this manufacturing\n\nchange may indeed have been material,\" id. at 159, plaintiff failed\n\n\"to allege facts that provide a strong inference that at the time\n\nof   the   manufacturing       change,     Defendants   knew   that     TAXUS    was\n\ndefective or that the product would later be recalled,\" id. at 160.\n\n              With respect to defendant Paul LaViolette's July 29, 2004\n\nremarks that Boston Scientific had identified and fixed the problem\n\nwith TAXUS, the district court also invoked the doctrine of fraud\n\nby hindsight.         A week after LaViolette's statements, the company\n\ninitiated an additional recall of 3,000 TAXUS stents. However, the\n\ndistrict court reasoned, there is no liability where \"a plaintiff's\n\nclaim rests on the assumption that the defendants 'must have known\n\nof the severity of their problems earlier because conditions became\n\nso bad later on.'\"         Id. (quoting In re Boston Tech., Inc. Sec.\n\nLitig., 8 F. Supp. 2d 43, 53 (D. Mass. 1998)).                  Here, the court\n\nconcluded that plaintiff failed to allege facts giving rise to a\n\nstrong inference that LaViolette knew at the time of his remarks\n\nthat   they    were    false   or   that    an   additional    recall    would    be\n\nnecessary.      Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f                                    II.\n\n          On appeal, plaintiff argues that the district court erred\n\nin several respects.      It argues that the court misapplied the\n\ndoctrine of fraud by hindsight, resulting in the imposition of too\n\nstringent a pleading standard.         More specifically, it claims that\n\nthe court erroneously drew factual inferences against plaintiff\n\nregarding the manufacturing change and failed to account for the\n\nmateriality of the change. Plaintiff further argues that the court\n\nmisapplied the fraud by hindsight doctrine to LaViolette's remarks\n\nby discounting the temporal proximity between his statements and\n\nthe third TAXUS recall, and it challenges the district court's\n\nfactual assumption that the recall was limited in scope.             Finally,\n\nplaintiff faults the district court for failing to consider the\n\nallegations    of   insider    trading    presented     in   the   complaint.\n\nOverall, plaintiff argues the district court atomized the complaint\n\nand did not look at the overall pattern.\n\nA.        Pleading Requirements\n\n          We   evaluate   de    novo     whether   a   complaint    meets   the\n\nrequirements of the PSLRA.      ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 58.          As with any\n\nRule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, we accept well-pled factual\n\nallegations in the complaint as true and make all reasonable\n\ninferences in plaintiff's favor.         Id.   The standard most recently\n\narticulated by the Supreme Court is that a complaint must allege \"a\n\nplausible entitlement to relief\" in order to withstand a motion to\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fdismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

Ct. 1955, 1967-69 (2007); ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 58.\n\n          A claim for securities fraud under section 10(b) and Rule\n\n10b-5 must contain six elements: (1) a material misrepresentation\n\nor omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or\n\nsale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss\n\ncausation.   ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 58 (citing Dura Pharm., Inc. v.\n\nBroudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005)).   Only the first two elements\n\nare at issue in this appeal.\n\n          Information is material if a reasonable investor would\n\nhave viewed it as \"having significantly altered the total mix of\n\ninformation made available.\"   Gross, 93 F.3d at 992 (quoting Basic\n\nInc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 232 (1988)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).   The PSLRA provides that a misleading statement or\n\nomission is alleged when plaintiff claims that defendant made \"an\n\nuntrue statement of a material fact,\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)(A),\n\nor \"omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the\n\nstatements made, in light of the circumstances in which they were\n\nmade, not misleading,\" id. § 78u-4(b)(1)(B). \"While a company need\n\nnot reveal every piece of information that affects anything said\n\nbefore, it must disclose facts, 'if any, that are needed so that\n\nwhat was revealed [before] would not be so incomplete as to\n\nmislead.'\"   Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 36 (quoting Backman v. Polaroid\n\nCorp., 910 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (en banc)).\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f          Scienter is a \"mental state embracing intent to deceive,\n\nmanipulate, or defraud.\"     Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S.\n\n185, 193 n.12 (1976); ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 58.          This circuit has\n\nheld that a plaintiff can demonstrate scienter by showing that\n\ndefendants either \"consciously intended to defraud, or that they\n\nacted with a high degree of recklessness.\"        Aldridge v. A.T. Cross\n\nCorp., 284 F.3d 72, 82 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Securities fraud allegations also must meet the standards\n\nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)5 and the PSLRA, which\n\nimposes heightened pleading requirements on private securities\n\nlitigation. The PSLRA requires that when alleging that a defendant\n\nmade a material misrepresentation or omission, a complaint must\n\n\"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading [and] the\n\nreason or reasons why the statement is misleading.\"          15 U.S.C. §\n\n78u-4(b)(1).   If   the   allegation   is   \"made   on   information   and\n\nbelief,\" then the complaint must \"state with particularity all\n\nfacts on which that belief is formed.\"      Id.\n\n          With respect to scienter, the complaint must, \"with\n\nrespect to each act or omission . . ., state with particularity\n\nfacts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted\n\n\n\n     5\n          Rule 9(b) requires that in alleging fraud or mistake, \"a\nparty must state with particularity the circumstances constituting\nfraud or mistake.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).    In securities fraud\ncases, this requirement is comparable to and effectively subsumed\nby the requirements of the PSLRA. See ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 58\nn.7.\n\n                                -20-\n\fwith the required state of mind.\"             Id. § 78u-4(b)(2) (emphasis\n\nadded).      This requirement that plaintiffs plead facts giving rise\n\nto a strong inference of scienter differs from the general rule\n\napplied to other cases that a reasonable inference is sufficient to\n\nsurvive   a    Rule   12(b)(6)    motion;    in    the    PSLRA    \"Congress   has\n\neffectively mandated a special standard for measuring whether\n\nallegations of scienter survive a motion to dismiss.\" Greebel, 194\n\nF.3d at 195.\n\n              The Supreme Court's recent decision in Tellabs clarified\n\nthat scienter should be evaluated with respect to \"the complaint in\n\nits entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine\n\nwhen ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular,\n\ndocuments incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters\n\nof which a court may take judicial notice.\"              Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at\n\n2509; see also ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 58.                 \"The inquiry . . . is\n\nwhether all of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to\n\na   strong    inference   of     scienter,   not    whether       any   individual\n\nallegation,      scrutinized     in   isolation,     meets    that      standard.\"\n\nTellabs, 127 S.

Tellabs also directed that courts\n\nconsider \"not only inferences urged by the plaintiff . . . but also\n\ncompeting inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged,\" id.\n\nat 2504, and held that a complaint survives when there are equally\n\ncompelling inferences for and against scienter, id. at 2510; see\n\nalso ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 59.\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fB.          Plaintiff's Allegations\n\n            We evaluate plaintiff's allegations in this context.          In\n\nreviewing    a   motion    to   dismiss    under   Rule   12(b)(6),   courts\n\nordinarily will consider only documents attached to the complaint,\n\nbut have made exceptions \"for documents the authenticity of which\n\nare not disputed by the parties; for official public records; for\n\ndocuments   central   to    plaintiffs'     claim;   [and]   for   documents\n\nsufficiently referred to in the complaint.\" Watterson v. Page, 987\n\nF.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).6\n\n            1.    Manufacturing Change\n\n            Plaintiff alleges that defendants failed to disclose\n\ninformation about the manufacturing change prior to July 2, 2004,\n\nand this information was material.         The primary motive alleged for\n\nthe delay is that defendants wanted to build up inventory before\n\nannouncing product recalls.         Under the requirements of section\n\n\n\n     6\n          We do not consider the transcripts of conference calls\nmentioned by both parties in their briefs and attached as an\nappendix to plaintiff's brief. In an order dated October 30, 2007,\nwe rejected plaintiff's motion to expand the record before this\ncourt to include three transcripts that were not before the\ndistrict court. We held that plaintiff had not demonstrated the\n\"extraordinary circumstances\" necessary to invoke this court's\npower to supplement a record under Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 10(e)(2). United States v. Muriel-Cruz, 412 F.3d 9, 12\n(1st Cir. 2005).    We further held that although the complaint\n\"contained some brief quotations from the documents, it did not\nexpressly incorporate the entire documents, including the\nadditional statements that [plaintiff] relies upon in its appellate\nbrief.\"   We also noted that regardless of whether the district\ncourt could have considered the transcripts if they were offered\nbelow, they had not been so offered.\n\n                                    -22-\n\f10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiff must demonstrate both that the\n\ndefendants omitted material information and that they did so with\n\nthe requisite scienter.\n\n           Securities actions raise questions of what corporate\n\nmanagers knew and when they knew it.            These issues are pertinent\n\nboth to materiality and to scienter.            Moreover, something may be\n\nmaterial because of other information or explanations that have\n\nbeen given by defendants.     Thus plaintiff does not need to rely on\n\na theory that there was an independent duty to disclose the\n\nmanufacturing change.        Further, we do not reach the district\n\ncourt's reasoning on the materiality, standing alone, of either\n\nmanufacturing changes or the receipt of FDA major deficiency\n\nletters.\n\n           The   existence   of   a    material    omission   is   usually   a\n\nquestion for the trier of fact.              See ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 65\n\n(citing Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1217 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)).    In this case, we cannot say that as a matter of law the\n\ncomplaint fails to raise a reasonable inference that this was a\n\nmaterial omission.\n\n           The company's own statements draw a connection between\n\nthe manufacturing change and the resolution of the balloon non-\n\ndeflation problems, whether or not the earlier product had a\n\ndefect.    Indeed, Boston Scientific's Form 10-Q for the quarter\n\nending June 30, 2004 included the following statements: \"As a\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fresult of its investigation, the Company has implemented reviews of\n\nits manufacturing process, additional inspections, and an FDA-\n\napproved modification to the manufacturing process for [TAXUS and\n\nExpress² stents].           The Company believes these measures will be\n\neffective in reducing the occurrence of balloon non-deflation.\"\n\n              Because the manufacturing change, in combination with\n\nother changes, would have the effect of reducing balloon non-\n\ndeflation,     a     jury   could   find   that    the    company's   continuing\n\nassertions that reported problems about TAXUS in the United States\n\nresulted from doctor unfamiliarity with the product rather than any\n\ndefect   in    the    product   were   misleading        unless   accompanied    by\n\ndisclosure of the manufacturing change and its connection to the\n\nballoon non-deflation problem.             See Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 36.\n\nAmong other things, the existence of this manufacturing change was\n\npertinent to the issue of potential recalls, and it would raise the\n\nquestion whether, if there were continuing problems or recalls, the\n\ncompany would have on hand sufficient new products incorporating\n\nthe manufacturing change in order to allow the company to replace\n\nthe original TAXUS stents and maintain market share.\n\n              Assuming that a jury could find a material omission, the\n\nnext   requirement      under   section    10(b)    and    Rule   10b-5   is   that\n\ndefendants acted with the requisite scienter in not disclosing the\n\nmanufacturing change sooner, i.e., prior to the first recall\n\nannounced on July 2, 2004. Knowingly omitting material information\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fis probative, although not determinative, of scienter.                       Aldridge,\n\n284   F.3d      at    83    (\"[T]he    fact   that      the   defendants     published\n\nstatements when they knew facts suggesting the statements were\n\ninaccurate       or    misleadingly      incomplete      is   classic   evidence      of\n\nscienter.\"); see also ACA Fin., 512 F.3d at 65.\n\n             Plaintiff alleges that at some point prior to the FDA\n\napproval of TAXUS in March 2004, defendants knew that the problem\n\nwith TAXUS was not doctor unfamiliarity but rather a manufacturing\n\ndefect, and the company had already determined how to fix that\n\ndefect.      Specifically, plaintiff alleges that prior to the U.S.\n\nlaunch of TAXUS, defendants knew of adverse reports from doctors in\n\nEurope about balloon non-deflation, and that they also knew that\n\nthe Express² metal stent, which used the same delivery system as\n\nTAXUS,    had    a    \"history    of    significant      problems.\"        CAC   ¶   93.\n\nPlaintiff also alleges that defendants received numerous adverse\n\nreports in the spring of 2004 from U.S. doctors, which they\n\n\"minimized       and       misrepresented,\"       and    attributed     to    doctors'\n\nunfamiliarity with the new product.               Id.    Yet defendants proceeded\n\nwith the U.S. launch of TAXUS and did not disclose this information\n\nuntil July 2, 2004.\n\n             Plaintiff         alleges     that      defendants     withheld         this\n\ninformation to allow the company to build up its inventory of new,\n\nnon-defective products which had been made with the manufacturing\n\n\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\fchange    in    place,    in    order     to   avoid      loss    of   market   share.7\n\nPlaintiff also alleges that several of the defendants engaged in\n\ninsider trading during this lag period, benefitting from the delay.\n\n               Inferences      supporting      plaintiff's        allegations     about\n\ndefendants' knowledge can be drawn from statements in Boston\n\nScientific's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004, filed\n\non August 9, 2004. The Form 10-Q discusses the company's voluntary\n\nrecall of the TAXUS Express² stent \"due to characteristics in the\n\ndelivery catheters that have the potential to impede balloon\n\ndeflation      during    a     coronary    angioplasty       procedure.         Further\n\nanalysis and investigation of the TAXUS Express² (paclitaxel-\n\neluting) and Express² (bare metal) stent systems, both of which\n\nshare the same delivery catheter, revealed that certain additional\n\nproduction      lots    exhibited    these       same    characteristics.\"         This\n\nstatement      acknowledges      a   connection         between   the   balloon    non-\n\ndeflation problem and the characteristics of the delivery catheter.\n\nThe   statement        also    acknowledges       that     the    company   had   been\n\nconducting ongoing analysis and investigation of the problem and as\n\na result voluntarily expanded its recall on July 16. The statement\n\ngoes on to say that the company would continue to work with the FDA\n\nto monitor the non-deflation problem.\n\n\n\n      7\n          Companies, of course, have other reasons not to have made\nan announcement from which some might have inferred there may have\nbeen a product defect causing injury and death, which could have\nbeen avoided by using different manufacturing techniques.\n\n                                          -26-\n\f           Tellingly, the statement also says that \"[a]s a result of\n\nits investigation, the Company has implemented . . . an FDA-\n\napproved modification to the manufacturing process.\"              (Emphasis\n\nadded.)   To the extent the company may be arguing that there was no\n\nconnection between the manufacturing change and any characteristics\n\nof the catheter, defendants' own statements can be read to say that\n\nthey implemented the manufacturing change in response to adverse\n\nreports, not independent of them.\n\n           Defendants made a similar statement in the press release\n\nannouncing the July 16 expanded recall.            After noting that the\n\ncompany had conducted \"further analysis and investigation\" that\n\ndemonstrated the need for an expanded recall, the press release\n\nstates:   \"The   Company   implemented    review   of   its   manufacturing\n\nprocess, additional inspections, and an FDA-approved modification\n\nto the manufacturing process for these products.          The current and\n\nfuture production are not expected to experience similar balloon\n\ndeflation problems.\"\n\n           Defendants make a different argument, addressed below,\n\nthat even if the manufacturing change did solve the problem by\n\npreventing balloon non-deflation, that does not mean they knew the\n\nconnection or were obliged to disclose it earlier.\n\n           Plaintiff   gave    a   reason    why    defendants     withheld\n\ninformation: so that they could build up an inventory of \"new\"\n\nTAXUS stents prior to announcing the recalls, thereby minimizing\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fsupply disruptions and maximizing profit.              In support of this\n\ntheory is the fact that defendants asserted in their Form 10-Q for\n\nthe quarter ending June 30, 2004 that they had been able to use\n\ntheir \"existing supply of coronary stents not subject to the recall\n\nto replenish the U.S. market,\" although they also noted that they\n\nwere unable to replenish the European market with existing stock\n\nand were hoping to do so during the third quarter of 2004.\n\nSimilarly, in the press release announcing the July 16 recall,\n\ndefendant James Tobin stated that, \"We're fortunate that current\n\nTAXUS inventory levels will minimize service disruption in the\n\nUnited States, but we do expect some disruption internationally.\"\n\n           Plaintiff's proposed inferences are that defendants knew\n\nabout the connection between adverse reports and the manufacturing\n\nchange well before July 2, and withheld that information in order\n\nto build up inventory prior to announcing recalls. Under the PSLRA\n\nthese   inferences   must   be   strong   and   must   be   weighed   against\n\ncompeting ones.   Defendants' inferences are that the manufacturing\n\nchange was implemented for \"innocuous\" reasons not owing to any\n\ndefect in the product, and that they did not know of a connection\n\nbetween the manufacturing change and the adverse reports they were\n\nreceiving from U.S. doctors until the time of the first recall.\n\nDefendants' inferences are supported by the fact that balloon non-\n\ndeflation complaints that defendants received from doctors in\n\nEurope in 2003 faded over time, indicating that such complaints\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fwere   in    fact       tied   to    doctor   unfamiliarity.       Additionally,\n\ndefendants' press releases and Form 10-Q for the quarter ending\n\nJune 30, 2004 stated that it was not the manufacturing change alone\n\nbut rather this change in combination with others, including an\n\nimproved inspection process, that would prevent non-deflation in\n\nthe future.         At no point did defendants communicate that the\n\nmanufacturing change alone would fix the non-deflation problem.\n\n             Given these allegations, the district court held that\n\nplaintiff failed to plead facts providing a strong inference that\n\nat   the    time   of    the    manufacturing    change,     defendants    had   the\n\nrequisite scienter.            In re Boston Scientific, 490 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n160.   It reasoned that the manufacturing change was implemented\n\nwith the FDA's knowledge and approval, at a time when the company\n\nhad received only a \"limited number of complaints from Europe which\n\nhad tapered off after the product's release.\"                    Id.      Moreover,\n\ndefendants     asserted        and   plaintiff   did   not    dispute     that   the\n\nmanufacturing change would have been put into place regardless of\n\nwhether the company received complaints from doctors in the United\n\nStates.     Id.    The district court did not address the key question\n\nof inferences about whether defendants knew that the manufacturing\n\nchange was related to non-deflation complaints at some point prior\n\n\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fto the July 2 recall, not just when they first initiated the\n\nchange.8\n\n           The district court did not have the benefit of the\n\nTellabs opinion, which reversed a higher standard for scienter\n\nimposed by the prior law of this circuit.      We apply Tellabs and\n\nthat leads us to a different result.   While there is support for\n\ndefendants' inferences, we think, at this stage, that plaintiff's\n\ninferences are at least equally strong.      First, there is a very\n\nreasonable inference that defendants initiated the manufacturing\n\nchange as a result of non-deflation complaints it had received from\n\nEurope, even if these complaints had tapered off over time.\n\n           Other inferences may be drawn favorable to plaintiff by\n\nproper recognition of the limits of the doctrine of fraud by\n\nhindsight. Fraud by hindsight refers to allegations that assert no\n\nmore than that because something eventually went wrong, defendants\n\nmust have known about the problem earlier.   \"[A] plaintiff may not\n\nsimply contrast a defendant's past optimism with less favorable\n\nactual results, and then 'contend[] that the difference must be\n\n\n\n\n     8\n           Plaintiff and defendants dispute the extent of the\nrecall, with plaintiff arguing that all pre-manufacturing change\nstents were recalled and defendants responding that approximately\n445,000 \"old\" TAXUS stents had already been shipped and implanted\nand therefore were not problematic or recalled.        We need not\nresolve this factual question at this point because the extent of\nthe recall is largely irrelevant to our analysis. There seems not\nto be a dispute that a connection existed between the manufacturing\nchange and the non-deflation problem that necessitated the recall.\n\n                               -30-\n\fattributable to fraud.'\"             Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1223 (quoting DiLeo v.\n\nErnst & Young, 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir. 1990)).\n\n             The doctrine has been applied in a number of different\n\nsituations.        We recognize that the effect of use of the doctrine at\n\nthe Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal stage is to cut off the case as a\n\nmatter of law, without further factual development.                          As some\n\ncommentators        have   stated,    \"[A]t    this    stage,    a   court   must   be\n\ncautious.        The case has not yet developed.            In cutting off the case\n\non the pleadings by citing hindsight, the court is essentially\n\nmaking a prediction that the discovery process will yield only\n\nevidence that requires the benefit of the hindsight bias to seem\n\nadequate [to support the allegations].\"                M. Gulati, J. Rachlinski\n\n& D. Langevoort, Fraud by Hindsight, 98 Nw. L. Rev. 773, 787\n\n(2004). Meanwhile, at the pleadings stage, \"a bad outcome truly is\n\nrelevant to the likelihood of fraud.\"                 Id. at 815.       Indeed, this\n\ncourt has held that \"in determining the adequacy of a complaint\n\n.   .   .   we    cannot    hold   plaintiffs     to    a    standard    that   would\n\neffectively require them, pre-discovery, to plead evidence.\" Shaw,\n\n82 F.3d at 1225.           The law \"proscribes the pleading of 'fraud by\n\nhindsight,' but neither can plaintiffs be expected to plead fraud\n\nwith complete insight.\"            Id. (quoting Denny v. Barber, 576 F.2d\n\n465, 470 (2d Cir. 1978) (Friendly, J.)).\n\n             In Shaw, we held that the doctrine did not apply when\n\nplaintiffs provided \"a series of factual allegations relating to a\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fcombination of developments known to the company . . . that could\n\nhave provided a basis for advance knowledge of the information\"\n\nwhich was eventually disclosed.              Id. at 1224.    We held that these\n\nallegations of developments known to the company, along with\n\n(admittedly weak) evidence of insider trading and the temporal\n\nproximity between the date of the alleged omission and the eventual\n\ndisclosure (less than a month), were sufficient to survive a motion\n\nto dismiss.9         Id. at 1225.\n\n                  Defendants in this case urged, and the district court\n\naccepted, that plaintiff's allegations amounted to nothing more\n\nthan an allegation of fraud by hindsight: that simply because the\n\nmanufacturing change eventually was linked as a remedy for the\n\nballoon non-deflation problem, defendants must have known about the\n\nconnection earlier.           This approach fails to consider the other\n\nallegations that plaintiff made from supporting documents.                       For\n\ninstance, there is no dispute that the manufacturing change related\n\nto the laser welding of the delivery catheter and balloon, and it\n\nmay be inferred this addressed the same problem which resulted in\n\nthe recalls.          It is also clear that defendants had received non-\n\ndeflation reports from doctors in Europe before instituting the\n\nmanufacturing change, as well as numerous non-deflation complaints\n\nfrom       U.S.    doctors   while   the    company   was   in   the   process    of\n\n\n       9\n          Shaw was decided before the PSLRA was enacted, but Rule\n9(b)'s particularity requirement is similar to the requirements of\nthe PSLRA. See supra n.5.\n\n                                           -32-\n\fimplementing the change. Moreover, defendants' own SEC filings and\n\npress releases reveal that they reassured the public that they had\n\nimplemented the manufacturing change in response to complaints of\n\nnon-deflation, so that the \"new\" TAXUS would not suffer from the\n\nsame problems. The company said it had been monitoring, analyzing,\n\nand investigating the problem and appropriate responses.            It is\n\nfair to infer the company has highly effective information systems.\n\nCf. id. at 1224 n.38.         Defendants are in a highly regulated\n\nindustry and the company, it can be inferred, constantly monitors\n\nreports of patient injury and death and looks for prompt solutions\n\nto such problems.\n\n           This is not the classic fraud by hindsight case where a\n\nplaintiff alleges that the fact that something turned out badly\n\nmust mean defendant knew earlier that it would turn out badly.\n\nDenny, 576 F.2d at 470.       Nor is this a case where there is no\n\ncontemporaneous evidence at all that defendants knew earlier what\n\nthey chose not to disclose until later.         DiLeo, 901 F.2d at 626-7.\n\n           2.      LaViolette's Statements\n\n           Plaintiff also disputes the district court's rejection of\n\nthe   LaViolette    allegations   under   the    doctrine   of   fraud   by\n\nhindsight. The allegations are that defendant Paul LaViolette made\n\npublic statements that were \"false and misleading\" and constituted\n\na \"misrepresentation\" (1) when he stated on July 29 -- a week\n\nbefore the third recall was announced on August 5 -- that the\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fproblem with TAXUS had been \"fixed,\" and (2) when he stated on July\n\n26    that   there    was    simply   a   \"lag    time\"   in    the   marketplace's\n\nconversion to the improved version of TAXUS.                   CAC ¶ 101.\n\n             Plaintiff's complaint may be read as alleging a material\n\nomission and as supporting scienter.                LaViolette's remarks were\n\nmisleading not because the problem had not been \"fixed,\" but\n\nbecause LaViolette excluded any mention of the upcoming recall. In\n\nother words, it was misleading for LaViolette to say that the\n\nproblem had been \"fixed\" while failing to mention that a third\n\nrecall, of another 3,000 stents, would be announced a week later.\n\n             As      with     plaintiff's        allegations       regarding    the\n\nmanufacturing change, we cannot say that LaViolette's omission was\n\nimmaterial as a matter of law.            The investors with whom LaViolette\n\nwas speaking in the conference call would very well have wanted to\n\nknow about the existence of an upcoming recall in addition to\n\nhearing LaViolette's assurances that the TAXUS problems were in the\n\npast.\n\n             With respect to scienter, the district court held that\n\nplaintiff was merely alleging fraud by hindsight because plaintiff\n\nwas claiming no more than that LaViolette should have known about\n\nthe   recall      earlier.     According     to    the    district    court,   \"Lead\n\nPlaintiff fails to allege facts that provide a strong inference\n\nthat Defendant LaViolette knew that an additional recall was\n\n\n\n\n                                          -34-\n\fnecessary or that his remarks were false when he made them.\"            In re\n\nBoston Scientific, 490 F. Supp. 2d at 160.           We disagree.\n\n           This fails to account for the very short amount of time\n\nbetween LaViolette's remarks, some of which were made on Thursday,\n\nJuly 29, and the third recall, which was announced the following\n\nThursday, August 5.      Temporal proximity alone is insufficient to\n\nestablish a claim for fraud, see Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1225, but this\n\ncourt has insisted on a \"fact-specific inquiry\" regarding scienter.\n\nGreebel, 194 F.3d at 196.      The extremely short time period here is\n\nstrong evidence.\n\n           Moreover, LaViolette was the company's Chief Operating\n\nOfficer and a point person on TAXUS, and so he would presumably\n\nhave been aware of the status of the company's \"ongoing monitoring\"\n\nof \"old\" TAXUS stents.       CAC ¶¶ 18, 93.      The third recall, like the\n\ntwo before it, was voluntary and initiated by Boston Scientific\n\nrather than the FDA.\n\n           3.     Insider Trading\n\n           Because the district court dismissed on scienter grounds,\n\nit did not consider the insider trading allegations.                   We do\n\nconsider these allegations in the overall mix.\n\n           Insider trading cannot establish scienter on its own, but\n\nit can be used to do so in combination with other evidence.\n\nGreebel, 194 F.3d at 197-98; Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1224.                   Insider\n\ntrading   in    suspicious   amounts   or   at   suspicious   times   may   be\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fprobative of scienter.        Greebel, 194 F.3d at 197; Greenstone v.\n\nCambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1992).                Plaintiff alleges\n\nthat all defendants engaged in insider trading during the narrowed\n\nclass period of December 3, 2003 to August 5, 2004, see CAC ¶¶ 15-\n\n23, and they argue that stock sales of $40.82 million by James R.\n\nTobin,   $54.2    million    by     Lawrence    C.    Best,   $4.2       million    by\n\nFredericus A. Colen, and $3.3 million by Robert G. MacLean within\n\nthe   two   months      following    the    FDA's     approval      of   TAXUS     are\n\nparticularly suspicious, see id. ¶ 96.\n\n            However, we acknowledge that plaintiff's complaint has\n\nallegations going the other way.             Plaintiff alleges that all but\n\none (Tobin) of these defendants engaged in insider trading at\n\nperiods outside of the narrowed class period, including some after\n\nthe   recalls    were    announced    and    the     manufacturing       change    was\n\ndisclosed.      This undermines the inference that the timing of the\n\ntrading was suspicious.           Id. ¶¶ 15-23.        Plaintiff also does not\n\nallege that the particular timing of the trading was suspicious\n\nother than that it occurred during the eight-month period to which\n\nthe appeal is limited: the trading has not been linked, for\n\ninstance,    to      defendants'      non-disclosed         knowledge        of    the\n\nmanufacturing change or problems with TAXUS.\n\n            Defendants     respond    that     many    of   these    stock    sales,\n\nincluding all of Best's and many of Tobin's, were effectuated\n\npursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans that removed control of the\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fsales from the individual defendants. It was defendants' choice to\n\nmove to dismiss the case on the pleadings without presenting\n\nevidence.      As a result, there is no evidence of when the trading\n\nplans went into effect, that such trading plans removed entirely\n\nfrom defendants' discretion the question of when sales would occur,\n\nor that they were unable to amend these trading plans.\n\n              The insider trading claims as alleged are on the weaker\n\nend    of   the   spectrum.    But,   as     in   Shaw,   \"we   think   that   the\n\nplaintiffs' allegations of insider trading, inasmuch as they are at\n\nleast consistent with their theory of fraud, provide some support\n\nagainst the defendants' motion to dismiss.\"               82 F.3d at 1224; see\n\nalso Greebel, 194 F.3d at 197-98 (\"The vitality of the inference to\n\nbe drawn depends on the facts, and can range from marginal to\n\nstrong.\"      (citations omitted)).\n\n              Plaintiff has alleged a significant amount of insider\n\ntrading in the months before the announcement of recalls in July,\n\nwhich caused the stock price to drop.                CAC ¶¶ 100, 102.          The\n\ncompany's stock price was at an all-time high in the months before\n\nthe recalls were announced, often closing above $40. Id. ¶¶ 15-23,\n\n96, 100.      It fits with plaintiff's theory that defendants would\n\nhave sold stock at this time, knowing that the price would drop\n\nwhen    the    manufacturing   change,       acknowledging      a   defect,    was\n\nannounced.        If defendants were unaware of the connection between\n\nthe non-deflation reports they were receiving and the manufacturing\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fchange, a fact finder could reasonably ask why they would have sold\n\nso much stock at a time when the company appeared to be soaring on\n\nthe strength of TAXUS.\n\n            Given   plaintiff's    specific    factual   allegations,    the\n\ntemporal proximity between LaViolette's statements and the third\n\nrecall, and the alleged insider trading, we think that plaintiff\n\nhas pled enough to give rise to inferences that are at least as\n\nstrong as any competing inferences regarding scienter.\n\nC.          Group Pleading\n\n            Defendants     argue   that   plaintiff      has   engaged    in\n\nimpermissible group pleading and that several of the defendants\n\nshould be dismissed from the case now that the subject area has\n\nbeen narrowed on appeal because they are not specifically alleged\n\nto have been involved with TAXUS.10           The district court did not\n\naddress the issue.       We decline to address the issue in the first\n\ninstance.\n\n            We take into account, as in Cabletron, the fact that the\n\noverall complaint survives, the pre-discovery posture of the case,\n\nand the fact that all of the individual defendants held positions\n\n\n     10\n          Under the group pleading presumption, a court may\nattribute all statements to the defendants as collective actions\nwithout considering the liability of each individual defendant.\nThis court has recognized \"a very limited version of the group\npleading doctrine for securities fraud.\" Cabletron, 311 F.3d at\n40. There has been \"great debate about the doctrine's continued\nexistence after enactment of the PSLRA,\" a question on which this\ncircuit has not taken a position. Id. We need not here resolve\nwhether group pleading survives the PSLRA.\n\n                                   -38-\n\fof significant responsibility within the company and therefore\n\npotentially face control person liability under section 20(a).\n\nCabletron, 311 F.3d at 41.         We think the questions should be\n\nresolved in the first instance by the district court.\n\nD.          Section 20(a) Liability\n\n            Plaintiff has also made allegations against defendants\n\nunder section 20(a), which establishes liability for any person who\n\n\"directly   or    indirectly[]   controls   any   person      liable\"   for   a\n\nviolation of securities laws.       15 U.S.C. § 78t(a).         The district\n\ncourt summarily dismissed the section 20(a) claims on account of\n\nits dismissal of the section 10(b) claims.               Reinstatement of\n\nsection 20(a) claims is generally appropriate when section 10(b)\n\nclaims have been reinstated and the section 20(a) claims had been\n\ndismissed by the district court because of its dismissal of the\n\nsection   10(b)   claims.

The appeal concerns dismissal of claims based on the company's launch of a new product, the drug-eluting TAXUS coronary stent, and its eventual recalls. Plaintiff, a Mississippi pension fund and purchaser of Boston Scientific stock, alleges that company executives both withheld material information about problems with the stent and decisions addressing those problems, and made misleading positive statements, in violation of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a), and the attendant rules and regulations, including Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff appeals the district court's grant of defendants' motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court held, in a thoughtful decision, that plaintiff failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements imposed by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737. <i>In re Boston Scientific Corp. Sec.

Nicholas (Chairman of the Board of Directors); James R. Tobin (President and Director); Paul A. LaViolette (Chief Operating Officer and member of the Executive Committee<sup>[1]</sup>); Fredericus A. Colen (Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer); Lawrence C. Best (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer); Stephen F. Moreci (Senior Vice President and Group President of Endosurgery); Robert G. MacLean (Vice President of Human Resources); Paul W. Sandman (Senior Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel); and James H. Taylor, Jr. (Senior Vice President of Corporate Operations). Consolidated Am. Compl. (\"CAC\") ¶¶ 1, 15-23.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff sued on behalf of a putative class of individuals and entities who purchased equity securities in Boston Scientific from March 31, 2003 to August 23, 2005. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 1. Plaintiff alleged that during that period, defendants made false and misleading statements and caused the market price of the company's securities to be artificially inflated, both harming investors and allowing the individual insider defendants to enrich themselves in excess of $332 million. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiff's original complaint divided into four categories its allegations regarding defendants' statements about a civil lawsuit with Medinol Ltd., a Department of Justice investigation into a 1998 product recall, the company's introduction of TAXUS stents to the market, and FDA investigations and warnings regarding Boston Scientific's plants. Only the TAXUS stent issue is before us on appeal following the dismissal of all claims.</p>\n<p>In particular, plaintiff advances these theories. By late 2003 defendants became aware of serious problems in patients in Europe resulting from the insertion of the new TAXUS stent, not yet introduced in the United States. The TAXUS stent was introduced in the United States in March 2004; American doctors reported similar problems. In the spring of 2004 defendants made affirmative statements attributing the problems reported about the new TAXUS stent to the unfamiliarity of doctors with the new stent. They did not correct the statements even though they had become aware that the problem was not doctor unfamiliarity, but rather a manufacturing defect in the stent that caused the balloon to fail to deflate. Defendants continued to withhold information about a manufacturing change Boston Scientific had instituted in December 2003 which would address the defect. They withheld the information to build up inventory, in order to preserve market share, before announcing recalls of TAXUS stents based <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> on the potential defects. Meanwhile, while withholding this material information, several of the individual defendants traded on the open market in unusual patterns and unusual amounts. When the material information was finally and belatedly disclosed, the market price for Boston Scientific stock plummeted downward. The stock price dropped 7.6% after the company announced an expanded recall and revealed that three deaths and several dozen serious injuries had been connected to balloon deflation failure, and it dropped another 6.6% when the company expanded the recall of the TAXUS stent for a second time. CAC ¶¶ 100, 102.</p>\n<p>The defendants' theory is that at the time the company received some thirty to forty reports of problems in Europe of balloon non-deflation following stent insertion, it was unable to identify anything about the device itself that would cause the problem and attributed the problem to doctor unfamiliarity. Defendants' brief argues that independently and</p>\n<blockquote>[i]n an effort to improve the device, Boston Scientific tried completely to eliminate the possibility of balloon non-deflation. It eventually identified a means to do so, by changing the manner of bonding the delivery catheter to the balloon and by implementing an additional inspection test at the end of the manufacturing process. These proposed modifications were submitted to the FDA for approval in April 2004 and approved by the FDA the following month. In June 2004 Boston Scientific began manufacturing the \"new\" device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>After</i> it identified how to completely eliminate what was already an infrequently occurring issue, Boston Scientific was able to re-analyze its \"old\" Taxus inventory. That process led to the identification of specific lots that had the <i>potential</i> for non-deflation. Out of an abundance of caution, Boston Scientific voluntarily recalled a limited number of specific production lots of its \"old\" Taxus stents in July and August 2004.</blockquote>\n<p>It is the company's position that the changes would have been implemented \"whether it got a complaint or not.\" The removal of the possibility that the balloon would fail to deflate by the manufacturing change did not prove there was a defect, much less that the company knew at an earlier date of a connection between the manufacturing change and the problem that necessitated the recalls, or that it was obliged to disclose it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Plaintiff's Allegations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff brought the suit as a putative class action. The class period plaintiff claims is relevant to this narrowed appeal is December 2, 2003 to August 5, 2004.</p>\n<p>In 2001, Boston Scientific decided to produce a drug-eluting stent<sup>[2]</sup> to compete with a similar product manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson. CAC ¶ 86. Boston Scientific's product is known as TAXUS® Express Paclitaxel-Eluting Monorail® Coronary Stent System. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> TAXUS debuted in Europe in January 2003. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 87, 92. Plaintiff alleges that defendants felt \"tremendous pressure\" to introduce TAXUS into the U.S. market because the company was losing market share to Johnson &amp; Johnson. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 87. While in the process of obtaining final FDA approval for TAXUS, defendants allegedly downplayed news that could delay the U.S. launch, such as failing to disclose in a timely manner an FDA major deficiency letter that the company received in September 2003. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 89. Meanwhile, defendants \"provided to the investment community a drum roll leading up to the FDA's approval of TAXUS which was deafening.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 90. Plaintiff alleges that in anticipation of FDA approval and in response to positive comments made by defendants, analysts upgraded their rating of Boston Scientific stock, and by March 2004, the price of Boston Scientific stock on the New York Stock Exchange hit a new high, trading at over $40 a share. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 15-23, 91, 100.</p>\n<p>On March 4, 2004, the FDA approved TAXUS for marketing and distribution in the United States. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 92. Plaintiff alleges that Boston Scientific \"trumpeted [TAXUS's] immediate impact in the Company's effort to take over market share for stents.\" <i>Id.</i> Meanwhile, defendants did not disclose complaints they had received from doctors in Europe that the balloon used during insertion of the TAXUS stent did not deflate. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 93. Defendants also knew that the Express2 metal stent, upon which the new TAXUS stent was based, \"had a history of significant problems.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Despite this knowledge, defendants \"minimized and misrepresented . . . problems,\" including in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2004, which Boston Scientific filed with the SEC on May 7, 2004. This report stated that the company was \"reviewing a limited number of reports related to balloon withdrawal difficulty during TAXUS angioplasty procedures.\" <i>Id.</i> In meetings with analysts, defendants \"further downplayed the complaints\" by attributing the problems to doctor unfamiliarity with TAXUS rather than balloon non-deflation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, plaintiff alleges, defendants knew \"the problems with TAXUS were much more significant, based on the complaints they had received out of Europe and the complaints which were rolling in as a result of the product rollout in the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 95. In December 2003 defendants allegedly had begun planning a manufacturing change for TAXUS because they had become aware that the problem with TAXUS was not doctor unfamiliarity but rather a \"manufacturing defect.\" This manufacturing change, which according to defendants was approved by the FDA in May 2004, related to the manner of the laser bonding of the delivery catheter and balloon. Defendants did not disclose this manufacturing change to the public prior to July 2, 2004, when they referred to it in a conference call with analysts. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 95, 98. Defendants also discussed the manufacturing change in the press releases announcing subsequent recalls on July 16 and August 5.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that defendants had an obligation to disclose this manufacturing change to the public at some point prior to July 2 because it was necessary to correct defendants' earlier and continuing statements that the adverse reports related to U.S. doctors' unfamiliarity with TAXUS rather than to a defect with the product itself. As plaintiff put it at oral argument: \"The disclosure that we are asking for is that as soon as they learned that . . . the problems with TAXUS were not related to doctor [un]familiarity . . . they had a duty to disclose that.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> In the months following the U.S. launch of TAXUS, Boston Scientific's stock price rose and defendants began to sell large quantities of their own stock. CAC ¶ 96. Plaintiff specifically points to the following stock sales, all of which occurred within two months of the FDA's March approval of TAXUS: over $40 million by James R. Tobin; over $54 million by Lawrence C. Best; over $4 million by Fredericus A. Colen; and over $3 million by Robert G. MacLean. <i>Id.</i> Additionally, defendant Paul LaViolette sold approximately $3 million worth of company stock in June of 2004. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 18. Plaintiff argues that these sales demonstrated \"unusual patterns\" and occurred in \"unusual amounts.\"</p>\n<p>On July 2, 2004, Boston Scientific announced that it was voluntarily recalling two lots of TAXUS stents (a total of 200 stents), which had not yet been implanted in patients. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 97. In a press release announcing the recall, the company stated that the FDA had received reports of one death and sixteen serious injuries associated with balloon non-deflation, along with eight reports of balloon malfunction that had not caused injury. <i>Id.</i> The press release explained that the recall was due to \"characteristics . . . related to a narrowing in the area where the catheter and balloon are laser welded,\" a problem referred to as \"focal neckdown.\" \"This narrowing resulted in the potential for impeded deflation and removal of the balloon after stent placement.\"</p>\n<p>The manufacturing change that defendants had put into motion in December 2003 addressed the problem of focal neckdown by changing the manner of the laser welding of the catheter and balloon. In a conference call with analysts on July 2, defendants asserted that this manufacturing change had been in progress before the TAXUS launch and \"would have been submitted whether we got a complaint or not.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 98.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, on July 16, defendants voluntarily expanded the company's recall to 85,000 TAXUS stents and 11,000 Express2 stents  which use the same delivery catheter as TAXUS  and admitted knowing of two additional serious injuries associated with TAXUS as well as two deaths and twenty-five serious injuries associated with balloon deflation failure in Express2 stents. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 100. In a press release announcing this recall, defendants assured the public: \"The Company implemented review of its manufacturing process, additional inspections, and an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process for these products. The current and future production are not expected to experience similar balloon deflation problems.\"</p>\n<p>After defendants announced this expanded recall on July 16, Boston Scientific's stock price dropped $3.09 per share, or 7.6%, to $37.40. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 100. Plaintiff connects the drop in stock price to the revelations of the deaths and injuries associated with the TAXUS and Express2 stents. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that during July and early August 2004, defendants \"continued to try to reassure the market about the safety of the Company's products through the issuance of public statements which were false and misleading.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 101. In particular, during a conference call with analysts on July 26, 2004, defendant Paul LaViolette responded to concerns about TAXUS by saying, \"[Y]ou are dealing with simple lag time in the marketplace conversion of newer products, not necessarily a continuation of complaints from the new issue product.\" <i>Id.</i> At a meeting with a local hospital official on July 29, LaViolette stated that the company had \"identified and fixed the problem.\" <i>Id.</i> On August 4, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> he stated that the problem was a \"nuisance.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On August 5, Boston Scientific announced that it was voluntarily recalling an additional 3,000 TAXUS stents.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.</i> ¶ 102. The press release announcing the recall stated that it was prompted by the company's \"ongoing monitoring\" and noted that since the company had \"modified its manufacturing process, implemented new tracking software and introduced new inspection protocols,\" it had not had any confirmed non-deflation problems caused by focal neckdown in the units made with these changes in place. At this time, the company's stock price dropped another $2.41, or 6.6%. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>By the end of 2004, Boston Scientific had recalled 99,000 TAXUS and Express2 stents because of manufacturing defects that plaintiff alleges had caused three deaths and dozens of serious injuries. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 103. The company spent over $57 million on these recalls. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 101. Between July 2, 2004, when the first recall was announced, and August 5, 2004, when the recall was expanded for a second time, the company's stock price dropped 21%. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 103.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's theory is that the investing world was aware of reports of patient death and injury involving TAXUS. However, defendants said that the problems with the TAXUS stents were caused by doctor unfamiliarity with the new product. It was natural for investors to conclude the problems would disappear over time as doctors became more familiar with the product, and there would be no recalls. Having given that explanation, the defendants, plaintiff argues, were required to disclose as soon as they could the connection between the patient problems, the manufacturing defect, and the manufacturing change remedying this problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>District Court Opinion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In dismissing the TAXUS claims, the district court reasoned in a series of discrete steps.<sup>[4]</sup> It first noted that there was no violation in not disclosing the FDA major deficiency letter regarding TAXUS that Boston Scientific had received in September 2003, before the U.S. release of the product. Rather, the major deficiency letter was simply \"a step in the FDA approval process which [Boston Scientific] had no duty to disclose.\" <i>In re Boston Scientific,</i> 490 F.Supp.2d at 158; <i>see also id.</i> at 158 n. 91 (citing 21 C.F.R. § 814.37(b) (\"A major deficiency letter informs the applicant that its PMA [Premarket Approval Application] lacks significant information needed for FDA to complete the scientific review of, and render a final decision on, the PMA.\")).</p>\n<p>The court next turned to the adverse reports from doctors that defendants received prior to announcement of the recalls of the TAXUS and Express2 stents in July and August of 2004. The court examined the company's statements that complaints received from American doctors in the spring of 2004 were comparable to complaints it had received the previous year from European doctors. Plaintiff asserted that these statements were false when made because the company knew that the problems in both Europe and the United States resulted from a product flaw rather than from the stated reason of doctor unfamiliarity with TAXUS. However, the district court concluded, plaintiff provided <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> \"little in the way of facts to support this claim. Lead Plaintiff pleads no facts to suggest that the complaints [Boston Scientific] received from American doctors were different than those it received from European doctors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 159.</p>\n<p>With respect to the manufacturing change which Boston Scientific initiated prior to the U.S. launch of TAXUS, the court rejected plaintiff's allegations that this change was evidence that defendants knew TAXUS was defective and that the change was material information that should have been disclosed. <i>Id.</i> Here the district court invoked the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. The court reasoned that a manufacturing change does not necessarily mean that a product is defective or that a company knows that a product is defective since \"[c]ompanies frequently adjust and change their products, and no rule requires a company to inform the public every time it modifies its manufacturing process.\" <i>Id.</i> The court pointed out that Boston Scientific's manufacturing change was conducted with the FDA's knowledge, at a time when the company had received only a limited number of complaints from European doctors, which had been tapering off. <i>Id.</i> at 160. Plaintiff did not contest that the manufacturing change was set in motion before TAXUS's release in the United States and would have been made regardless of whether the company received complaints from U.S. doctors. <i>Id.</i> The district court further noted that \"[t]he recalls were limited, and only applied to a fraction of the TAXUS stents released on the domestic market.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the court concluded, while \"[i]n hindsight. . . it appears that this manufacturing change may indeed have been material,\" <i>id.</i> at 159, plaintiff failed \"to allege facts that provide a strong inference that at the time of the manufacturing change, Defendants knew that TAXUS was defective or that the product would later be recalled,\" <i>id.</i> at 160.</p>\n<p>With respect to defendant Paul LaViolette's July 29, 2004 remarks that Boston Scientific had identified and fixed the problem with TAXUS, the district court also invoked the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. A week after LaViolette's statements, the company initiated an additional recall of 3,000 TAXUS stents. However, the district court reasoned, there is no liability where \"a plaintiff's claim rests on the assumption that the defendants `must have known of the severity of their problems earlier because conditions became so bad later on.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>In re Boston Tech., Inc. Sec. Litig.,</i> 8 F.Supp.2d 43, 53 (D.Mass.1998)). Here, the court concluded that plaintiff failed to allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that LaViolette knew at the time of his remarks that they were false or that an additional recall would be necessary. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal, plaintiff argues that the district court erred in several respects. It argues that the court misapplied the doctrine of fraud by hindsight, resulting in the imposition of too stringent a pleading standard. More specifically, it claims that the court erroneously drew factual inferences against plaintiff regarding the manufacturing change and failed to account for the materiality of the change. Plaintiff further argues that the court misapplied the fraud by hindsight doctrine to LaViolette's remarks by discounting the temporal proximity between his statements and the third TAXUS recall, and it challenges the district court's factual assumption that the recall was limited in scope. Finally, plaintiff faults the district court for failing to consider the allegations of insider trading presented in the complaint. Overall, plaintiff argues the district court atomized the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> complaint and did not look at the overall pattern.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Pleading Requirements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We evaluate de novo whether a complaint meets the requirements of the PSLRA. <i>ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58. As with any Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, we accept well-pled factual allegations in the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor. <i>Id.</i> The standard most recently articulated by the Supreme Court is that a complaint must allege \"a plausible entitlement to relief\" in order to withstand a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1967-69, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <i>ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58.</p>\n<p>A claim for securities fraud under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 must contain six elements: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. <i>ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58 (citing <i>Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo,</i> 544 U.S. 336, 341-42, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005)). Only the first two elements are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>Information is material if a reasonable investor would have viewed it as \"having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.\" <i>Gross,</i> 93 F.3d at 992 (quoting <i>Basic Inc. v. Levinson,</i> 485 U.S. 224, 232, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The PSLRA provides that a misleading statement or omission is alleged when plaintiff claims that defendant made \"an untrue statement of a material fact,\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)(A), or \"omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading,\" <i>id.</i> § 78u-4(b)(1)(B). \"While a company need not reveal every piece of information that affects anything said before, it must disclose facts, `if any, that are needed so that what was revealed [before] would not be so incomplete as to mislead.'\" <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 36 (quoting <i>Backman v. Polaroid Corp.,</i> 910 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1990) (en banc)).</p>\n<p>Scienter is a \"mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 193 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); <i>ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58. This circuit has held that a plaintiff can demonstrate scienter by showing that defendants either \"consciously intended to defraud, or that they acted with a high degree of recklessness.\" <i>Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> 284 F.3d 72, 82 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Securities fraud allegations also must meet the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)<sup>[5]</sup> and the PSLRA, which imposes heightened pleading requirements on private securities litigation. The PSLRA requires that when alleging that a defendant made a material misrepresentation or omission, a complaint must \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1). If the allegation is \"made on information and belief,\" then the complaint must \"state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> With respect to scienter, the complaint must, \"with respect to each act or omission. . ., state with particularity facts giving rise to a <i>strong inference</i> that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" <i>Id.</i> § 78u-4(b)(2) (emphasis added). This requirement that plaintiffs plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter differs from the general rule applied to other cases that a reasonable inference is sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion; in the PSLRA \"Congress has effectively mandated a special standard for measuring whether allegations of scienter survive a motion to dismiss.\" <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 195.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Tellabs</i> clarified that scienter should be evaluated with respect to \"the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.\" <i>Tellabs,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2509; <i>see also ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58. \"The inquiry . . . is whether <i>all</i> of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.\" <i>Tellabs,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2509. <i>Tellabs</i> also directed that courts consider \"not only inferences urged by the plaintiff. . . but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged,\" <i>id.</i> at 2504, and held that a complaint survives when there are equally compelling inferences for and against scienter, <i>id.</i> at 2510; <i>see also ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 59.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Plaintiff's Allegations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We evaluate plaintiff's allegations in this context. In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), courts ordinarily will consider only documents attached to the complaint, but have made exceptions \"for documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; for official public records; for documents central to plaintiffs' claim; [and] for documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint.\" <i>Watterson v. Page,</i> 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Manufacturing Change</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that defendants failed to disclose information about the manufacturing change prior to July 2, 2004, and this information was material. The primary motive alleged for the delay is that defendants wanted to build up inventory before announcing product recalls. Under the requirements of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiff must demonstrate both that the defendants omitted material information and that they did so with the requisite scienter.</p>\n<p>Securities actions raise questions of what corporate managers knew and when they knew it. These issues are pertinent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> both to materiality and to scienter. Moreover, something may be material because of other information or explanations that have been given by defendants. Thus plaintiff does not need to rely on a theory that there was an independent duty to disclose the manufacturing change. Further, we do not reach the district court's reasoning on the materiality, standing alone, of either manufacturing changes or the receipt of FDA major deficiency letters.</p>\n<p>The existence of a material omission is usually a question for the trier of fact. <i>See ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 65 (citing <i>Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 82 F.3d 1194, 1217 (1st Cir.1996)). In this case, we cannot say that as a matter of law the complaint fails to raise a reasonable inference that this was a material omission.</p>\n<p>The company's own statements draw a connection between the manufacturing change and the resolution of the balloon non-deflation problems, whether or not the earlier product had a defect. Indeed, Boston Scientific's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004 included the following statements: \"As a result of its investigation, the Company has implemented reviews of its manufacturing process, additional inspections, and an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process for [TAXUS and Express2 stents]. The Company believes these measures will be effective in reducing the occurrence of balloon non-deflation.\"</p>\n<p>Because the manufacturing change, in combination with other changes, would have the effect of reducing balloon non-deflation, a jury could find that the company's continuing assertions that reported problems about TAXUS in the United States resulted from doctor unfamiliarity with the product rather than any defect in the product were misleading unless accompanied by disclosure of the manufacturing change and its connection to the balloon non-deflation problem. <i>See </i><i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 36. Among other things, the existence of this manufacturing change was pertinent to the issue of potential recalls, and it would raise the question whether, if there were continuing problems or recalls, the company would have on hand sufficient new products incorporating the manufacturing change in order to allow the company to replace the original TAXUS stents and maintain market share.</p>\n<p>Assuming that a jury could find a material omission, the next requirement under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is that defendants acted with the requisite scienter in not disclosing the manufacturing change sooner, i.e., prior to the first recall announced on July 2, 2004. Knowingly omitting material information is probative, although not determinative, of scienter. <i>Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 83 (\"[T]he fact that the defendants published statements when they knew facts suggesting the statements were inaccurate or misleadingly incomplete is classic evidence of scienter.\"); <i>see also ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 65.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that at some point prior to the FDA approval of TAXUS in March 2004, defendants knew that the problem with TAXUS was not doctor unfamiliarity but rather a manufacturing defect, and the company had already determined how to fix that defect. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that prior to the U.S. launch of TAXUS, defendants knew of adverse reports from doctors in Europe about balloon non-deflation, and that they also knew that the Express2 metal stent, which used the same delivery system as TAXUS, had a \"history of significant problems.\" CAC ¶ 93. Plaintiff also alleges that defendants received numerous adverse reports in the spring of 2004 from U.S. doctors, which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> they \"minimized and misrepresented,\" and attributed to doctors' unfamiliarity with the new product. <i>Id.</i> Yet defendants proceeded with the U.S. launch of TAXUS and did not disclose this information until July 2, 2004.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that defendants withheld this information to allow the company to build up its inventory of new, non-defective products which had been made with the manufacturing change in place, in order to avoid loss of market share.<sup>[7]</sup> Plaintiff also alleges that several of the defendants engaged in insider trading during this lag period, benefitting from the delay.</p>\n<p>Inferences supporting plaintiff's allegations about defendants' knowledge can be drawn from statements in Boston Scientific's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004, filed on August 9, 2004. The Form 10-Q discusses the company's voluntary recall of the TAXUS Express2 stent \"due to characteristics in the delivery catheters that have the potential to impede balloon deflation during a coronary angioplasty procedure. Further analysis and investigation of the TAXUS Express2 (paclitaxel-eluting) and Express2 (bare metal) stent systems, both of which share the same delivery catheter, revealed that certain additional production lots exhibited these same characteristics.\" This statement acknowledges a connection between the balloon non-deflation problem and the characteristics of the delivery catheter. The statement also acknowledges that the company had been conducting ongoing analysis and investigation of the problem and as a result voluntarily expanded its recall on July 16. The statement goes on to say that the company would continue to work with the FDA to monitor the non-deflation problem.</p>\n<p>Tellingly, the statement also says that \"<i>[a]s a result of its investigation,</i> the Company has implemented . . . an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process.\" (Emphasis added.) To the extent the company may be arguing that there was no connection between the manufacturing change and any characteristics of the catheter, defendants' own statements can be read to say that they implemented the manufacturing change <i>in response to</i> adverse reports, not independent of them.</p>\n<p>Defendants made a similar statement in the press release announcing the July 16 expanded recall. After noting that the company had conducted \"further analysis and investigation\" that demonstrated the need for an expanded recall, the press release states: \"The Company implemented review of its manufacturing process, additional inspections, and an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process for these products. The current and future production are not expected to experience similar balloon deflation problems.\"</p>\n<p>Defendants make a different argument, addressed below, that even if the manufacturing change did solve the problem by preventing balloon non-deflation, that does not mean they knew the connection or were obliged to disclose it earlier.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff gave a reason why defendants withheld information: so that they could build up an inventory of \"new\" TAXUS stents prior to announcing the recalls, thereby minimizing supply disruptions and maximizing profit. In support of this theory is the fact that defendants asserted in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> their Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004 that they had been able to use their \"existing supply of coronary stents not subject to the recall to replenish the U.S. market,\" although they also noted that they were unable to replenish the European market with existing stock and were hoping to do so during the third quarter of 2004. Similarly, in the press release announcing the July 16 recall, defendant James Tobin stated that, \"We're fortunate that current TAXUS inventory levels will minimize service disruption in the United States, but we do expect some disruption internationally.\"</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's proposed inferences are that defendants knew about the connection between adverse reports and the manufacturing change well before July 2, and withheld that information in order to build up inventory prior to announcing recalls. Under the PSLRA these inferences must be strong and must be weighed against competing ones. Defendants' inferences are that the manufacturing change was implemented for \"innocuous\" reasons not owing to any defect in the product, and that they did not know of a connection between the manufacturing change and the adverse reports they were receiving from U.S. doctors until the time of the first recall. Defendants' inferences are supported by the fact that balloon non-deflation complaints that defendants received from doctors in Europe in 2003 faded over time, indicating that such complaints were in fact tied to doctor unfamiliarity. Additionally, defendants' press releases and Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004 stated that it was not the manufacturing change alone but rather this change in combination with others, including an improved inspection process, that would prevent non-deflation in the future. At no point did defendants communicate that the manufacturing change alone would fix the non-deflation problem.</p>\n<p>Given these allegations, the district court held that plaintiff failed to plead facts providing a strong inference that at the time of the manufacturing change, defendants had the requisite scienter. <i>In re Boston Scientific,</i> 490 F.Supp.2d at 160. It reasoned that the manufacturing change was implemented with the FDA's knowledge and approval, at a time when the company had received only a \"limited number of complaints from Europe which had tapered off after the product's release.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, defendants asserted and plaintiff did not dispute that the manufacturing change would have been put into place regardless of whether the company received complaints from doctors in the United States. <i>Id.</i> The district court did not address the key question of inferences about whether defendants knew that the manufacturing change was related to non-deflation complaints at some point prior to the July 2 recall, not just when they first initiated the change.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court did not have the benefit of the <i>Tellabs</i> opinion, which reversed a higher standard for scienter imposed by the prior law of this circuit. We apply <i>Tellabs</i> and that leads us to a different result. While there is support for defendants' inferences, we think, at this stage, that plaintiff's inferences are at least equally strong. First, there is a very reasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> inference that defendants initiated the manufacturing change as a result of non-deflation complaints it had received from Europe, even if these complaints had tapered off over time.</p>\n<p>Other inferences may be drawn favorable to plaintiff by proper recognition of the limits of the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. Fraud by hindsight refers to allegations that assert no more than that because something eventually went wrong, defendants must have known about the problem earlier. \"[A] plaintiff may not simply contrast a defendant's past optimism with less favorable actual results, and then `contend[] that the difference must be attributable to fraud.'\" <i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1223 (quoting <i>DiLeo v. Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p>The doctrine has been applied in a number of different situations. We recognize that the effect of use of the doctrine at the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal stage is to cut off the case as a matter of law, without further factual development. As some commentators have stated, \"[A]t this stage, a court must be cautious. The case has not yet developed. In cutting off the case on the pleadings by citing hindsight, the court is essentially making a prediction that the discovery process will yield only evidence that requires the benefit of the hindsight bias to seem adequate [to support the allegations].\" M. Gulati, J. Rachlinski &amp; D. Langevoort, <i>Fraud by Hindsight,</i> 98 Nw. L.Rev. 773, 787 (2004). Meanwhile, at the pleadings stage, \"a bad outcome truly is relevant to the likelihood of fraud.\" <i>Id.</i> at 815. Indeed, this court has held that \"in determining the adequacy of a complaint. . . we cannot hold plaintiffs to a standard that would effectively require them, pre-discovery, to plead evidence.\" <i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1225. The law \"proscribes the pleading of `fraud by hindsight,' but neither can plaintiffs be expected to plead fraud with complete insight.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Denny v. Barber,</i> 576 F.2d 465, 470 (2d Cir.1978) (Friendly, J.)).</p>\n<p>In <i>Shaw,</i> we held that the doctrine did not apply when plaintiffs provided \"a series of factual allegations relating to a combination of developments known to the company . . . that could have provided a basis for advance knowledge of the information\" which was eventually disclosed. <i>Id.</i> at 1224. We held that these allegations of developments known to the company, along with (admittedly weak) evidence of insider trading and the temporal proximity between the date of the alleged omission and the eventual disclosure (less than a month), were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.<sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 1225.</p>\n<p>Defendants in this case urged, and the district court accepted, that plaintiff's allegations amounted to nothing more than an allegation of fraud by hindsight: that simply because the manufacturing change eventually was linked as a remedy for the balloon non-deflation problem, defendants must have known about the connection earlier. This approach fails to consider the other allegations that plaintiff made from supporting documents. For instance, there is no dispute that the manufacturing change related to the laser welding of the delivery catheter and balloon, and it may be inferred this addressed the same problem which resulted in the recalls. It is also clear that defendants had received non-deflation reports from doctors in Europe before instituting the manufacturing change, as well as numerous non-deflation complaints from U.S. doctors while the company was in the process of implementing the change. Moreover, defendants' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> own SEC filings and press releases reveal that they reassured the public that they had implemented the manufacturing change <i>in response</i> to complaints of non-deflation, so that the \"new\" TAXUS would not suffer from the same problems. The company said it had been monitoring, analyzing, and investigating the problem and appropriate responses. It is fair to infer the company has highly effective information systems. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 1224 n. 38. Defendants are in a highly regulated industry and the company, it can be inferred, constantly monitors reports of patient injury and death and looks for prompt solutions to such problems.</p>\n<p>This is not the classic fraud by hindsight case where a plaintiff alleges that the fact that something turned out badly must mean defendant knew earlier that it would turn out badly. <i>Denny,</i> 576 F.2d at 470. Nor is this a case where there is no contemporaneous evidence at all that defendants knew earlier what they chose not to disclose until later. <i>DiLeo,</i> 901 F.2d at 626-7.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>LaViolette's Statements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff also disputes the district court's rejection of the LaViolette allegations under the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. The allegations are that defendant Paul LaViolette made public statements that were \"false and misleading\" and constituted a \"misrepresentation\" (1) when he stated on July 29  a week before the third recall was announced on August 5  that the problem with TAXUS had been \"fixed,\" and (2) when he stated on July 26 that there was simply a \"lag time\" in the marketplace's conversion to the improved version of TAXUS. CAC ¶ 101.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's complaint may be read as alleging a material omission and as supporting scienter. LaViolette's remarks were misleading not because the problem had not been \"fixed,\" but because LaViolette excluded any mention of the upcoming recall. In other words, it was misleading for LaViolette to say that the problem had been \"fixed\" while failing to mention that a third recall, of another 3,000 stents, would be announced a week later.</p>\n<p>As with plaintiff's allegations regarding the manufacturing change, we cannot say that LaViolette's omission was immaterial as a matter of law. The investors with whom LaViolette was speaking in the conference call would very well have wanted to know about the existence of an upcoming recall in addition to hearing LaViolette's assurances that the TAXUS problems were in the past.</p>\n<p>With respect to scienter, the district court held that plaintiff was merely alleging fraud by hindsight because plaintiff was claiming no more than that LaViolette should have known about the recall earlier. According to the district court, \"Lead Plaintiff fails to allege facts that provide a strong inference that Defendant LaViolette knew that an additional recall was necessary or that his remarks were false when he made them.\" <i>In re Boston Scientific,</i> 490 F.Supp.2d at 160. We disagree.</p>\n<p>This fails to account for the very short amount of time between LaViolette's remarks, some of which were made on Thursday, July 29, and the third recall, which was announced the following Thursday, August 5. Temporal proximity alone is insufficient to establish a claim for fraud, <i>see </i><i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1225, but this court has insisted on a \"fact-specific inquiry\" regarding scienter. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 196. The extremely short time period here is strong evidence.</p>\n<p>Moreover, LaViolette was the company's Chief Operating Officer and a point person on TAXUS, and so he would presumably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> have been aware of the status of the company's \"ongoing monitoring\" of \"old\" TAXUS stents. CAC ¶¶ 18, 93. The third recall, like the two before it, was voluntary and initiated by Boston Scientific rather than the FDA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Insider Trading</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because the district court dismissed on scienter grounds, it did not consider the insider trading allegations. We do consider these allegations in the overall mix.</p>\n<p>Insider trading cannot establish scienter on its own, but it can be used to do so in combination with other evidence. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197-98; <i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1224. Insider trading in suspicious amounts or at suspicious times may be probative of scienter. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197; <i>Greenstone v. Cambex Corp.,</i> 975 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1992). Plaintiff alleges that all defendants engaged in insider trading during the narrowed class period of December 3, 2003 to August 5, 2004, <i>see</i> CAC ¶¶ 15-23, and they argue that stock sales of $40.82 million by James R. Tobin, $54.2 million by Lawrence C. Best, $4.2 million by Fredericus A. Colen, and $3.3 million by Robert G. MacLean within the two months following the FDA's approval of TAXUS are particularly suspicious, <i>see id.</i> ¶ 96.</p>\n<p>However, we acknowledge that plaintiff's complaint has allegations going the other way. Plaintiff alleges that all but one (Tobin) of these defendants engaged in insider trading at periods outside of the narrowed class period, including some after the recalls were announced and the manufacturing change was disclosed. This undermines the inference that the timing of the trading was suspicious. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 15-23. Plaintiff also does not allege that the particular timing of the trading was suspicious other than that it occurred during the eight-month period to which the appeal is limited: the trading has not been linked, for instance, to defendants' non-disclosed knowledge of the manufacturing change or problems with TAXUS.</p>\n<p>Defendants respond that many of these stock sales, including all of Best's and many of Tobin's, were effectuated pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans that removed control of the sales from the individual defendants. It was defendants' choice to move to dismiss the case on the pleadings without presenting evidence. As a result, there is no evidence of when the trading plans went into effect, that such trading plans removed entirely from defendants' discretion the question of when sales would occur, or that they were unable to amend these trading plans.</p>\n<p>The insider trading claims as alleged are on the weaker end of the spectrum. But, as in <i>Shaw,</i> \"we think that the plaintiffs' allegations of insider trading, inasmuch as they are at least consistent with their theory of fraud, provide some support against the defendants' motion to dismiss.\" 82 F.3d at 1224; <i>see also </i><i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197-98 (\"The vitality of the inference to be drawn depends on the facts, and can range from marginal to strong.\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>Plaintiff has alleged a significant amount of insider trading in the months before the announcement of recalls in July, which caused the stock price to drop. CAC ¶¶ 100, 102. The company's stock price was at an all-time high in the months before the recalls were announced, often closing above $40. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 15-23, 96, 100. It fits with plaintiff's theory that defendants would have sold stock at this time, knowing that the price would drop when the manufacturing change, acknowledging a defect, was announced. If defendants were unaware of the connection between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> the non-deflation reports they were receiving and the manufacturing change, a fact finder could reasonably ask why they would have sold so much stock at a time when the company appeared to be soaring on the strength of TAXUS.</p>\n<p>Given plaintiff's specific factual allegations, the temporal proximity between LaViolette's statements and the third recall, and the alleged insider trading, we think that plaintiff has pled enough to give rise to inferences that are at least as strong as any competing inferences regarding scienter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Group Pleading</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendants argue that plaintiff has engaged in impermissible group pleading and that several of the defendants should be dismissed from the case now that the subject area has been narrowed on appeal because they are not specifically alleged to have been involved with TAXUS.<sup>[10]</sup> The district court did not address the issue. We decline to address the issue in the first instance.</p>\n<p>We take into account, as in <i>Cabletron,</i> the fact that the overall complaint survives, the pre-discovery posture of the case, and the fact that all of the individual defendants held positions of significant responsibility within the company and therefore potentially face control person liability under section 20(a). <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 41. We think the questions should be resolved in the first instance by the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Section 20(a) Liability</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff has also made allegations against defendants under section 20(a), which establishes liability for any person who \"directly or indirectly[] controls any person liable\" for a violation of securities laws. 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a). The district court summarily dismissed the section 20(a) claims on account of its dismissal of the section 10(b) claims. Reinstatement of section 20(a) claims is generally appropriate when section 10(b) claims have been reinstated and the section 20(a) claims had been dismissed by the district court because of its dismissal of the section 10(b) claims. <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 41; <i>see also </i><i>Nathenson v. Zonagen Inc.,</i> 267 F.3d 400, 426 n. 29 (5th Cir.2001); <i>Hollin v. Scholastic Corp.</i> (<i>In re Scholastic Corp. Sec. Litig.</i>), 252 F.3d 63, 77-78 (2d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p>On appeal, defendants claim that plaintiff has failed to allege facts demonstrating that any of the individual defendants are subject to control person liability and therefore the section 20(a) claims should be dismissed even if the section 10(b) claims are allowed to stand. We disagree. \"Control is a question of fact that `will not ordinarily be resolved summarily at the pleading stage.' The issue raises a number of complexities that should not be resolved on such an underdeveloped record.\" <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 41 (citation omitted) (quoting 2 T.L. Hazen, <i>Treatise on the Law of Securities Regulation</i> § 12.24(1) (4th ed.2002)). The practical effect of reinstating the section 20(a) claims is small since the same defendants are involved as with the section 10(b) claims, and individual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> defendants are not foreclosed from challenging their liability under section 20(a) in the future. <i>Id.</i> at 41-42.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We do not address the other requirements of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, which were not raised in this appeal by either party.</p>\n<p>We reverse the dismissal and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  LaViolette became Chief Operating Officer in 2004, after the beginning of the class period.</p>\n<p>[2]  Coronary stents are tiny tubes placed in patients' arteries to ameliorate blockages and facilitate blood flow. Drug-eluting stents (also called \"coated\" or \"medicated\" stents) slowly release drugs aimed at reducing restenosis, a narrowing of the arteries that can occur after a stent is implanted. Stents are implanted in arteries using a delivery catheter.\n</p>\n<p>In 2002, Boston Scientific marketed a coronary stent system called the Express2, which combined its highly successful Express coronary stent and Maverick® balloon dilation catheter, which uses a tiny balloon to inflate the artery and permit the stent to be inserted. TAXUS uses the same delivery catheter as the Express2; the systems differ in that Express2 is a bare metal stent whereas TAXUS is a drug-eluting stent.</p>\n<p>[3]  The complaint states the date of the third recall as August 4, but the press release announcing the recall is dated August 5.</p>\n<p>[4]  We discuss the district court's opinion only as it pertains to the TAXUS claims because only that part of the opinion is being appealed.</p>\n<p>[5]  Rule 9(b) requires that in alleging fraud or mistake, \"a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). In securities fraud cases, this requirement is comparable to and effectively subsumed by the requirements of the PSLRA. <i>See ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58 n. 7.</p>\n<p>[6]  We do not consider the transcripts of conference calls mentioned by both parties in their briefs and attached as an appendix to plaintiff's brief. In an order dated October 30, 2007, we rejected plaintiff's motion to expand the record before this court to include three transcripts that were not before the district court. We held that plaintiff had not demonstrated the \"extraordinary circumstances\" necessary to invoke this court's power to supplement a record under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(e)(2). <i>United States v. Muriel-Cruz,</i> 412 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2005). We further held that although the complaint \"contained some brief quotations from the documents, it did not expressly incorporate the entire documents, including the additional statements that [plaintiff] relies upon in its appellate brief.\" We also noted that regardless of whether the district court could have considered the transcripts if they were offered below, they had not been so offered.</p>\n<p>[7]  Companies, of course, have other reasons not to have made an announcement from which some might have inferred there may have been a product defect causing injury and death, which could have been avoided by using different manufacturing techniques.</p>\n<p>[8]  Plaintiff and defendants dispute the extent of the recall, with plaintiff arguing that all pre-manufacturing change stents were recalled and defendants responding that approximately 445,000 \"old\" TAXUS stents had already been shipped and implanted and therefore were not problematic or recalled. We need not resolve this factual question at this point because the extent of the recall is largely irrelevant to our analysis. There seems not to be a dispute that a connection existed between the manufacturing change and the non-deflation problem that necessitated the recall.</p>\n<p>[9]  <i>Shaw</i> was decided before the PSLRA was enacted, but Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement is similar to the requirements of the PSLRA. <i>See supra</i> n. 5.</p>\n<p>[10]  Under the group pleading presumption, a court may attribute all statements to the defendants as collective actions without considering the liability of each individual defendant. This court has recognized \"a very limited version of the group pleading doctrine for securities fraud.\" <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 40. There has been \"great debate about the doctrine's continued existence after enactment of the PSLRA,\" a question on which this circuit has not taken a position. <i>Id.</i> We need not here resolve whether group pleading survives the PSLRA.</p>\n\n</div>",

The appeal concerns dismissal of claims based on the company's launch of a new product, the drug-eluting TAXUS coronary stent, and its eventual recalls. Plaintiff, a Mississippi pension fund and purchaser of Boston Scientific stock, alleges that company executives both withheld material information about problems with the stent and decisions addressing those problems, and made misleading positive statements, in violation of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a), and the attendant rules and regulations, including Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff appeals the district court's grant of defendants' motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

Nicholas (Chairman of the Board of Directors); James R. Tobin (President and Director); Paul A. LaViolette (Chief Operating Officer and member of the Executive Committee<sup>[1]</sup>); Fredericus A. Colen (Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer); Lawrence C. Best (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer); Stephen F. Moreci (Senior Vice President and Group President of Endosurgery); Robert G. MacLean (Vice President of Human Resources); Paul W. Sandman (Senior Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel); and James H. Taylor, Jr. (Senior Vice President of Corporate Operations). Consolidated Am. Compl. (\"CAC\") ¶¶ 1, 15-23.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff sued on behalf of a putative class of individuals and entities who purchased equity securities in Boston Scientific from March 31, 2003 to August 23, 2005. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 1. Plaintiff alleged that during that period, defendants made false and misleading statements and caused the market price of the company's securities to be artificially inflated, both harming investors and allowing the individual insider defendants to enrich themselves in excess of $332 million. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiff's original complaint divided into four categories its allegations regarding defendants' statements about a civil lawsuit with Medinol Ltd., a Department of Justice investigation into a 1998 product recall, the company's introduction of TAXUS stents to the market, and FDA investigations and warnings regarding Boston Scientific's plants. Only the TAXUS stent issue is before us on appeal following the dismissal of all claims.</p>\n<p>In particular, plaintiff advances these theories. By late 2003 defendants became aware of serious problems in patients in Europe resulting from the insertion of the new TAXUS stent, not yet introduced in the United States. The TAXUS stent was introduced in the United States in March 2004; American doctors reported similar problems. In the spring of 2004 defendants made affirmative statements attributing the problems reported about the new TAXUS stent to the unfamiliarity of doctors with the new stent. They did not correct the statements even though they had become aware that the problem was not doctor unfamiliarity, but rather a manufacturing defect in the stent that caused the balloon to fail to deflate. Defendants continued to withhold information about a manufacturing change Boston Scientific had instituted in December 2003 which would address the defect. They withheld the information to build up inventory, in order to preserve market share, before announcing recalls of TAXUS stents based <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> on the potential defects. Meanwhile, while withholding this material information, several of the individual defendants traded on the open market in unusual patterns and unusual amounts. When the material information was finally and belatedly disclosed, the market price for Boston Scientific stock plummeted downward. The stock price dropped 7.6% after the company announced an expanded recall and revealed that three deaths and several dozen serious injuries had been connected to balloon deflation failure, and it dropped another 6.6% when the company expanded the recall of the TAXUS stent for a second time. CAC ¶¶ 100, 102.</p>\n<p>The defendants' theory is that at the time the company received some thirty to forty reports of problems in Europe of balloon non-deflation following stent insertion, it was unable to identify anything about the device itself that would cause the problem and attributed the problem to doctor unfamiliarity. Defendants' brief argues that independently and</p>\n<blockquote>[i]n an effort to improve the device, Boston Scientific tried completely to eliminate the possibility of balloon non-deflation. It eventually identified a means to do so, by changing the manner of bonding the delivery catheter to the balloon and by implementing an additional inspection test at the end of the manufacturing process. These proposed modifications were submitted to the FDA for approval in April 2004 and approved by the FDA the following month. In June 2004 Boston Scientific began manufacturing the \"new\" device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>After</i> it identified how to completely eliminate what was already an infrequently occurring issue, Boston Scientific was able to re-analyze its \"old\" Taxus inventory. That process led to the identification of specific lots that had the <i>potential</i> for non-deflation. Out of an abundance of caution, Boston Scientific voluntarily recalled a limited number of specific production lots of its \"old\" Taxus stents in July and August 2004.</blockquote>\n<p>It is the company's position that the changes would have been implemented \"whether it got a complaint or not.\" The removal of the possibility that the balloon would fail to deflate by the manufacturing change did not prove there was a defect, much less that the company knew at an earlier date of a connection between the manufacturing change and the problem that necessitated the recalls, or that it was obliged to disclose it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Plaintiff's Allegations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff brought the suit as a putative class action. The class period plaintiff claims is relevant to this narrowed appeal is December 2, 2003 to August 5, 2004.</p>\n<p>In 2001, Boston Scientific decided to produce a drug-eluting stent<sup>[2]</sup> to compete with a similar product manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson. CAC ¶ 86. Boston Scientific's product is known as TAXUS® Express Paclitaxel-Eluting Monorail® Coronary Stent System. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> TAXUS debuted in Europe in January 2003. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 87, 92. Plaintiff alleges that defendants felt \"tremendous pressure\" to introduce TAXUS into the U.S. market because the company was losing market share to Johnson &amp; Johnson. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 87. While in the process of obtaining final FDA approval for TAXUS, defendants allegedly downplayed news that could delay the U.S. launch, such as failing to disclose in a timely manner an FDA major deficiency letter that the company received in September 2003. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 89. Meanwhile, defendants \"provided to the investment community a drum roll leading up to the FDA's approval of TAXUS which was deafening.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 90. Plaintiff alleges that in anticipation of FDA approval and in response to positive comments made by defendants, analysts upgraded their rating of Boston Scientific stock, and by March 2004, the price of Boston Scientific stock on the New York Stock Exchange hit a new high, trading at over $40 a share. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 15-23, 91, 100.</p>\n<p>On March 4, 2004, the FDA approved TAXUS for marketing and distribution in the United States. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 92. Plaintiff alleges that Boston Scientific \"trumpeted [TAXUS's] immediate impact in the Company's effort to take over market share for stents.\" <i>Id.</i> Meanwhile, defendants did not disclose complaints they had received from doctors in Europe that the balloon used during insertion of the TAXUS stent did not deflate. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 93. Defendants also knew that the Express2 metal stent, upon which the new TAXUS stent was based, \"had a history of significant problems.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Despite this knowledge, defendants \"minimized and misrepresented . . . problems,\" including in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2004, which Boston Scientific filed with the SEC on May 7, 2004. This report stated that the company was \"reviewing a limited number of reports related to balloon withdrawal difficulty during TAXUS angioplasty procedures.\" <i>Id.</i> In meetings with analysts, defendants \"further downplayed the complaints\" by attributing the problems to doctor unfamiliarity with TAXUS rather than balloon non-deflation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, plaintiff alleges, defendants knew \"the problems with TAXUS were much more significant, based on the complaints they had received out of Europe and the complaints which were rolling in as a result of the product rollout in the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 95. In December 2003 defendants allegedly had begun planning a manufacturing change for TAXUS because they had become aware that the problem with TAXUS was not doctor unfamiliarity but rather a \"manufacturing defect.\" This manufacturing change, which according to defendants was approved by the FDA in May 2004, related to the manner of the laser bonding of the delivery catheter and balloon. Defendants did not disclose this manufacturing change to the public prior to July 2, 2004, when they referred to it in a conference call with analysts. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 95, 98. Defendants also discussed the manufacturing change in the press releases announcing subsequent recalls on July 16 and August 5.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that defendants had an obligation to disclose this manufacturing change to the public at some point prior to July 2 because it was necessary to correct defendants' earlier and continuing statements that the adverse reports related to U.S. doctors' unfamiliarity with TAXUS rather than to a defect with the product itself. As plaintiff put it at oral argument: \"The disclosure that we are asking for is that as soon as they learned that . . . the problems with TAXUS were not related to doctor [un]familiarity . . . they had a duty to disclose that.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> In the months following the U.S. launch of TAXUS, Boston Scientific's stock price rose and defendants began to sell large quantities of their own stock. CAC ¶ 96. Plaintiff specifically points to the following stock sales, all of which occurred within two months of the FDA's March approval of TAXUS: over $40 million by James R. Tobin; over $54 million by Lawrence C. Best; over $4 million by Fredericus A. Colen; and over $3 million by Robert G. MacLean. <i>Id.</i> Additionally, defendant Paul LaViolette sold approximately $3 million worth of company stock in June of 2004. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 18. Plaintiff argues that these sales demonstrated \"unusual patterns\" and occurred in \"unusual amounts.\"</p>\n<p>On July 2, 2004, Boston Scientific announced that it was voluntarily recalling two lots of TAXUS stents (a total of 200 stents), which had not yet been implanted in patients. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 97. In a press release announcing the recall, the company stated that the FDA had received reports of one death and sixteen serious injuries associated with balloon non-deflation, along with eight reports of balloon malfunction that had not caused injury. <i>Id.</i> The press release explained that the recall was due to \"characteristics . . . related to a narrowing in the area where the catheter and balloon are laser welded,\" a problem referred to as \"focal neckdown.\" \"This narrowing resulted in the potential for impeded deflation and removal of the balloon after stent placement.\"</p>\n<p>The manufacturing change that defendants had put into motion in December 2003 addressed the problem of focal neckdown by changing the manner of the laser welding of the catheter and balloon. In a conference call with analysts on July 2, defendants asserted that this manufacturing change had been in progress before the TAXUS launch and \"would have been submitted whether we got a complaint or not.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 98.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, on July 16, defendants voluntarily expanded the company's recall to 85,000 TAXUS stents and 11,000 Express2 stents  which use the same delivery catheter as TAXUS  and admitted knowing of two additional serious injuries associated with TAXUS as well as two deaths and twenty-five serious injuries associated with balloon deflation failure in Express2 stents. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 100. In a press release announcing this recall, defendants assured the public: \"The Company implemented review of its manufacturing process, additional inspections, and an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process for these products. The current and future production are not expected to experience similar balloon deflation problems.\"</p>\n<p>After defendants announced this expanded recall on July 16, Boston Scientific's stock price dropped $3.09 per share, or 7.6%, to $37.40. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 100. Plaintiff connects the drop in stock price to the revelations of the deaths and injuries associated with the TAXUS and Express2 stents. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that during July and early August 2004, defendants \"continued to try to reassure the market about the safety of the Company's products through the issuance of public statements which were false and misleading.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 101. In particular, during a conference call with analysts on July 26, 2004, defendant Paul LaViolette responded to concerns about TAXUS by saying, \"[Y]ou are dealing with simple lag time in the marketplace conversion of newer products, not necessarily a continuation of complaints from the new issue product.\" <i>Id.</i> At a meeting with a local hospital official on July 29, LaViolette stated that the company had \"identified and fixed the problem.\" <i>Id.</i> On August 4, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> he stated that the problem was a \"nuisance.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On August 5, Boston Scientific announced that it was voluntarily recalling an additional 3,000 TAXUS stents.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.</i> ¶ 102. The press release announcing the recall stated that it was prompted by the company's \"ongoing monitoring\" and noted that since the company had \"modified its manufacturing process, implemented new tracking software and introduced new inspection protocols,\" it had not had any confirmed non-deflation problems caused by focal neckdown in the units made with these changes in place. At this time, the company's stock price dropped another $2.41, or 6.6%. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>By the end of 2004, Boston Scientific had recalled 99,000 TAXUS and Express2 stents because of manufacturing defects that plaintiff alleges had caused three deaths and dozens of serious injuries. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 103. The company spent over $57 million on these recalls. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 101. Between July 2, 2004, when the first recall was announced, and August 5, 2004, when the recall was expanded for a second time, the company's stock price dropped 21%. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 103.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's theory is that the investing world was aware of reports of patient death and injury involving TAXUS. However, defendants said that the problems with the TAXUS stents were caused by doctor unfamiliarity with the new product. It was natural for investors to conclude the problems would disappear over time as doctors became more familiar with the product, and there would be no recalls. Having given that explanation, the defendants, plaintiff argues, were required to disclose as soon as they could the connection between the patient problems, the manufacturing defect, and the manufacturing change remedying this problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>District Court Opinion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In dismissing the TAXUS claims, the district court reasoned in a series of discrete steps.<sup>[4]</sup> It first noted that there was no violation in not disclosing the FDA major deficiency letter regarding TAXUS that Boston Scientific had received in September 2003, before the U.S. release of the product. Rather, the major deficiency letter was simply \"a step in the FDA approval process which [Boston Scientific] had no duty to disclose.\" <i>In re Boston Scientific,</i> 490 F.Supp.2d at 158; <i>see also id.</i> at 158 n. 91 (citing 21 C.F.R. § 814.37(b) (\"A major deficiency letter informs the applicant that its PMA [Premarket Approval Application] lacks significant information needed for FDA to complete the scientific review of, and render a final decision on, the PMA.\")).</p>\n<p>The court next turned to the adverse reports from doctors that defendants received prior to announcement of the recalls of the TAXUS and Express2 stents in July and August of 2004. The court examined the company's statements that complaints received from American doctors in the spring of 2004 were comparable to complaints it had received the previous year from European doctors. Plaintiff asserted that these statements were false when made because the company knew that the problems in both Europe and the United States resulted from a product flaw rather than from the stated reason of doctor unfamiliarity with TAXUS. However, the district court concluded, plaintiff provided <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> \"little in the way of facts to support this claim. Lead Plaintiff pleads no facts to suggest that the complaints [Boston Scientific] received from American doctors were different than those it received from European doctors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 159.</p>\n<p>With respect to the manufacturing change which Boston Scientific initiated prior to the U.S. launch of TAXUS, the court rejected plaintiff's allegations that this change was evidence that defendants knew TAXUS was defective and that the change was material information that should have been disclosed. <i>Id.</i> Here the district court invoked the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. The court reasoned that a manufacturing change does not necessarily mean that a product is defective or that a company knows that a product is defective since \"[c]ompanies frequently adjust and change their products, and no rule requires a company to inform the public every time it modifies its manufacturing process.\" <i>Id.</i> The court pointed out that Boston Scientific's manufacturing change was conducted with the FDA's knowledge, at a time when the company had received only a limited number of complaints from European doctors, which had been tapering off. <i>Id.</i> at 160. Plaintiff did not contest that the manufacturing change was set in motion before TAXUS's release in the United States and would have been made regardless of whether the company received complaints from U.S. doctors. <i>Id.</i> The district court further noted that \"[t]he recalls were limited, and only applied to a fraction of the TAXUS stents released on the domestic market.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the court concluded, while \"[i]n hindsight. . . it appears that this manufacturing change may indeed have been material,\" <i>id.</i> at 159, plaintiff failed \"to allege facts that provide a strong inference that at the time of the manufacturing change, Defendants knew that TAXUS was defective or that the product would later be recalled,\" <i>id.</i> at 160.</p>\n<p>With respect to defendant Paul LaViolette's July 29, 2004 remarks that Boston Scientific had identified and fixed the problem with TAXUS, the district court also invoked the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. A week after LaViolette's statements, the company initiated an additional recall of 3,000 TAXUS stents. However, the district court reasoned, there is no liability where \"a plaintiff's claim rests on the assumption that the defendants `must have known of the severity of their problems earlier because conditions became so bad later on.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>In re Boston Tech., Inc. Sec. Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576714\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576714/in-re-boston-technology-inc-securities-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 53 (D.Mass.1998)). Here, the court concluded that plaintiff failed to allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that LaViolette knew at the time of his remarks that they were false or that an additional recall would be necessary. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal, plaintiff argues that the district court erred in several respects. It argues that the court misapplied the doctrine of fraud by hindsight, resulting in the imposition of too stringent a pleading standard. More specifically, it claims that the court erroneously drew factual inferences against plaintiff regarding the manufacturing change and failed to account for the materiality of the change. Plaintiff further argues that the court misapplied the fraud by hindsight doctrine to LaViolette's remarks by discounting the temporal proximity between his statements and the third TAXUS recall, and it challenges the district court's factual assumption that the recall was limited in scope. Finally, plaintiff faults the district court for failing to consider the allegations of insider trading presented in the complaint. Overall, plaintiff argues the district court atomized the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> complaint and did not look at the overall pattern.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Pleading Requirements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We evaluate de novo whether a complaint meets the requirements of the PSLRA. <i>ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58. As with any Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, we accept well-pled factual allegations in the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor. <i>Id.</i> The standard most recently articulated by the Supreme Court is that a complaint must allege \"a plausible entitlement to relief\" in order to withstand a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Bell Atl.

The PSLRA requires that when alleging that a defendant made a material misrepresentation or omission, a complaint must \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1). If the allegation is \"made on information and belief,\" then the complaint must \"state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> With respect to scienter, the complaint must, \"with respect to each act or omission. . ., state with particularity facts giving rise to a <i>strong inference</i> that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" <i>Id.</i> § 78u-4(b)(2) (emphasis added). This requirement that plaintiffs plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter differs from the general rule applied to other cases that a reasonable inference is sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion; in the PSLRA \"Congress has effectively mandated a special standard for measuring whether allegations of scienter survive a motion to dismiss.\" <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 195.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Tellabs</i> clarified that scienter should be evaluated with respect to \"the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.\" <i>Tellabs,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2509; <i>see also ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58. \"The inquiry . . . is whether <i>all</i> of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.\" <i>Tellabs,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2509. <i>Tellabs</i> also directed that courts consider \"not only inferences urged by the plaintiff. . . but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged,\" <i>id.</i> at 2504, and held that a complaint survives when there are equally compelling inferences for and against scienter, <i>id.</i> at 2510; <i>see also ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 59.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Plaintiff's Allegations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We evaluate plaintiff's allegations in this context. In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), courts ordinarily will consider only documents attached to the complaint, but have made exceptions \"for documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; for official public records; for documents central to plaintiffs' claim; [and] for documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint.\" <i>Watterson v.

The primary motive alleged for the delay is that defendants wanted to build up inventory before announcing product recalls. Under the requirements of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiff must demonstrate both that the defendants omitted material information and that they did so with the requisite scienter.</p>\n<p>Securities actions raise questions of what corporate managers knew and when they knew it. These issues are pertinent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> both to materiality and to scienter. Moreover, something may be material because of other information or explanations that have been given by defendants. Thus plaintiff does not need to rely on a theory that there was an independent duty to disclose the manufacturing change. Further, we do not reach the district court's reasoning on the materiality, standing alone, of either manufacturing changes or the receipt of FDA major deficiency letters.</p>\n<p>The existence of a material omission is usually a question for the trier of fact. <i>See ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 65 (citing <i>Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196753\"><a href=\"/opinion/196753/shaw-v-digital/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1217 (1st Cir.1996)). In this case, we cannot say that as a matter of law the complaint fails to raise a reasonable inference that this was a material omission.</p>\n<p>The company's own statements draw a connection between the manufacturing change and the resolution of the balloon non-deflation problems, whether or not the earlier product had a defect. Indeed, Boston Scientific's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004 included the following statements: \"As a result of its investigation, the Company has implemented reviews of its manufacturing process, additional inspections, and an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process for [TAXUS and Express2 stents]. The Company believes these measures will be effective in reducing the occurrence of balloon non-deflation.\"</p>\n<p>Because the manufacturing change, in combination with other changes, would have the effect of reducing balloon non-deflation, a jury could find that the company's continuing assertions that reported problems about TAXUS in the United States resulted from doctor unfamiliarity with the product rather than any defect in the product were misleading unless accompanied by disclosure of the manufacturing change and its connection to the balloon non-deflation problem. <i>See </i><i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 36. Among other things, the existence of this manufacturing change was pertinent to the issue of potential recalls, and it would raise the question whether, if there were continuing problems or recalls, the company would have on hand sufficient new products incorporating the manufacturing change in order to allow the company to replace the original TAXUS stents and maintain market share.</p>\n<p>Assuming that a jury could find a material omission, the next requirement under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is that defendants acted with the requisite scienter in not disclosing the manufacturing change sooner, i.e., prior to the first recall announced on July 2, 2004. Knowingly omitting material information is probative, although not determinative, of scienter. <i>Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 83 (\"[T]he fact that the defendants published statements when they knew facts suggesting the statements were inaccurate or misleadingly incomplete is classic evidence of scienter.\"); <i>see also ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 65.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that at some point prior to the FDA approval of TAXUS in March 2004, defendants knew that the problem with TAXUS was not doctor unfamiliarity but rather a manufacturing defect, and the company had already determined how to fix that defect. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that prior to the U.S. launch of TAXUS, defendants knew of adverse reports from doctors in Europe about balloon non-deflation, and that they also knew that the Express2 metal stent, which used the same delivery system as TAXUS, had a \"history of significant problems.\" CAC ¶ 93. Plaintiff also alleges that defendants received numerous adverse reports in the spring of 2004 from U.S. doctors, which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> they \"minimized and misrepresented,\" and attributed to doctors' unfamiliarity with the new product. <i>Id.</i> Yet defendants proceeded with the U.S. launch of TAXUS and did not disclose this information until July 2, 2004.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that defendants withheld this information to allow the company to build up its inventory of new, non-defective products which had been made with the manufacturing change in place, in order to avoid loss of market share.<sup>[7]</sup> Plaintiff also alleges that several of the defendants engaged in insider trading during this lag period, benefitting from the delay.</p>\n<p>Inferences supporting plaintiff's allegations about defendants' knowledge can be drawn from statements in Boston Scientific's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004, filed on August 9, 2004. The Form 10-Q discusses the company's voluntary recall of the TAXUS Express2 stent \"due to characteristics in the delivery catheters that have the potential to impede balloon deflation during a coronary angioplasty procedure. Further analysis and investigation of the TAXUS Express2 (paclitaxel-eluting) and Express2 (bare metal) stent systems, both of which share the same delivery catheter, revealed that certain additional production lots exhibited these same characteristics.\" This statement acknowledges a connection between the balloon non-deflation problem and the characteristics of the delivery catheter. The statement also acknowledges that the company had been conducting ongoing analysis and investigation of the problem and as a result voluntarily expanded its recall on July 16. The statement goes on to say that the company would continue to work with the FDA to monitor the non-deflation problem.</p>\n<p>Tellingly, the statement also says that \"<i>[a]s a result of its investigation,</i> the Company has implemented . . . an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process.\" (Emphasis added.) To the extent the company may be arguing that there was no connection between the manufacturing change and any characteristics of the catheter, defendants' own statements can be read to say that they implemented the manufacturing change <i>in response to</i> adverse reports, not independent of them.</p>\n<p>Defendants made a similar statement in the press release announcing the July 16 expanded recall. After noting that the company had conducted \"further analysis and investigation\" that demonstrated the need for an expanded recall, the press release states: \"The Company implemented review of its manufacturing process, additional inspections, and an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process for these products. The current and future production are not expected to experience similar balloon deflation problems.\"</p>\n<p>Defendants make a different argument, addressed below, that even if the manufacturing change did solve the problem by preventing balloon non-deflation, that does not mean they knew the connection or were obliged to disclose it earlier.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff gave a reason why defendants withheld information: so that they could build up an inventory of \"new\" TAXUS stents prior to announcing the recalls, thereby minimizing supply disruptions and maximizing profit. In support of this theory is the fact that defendants asserted in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> their Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004 that they had been able to use their \"existing supply of coronary stents not subject to the recall to replenish the U.S. market,\" although they also noted that they were unable to replenish the European market with existing stock and were hoping to do so during the third quarter of 2004. Similarly, in the press release announcing the July 16 recall, defendant James Tobin stated that, \"We're fortunate that current TAXUS inventory levels will minimize service disruption in the United States, but we do expect some disruption internationally.\"</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's proposed inferences are that defendants knew about the connection between adverse reports and the manufacturing change well before July 2, and withheld that information in order to build up inventory prior to announcing recalls. Under the PSLRA these inferences must be strong and must be weighed against competing ones. Defendants' inferences are that the manufacturing change was implemented for \"innocuous\" reasons not owing to any defect in the product, and that they did not know of a connection between the manufacturing change and the adverse reports they were receiving from U.S. doctors until the time of the first recall. Defendants' inferences are supported by the fact that balloon non-deflation complaints that defendants received from doctors in Europe in 2003 faded over time, indicating that such complaints were in fact tied to doctor unfamiliarity. Additionally, defendants' press releases and Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2004 stated that it was not the manufacturing change alone but rather this change in combination with others, including an improved inspection process, that would prevent non-deflation in the future. At no point did defendants communicate that the manufacturing change alone would fix the non-deflation problem.</p>\n<p>Given these allegations, the district court held that plaintiff failed to plead facts providing a strong inference that at the time of the manufacturing change, defendants had the requisite scienter. <i>In re Boston Scientific,</i> 490 F.Supp.2d at 160. It reasoned that the manufacturing change was implemented with the FDA's knowledge and approval, at a time when the company had received only a \"limited number of complaints from Europe which had tapered off after the product's release.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, defendants asserted and plaintiff did not dispute that the manufacturing change would have been put into place regardless of whether the company received complaints from doctors in the United States. <i>Id.</i> The district court did not address the key question of inferences about whether defendants knew that the manufacturing change was related to non-deflation complaints at some point prior to the July 2 recall, not just when they first initiated the change.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court did not have the benefit of the <i>Tellabs</i> opinion, which reversed a higher standard for scienter imposed by the prior law of this circuit. We apply <i>Tellabs</i> and that leads us to a different result. While there is support for defendants' inferences, we think, at this stage, that plaintiff's inferences are at least equally strong. First, there is a very reasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> inference that defendants initiated the manufacturing change as a result of non-deflation complaints it had received from Europe, even if these complaints had tapered off over time.</p>\n<p>Other inferences may be drawn favorable to plaintiff by proper recognition of the limits of the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. Fraud by hindsight refers to allegations that assert no more than that because something eventually went wrong, defendants must have known about the problem earlier. \"[A] plaintiff may not simply contrast a defendant's past optimism with less favorable actual results, and then `contend[] that the difference must be attributable to fraud.'\" <i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1223 (quoting <i>DiLeo v. Ernst &amp; Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540063\"><a href=\"/opinion/540063/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95228-rocco-dileo-and-louise-dileo-v-ernst-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 627 (7th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p>The doctrine has been applied in a number of different situations. We recognize that the effect of use of the doctrine at the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal stage is to cut off the case as a matter of law, without further factual development. As some commentators have stated, \"[A]t this stage, a court must be cautious. The case has not yet developed. In cutting off the case on the pleadings by citing hindsight, the court is essentially making a prediction that the discovery process will yield only evidence that requires the benefit of the hindsight bias to seem adequate [to support the allegations].\" M. Gulati, J. Rachlinski &amp; D. Langevoort, <i>Fraud by Hindsight,</i> 98 Nw. L.Rev. 773, 787 (2004). Meanwhile, at the pleadings stage, \"a bad outcome truly is relevant to the likelihood of fraud.\" <i>Id.</i> at 815. Indeed, this court has held that \"in determining the adequacy of a complaint. . . we cannot hold plaintiffs to a standard that would effectively require them, pre-discovery, to plead evidence.\" <i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1225. The law \"proscribes the pleading of `fraud by hindsight,' but neither can plaintiffs be expected to plead fraud with complete insight.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Denny v. Barber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355917\"><a href=\"/opinion/355917/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96438-frank-denny-v-charles-f-barber-james-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 470 (2d Cir.1978) (Friendly, J.)).</p>\n<p>In <i>Shaw,</i> we held that the doctrine did not apply when plaintiffs provided \"a series of factual allegations relating to a combination of developments known to the company . . . that could have provided a basis for advance knowledge of the information\" which was eventually disclosed. <i>Id.</i> at 1224. We held that these allegations of developments known to the company, along with (admittedly weak) evidence of insider trading and the temporal proximity between the date of the alleged omission and the eventual disclosure (less than a month), were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.<sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 1225.</p>\n<p>Defendants in this case urged, and the district court accepted, that plaintiff's allegations amounted to nothing more than an allegation of fraud by hindsight: that simply because the manufacturing change eventually was linked as a remedy for the balloon non-deflation problem, defendants must have known about the connection earlier. This approach fails to consider the other allegations that plaintiff made from supporting documents. For instance, there is no dispute that the manufacturing change related to the laser welding of the delivery catheter and balloon, and it may be inferred this addressed the same problem which resulted in the recalls. It is also clear that defendants had received non-deflation reports from doctors in Europe before instituting the manufacturing change, as well as numerous non-deflation complaints from U.S. doctors while the company was in the process of implementing the change. Moreover, defendants' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> own SEC filings and press releases reveal that they reassured the public that they had implemented the manufacturing change <i>in response</i> to complaints of non-deflation, so that the \"new\" TAXUS would not suffer from the same problems. The company said it had been monitoring, analyzing, and investigating the problem and appropriate responses. It is fair to infer the company has highly effective information systems. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 1224 n. 38. Defendants are in a highly regulated industry and the company, it can be inferred, constantly monitors reports of patient injury and death and looks for prompt solutions to such problems.</p>\n<p>This is not the classic fraud by hindsight case where a plaintiff alleges that the fact that something turned out badly must mean defendant knew earlier that it would turn out badly. <i>Denny,</i> 576 F.2d at 470. Nor is this a case where there is no contemporaneous evidence at all that defendants knew earlier what they chose not to disclose until later. <i>DiLeo,</i> 901 F.2d at 626-7.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>LaViolette's Statements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff also disputes the district court's rejection of the LaViolette allegations under the doctrine of fraud by hindsight. The allegations are that defendant Paul LaViolette made public statements that were \"false and misleading\" and constituted a \"misrepresentation\" (1) when he stated on July 29  a week before the third recall was announced on August 5  that the problem with TAXUS had been \"fixed,\" and (2) when he stated on July 26 that there was simply a \"lag time\" in the marketplace's conversion to the improved version of TAXUS. CAC ¶ 101.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's complaint may be read as alleging a material omission and as supporting scienter. LaViolette's remarks were misleading not because the problem had not been \"fixed,\" but because LaViolette excluded any mention of the upcoming recall. In other words, it was misleading for LaViolette to say that the problem had been \"fixed\" while failing to mention that a third recall, of another 3,000 stents, would be announced a week later.</p>\n<p>As with plaintiff's allegations regarding the manufacturing change, we cannot say that LaViolette's omission was immaterial as a matter of law. The investors with whom LaViolette was speaking in the conference call would very well have wanted to know about the existence of an upcoming recall in addition to hearing LaViolette's assurances that the TAXUS problems were in the past.</p>\n<p>With respect to scienter, the district court held that plaintiff was merely alleging fraud by hindsight because plaintiff was claiming no more than that LaViolette should have known about the recall earlier. According to the district court, \"Lead Plaintiff fails to allege facts that provide a strong inference that Defendant LaViolette knew that an additional recall was necessary or that his remarks were false when he made them.\" <i>In re Boston Scientific,</i> 490 F.Supp.2d at 160. We disagree.</p>\n<p>This fails to account for the very short amount of time between LaViolette's remarks, some of which were made on Thursday, July 29, and the third recall, which was announced the following Thursday, August 5. Temporal proximity alone is insufficient to establish a claim for fraud, <i>see </i><i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1225, but this court has insisted on a \"fact-specific inquiry\" regarding scienter. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 196. The extremely short time period here is strong evidence.</p>\n<p>Moreover, LaViolette was the company's Chief Operating Officer and a point person on TAXUS, and so he would presumably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> have been aware of the status of the company's \"ongoing monitoring\" of \"old\" TAXUS stents. CAC ¶¶ 18, 93. The third recall, like the two before it, was voluntary and initiated by Boston Scientific rather than the FDA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Insider Trading</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because the district court dismissed on scienter grounds, it did not consider the insider trading allegations. We do consider these allegations in the overall mix.</p>\n<p>Insider trading cannot establish scienter on its own, but it can be used to do so in combination with other evidence. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197-98; <i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1224. Insider trading in suspicious amounts or at suspicious times may be probative of scienter. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197; <i>Greenstone v. Cambex Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590895\"><a href=\"/opinion/590895/amy-greenstone-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v-cambex-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1992). Plaintiff alleges that all defendants engaged in insider trading during the narrowed class period of December 3, 2003 to August 5, 2004, <i>see</i> CAC ¶¶ 15-23, and they argue that stock sales of $40.82 million by James R. Tobin, $54.2 million by Lawrence C. Best, $4.2 million by Fredericus A. Colen, and $3.3 million by Robert G. MacLean within the two months following the FDA's approval of TAXUS are particularly suspicious, <i>see id.</i> ¶ 96.</p>\n<p>However, we acknowledge that plaintiff's complaint has allegations going the other way. Plaintiff alleges that all but one (Tobin) of these defendants engaged in insider trading at periods outside of the narrowed class period, including some after the recalls were announced and the manufacturing change was disclosed. This undermines the inference that the timing of the trading was suspicious. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 15-23. Plaintiff also does not allege that the particular timing of the trading was suspicious other than that it occurred during the eight-month period to which the appeal is limited: the trading has not been linked, for instance, to defendants' non-disclosed knowledge of the manufacturing change or problems with TAXUS.</p>\n<p>Defendants respond that many of these stock sales, including all of Best's and many of Tobin's, were effectuated pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans that removed control of the sales from the individual defendants. It was defendants' choice to move to dismiss the case on the pleadings without presenting evidence. As a result, there is no evidence of when the trading plans went into effect, that such trading plans removed entirely from defendants' discretion the question of when sales would occur, or that they were unable to amend these trading plans.</p>\n<p>The insider trading claims as alleged are on the weaker end of the spectrum. But, as in <i>Shaw,</i> \"we think that the plaintiffs' allegations of insider trading, inasmuch as they are at least consistent with their theory of fraud, provide some support against the defendants' motion to dismiss.\" 82 F.3d at 1224; <i>see also </i><i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197-98 (\"The vitality of the inference to be drawn depends on the facts, and can range from marginal to strong.\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>Plaintiff has alleged a significant amount of insider trading in the months before the announcement of recalls in July, which caused the stock price to drop. CAC ¶¶ 100, 102. The company's stock price was at an all-time high in the months before the recalls were announced, often closing above $40. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 15-23, 96, 100. It fits with plaintiff's theory that defendants would have sold stock at this time, knowing that the price would drop when the manufacturing change, acknowledging a defect, was announced. If defendants were unaware of the connection between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> the non-deflation reports they were receiving and the manufacturing change, a fact finder could reasonably ask why they would have sold so much stock at a time when the company appeared to be soaring on the strength of TAXUS.</p>\n<p>Given plaintiff's specific factual allegations, the temporal proximity between LaViolette's statements and the third recall, and the alleged insider trading, we think that plaintiff has pled enough to give rise to inferences that are at least as strong as any competing inferences regarding scienter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Group Pleading</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Defendants argue that plaintiff has engaged in impermissible group pleading and that several of the defendants should be dismissed from the case now that the subject area has been narrowed on appeal because they are not specifically alleged to have been involved with TAXUS.<sup>[10]</sup> The district court did not address the issue. We decline to address the issue in the first instance.</p>\n<p>We take into account, as in <i>Cabletron,</i> the fact that the overall complaint survives, the pre-discovery posture of the case, and the fact that all of the individual defendants held positions of significant responsibility within the company and therefore potentially face control person liability under section 20(a). <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 41. We think the questions should be resolved in the first instance by the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Section 20(a) Liability</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff has also made allegations against defendants under section 20(a), which establishes liability for any person who \"directly or indirectly[] controls any person liable\" for a violation of securities laws. 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a). The district court summarily dismissed the section 20(a) claims on account of its dismissal of the section 10(b) claims. Reinstatement of section 20(a) claims is generally appropriate when section 10(b) claims have been reinstated and the section 20(a) claims had been dismissed by the district court because of its dismissal of the section 10(b) claims. <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 41; <i>see also </i><i>Nathenson v. Zonagen Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"25546\"><a href=\"/opinion/25546/nathenson-v-zonagen-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 426 n. 29 (5th Cir.2001); <i>Hollin v.

Hazen, <i>Treatise on the Law of Securities Regulation</i> § 12.24(1) (4th ed.2002)). The practical effect of reinstating the section 20(a) claims is small since the same defendants are involved as with the section 10(b) claims, and individual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> defendants are not foreclosed from challenging their liability under section 20(a) in the future. <i>Id.</i> at 41-42.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We do not address the other requirements of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, which were not raised in this appeal by either party.</p>\n<p>We reverse the dismissal and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  LaViolette became Chief Operating Officer in 2004, after the beginning of the class period.</p>\n<p>[2]  Coronary stents are tiny tubes placed in patients' arteries to ameliorate blockages and facilitate blood flow.

TAXUS uses the same delivery catheter as the Express2; the systems differ in that Express2 is a bare metal stent whereas TAXUS is a drug-eluting stent.</p>\n<p>[3]  The complaint states the date of the third recall as August 4, but the press release announcing the recall is dated August 5.</p>\n<p>[4]  We discuss the district court's opinion only as it pertains to the TAXUS claims because only that part of the opinion is being appealed.</p>\n<p>[5]  Rule 9(b) requires that in alleging fraud or mistake, \"a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). In securities fraud cases, this requirement is comparable to and effectively subsumed by the requirements of the PSLRA. <i>See ACA Fin.,</i> 512 F.3d at 58 n. 7.</p>\n<p>[6]  We do not consider the transcripts of conference calls mentioned by both parties in their briefs and attached as an appendix to plaintiff's brief. In an order dated October 30, 2007, we rejected plaintiff's motion to expand the record before this court to include three transcripts that were not before the district court. We held that plaintiff had not demonstrated the \"extraordinary circumstances\" necessary to invoke this court's power to supplement a record under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(e)(2). <i>United States v. Muriel-Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201643\"><a href=\"/opinion/201643/united-states-v-muriel-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2005). We further held that although the complaint \"contained some brief quotations from the documents, it did not expressly incorporate the entire documents, including the additional statements that [plaintiff] relies upon in its appellate brief.\" We also noted that regardless of whether the district court could have considered the transcripts if they were offered below, they had not been so offered.</p>\n<p>[7]  Companies, of course, have other reasons not to have made an announcement from which some might have inferred there may have been a product defect causing injury and death, which could have been avoided by using different manufacturing techniques.</p>\n<p>[8]  Plaintiff and defendants dispute the extent of the recall, with plaintiff arguing that all pre-manufacturing change stents were recalled and defendants responding that approximately 445,000 \"old\" TAXUS stents had already been shipped and implanted and therefore were not problematic or recalled. We need not resolve this factual question at this point because the extent of the recall is largely irrelevant to our analysis. There seems not to be a dispute that a connection existed between the manufacturing change and the non-deflation problem that necessitated the recall.</p>\n<p>[9]  <i>Shaw</i> was decided before the PSLRA was enacted, but Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement is similar to the requirements of the PSLRA. <i>See supra</i> n. 5.</p>\n<p>[10]  Under the group pleading presumption, a court may attribute all statements to the defendants as collective actions without considering the liability of each individual defendant. This court has recognized \"a very limited version of the group pleading doctrine for securities fraud.\" <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 40. There has been \"great debate about the doctrine's continued existence after enactment of the PSLRA,\" a question on which this circuit has not taken a position. <i>Id.</i> We need not here resolve whether group pleading survives the PSLRA.</p>\n\n</div>",
