Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rodney S. Dowell, with whom Berman & Dowell was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Theodore B. Heinrich, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 18, 2007\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           Defendant Edward Pierre ran an\n\nillegal wholesale and retail drug distribution business in Fall\n\nRiver, Massachusetts.\n\n           In 2003, Pierre was convicted of possessing cocaine with\n\nintent to distribute; the jury hung on a separate drug conspiracy\n\ncount.   The conspiracy count was retried in 2004, and Pierre was\n\nconvicted of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine and cocaine.\n\nPierre's co-defendant and ex-girlfriend, Michelle Mickens, pled\n\nguilty   and   testified   against   Pierre     at   both   trials.    Pierre\n\nsubsequently was sentenced to a 432-month term of imprisonment on\n\nthe conspiracy charge, a 240-month term of imprisonment, which was\n\nto run concurrently, on the possession charge, and five years'\n\nsupervised release.    The district court also entered a final order\n\nof forfeiture for $500,000 against Pierre.\n\n           Pierre's appeal relates primarily to the 2004 conspiracy\n\nconviction and the accompanying sentence, although he does assign\n\nerror to the introduction of certain evidence at both the 2003 and\n\n2004 trials and to his sentence on the possession count.              He also\n\nclaims that the district court's forfeiture order was error.              On\n\nappeal, we reject his myriad claims of error and affirm his\n\nconvictions, his combined sentence, and the forfeiture order.\n\n                                I.    Facts\n\n           Pierre and Mickens were indicted on August 15, 2002 for\n\nconspiring to distribute cocaine base.          On September 24, 2003, the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fgrand jury returned a second superceding indictment charging Pierre\n\nand Mickens with conspiring with others, from at least April 1998\n\nuntil September 2001, to distribute fifty or more grams of crack\n\nand   500   or   more   grams   of   cocaine,   and   charging   Pierre   with\n\npossessing with intent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine\n\non or about July 2, 2000.            A forfeiture count sought criminal\n\nforfeiture of the proceeds of the conspiracy, including $500,000\n\nand five pieces of jewelry. Mickens pled guilty, while Pierre went\n\nto trial.    After a two-week trial in December 2003, a jury found\n\nPierre guilty of the possession count, but found that the quantity\n\nof drugs was less than 500 grams.           The jury was unable to reach a\n\nverdict on the conspiracy count.         The conspiracy count was retried\n\nin April and May 2004, and a jury found Pierre guilty of the\n\nconspiracy count.       In a special verdict form as to the forfeiture\n\nallegation, the jury found that at least $500,000 and a pair of\n\ndiamond earrings were proceeds of the drug conspiracy.\n\n            The facts in evidence at the 2004 conspiracy trial fairly\n\nestablish the following.\n\n            Pierre ran a drug business in Fall River from at least\n\nApril 1998 to September 2001.          During that time, Pierre obtained\n\ncocaine from a source in Brockton.          He would then cook some of the\n\ncocaine into crack, and he would sell both crack and powder cocaine\n\nto customers in Fall River and New Bedford.           Pierre did not have a\n\ndriver's license, so he employed people to drive him back and forth\n\n                                      -3-\n\fto   Brockton   and   around   Fall   River.   In   particular,   Mickens\n\ntestified at trial that she chauffeured Pierre, in addition to\n\ntransporting drugs, collecting money, and selling crack for him.\n\nAt the height of her involvement, Mickens made retail sales of up\n\nto $3000 worth of crack per night at Fall River bars and collected\n\nat least $1000 twice a week from Pierre's wholesale customers.\n\nAmong Pierre's biggest wholesale customers were members of the 504\n\nBoyz, a gang that sold crack around the Fifth Street area of Fall\n\nRiver.1\n\n           Mickens testified that Pierre used the proceeds of his\n\ndrug operation to buy more drugs, to pay his living expenses and\n\nthose of Mickens and the mother of his children, and to buy luxury\n\nitems like expensive clothes and jewelry.           In addition, Pierre\n\nobtained at least seven cars for use in his drug business, all of\n\nwhich he registered to other people.           Mickens's testimony was\n\ncorroborated by motel, bank, and motor vehicle records, and by the\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Two members of the 504 Boyz testified at the 2003 trial.\nOne member -- Nathaniel Fernandes -- testified on behalf of the\ngovernment and offered evidence about the quantities of drugs that\nPierre sold to the 504 Boyz. Another member -- Henry Sanders --\nwas the sole witness for Pierre. On direct examination, Sanders\ntestified about a source other than Pierre who supplied drugs to\nthe 504 Boyz. On cross-examination, however, Sanders acknowledged\nthat he had met Pierre many times when Pierre had come through the\nFifth Street area to drop off drugs, and he also testified that\nfrom 1998 to 2001 Pierre was Fernandes's main source of supply.\nNone of the 504 Boyz testified at the 2004 conspiracy trial.\n\n                                      -4-\n\ftestimony of Paula Costa, who bought crack from Pierre, and Fall\n\nRiver police officers.\n\n                          II.    Trial Error Claims\n\n              Pierre raises three claims of trial error and argues that\n\neach of the errors entitles him to a new trial.                 First, Pierre\n\nargues    that    the    district     court    constructively    amended    the\n\nindictment by admitting evidence of offenses not charged therein.\n\nNext,    he   argues    that    in   failing   to   suppress   evidence    of   a\n\nparticular drug seizure, the district court admitted evidence that\n\nviolated Pierre's Fourth Amendment rights and that was unduly\n\nprejudicial and irrelevant.             Finally, Pierre argues that the\n\ndistrict court impermissibly admitted prior bad acts evidence.\n\nA.            Constructive Amendment of the Indictment\n\n              At both of Pierre's trials, Mickens and several Fall\n\nRiver police officers testified to an incident on April 14, 1998 at\n\nthe Old Colony apartment complex, where Pierre then resided.\n\nDetective Michael Boutin testified that on that date he discovered\n\na bag containing cocaine, a scale, and a bottle of inositol (a\n\nsubstance used to cut cocaine and crack) hidden behind a ceiling\n\npanel in the hallway of an Old Colony building.                 He and other\n\nofficers seized the items in the bag, replaced them with similar-\n\nlooking items, and returned the bag to its hiding place.\n\n              The police officers then established surveillance at the\n\nsite.    Officer Scott Paul testified that he saw Pierre emerge from\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fhis apartment with a small step-ladder.     Officer Alan Beausoliel\n\ntestified that he saw Pierre approach the location of the hidden\n\nitems.   Although he could hear the ladder and ceiling tile being\n\nmoved, Officer Beausoliel did not observe Pierre remove the bag\n\nfrom the ceiling.    Officer Paul observed Pierre returning to his\n\napartment with the step-ladder.    He then heard a thud and running.\n\nOther officers spotted Pierre running out of the building and\n\nfleeing in a car.   A fingerprint lifted from the bottle of inositol\n\nlater was matched to Pierre.\n\n          Mickens corroborated this account.     She testified that\n\nPierre had told her that he had hidden cocaine and a scale in the\n\nceiling of the building, and that when he returned to retrieve it,\n\nhe noticed that a switch had been made.   When he heard a noise and\n\nsaw police, Pierre had run out of the building and fled in a car\n\ndriven by an associate named Kennisen.\n\n          In addition, Detective Steven Washington testified that\n\nwithin the two weeks before the Old Colony incident he and two\n\nother officers had observed Pierre meeting with another individual\n\nby the name of Noel Lukenson.2      The officers initially observed\n\nLukenson and Pierre talking in a car parked on the street.   Pierre\n\nthen left, and after entering and exiting a nearby building,\n\n\n\n     2\n          There seems to be some confusion over whether the\nindividual's name is Noel Lukenson or Lukenson Noel. We refer to\nhim hereafter as Lukenson.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fLukenson began crawling on the ground, took up a divot of grass,\n\nand removed a large white bag from underneath the divot.                   Lukenson\n\nthen drove to Old Colony, picked up Pierre, and drove to two Fall\n\nRiver bars.    At the first bar, a person entered the car and left\n\nwithin approximately two minutes.             At the second bar, the officers\n\nobserved Pierre meeting with another man; the man handed Pierre\n\nmoney, and Pierre then put his hand to his mouth, shook the other\n\nman's hand, and left.\n\n            Pierre argues that these two incidents were unrelated to\n\nthe conspiracy charged in the indictment, and that by permitting\n\ntestimony about them, the district court constructively amended the\n\nindictment.        He   argues   that     the   indictment       charged    only   a\n\nconspiracy between Pierre, Mickens, and the 504 Boyz.                      Pierre's\n\nposition is that his supposed conspiracy with Mickens and the 504\n\nBoyz had nothing to do with the Old Colony incident or with any\n\nagreement he might have had with Lukenson.                    Rather, he argues,\n\nthese   incidents       were   evidence    of    an       independent,   uncharged\n\nconspiracy. In particular, he emphasizes that Mickens did not know\n\nLukenson, and that there was no evidence connecting the 504 Boyz to\n\nLukenson.     He    argues     that   there     is    a    possibility   that   his\n\nconviction \"rests upon an offense not charged by the grand jury,\"\n\nand that as a result he is entitled to reversal of his conviction.\n\nUnited States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f           The government argues that Pierre has not preserved his\n\nconstructive amendment claim, and that our review is only for plain\n\nerror.   See United States v. DeCicco, 439 F.3d 36, 44-45 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   We bypass the forfeiture issue and rule on the merits.\n\n           Constructive amendment of an indictment is prohibited in\n\norder \"to preserve the right of the person accused of a[] . . .\n\ncrime to have a grand jury vote on an indictment, to prevent\n\nreprosecution for the same offense, and to protect the right of the\n\naccused to be informed of the charges.\" United States v. Vavlitis,\n\n9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir. 1993).    \"A constructive amendment occurs\n\nwhen the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either\n\nliterally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand\n\njury has last passed upon them.\"     United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d\n\n456, 462 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Dunn, 758 F.2d at 35) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    When the facts proved at trial differ\n\nfrom those alleged in the indictment, the indictment has been\n\nconstructively amended.     Id.    Constructive amendment is per se\n\nprejudicial and is grounds for reversal of a conviction. Dunn, 758\n\nF.2d at 35.\n\n           The second superceding indictment charged that\n\n           [f]rom a time unknown to the Grand Jury, but\n           at least by in or about April of 1998, and\n           continuing thereafter until September of 2001,\n           in   the   District   of   Massachusetts   and\n           elsewhere, . . . PIERRE . . . did knowingly\n           and intentionally conspire and agree with\n           [Mickens and] others known and unknown to the\n           Grand Jury[] to distribute 50 grams or more of\n\n                                  -8-\n\f           a mixture or substance which contains a\n           detectable amount of cocaine base, also known\n           as \"crack,\" and to distribute more than 500\n           grams of cocaine.\n\nThe plain language of the indictment encompasses the Old Colony\n\nincident and the activities with Lukenson, which took place in\n\nApril 1998.      See id. at 37.            It does not limit the charged\n\nconspiracy to the 504 Boyz.           Further, evidence of the Lukenson\n\nincident   was   presented      to   the   Grand   Jury     that      returned   the\n\nindictment.\n\n           We find no support in the record for Pierre's argument\n\nthat the government's \"primary theory of the case was that Pierre\n\nand Mickens conspired together and with the 504 Boyz to distribute\n\ncocaine,\" or his contention that the government switched theories\n\nin the 2004 trial.      The government presented the Lukenson evidence\n\nto the Grand Jury and the Old Colony evidence at the 2003 trial.\n\nThe prosecution theory all along was that Pierre conspired with\n\nmany people, including Lukenson and women other than Mickens.\n\n           Nor   did    the    evidence     presented     at    the    2004   trial\n\nnecessarily show two distinct conspiracies, as Pierre argues.\n\nContrary to Pierre's suggestion, there is no requirement that all\n\nof the participants in a conspiracy know or even know of one\n\nanother.   United States v. Fenton, 367 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThe test for determining whether a single agreement existed among\n\nco-conspirators    is    a    pragmatic    one,    taking      into    account   the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.         Id.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f          The evidence at the 2004 trial showed continuity between\n\nthe two time periods at issue -- April 1998, when the Lukenson and\n\nOld Colony events took place, and the summer of 1999, when Mickens\n\nbegan a relationship with Pierre.    See United States v. David, 940\n\nF.2d 722, 734 (1st Cir. 1991).    Mickens testified that Pierre told\n\nher about the Old Colony incident, and that he told her he fled in\n\na car driven by a man named Kennisen.      She testified that she knew\n\nKennisen because Pierre regularly directed her to collect money\n\nfrom him and because she frequently drove Pierre to New Bedford to\n\nmeet with Kennisen.3   Likewise, Mickens testified that when she\n\narrived in Fall River in 1998, Pierre had an ongoing relationship\n\nwith the 504 Boyz.\n\n          The evidence also showed that Pierre's business operated\n\nin the same way and to the same end in April 1998 as it did during\n\nMickens's later involvement.     See id.   The Old Colony and Lukenson\n\nevidence demonstrated that in April 1998 Pierre used other people\n\nto drive him around, hid his drugs in public spaces and outdoors,\n\ncut his drugs with inositol, and sold his drugs at Fall River bars.\n\nMickens's testimony was that during the time she was involved with\n\nPierre's business, he used other people to drive him around, often\n\n\n     3\n          There was testimony suggesting that Pierre fled in\nLukenson's car, although no one observed the driver of the car.\n\"Lukenson\" and \"Kennisen\" are phonetically similar, and it is\npossible that the two names refer to the same person. Regardless,\nMickens's testimony was that she knew the person who drove the car\nfrom the Old Colony incident, and that he was still involved when\nshe joined the drug operation.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fhid his drugs outdoors in holes in the ground, cut his drugs with\n\ninositol, and sold his drugs at Fall River bars.\n\n          The facts proved at trial were more than adequate to\n\nprove one ongoing conspiracy, with Pierre at the center.       See\n\nFenton, 367 F.3d at 19-20.   There was no constructive amendment.\n\nDunn, 758 F.2d at 38; see also United States v. Kelly, 722 F.2d\n\n873, 876 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\nB.        Drug Seizure Evidence\n\n          On February 21, 2001, Pierre was driving in a convenience\n\nstore parking lot when he was stopped by Fall River Police Officer\n\nDavid Murphy.   Officer Murphy later testified that he stopped\n\nPierre because he \"was aware at the time [that Pierre] did not have\n\nan active license.\"   After confirming that Pierre's license had\n\nbeen suspended, Officer Murphy arrested Pierre for driving with a\n\nsuspended license.    Pierre was taken to the Fall River Police\n\nDepartment where he was searched as part of the booking process.\n\nDuring the search, police officers recovered cocaine from Pierre's\n\npocket.\n\n          Pierre filed a motion to suppress the February 21 traffic\n\nstop evidence, arguing that Officer Murphy did not have reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop Pierre.    The district court denied the motion\n\nafter an evidentiary hearing.     The court found that Pierre had\n\nreasonable suspicion to stop Pierre for driving without a license.\n\nThe cocaine seized during the traffic stop was admitted at both the\n\n                                -11-\n\f2003 and 2004 trials.      Pierre argues that the information on which\n\nOfficer   Murphy   based    the   traffic   stop    was   stale,   and    that\n\nintroduction of the seized cocaine therefore violated his Fourth\n\nAmendment rights.\n\n            We review the district court's ultimate determination of\n\nreasonable suspicion on a motion to suppress de novo.                United\n\nStates v. Capelton, 350 F.3d 231, 240 (1st Cir. 2003).             We review\n\nsubsidiary factual findings for clear error.           Id.\n\n            A traffic stop constitutes a seizure within the meaning\n\nof the Fourth Amendment.      United States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).    As a result, \"the stop must be supported by a\n\nreasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity.\"                Id.\n\nat 6.   Reasonable suspicion requires more than a naked hunch that\n\ncriminal activity is afoot, but less than probable cause.           Id.    Its\n\nexistence is assessed on a case-by-case basis, in light of all the\n\nattendant   circumstances.        Id.     When   evaluating   a    claim    of\n\nstaleness, courts do not measure the timeliness of information\n\nsimply by counting the number of days that have elapsed.              United\n\nStates v. Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d 937, 940 (1st Cir. 1992), abrogated\n\non other grounds by Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12 (2000).\n\nRather, a court must assess the nature of the information, the\n\nnature and characteristics of the suspected criminal activity, and\n\nthe likely endurance of the information.           Cf. id.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f          At the suppression hearing, Officer Murphy testified that\n\nfrom September 1999 to September 2000 he had worked in the vice and\n\nintelligence unit of the Fall River Police Department. During that\n\ntime, Pierre's name came up often in conversation; fellow officers\n\nfrequently discussed his drug dealing, and Officer Murphy was\n\ninformed that Pierre did not have an active license.                    Officer\n\nMurphy testified that after he left the vice unit, he continued to\n\ntalk with detectives there regarding Pierre, and no one ever\n\ninformed him that Pierre's license status had changed.\n\n          Pierre relies on United States v. Laughrin, 438 F.3d 1245\n\n(10th Cir. 2006), a Tenth Circuit case, to argue that Officer\n\nMurphy's information (from the time he served in the vice unit) was\n\nso old as to be meaningless, and therefore could not justify a\n\ntraffic stop.     Laughrin, however, is distinguishable.                In that\n\ncase, a police officer had stopped the defendant based on his\n\nknowledge,    which   was    at   least    twenty-two    weeks   old,   of    the\n\ndefendant's    driving      record.       Id.   at   1246-47.    The    officer\n\npreviously had stopped the defendant when he was driving on a\n\nsuspended license, but the court noted that there was no indication\n\nfrom the officer's testimony about the length of the license\n\nsuspension.    Id. at 1248.       The court stated that if there had been\n\ntestimony about the length of the suspension, the court might have\n\nbeen able to affirm the finding of reasonable suspicion.                Id.   In\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fthe absence of such testimony, however, it held that the officer's\n\ninformation was too stale to justify the stop.    Id.\n\n          Here,   however,   Officer    Murphy   offered   testimony\n\nindicating that Pierre's license had been suspended during the\n\nentire year that Officer Murphy had served in the vice unit.    This\n\ntestimony suggests that Pierre's license was suspended on an\n\nongoing basis, rather than for a short period of time, making the\n\nsuspicion that it was still inactive some five months later more\n\nreasonable.   Moreover, Officer Murphy testified that he kept in\n\ntouch with some of the detectives in the vice unit, and that none\n\nof those detectives ever informed him during conversations about\n\nPierre of any change in Pierre's license status.    Although he did\n\nnot explicitly state as much, the import of Officer Murphy's\n\ntestimony was that because Pierre's license status was relevant to\n\nfuture investigations and cases, he would have expected someone to\n\nhave informed him if Pierre's license status had changed.    We hold\n\nthat Officer Murphy had reasonable suspicion to stop Pierre's car,\n\nand that the district court did not err in failing to suppress the\n\ncocaine seized incident to Pierre's arrest.\n\n          Pierre cursorily states that the February 21 evidence was\n\nirrelevant and unduly prejudicial.     See Fed. R. Evid. 403.   This\n\nargument has been waived, see United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fwaived.\"), and is without merit in any event. Evidence that Pierre\n\nwas driving without a license served to corroborate Mickens's\n\ntestimony that Pierre did not have a license and employed people to\n\ndrive him around.     Likewise, evidence that Pierre was carrying\n\ncocaine when he was stopped in February 2001 is directly relevant\n\nto his participation in a drug distribution conspiracy between\n\nApril 1998 and September 2001.\n\nC.        Prior Bad Acts Evidence\n\n          Pierre argues that the Old Colony, Lukenson, and February\n\n21 traffic stop testimony should not have been admitted because it\n\nwas evidence of prior bad acts.      See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b); id. 403.\n\nHe also argues that during the 2003 trial, Officer Alan Correiro,\n\nwho appeared on behalf of the government, testified about an\n\nuncharged shooting \"in an attempt to prejudice the jury concerning\n\nthe character of Pierre.\"     The district court's determination that\n\nevidence is not precluded by Federal Rules of Evidence 403 or\n\n404(b) is reviewed for abuse of discretion.           United States v.\n\nFrankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          Our    conclusion   that   the   Old   Colony,   Lukenson,   and\n\nFebruary 21 traffic stop evidence was proof of the conspiracy\n\ncharged in the indictment defeats the prior bad acts argument as to\n\nthat evidence.    See United States v. Arboleda, 929 F.2d 858, 866\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).      Moreover, none of this evidence was unduly\n\nprejudicial.    See id. at 866-67.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f            As to the Correiro testimony, it was a minor issue that\n\nwas fully remedied by the district court.                   Correiro was called to\n\ntestify about drug-related statements that Pierre made to him in\n\nOctober 2000.         When questioned about an omission in his report,\n\nCorreiro explained that the initial report was not about drugs\n\nbecause the investigation was of \"a shooting incident.\"                       Defense\n\ncounsel objected, and the district court instructed the jury to\n\ndisregard the answer.         During cross-examination, Correiro again\n\nreferred to the incident and stated that charges had been brought\n\nagainst Pierre.        Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial, which\n\nthe district court denied, and the court instructed the jury more\n\nforcefully that the shooting incident had nothing to do with the\n\ncase   before    them,    that     the   charges       against     Pierre   had   been\n\ndismissed, and that they should not think or talk about the\n\nincident.       \"We    normally    presume      that    a   jury    will    follow   an\n\ninstruction     to     disregard    inadmissible         evidence     inadvertently\n\npresented to it.\"        Greer v. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 766 n.8 (1987).\n\nOnly if there is an overwhelming probability that the jury could\n\nnot have followed the instruction and a strong likelihood that the\n\nevidence was devastating to the defendant will we assume otherwise.\n\nId.    This is not such a case.\n\n                       III.   Forfeiture-Related Claim\n\n            Pierre argues that the forfeiture order was error because\n\nthe government failed to demonstrate that he earned $500,000 as a\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fresult of the conspiracy for which he was convicted.                  He further\n\nargues that the government was improperly permitted to seize\n\nsubstitute assets prior to the 2003 trial.\n\n\n\nA.          Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Following the guilty verdict at the 2004 trial, the jury\n\nreturned a special verdict in which it found that at least $500,000\n\nand a pair of diamond earrings seized by the government were\n\n\"derived,   directly    or   indirectly,\"       from    the    conspiracy.4       A\n\nforfeiture verdict must be supported by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.   United States v. Keene, 341 F.3d 78, 86 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nUnited States v. Rogers, 102 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996).                     We\n\nhave no problem finding a sufficient evidentiary basis for the\n\njury's verdict here.\n\n            The evidence in support of the forfeiture verdict at the\n\n2004 trial included Mickens's testimony, as well as several records\n\ndocumenting expenditures by Pierre.             Mickens testified that from\n\nthe time she moved to Fall River in 1998 until she developed a\n\nrelationship   with    Pierre      the    following    year,   she   saw   Pierre\n\nexchanging money with others in various locations.                   She further\n\ntestified that during the period of her involvement with Pierre --\n\nfrom summer 1999 until her arrest in September 2001 -- Pierre\n\n\n\n     4\n            Pierre    does   not    contest     the    forfeitability      of   the\nearrings.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fadmitted to her that he had been in the drug business for years,\n\nand she observed Pierre regularly obtain cocaine from a source in\n\nBrockton and sell crack to customers in Fall River and New Bedford.\n\nMickens testified that she drove Pierre to his source in Brockton\n\n\"[q]uite a bit,\" \"once a week, twice a week, sometimes more,\" and\n\nthat she drove Pierre around Fall River \"[j]ust about every day\" so\n\nthat he could \"collect money or drop off ounces.\"         She also\n\ntestified that she sold crack for Pierre, and at the height of her\n\ninvolvement she sold up to $3000 worth of crack per night; she\n\nfurther indicated that if Pierre did not need her to drive him\n\naround, she \"was in the bar [selling drugs] from the time they\n\nopened, all day.\"   Mickens also stated that she collected at least\n\n$1000 two times per week from Pierre's biggest wholesale customers,\n\nand that Pierre also collected money from them.    Finally, Mickens\n\ntestified that she observed Pierre cook up part of a half-kilogram\n\nof cocaine that he had obtained in Florida.\n\n          The documentary evidence presented by the government\n\nshowed that during the course of the conspiracy Pierre spent over\n\n$6000 on motel rooms, over $22,000 on cars, and deposited and\n\nwithdrew nearly $40,000 from a bank account.      He also spent at\n\nleast $4700 on jewelry.   Finally, he paid the living expenses of\n\nMickens, totaling over $12,000 per year, and the expenses of his\n\nchildren and their mother.     Mickens testified that Pierre had no\n\njob other than drug dealing.    At the time Mickens met Pierre, he\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fdid have a used car lot, but Mickens testified that he used the car\n\nlot to deal drugs and sold only one or two cars before getting rid\n\nof the lot a couple of months after she had met him.\n\n             Although   one    cannot,   based   on   this   testimony   and\n\ndocumentary evidence, tally specific amounts to arrive at $500,000,\n\nthe government may satisfy its burden of proof by either direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence.        United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271,\n\n1299 (1st Cir. 1996).         From the time of her involvement in 1999,\n\nMickens estimated that she earned or collected between $3400 and\n\nover $20,000 per week in drug money for Pierre.              The jury could\n\neasily have inferred from the evidence presented that on average\n\nPierre sold at least $3000 worth of cocaine or crack each week over\n\nthe life of the conspiracy.       Such an inference supports the jury's\n\nfinding that $500,000 was forfeitable.\n\nB.           Substitute Assets\n\n             When Pierre was arrested, the government seized from him\n\nvarious pieces of jewelry -- including a watch, necklace, ring,\n\nbracelet, and earrings -- subsequently valued at over $60,000.            It\n\nthen began administrative forfeiture proceedings, but when Pierre\n\nfiled a motion contesting the forfeiture, the government abandoned\n\nthe claim.    Pierre's motion also requested immediate return of the\n\njewelry, but the government refused to return the jewelry to\n\nPierre, stating that it was evidence of criminal activity.               See\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) (providing that the district court \"may\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fimpose reasonable conditions to protect access to [seized] property\n\nand its use in later proceedings\"). The district court agreed that\n\nthe government was permitted to retain possession of the jewelry as\n\nevidence and denied Pierre's motion requesting return of the\n\njewelry.\n\n           On September 24, 2003, the government obtained a second\n\nsuperceding   indictment   that    included   a    forfeiture   allegation\n\nspecifying the seized jewelry and $500,000 as forfeitable.            At the\n\n2003 trial, Fernandes testified that Pierre had spent money on gold\n\nchains and a jeweled bracelet, and the government offered the\n\njewelry into evidence without objection.          Prior to the 2004 trial,\n\nhowever,   Pierre   challenged    the   admissibility    of   the   jewelry,\n\narguing that the government was unable to tie it to the alleged\n\nconspiracy.   The district court granted Pierre's motion to exclude\n\nthe jewelry from the 2004 trial, except for the pair of earrings,\n\nwhich Mickens testified Pierre purchased for himself during their\n\nrelationship. Defense counsel then took possession of the excluded\n\njewelry.\n\n           After the jury in the 2004 trial returned a special\n\nverdict finding that $500,000 and the earrings were forfeitable,\n\nthe district court entered a preliminary order forfeiting the\n\nearrings and the other four pieces of jewelry as substitute assets,\n\n21 U.S.C. § 853(p), since the government was unable to locate the\n\n$500,000 specified in the special verdict.           See United States v.\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fHall, 434 F.3d 42, 58 n.7 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Substitute property may\n\nbe seized by the government to satisfy a forfeiture order where, by\n\nan act or omission, the defendant has prevented the government from\n\ntracing his illegally obtained assets.\").           Nine months later, the\n\ndistrict court entered a final order of forfeiture, forfeiting the\n\nearrings and the substitute assets.\n\n            Pierre does not object to the forfeiture of the four\n\npieces of jewelry as substitute assets, but rather to the district\n\ncourt's having permitted the government to retain possession of\n\nthem prior to the 2003 trial.         As a remedy, he seeks to have the\n\njewelry (or its monetary equivalent) returned to him now.                    We\n\nreview the district court's interpretation of Rule 41(g) de novo.\n\nSee United States v. Dean, 100 F.3d 19, 20 (5th Cir. 1996).                 The\n\ndistrict    court's    factual    determination     that   the   jewelry   had\n\nevidentiary value to the government is reviewed for clear error.\n\nSee id.\n\n            Rule 41(g) provides that \"[a] person aggrieved . . . by\n\nthe deprivation of property may move [the district court] for the\n\nproperty's return.\"         Once seized property is no longer needed as\n\nevidence, a criminal defendant is presumed to have the right to its\n\nreturn.    See Dean, 100 F.3d at 20; United States v. Mills, 991 F.2d\n\n609, 612 (9th Cir. 1993).          However, \"[a] Rule 41[(g)] motion is\n\nproperly    denied    'if   the   defendant   is   not   entitled   to   lawful\n\npossession of the seized property, the property is contraband or\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fsubject to forfeiture[,] or the government's need for the property\n\nas evidence continues.'\"     Mills, 991 F.2d at 612 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Van Cauwenberghe, 934 F.2d 1048, 1061 (9th Cir. 1991));\n\nsee also United States v. Saunders, 957 F.2d 1488, 1495 (8th Cir.\n\n1992) (holding that \"[t]he motion for the return of the paperwork,\n\neven papers that were not introduced at trial, was premature\n\nbecause   defendant's   direct   appeal    was   still    pending\");     Van\n\nCauwenberghe, 934 F.2d at 1061 (holding that a defendant's motion\n\nfor the return of property may be denied based on the government's\n\nneed for the property as evidence).\n\n           The   district   court's   finding    that    the   jewelry   had\n\nevidentiary value to the government was not clearly erroneous. The\n\ngovernment introduced the seized jewelry into evidence at the 2003\n\ntrial and presented testimony attempting to link the jewelry to the\n\nproceeds of the charged conspiracy.       Once it became clear that the\n\ngovernment's evidence on this point was not particularly strong,\n\nthe district court granted Pierre's motion to exclude four pieces\n\nof the jewelry, and defense counsel took possession of those pieces\n\nat that time.\n\n           Moreover, even if the district court's order permitting\n\nthe government to retain possession of the jewelry before the 2003\n\ntrial was in error, Pierre still would not be entitled to return of\n\nthe jewelry now.   An illegal seizure of property does not immunize\n\nit from forfeiture as long as the government can sustain the\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fforfeiture claim with independent evidence.                           United States v.\n\nRogers, 102 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting a claim that\n\nproperty illegally seized by law enforcement officers was not\n\nforfeitable). The cases cited by Pierre in support of his argument\n\nthat   the   jewelry       must    be   returned      do   not    suggest    otherwise.\n\nRather, the remedy in each of those cases was to affirm the denial\n\nof or vacate the grant of a pre-trial restraining order as to\n\nsubstitute assets.          United States v. Gotti, 155 F.3d 144, 146, 150\n\n(2d Cir. 1998); United States v. Field, 62 F.3d 246, 247-48, 250\n\n(8th Cir. 1995); In re Assets of Martin, 1 F.3d 1351, 1354, 1362\n\n(3d Cir. 1993); United States v. Floyd, 992 F.2d 498, 498-99 (5th\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n             The forfeiture of the jewelry was not erroneous.\n\n                           IV.    Sentencing Error Claims\n\n             Pierre raises four claims of sentencing error. He argues\n\nthat the district court improperly calculated his base offense\n\nlevel with respect to drug quantity and improperly applied a four-\n\nlevel enhancement for leadership of extensive criminal activity.\n\nHe also argues that his sentence on the conspiracy count is\n\nunreasonable    as     a    matter      of   law    because   of      disparities   with\n\nsentences     imposed       on    other      participants        in   the   conspiracy.\n\nFinally, he argues that his sentence on the possession count is\n\nunreasonable because it exceeds the Guidelines range (although not\n\nthe statutory maximum) for that count.\n\n\n                                             -23-\n\f            We review de novo sentencing issues involving questions\n\nof law.     United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).      We   review     the   district    court's   determination    of   the\n\nreliability of sentencing information for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Luciano, 414 F.3d 174, 180 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nFactual determinations are reviewed for clear error.              Id.\n\nA.          Drug Quantity\n\n            At sentencing, the district court found that Pierre was\n\nresponsible for 1.5 kilograms or more of cocaine base, and that the\n\nappropriate base offense level therefore was 38.                Pierre argues\n\nthat this finding was unsupported by either of the jury verdicts\n\n(one of which found that he did not, on a particular occasion,\n\npossess 500 or more grams of cocaine but rather possessed a lesser\n\namount, and one of which found that he was responsible over the\n\ncourse of the conspiracy for 50 grams or more of crack and 500\n\ngrams or more of powder cocaine), and that it therefore infringed\n\non his Fifth Amendment due process and Sixth Amendment jury trial\n\nrights.\n\n            Our prior caselaw forecloses any such argument.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"Since Booker we have made it clear that the district courts may\n\nmake     drug    quantity     determinations      for    sentencing     purposes\n\n. . . .\"); United States v. Pérez-Ruiz, 421 F.3d 11, 14-15 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (rejecting the claim that \"the district judge violated\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fthe Sixth Amendment by himself making the determinations as to drug\n\nquantity and other enhancements\").\n\n            To the extent Pierre argues that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to support the district court's drug quantity finding,5\n\nthe argument fails.      At Pierre's first trial, in 2003, Fernandes\n\ntestified that Pierre supplied the 504 Boyz with half a kilogram of\n\ncrack every month for two years.           At the sentencing hearing, the\n\ndistrict court specifically commented on Fernandes's credibility\n\nand concluded that he was \"credible in [his] testimony about the\n\ndrug quantity.\" This credibility determination was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, see Luciano, 414 F.3d at 180, and Fernandes's testimony\n\namply supports the court's drug quantity finding.                There was thus\n\nno clear error in the district court's drug quantity determination.\n\nSee id.\n\nB.          Leadership Enhancement\n\n            Pierre makes similar objections to the district court's\n\nimposition of a four-level enhancement for leadership of extensive\n\ncriminal    activity.     He    argues     first    that    no    jury   verdict\n\nestablished that he was \"an organizer or leader of a criminal\n\nactivity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise\n\nextensive,\"   U.S.S.G.    §    3B1.1(a),    and    that    imposition    of   the\n\nenhancement therefore was improper.               He next argues that the\n\n\n\n     5\n            It is not at all clear that Pierre makes any such\nargument.    See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n                                    -25-\n\fevidence was insufficient to establish that he was a leader of\n\nextensive   criminal   activity,    even   by   a    preponderance   of   the\n\nevidence.\n\n            There is no requirement that the jury find that the\n\nleadership enhancement applies.          \"Under the advisory guidelines\n\nregime,   the   district   court   can   use   the   preponderance   of   the\n\nevidence standard to determine whether an enhancement applies.\"\n\nUnited States v. Holliday, 457 F.3d 121, 130 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            We review the district court's \"factbound\" determination\n\nthat Pierre was a leader for clear error.                United States v.\n\nVentura, 353 F.3d 84, 89 (1st Cir. 2003).              The district court\n\nstated that it based its determination that Pierre was a leader of\n\nextensive criminal activity on \"the number of people involved, the\n\nnumber of places in which drugs were sold, . . . the fact that\n\ndrugs were sold both at the wholesale level and at the retail\n\nlevel, . . . and at the center of all this is Mr. Pierre.\"                The\n\ndistrict court also mentioned the quantity of drugs involved and\n\nthe period of time over which the drug business extended as factors\n\ncontributing to its conclusion.      The record bears out the district\n\ncourt's conclusion. There was testimony that a number of different\n\npeople assisted Pierre with his drug operations; that Pierre made\n\nwholesale drug sales to groups like the 504 Boyz, as well as retail\n\nsales at bars in and around Fall River; that Pierre's business\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\finvolved significant quantities of drugs; and that it extended over\n\na period of at least three years.\n\n             The    district    court's    application      of   the   leadership\n\nenhancement thus was not clearly erroneous.              See United States v.\n\nColón-Muñoz, 318 F.3d 348, 364 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that the\n\nextent of criminal activity within the meaning of U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1\n\nis assessed based on \"the totality of the circumstances, including\n\nnot only the number of participants but also the width, breadth,\n\nscope, complexity, and duration of the scheme\" (quoting United\n\nStates v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 1991)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\nC.           Reasonableness\n\n             Pierre    argues    that     his   432-month    sentence     on   the\n\nconspiracy count is unreasonable as a matter of law.6                  See United\n\nStates v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en\n\nbanc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 928 (2007); see also 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a).    He bases this argument on the fact that his sentence is\n\nover three times as long as that imposed on any other member of the\n\nconspiracy.        He makes a related argument that the district court\n\nfailed to explain adequately the reasons why his sentence is so\n\nmuch longer than his co-conspirators' sentences.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          The district court calculated Pierre's Guidelines range\non the conspiracy count to be 360 months to life.\n\n                                        -27-\n\f            Pierre fails to present us with any evidence that he is\n\nsimilarly situated to other members of the conspiracy and so\n\ntherefore arguably should have received a comparable sentence. Our\n\nreview of the evidence indicates quite the contrary -- that Pierre\n\nwas not similarly situated to other members of the conspiracy. For\n\nexample, Pierre is not similarly situated to Mickens, who reported\n\nto and took orders from Pierre. Mickens testified that Pierre beat\n\nher on a number of occasions, that he threatened to kill her, and\n\nthat he forced her to have sex with other men while he watched.\n\nLikewise,    Pierre's   criminal   history    included    incidents   that\n\ndistinguished him from his co-conspirators.        Pierre's pre-sentence\n\nreport,     which   included   information     from   the     grand   jury\n\ninvestigation that had been excluded at trial, stated that Pierre\n\npreviously had been convicted of threatening to kill a former\n\ngirlfriend and \"cut up her face and dump her body.\"         Moreover, both\n\nMickens   and   Fernandes   pled   guilty    and   provided   substantial\n\nassistance to the government.         A defendant's sentence is not\n\n\"unreasonable simply because his co-defendants agreed to help the\n\ngovernment in exchange for reduced sentences.\"           United States v.\n\nVázquez-Rivera, 470 F.3d 443, 449 (1st Cir. 2006); see also United\n\nStates v. Saez, 444 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127\n\nS. Ct. 224 (2006).       Finally, all of the participants in the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fconspiracy except for Mickens were sentenced by a different judge\n\nfrom the one who sentenced Pierre.7    See Saez, 444 F.3d at 19.\n\n           The district court explained its reasons for imposing the\n\nsentence   that   it   did.     The    court   repeatedly   expressed\n\ndisappointment that Pierre, in his statement to the court, refused\n\nto take any responsibility for the situation in which he found\n\nhimself and failed to express any remorse for his actions.     In its\n\nStatement of Reasons, the court wrote that it viewed Pierre as \"an\n\nunrepentant and dangerous dealer in illicit drugs and firearms.\"\n\nIt explained that it found a sentence of 432 months \"sufficient to\n\npunish [Pierre] and to deter him and others from similar conduct,\"\n\nwhile still preserving the possibility that Pierre would \"have some\n\nperiod of freedom in the sunset of his life.\"\n\n           Although the district court did not explicitly state why\n\nit imposed on Pierre a sentence much more substantial than those\n\nreceived by other members of the conspiracy, we can infer its\n\nreasoning \"by comparing what was argued by the parties . . . with\n\nwhat the [court] did.\"   Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519.      Pierre\n\nargued in his sentencing memorandum and at his sentencing hearing\n\nthat he should receive a sentence no greater than that imposed on\n\n\n\n     7\n          We further note that Congress's aim in enacting 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(a)(6), which directs the sentencing court to consider \"the\nneed to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants\nwith similar records who have been found guilty of similar\nconduct,\" \"almost certainly\" was to reduce unwarranted disparities\nin sentencing on a national level. Saez, 444 F.3d at 18.\n\n                                -29-\n\fhis co-conspirators.           The district court rejected this argument\n\nand, having found that Pierre was a dangerous and unrepentant\n\ncriminal, sentenced Pierre within the Guidelines range.\n\n                 Pierre's sentence on the conspiracy count is reasonable\n\nand is adequately explained.               See Saez, 444 F.3d at 17.\n\nD.               Sentence on Possession Count\n\n                 Because    Pierre    was    sentenced    to   serve    concurrent\n\nsentences,8 he was not prejudiced by any error he alleges with\n\nrespect to the possession count. See United States v. Ziskind, 471\n\nF.3d 266, 271 (1st Cir. 2006); see also United States v.

The conspiracy count was retried in 2004, and Pierre was convicted of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine and cocaine. Pierre's co-defendant and ex-girlfriend, Michelle Mickens, pled guilty and testified against Pierre at both trials. Pierre subsequently was sentenced to a 432-month term of imprisonment on the conspiracy charge, a 240-month term of imprisonment, which was to run concurrently, on the possession charge, and five years' supervised release. The district court also entered a final order of forfeiture for $500,000 against Pierre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre's appeal relates primarily to the 2004 conspiracy conviction and the accompanying sentence, although he does assign error to the introduction of certain evidence at both the 2003 and 2004 trials and to his sentence on the possession count. He also claims that the district court's forfeiture order was error. On appeal, we reject his myriad claims of error and affirm his convictions, his combined sentence, and the forfeiture order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre and Mickens were indicted on August 15, 2002 for conspiring to distribute cocaine base. On September 24, 2003, the grand jury returned a second superceding indictment charging Pierre and Mickens with conspiring with others, from at least April 1998 until September 2001, to distribute fifty or more grams of crack and 500 or more grams of cocaine, and charging Pierre with possessing with intent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine on or about July 2, 2000. A forfeiture count sought criminal forfeiture of the proceeds of the conspiracy, including $500,000 and five pieces of jewelry. Mickens pled guilty, while Pierre went to trial. After a two-week trial in December 2003, a jury found Pierre guilty of the possession count, but found that the quantity of drugs was less than 500 grams. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the conspiracy count. The conspiracy count was retried in April and May 2004, and a jury found Pierre guilty of the conspiracy count. In a special verdict form as to the forfeiture allegation, the jury found that at least $500,000 and a pair of diamond earrings were proceeds of the drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in evidence at the 2004 conspiracy trial fairly establish the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre ran a drug business in Fall River from at least April 1998 to September 2001. During that time, Pierre obtained cocaine from a source in Brockton. He would then cook some of the cocaine into crack, and he would sell both crack and powder cocaine to customers in Fall River and New Bedford. Pierre did not have a driver's license, so he employed people to drive him back and forth to Brockton and around Fall River. In particular, Mickens testified at trial that she chauffeured Pierre, in addition to transporting drugs, collecting money, and selling crack for him. At the height of her involvement, Mickens made retail sales of up to $3000 worth of crack per night at Fall River bars and collected at least $1000 twice a week from Pierre's wholesale customers. Among Pierre's biggest wholesale customers were members of the 504 Boyz, a gang that sold crack around the Fifth Street area of Fall River.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mickens testified that Pierre used the proceeds of his drug operation to buy more drugs, to pay his living expenses and those of Mickens and the mother of his children, and to buy luxury items like expensive clothes and jewelry. In addition, Pierre obtained at least seven cars for use in his drug business, all of which he registered to other people. Mickens's testimony was corroborated by motel, bank, and motor vehicle records, and by the testimony of Paula Costa, who bought crack from Pierre, and Fall River police officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Trial Error Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre raises three claims of trial error and argues that each of the errors entitles him to a new trial. First, Pierre argues that the district court constructively amended the indictment by admitting evidence of offenses not charged therein. Next, he argues that in failing to suppress evidence of a particular drug seizure, the district court admitted evidence that violated Pierre's Fourth Amendment rights and that was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant. Finally, Pierre argues that the district court impermissibly admitted prior bad acts evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Constructive Amendment of the Indictment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At both of Pierre's trials, Mickens and several Fall River police officers testified to an incident on April 14, 1998 at the Old Colony apartment complex, where Pierre then resided. Detective Michael Boutin testified that on that date he discovered a bag containing cocaine, a scale, and a bottle of inositol (a substance used to cut cocaine and crack) hidden behind a ceiling panel in the hallway of an Old Colony building. He and other officers seized the items in the bag, replaced them with similar-looking items, and returned the bag to its hiding place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police officers then established surveillance at the site. Officer Scott Paul testified that he saw Pierre emerge from his apartment with a small step-ladder. Officer Alan Beausoliel testified that he saw Pierre approach the location of the hidden items. Although he could hear the ladder and ceiling tile being moved, Officer Beausoliel did not observe Pierre remove the bag from the ceiling. Officer Paul observed Pierre returning to his apartment with the step-ladder. He then heard a thud and running. Other officers spotted Pierre running out of the building and fleeing in a car. A fingerprint lifted from the bottle of inositol later was matched to Pierre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mickens corroborated this account. She testified that Pierre had told her that he had hidden cocaine and a scale in the ceiling of the building, and that when he returned to retrieve it, he noticed that a switch had been made. When he heard a noise and saw police, Pierre had run out of the building and fled in a car driven by an associate named Kennisen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Detective Steven Washington testified that within the two weeks before the Old Colony incident he and two other officers had observed Pierre meeting with an individual by the name of Noel Lukenson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The officers initially observed Lukenson and Pierre talking in a car parked on the street. Pierre then left, and after entering and exiting a nearby building, Lukenson began crawling on the ground, took up a divot of grass, and removed a large white bag from underneath the divot. Lukenson then drove to Old Colony, picked up Pierre, and drove to two Fall River bars. At the first bar, a person entered the car and left within approximately two minutes. At the second bar, the officers observed Pierre meeting with another man; the man handed Pierre money, and Pierre then put his hand to his mouth, shook the other man's hand, and left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre argues that these two incidents were unrelated to the conspiracy charged in the indictment, and that by permitting testimony about them, the district court constructively amended the indictment. He argues that the indictment charged only a conspiracy between Pierre, Mickens, and the 504 Boyz. Pierre's position is that his supposed conspiracy with Mickens and the 504 Boyz had nothing to do with the Old Colony incident or with any agreement he might have had with Lukenson. Rather, he argues, these incidents were evidence of an independent, uncharged conspiracy. In particular, he emphasizes that Mickens did not know Lukenson, and that there was no evidence connecting the 504 Boyz to Lukenson. He argues that there is a possibility that his conviction \"rests upon an offense not charged by the grand jury,\" and that as a result he is entitled to reversal of his conviction. <i>United States v. Dunn,</i> 758 F.2d 30, 36 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Pierre has not preserved his constructive amendment claim, and that our review is only for plain error. <i>See United States v. DeCicco,</i> 439 F.3d 36, 44-45 (1st Cir.2006). We bypass the forfeiture issue and rule on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Constructive amendment of an indictment is prohibited in order \"to preserve the right of the person accused of a[ ] . . . crime to have a grand jury vote on an indictment, to prevent reprosecution for the same offense, and to protect the right of the accused to be informed of the charges.\" <i>United States v. Vavlitis,</i> 9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir.1993). \"A constructive amendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.\" <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting <i>Dunn,</i> 758 F.2d at 35) (internal quotation marks omitted). When the facts proved at trial differ from those alleged in the indictment, the indictment has been constructively amended. <i>Id.</i> Constructive amendment is per se prejudicial and is grounds for reversal of a conviction. <i>Dunn,</i> 758 F.2d at 35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second superceding indictment charged that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[f]rom a time unknown to the Grand Jury, but at least by in or about April of 1998, and continuing thereafter until September of 2001, in the District of Massachusetts and elsewhere, . . . PIERRE . . . did knowingly and intentionally conspire and agree with [Mickens and] others known and unknown to the Grand Jury[] to distribute 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains a detectable amount of cocaine base, also known as \"crack,\" and to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of the indictment encompasses the Old Colony incident and the activities with Lukenson, which took place in April 1998. <i>See id.</i> at 37. It does not limit the charged conspiracy to the 504 Boyz. Further, evidence of the Lukenson incident was presented to the Grand Jury that returned the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no support in the record for Pierre's argument that the government's \"primary theory of the case was that Pierre and Mickens conspired together and with the 504 Boyz to distribute cocaine,\" or his contention that the government switched theories in the 2004 trial. The government presented the Lukenson evidence to the Grand Jury and the Old Colony evidence at the 2003 trial. The prosecution theory all along was that Pierre conspired with many people, including Lukenson and women other than Mickens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the evidence presented at the 2004 trial necessarily show two distinct conspiracies, as Pierre argues. Contrary to Pierre's suggestion, there is no requirement that all of the participants in a conspiracy know or even <i>know of</i> one another. <i>United States v. Fenton,</i> 367 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.2004). The test for determining whether a single agreement existed among co-conspirators is a pragmatic one, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence at the 2004 trial showed continuity between the two time periods at issue&#8212;April 1998, when the Lukenson and Old Colony events took place, and the summer of 1999, when Mickens began a relationship with Pierre. <i>See United States v. David,</i> 940 F.2d 722, 734 (1st Cir.1991). Mickens testified that Pierre told her about the Old Colony incident, and that he told her he fled in a car driven by a man named Kennisen. She testified that she knew Kennisen because Pierre regularly directed her to collect money from him and because she frequently drove Pierre to New Bedford to meet with Kennisen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Likewise, Mickens testified that when she arrived in Fall River in 1998, Pierre had an <i>ongoing</i> relationship with the 504 Boyz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence also showed that Pierre's business operated in the same way and to the same end in April 1998 as it did during Mickens's later involvement. <i>See id.</i> The Old Colony and Lukenson evidence demonstrated that in April 1998 Pierre used other people to drive him around, hid his drugs in public spaces and outdoors, cut his drugs with inositol, and sold his drugs at Fall River bars. Mickens's testimony was that during the time she was involved with Pierre's business, he used other people to drive him around, often hid his drugs outdoors in holes in the ground, cut his drugs with inositol, and sold his drugs at Fall River bars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts proved at trial were more than adequate to prove one ongoing conspiracy, with Pierre at the center. <i>See Fenton,</i> 367 F.3d at 19-20. There was no constructive amendment. <i>Dunn,</i> 758 F.2d at 38; <i>see also United States v. Kelly,</i> 722 F.2d 873, 876 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Drug Seizure Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 2001, Pierre was driving in a convenience store parking lot when he was stopped by Fall River Police Officer David Murphy. Officer Murphy later testified that he stopped Pierre because he \"was aware at the time [that Pierre] did not have an active license.\" After confirming that Pierre's license had been suspended, Officer Murphy arrested Pierre for driving with a suspended license. Pierre was taken to the Fall River Police Department where he was searched as part of the booking process. During the search, police officers recovered cocaine from Pierre's pocket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre filed a motion to suppress the February 21 traffic stop evidence, arguing that Officer Murphy did not have reasonable suspicion to stop Pierre. The district court denied the motion after an evidentiary hearing. The court found that Pierre had reasonable suspicion to stop Pierre for driving without a license. The cocaine seized during the traffic stop was admitted at both the 2003 and 2004 trials. Pierre argues that the information on which Officer Murphy based the traffic stop was stale, and that introduction of the seized cocaine therefore violated his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's ultimate determination of reasonable suspicion on a motion to suppress de novo. <i>United States v. Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d 231, 240 (1st Cir.2003). We review subsidiary factual findings for clear error. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A traffic stop constitutes a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <i>United States v. Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001). As a result, \"the stop must be supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6. Reasonable suspicion requires more than a naked hunch that criminal activity is afoot, but less than probable cause. <i>Id.</i> Its existence is assessed on a case-by-case basis, in light of all the attendant circumstances. <i>Id.</i> When evaluating a claim of staleness, courts do not measure the timeliness of information simply by counting the number of days that have elapsed. <i>United States v. Bucuvalas,</i> 970 F.2d 937, 940 (1st Cir.1992), <i>abrogated on other grounds by Cleveland v. United States,</i> 531 U.S. 12, 121 S.Ct. 365, 148 L.Ed.2d 221 (2000). Rather, a court must assess the nature of the information, the nature and characteristics of the suspected criminal activity, and the likely endurance of the information. <i>Cf. id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the suppression hearing, Officer Murphy testified that from September 1999 to September 2000 he had worked in the vice and intelligence unit of the Fall River Police Department. During that time, Pierre's name came up often in conversation; fellow officers frequently discussed his drug dealing, and Officer Murphy was informed that Pierre did not have an active license. Officer Murphy testified that after he left the vice unit, he continued to talk with detectives there regarding Pierre, and no one ever informed him that Pierre's license status had changed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre relies on <i>United States v. Laughrin,</i> 438 F.3d 1245 (10th Cir.2006), a Tenth Circuit case, to argue that Officer Murphy's information (from the time he served in the vice unit) was so old as to be meaningless, and therefore could not justify a traffic stop. <i>Laughrin,</i> however, is distinguishable. In that case, a police officer had stopped the defendant based on his knowledge, which was at least twenty-two weeks old, of the defendant's driving record. <i>Id.</i> at 1246-47. The officer previously had stopped the defendant when he was driving on a suspended license, but the court noted that there was no indication from the officer's testimony about the length of the license suspension. <i>Id.</i> at 1248. The court stated that if there had been testimony about the length of the suspension, the court might have been able to affirm the finding of reasonable suspicion. <i>Id.</i> In the absence of such testimony, however, it held that the officer's information was too stale to justify the stop. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Officer Murphy offered testimony indicating that Pierre's license had been suspended during the entire year that Officer Murphy had served in the vice unit. This testimony suggests that Pierre's license was suspended on an ongoing basis, rather than for a short period of time, making the suspicion that it was still inactive some five months later more reasonable. Moreover, Officer Murphy testified that he kept in touch with some of the detectives in the vice unit, and that none of those detectives ever informed him during conversations about Pierre of any change in Pierre's license status. Although he did not explicitly state as much, the import of Officer Murphy's testimony was that because Pierre's license status was relevant to future investigations and cases, he would have expected someone to have informed him if Pierre's license status had changed. We hold that Officer Murphy had reasonable suspicion to stop Pierre's car, and that the district court did not err in failing to suppress the cocaine seized incident to Pierre's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre cursorily states that the February 21 evidence was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403. This argument has been waived, <i>see United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"), and is without merit in any event. Evidence that Pierre was driving without a license served to corroborate Mickens's testimony that Pierre did not have a license and employed people to drive him around. Likewise, evidence that Pierre was carrying cocaine when he was stopped in February 2001 is directly relevant to his participation in a drug distribution conspiracy between April 1998 and September 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Prior Bad Acts Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre argues that the Old Colony, Lukenson, and February 21 traffic stop testimony should not have been admitted because it was evidence of prior bad acts. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <i>id.</i> 403. He also argues that during the 2003 trial, Officer Alan Correiro, who appeared on behalf of the government, testified about an uncharged shooting \"in an attempt to prejudice the jury concerning the character of Pierre.\" The district court's determination that evidence is not precluded by Federal Rules of Evidence 403 or 404(b) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Frankhauser,</i> 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the Old Colony, Lukenson, and February 21 traffic stop evidence was proof of the conspiracy charged in the indictment defeats the prior bad acts argument as to that evidence. <i>See United States v. Arboleda,</i> 929 F.2d 858, 866 (1st Cir.1991). Moreover, none of this evidence was unduly prejudicial. <i>See id.</i> at 866-67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Correiro testimony, it was a minor issue that was fully remedied by the district court. Correiro was called to testify about drug-related statements that Pierre made to him in October 2000. When questioned about an omission in his report, Correiro explained that the initial report was not about drugs because the investigation was of \"a shooting incident.\" Defense counsel objected, and the district court instructed the jury to disregard the answer. During cross-examination, Correiro again referred to the incident and stated that charges had been brought against Pierre. Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial, which the district court denied, and the court instructed the jury more forcefully that the shooting incident had nothing to do with the case before them, that the charges against Pierre had been dismissed, and that they should not think or talk about the incident. \"We normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it.\" <i>Greer v. Miller,</i> 483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987). Only if there is an overwhelming probability that the jury could not have followed the instruction and a strong likelihood that the evidence was devastating to the defendant will we assume otherwise. <i>Id.</i> This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Forfeiture-Related Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre argues that the forfeiture order was error because the government failed to demonstrate that he earned $500,000 as a result of the conspiracy for which he was convicted. He further argues that the government was improperly permitted to seize substitute assets prior to the 2003 trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the guilty verdict at the 2004 trial, the jury returned a special verdict in which it found that at least $500,000 and a pair of diamond earrings seized by the government were \"derived, directly or indirectly,\" from the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> A forfeiture verdict must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v. Keene,</i> 341 F.3d 78, 86 (1st Cir. 2003); <i>United States v. Rogers,</i> 102 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir.1996). We have no problem finding a sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury's verdict here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in support of the forfeiture verdict at the 2004 trial included Mickens's testimony, as well as several records documenting expenditures by Pierre. Mickens testified that from the time she moved to Fall River in 1998 until she developed a relationship with Pierre the following year, she saw Pierre exchanging money with others in various locations. She further testified that during the period of her involvement with Pierre&#8212;from summer 1999 until her arrest in September 2001&#8212;Pierre admitted to her that he had been in the drug business for years, and she observed Pierre regularly obtain cocaine from a source in Brockton and sell crack to customers in Fall River and New Bedford. Mickens testified that she drove Pierre to his source in Brockton \"[q]uite a bit,\" \"once a week, twice a week, sometimes more,\" and that she drove Pierre around Fall River \"[j]ust about every day\" so that he could \"collect money or drop off ounces.\" She also testified that she sold crack for Pierre, and at the height of her involvement she sold up to $3000 worth of crack per night; she further indicated that if Pierre did not need her to drive him around, she \"was in the bar [selling drugs] from the time they opened, all day.\" Mickens also stated that she collected at least $1000 two times per week from Pierre's biggest wholesale customers, and that Pierre also collected money from them. Finally, Mickens testified that she observed Pierre cook up part of a half-kilogram of cocaine that he had obtained in Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The documentary evidence presented by the government showed that during the course of the conspiracy Pierre spent over $6000 on motel rooms, over $22,000 on cars, and deposited and withdrew nearly $40,000 from a bank account. He also spent at least $4700 on jewelry. Finally, he paid the living expenses of Mickens, totaling over $12,000 per year, and the expenses of his children and their mother. Mickens testified that Pierre had no job other than drug dealing. At the time Mickens met Pierre, he did have a used car lot, but Mickens testified that he used the car lot to deal drugs and sold only one or two cars before getting rid of the lot a couple of months after she had met him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although one cannot, based on this testimony and documentary evidence, tally specific amounts to arrive at $500,000, the government may satisfy its burden of proof by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <i>United States v. Houlihan,</i> 92 F.3d 1271, 1299 (1st Cir.1996). From the time of her involvement in 1999, Mickens estimated that she earned or collected between $3400 and over $20,000 per week in drug money for Pierre. The jury could easily have inferred from the evidence presented that on average Pierre sold at least $3000 worth of cocaine or crack each week over the life of the conspiracy. Such an inference supports the jury's finding that $500,000 was forfeitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Substitute Assets</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Pierre was arrested, the government seized from him various pieces of jewelry&#8212;including a watch, necklace, ring, bracelet, and earrings&#8212;subsequently valued at over $60,000. It then began administrative forfeiture proceedings, but when Pierre filed a motion contesting the forfeiture, the government abandoned the claim. Pierre's motion also requested immediate return of the jewelry, but the government refused to return the jewelry to Pierre, stating that it was evidence of criminal activity. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) (providing that the district court \"may impose reasonable conditions to protect access to [seized] property and its use in later proceedings\"). The district court agreed that the government was permitted to retain possession of the jewelry as evidence and denied Pierre's motion requesting return of the jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 2003, the government obtained a second superceding indictment that included a forfeiture allegation specifying the seized jewelry and $500,000 as forfeitable. At the 2003 trial, Fernandes testified that Pierre had spent money on gold chains and a jeweled bracelet, and the government offered the jewelry into evidence without objection. Prior to the 2004 trial, however, Pierre challenged the admissibility of the jewelry, arguing that the government was unable to tie it to the alleged conspiracy. The district court granted Pierre's motion to exclude the jewelry from the 2004 trial, except for the pair of earrings, which Mickens testified Pierre purchased for himself during their relationship. Defense counsel then took possession of the excluded jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury in the 2004 trial returned a special verdict finding that $500,000 and the earrings were forfeitable, the district court entered a preliminary order forfeiting the earrings and the other four pieces of jewelry as substitute assets, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(p), since the government was unable to locate the $500,000 specified in the special verdict. <i>See United States v. Hall,</i> 434 F.3d 42, 58 n. 7 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Substitute property may be seized by the government to satisfy a forfeiture order where, by an act or omission, the defendant has prevented the government from tracing his illegally obtained assets.\"). Nine months later, the district court entered a final order of forfeiture, forfeiting the earrings and the substitute assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre does not object to the forfeiture of the four pieces of jewelry as substitute assets, but rather to the district court's having permitted the government to retain possession of them prior to the 2003 trial. As a remedy, he seeks to have the jewelry (or its monetary equivalent) returned to him now. We review the district court's interpretation of Rule 41(g) de novo. <i>See United States v. Dean,</i> 100 F.3d 19, 20 (5th Cir.1996). The district court's factual determination that the jewelry had evidentiary value to the government is reviewed for clear error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 41(g) provides that \"[a] person aggrieved . . . by the deprivation of property may move [the district court] for the property's return.\" Once seized property is no longer needed as evidence, a criminal defendant is presumed to have the right to its return. <i>See Dean,</i> 100 F.3d at 20; <i>United States v. Mills,</i> 991 F.2d 609, 612 (9th Cir.1993). However, \"[a] Rule 41[(g)] motion is properly denied `if the defendant is not entitled to lawful possession of the seized property, the property is contraband or subject to forfeiture[,] or the government's need for the property as evidence continues.'\" <i>Mills,</i> 991 F.2d at 612 (quoting <i>United States v. Van Cauwenberghe,</i> 934 F.2d 1048, 1061 (9th Cir.1991)); <i>see also United States v. Saunders,</i> 957 F.2d 1488, 1495 (8th Cir.1992) (holding that \"[t]he motion for the return of the paperwork, even papers that were not introduced at trial, was premature because defendant's direct appeal was still pending\"); <i>Van Cauwenberghe,</i> 934 F.2d at 1061 (holding that a defendant's motion for the return of property may be denied based on the government's need for the property as evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's finding that the jewelry had evidentiary value to the government was not clearly erroneous. The government introduced the seized jewelry into evidence at the 2003 trial and presented testimony attempting to link the jewelry to the proceeds of the charged conspiracy. Once it became clear that the government's evidence on this point was not particularly strong, the district court granted Pierre's motion to exclude four pieces of the jewelry, and defense counsel took possession of those pieces at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the district court's order permitting the government to retain possession of the jewelry before the 2003 trial was in error, Pierre still would not be entitled to return of the jewelry <i>now.</i> An illegal seizure of property does not immunize it from forfeiture as long as the government can sustain the forfeiture claim with independent evidence. <i>United States v. Rogers,</i> 102 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir.1996) (rejecting a claim that property illegally seized by law enforcement officers was not forfeitable). The cases cited by Pierre in support of his argument that the jewelry must be returned do not suggest otherwise. Rather, the remedy in each of those cases was to affirm the denial of or vacate the grant of a <i>pre-trial restraining order</i> as to substitute assets. <i>United</i> <i>States v. Gotti,</i> 155 F.3d 144, 146, 150 (2d Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Field,</i> 62 F.3d 246, 247-48, 250 (8th Cir.1995); <i>In re Assets of Martin,</i> 1 F.3d 1351, 1354, 1362 (3d Cir.1993); <i>United States v.

Sentencing Error Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre raises four claims of sentencing error. He argues that the district court improperly calculated his base offense level with respect to drug quantity and improperly applied a four-level enhancement for leadership of extensive criminal activity. He also argues that his sentence on the conspiracy count is unreasonable as a matter of law because of disparities with sentences imposed on other participants in the conspiracy. Finally, he argues that his sentence on the possession count is unreasonable because it exceeds the Guidelines range (although not the statutory maximum) for that count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo sentencing issues involving questions of law. <i>United States v. McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir.1996). We review the district court's determination of the reliability of sentencing information for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d 174, 180 (1st Cir.2005). Factual determinations are reviewed for clear error. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Drug Quantity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that Pierre was responsible for 1.5 kilograms or more of cocaine base, and that the appropriate base offense level therefore was 38. Pierre argues that this finding was unsupported by either of the jury verdicts (one of which found that he did not, on a particular occasion, possess 500 or more grams of cocaine but rather possessed a lesser amount, and one of which found that he was responsible over the course of the conspiracy for 50 grams or more of crack and 500 grams or more of powder cocaine), and that it therefore infringed on his Fifth Amendment due process and Sixth Amendment jury trial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our prior caselaw forecloses any such argument. <i>See United States v. Yeje-Cabrera,</i> 430 F.3d 1, 17-18 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Since <i>Booker</i> we have made it clear that the district courts may make drug quantity determinations for sentencing purposes . . . .\"); <i>United States v. P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 421 F.3d 11, 14-15 (1st Cir.2005) (rejecting the claim that \"the district judge violated the Sixth Amendment by himself making the determinations as to drug quantity and other enhancements\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent Pierre argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court's drug quantity finding,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the argument fails. At Pierre's first trial, in 2003, Fernandes testified that Pierre supplied the 504 Boyz with half a kilogram of crack every month for two years. At the sentencing hearing, the district court specifically commented on Fernandes's credibility and concluded that he was \"credible in [his] testimony about the drug quantity.\" This credibility determination was not an abuse of discretion, <i>see Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d at 180, and Fernandes's testimony amply supports the court's drug quantity finding. There was thus no clear error in the district court's drug quantity determination. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Leadership Enhancement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre makes similar objections to the district court's imposition of a four-level enhancement for leadership of extensive criminal activity. He argues first that no jury verdict established that he was \"an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a), and that imposition of the enhancement therefore was improper. He next argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he was a leader of extensive criminal activity, even by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no requirement that the jury find that the leadership enhancement applies. \"Under the advisory guidelines regime, the district court can use the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether an enhancement applies.\" <i>United States v. Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d 121, 130 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's \"fact-bound\" determination that Pierre was a leader for clear error. <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> 353 F.3d 84, 89 (1st Cir.2003). The district court stated that it based its determination that Pierre was a leader of extensive criminal activity on \"the number of people involved, the number of places in which drugs were sold, . . . the fact that drugs were sold both at the wholesale level and at the retail level, . . . and at the center of all this is Mr. Pierre.\" The district court also mentioned the quantity of drugs involved and the period of time over which the drug business extended as factors contributing to its conclusion. The record bears out the district court's conclusion. There was testimony that a number of different people assisted Pierre with his drug operations; that Pierre made wholesale drug sales to groups like the 504 Boyz, as well as retail sales at bars in and around Fall River; that Pierre's business involved significant quantities of drugs; and that it extended over a period of at least three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's application of the leadership enhancement thus was not clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v. Col&#243;n-Mu&#241;oz,</i> 318 F.3d 348, 364 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that the extent of criminal activity within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 is assessed based on \"the totality of the circumstances, including not only the number of participants but also the width, breadth, scope, complexity, and duration of the scheme\" (quoting <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Reasonableness</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre argues that his 432-month sentence on the conspiracy count is unreasonable as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 928, 166 L.Ed.2d 715 (2007); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a). He bases this argument on the fact that his sentence is over three times as long as that imposed on any other member of the conspiracy. He makes a related argument that the district court failed to explain adequately the reasons why his sentence is so much longer than his co-conspirators' sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre fails to present us with any evidence that he is similarly situated to other members of the conspiracy and so therefore arguably should have received a comparable sentence. Our review of the evidence indicates quite the contrary&#8212;that Pierre was not similarly situated to other members of the conspiracy. For example, Pierre is not similarly situated to Mickens, who reported to and took orders from Pierre. Mickens testified that Pierre beat her on a number of occasions, that he threatened to kill her, and that he forced her to have sex with other men while he watched. Likewise, Pierre's criminal history included incidents that distinguished him from his co-conspirators. Pierre's pre-sentence report, which included information from the grand jury investigation that had been excluded at trial, stated that Pierre previously had been convicted of threatening to kill a former girlfriend and \"cut up her face and dump her body.\" Moreover, both Mickens and Fernandes pled guilty and provided substantial assistance to the government. A defendant's sentence is not \"unreasonable simply because his co-defendants agreed to help the government in exchange for reduced sentences.\" <i>United States v. V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> 470 F.3d 443, 449 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also United States v. Saez,</i> 444 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 224, 166 L.Ed.2d 178 (2006).

The conspiracy count was retried in 2004, and Pierre was convicted of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine and cocaine. Pierre's co-defendant and ex-girlfriend, Michelle Mickens, pled guilty and testified against Pierre at both trials. Pierre subsequently was sentenced to a 432-month term of imprisonment on the conspiracy charge, a 240-month term of imprisonment, which was to run concurrently, on the possession charge, and five years' supervised release. The district court also entered a final order of forfeiture for $500,000 against Pierre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre's appeal relates primarily to the 2004 conspiracy conviction and the accompanying sentence, although he does assign error to the introduction of certain evidence at both the 2003 and 2004 trials and to his sentence on the possession count. He also claims that the district court's forfeiture order was error. On appeal, we reject his myriad claims of error and affirm his convictions, his combined sentence, and the forfeiture order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre and Mickens were indicted on August 15, 2002 for conspiring to distribute cocaine base. On September 24, 2003, the grand jury returned a second superceding indictment charging Pierre and Mickens with conspiring with others, from at least April 1998 until September 2001, to distribute fifty or more grams of crack and 500 or more grams of cocaine, and charging Pierre with possessing with intent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine on or about July 2, 2000. A forfeiture count sought criminal forfeiture of the proceeds of the conspiracy, including $500,000 and five pieces of jewelry. Mickens pled guilty, while Pierre went to trial. After a two-week trial in December 2003, a jury found Pierre guilty of the possession count, but found that the quantity of drugs was less than 500 grams. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the conspiracy count. The conspiracy count was retried in April and May 2004, and a jury found Pierre guilty of the conspiracy count. In a special verdict form as to the forfeiture allegation, the jury found that at least $500,000 and a pair of diamond earrings were proceeds of the drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in evidence at the 2004 conspiracy trial fairly establish the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre ran a drug business in Fall River from at least April 1998 to September 2001. During that time, Pierre obtained cocaine from a source in Brockton. He would then cook some of the cocaine into crack, and he would sell both crack and powder cocaine to customers in Fall River and New Bedford. Pierre did not have a driver's license, so he employed people to drive him back and forth to Brockton and around Fall River. In particular, Mickens testified at trial that she chauffeured Pierre, in addition to transporting drugs, collecting money, and selling crack for him. At the height of her involvement, Mickens made retail sales of up to $3000 worth of crack per night at Fall River bars and collected at least $1000 twice a week from Pierre's wholesale customers. Among Pierre's biggest wholesale customers were members of the 504 Boyz, a gang that sold crack around the Fifth Street area of Fall River.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mickens testified that Pierre used the proceeds of his drug operation to buy more drugs, to pay his living expenses and those of Mickens and the mother of his children, and to buy luxury items like expensive clothes and jewelry. In addition, Pierre obtained at least seven cars for use in his drug business, all of which he registered to other people. Mickens's testimony was corroborated by motel, bank, and motor vehicle records, and by the testimony of Paula Costa, who bought crack from Pierre, and Fall River police officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Trial Error Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre raises three claims of trial error and argues that each of the errors entitles him to a new trial. First, Pierre argues that the district court constructively amended the indictment by admitting evidence of offenses not charged therein. Next, he argues that in failing to suppress evidence of a particular drug seizure, the district court admitted evidence that violated Pierre's Fourth Amendment rights and that was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant. Finally, Pierre argues that the district court impermissibly admitted prior bad acts evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Constructive Amendment of the Indictment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At both of Pierre's trials, Mickens and several Fall River police officers testified to an incident on April 14, 1998 at the Old Colony apartment complex, where Pierre then resided. Detective Michael Boutin testified that on that date he discovered a bag containing cocaine, a scale, and a bottle of inositol (a substance used to cut cocaine and crack) hidden behind a ceiling panel in the hallway of an Old Colony building. He and other officers seized the items in the bag, replaced them with similar-looking items, and returned the bag to its hiding place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police officers then established surveillance at the site. Officer Scott Paul testified that he saw Pierre emerge from his apartment with a small step-ladder. Officer Alan Beausoliel testified that he saw Pierre approach the location of the hidden items. Although he could hear the ladder and ceiling tile being moved, Officer Beausoliel did not observe Pierre remove the bag from the ceiling. Officer Paul observed Pierre returning to his apartment with the step-ladder. He then heard a thud and running. Other officers spotted Pierre running out of the building and fleeing in a car. A fingerprint lifted from the bottle of inositol later was matched to Pierre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mickens corroborated this account. She testified that Pierre had told her that he had hidden cocaine and a scale in the ceiling of the building, and that when he returned to retrieve it, he noticed that a switch had been made. When he heard a noise and saw police, Pierre had run out of the building and fled in a car driven by an associate named Kennisen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Detective Steven Washington testified that within the two weeks before the Old Colony incident he and two other officers had observed Pierre meeting with an individual by the name of Noel Lukenson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The officers initially observed Lukenson and Pierre talking in a car parked on the street. Pierre then left, and after entering and exiting a nearby building, Lukenson began crawling on the ground, took up a divot of grass, and removed a large white bag from underneath the divot. Lukenson then drove to Old Colony, picked up Pierre, and drove to two Fall River bars. At the first bar, a person entered the car and left within approximately two minutes. At the second bar, the officers observed Pierre meeting with another man; the man handed Pierre money, and Pierre then put his hand to his mouth, shook the other man's hand, and left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre argues that these two incidents were unrelated to the conspiracy charged in the indictment, and that by permitting testimony about them, the district court constructively amended the indictment. He argues that the indictment charged only a conspiracy between Pierre, Mickens, and the 504 Boyz. Pierre's position is that his supposed conspiracy with Mickens and the 504 Boyz had nothing to do with the Old Colony incident or with any agreement he might have had with Lukenson. Rather, he argues, these incidents were evidence of an independent, uncharged conspiracy. In particular, he emphasizes that Mickens did not know Lukenson, and that there was no evidence connecting the 504 Boyz to Lukenson. He argues that there is a possibility that his conviction \"rests upon an offense not charged by the grand jury,\" and that as a result he is entitled to reversal of his conviction. <i>United States v.

The government presented the Lukenson evidence to the Grand Jury and the Old Colony evidence at the 2003 trial. The prosecution theory all along was that Pierre conspired with many people, including Lukenson and women other than Mickens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the evidence presented at the 2004 trial necessarily show two distinct conspiracies, as Pierre argues.

Mickens testified that Pierre told her about the Old Colony incident, and that he told her he fled in a car driven by a man named Kennisen. She testified that she knew Kennisen because Pierre regularly directed her to collect money from him and because she frequently drove Pierre to New Bedford to meet with Kennisen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Likewise, Mickens testified that when she arrived in Fall River in 1998, Pierre had an <i>ongoing</i> relationship with the 504 Boyz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence also showed that Pierre's business operated in the same way and to the same end in April 1998 as it did during Mickens's later involvement. <i>See id.</i> The Old Colony and Lukenson evidence demonstrated that in April 1998 Pierre used other people to drive him around, hid his drugs in public spaces and outdoors, cut his drugs with inositol, and sold his drugs at Fall River bars.

Officer Murphy later testified that he stopped Pierre because he \"was aware at the time [that Pierre] did not have an active license.\" After confirming that Pierre's license had been suspended, Officer Murphy arrested Pierre for driving with a suspended license. Pierre was taken to the Fall River Police Department where he was searched as part of the booking process.

The district court denied the motion after an evidentiary hearing. The court found that Pierre had reasonable suspicion to stop Pierre for driving without a license. The cocaine seized during the traffic stop was admitted at both the 2003 and 2004 trials.

During that time, Pierre's name came up often in conversation; fellow officers frequently discussed his drug dealing, and Officer Murphy was informed that Pierre did not have an active license.

In that case, a police officer had stopped the defendant based on his knowledge, which was at least twenty-two weeks old, of the defendant's driving record. <i>Id.</i> at 1246-47. The officer previously had stopped the defendant when he was driving on a suspended license, but the court noted that there was no indication from the officer's testimony about the length of the license suspension. <i>Id.</i> at 1248. The court stated that if there had been testimony about the length of the suspension, the court might have been able to affirm the finding of reasonable suspicion. <i>Id.</i> In the absence of such testimony, however, it held that the officer's information was too stale to justify the stop. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Officer Murphy offered testimony indicating that Pierre's license had been suspended during the entire year that Officer Murphy had served in the vice unit. This testimony suggests that Pierre's license was suspended on an ongoing basis, rather than for a short period of time, making the suspicion that it was still inactive some five months later more reasonable. Moreover, Officer Murphy testified that he kept in touch with some of the detectives in the vice unit, and that none of those detectives ever informed him during conversations about Pierre of any change in Pierre's license status. Although he did not explicitly state as much, the import of Officer Murphy's testimony was that because Pierre's license status was relevant to future investigations and cases, he would have expected someone to have informed him if Pierre's license status had changed. We hold that Officer Murphy had reasonable suspicion to stop Pierre's car, and that the district court did not err in failing to suppress the cocaine seized incident to Pierre's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre cursorily states that the February 21 evidence was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403.

Correiro was called to testify about drug-related statements that Pierre made to him in October 2000. When questioned about an omission in his report, Correiro explained that the initial report was not about drugs because the investigation was of \"a shooting incident.\" Defense counsel objected, and the district court instructed the jury to disregard the answer. During cross-examination, Correiro again referred to the incident and stated that charges had been brought against Pierre. Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial, which the district court denied, and the court instructed the jury more forcefully that the shooting incident had nothing to do with the case before them, that the charges against Pierre had been dismissed, and that they should not think or talk about the incident. \"We normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it.\" <i>Greer v.

Mickens testified that from the time she moved to Fall River in 1998 until she developed a relationship with Pierre the following year, she saw Pierre exchanging money with others in various locations. She further testified that during the period of her involvement with Pierre&#8212;from summer 1999 until her arrest in September 2001&#8212;Pierre admitted to her that he had been in the drug business for years, and she observed Pierre regularly obtain cocaine from a source in Brockton and sell crack to customers in Fall River and New Bedford. Mickens testified that she drove Pierre to his source in Brockton \"[q]uite a bit,\" \"once a week, twice a week, sometimes more,\" and that she drove Pierre around Fall River \"[j]ust about every day\" so that he could \"collect money or drop off ounces.\" She also testified that she sold crack for Pierre, and at the height of her involvement she sold up to $3000 worth of crack per night; she further indicated that if Pierre did not need her to drive him around, she \"was in the bar [selling drugs] from the time they opened, all day.\" Mickens also stated that she collected at least $1000 two times per week from Pierre's biggest wholesale customers, and that Pierre also collected money from them. Finally, Mickens testified that she observed Pierre cook up part of a half-kilogram of cocaine that he had obtained in Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The documentary evidence presented by the government showed that during the course of the conspiracy Pierre spent over $6000 on motel rooms, over $22,000 on cars, and deposited and withdrew nearly $40,000 from a bank account. He also spent at least $4700 on jewelry. Finally, he paid the living expenses of Mickens, totaling over $12,000 per year, and the expenses of his children and their mother. Mickens testified that Pierre had no job other than drug dealing. At the time Mickens met Pierre, he did have a used car lot, but Mickens testified that he used the car lot to deal drugs and sold only one or two cars before getting rid of the lot a couple of months after she had met him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although one cannot, based on this testimony and documentary evidence, tally specific amounts to arrive at $500,000, the government may satisfy its burden of proof by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <i>United States v.

From the time of her involvement in 1999, Mickens estimated that she earned or collected between $3400 and over $20,000 per week in drug money for Pierre. The jury could easily have inferred from the evidence presented that on average Pierre sold at least $3000 worth of cocaine or crack each week over the life of the conspiracy. Such an inference supports the jury's finding that $500,000 was forfeitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Substitute Assets</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Pierre was arrested, the government seized from him various pieces of jewelry&#8212;including a watch, necklace, ring, bracelet, and earrings&#8212;subsequently valued at over $60,000. It then began administrative forfeiture proceedings, but when Pierre filed a motion contesting the forfeiture, the government abandoned the claim. Pierre's motion also requested immediate return of the jewelry, but the government refused to return the jewelry to Pierre, stating that it was evidence of criminal activity. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) (providing that the district court \"may impose reasonable conditions to protect access to [seized] property and its use in later proceedings\"). The district court agreed that the government was permitted to retain possession of the jewelry as evidence and denied Pierre's motion requesting return of the jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 2003, the government obtained a second superceding indictment that included a forfeiture allegation specifying the seized jewelry and $500,000 as forfeitable. At the 2003 trial, Fernandes testified that Pierre had spent money on gold chains and a jeweled bracelet, and the government offered the jewelry into evidence without objection. Prior to the 2004 trial, however, Pierre challenged the admissibility of the jewelry, arguing that the government was unable to tie it to the alleged conspiracy. The district court granted Pierre's motion to exclude the jewelry from the 2004 trial, except for the pair of earrings, which Mickens testified Pierre purchased for himself during their relationship. Defense counsel then took possession of the excluded jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury in the 2004 trial returned a special verdict finding that $500,000 and the earrings were forfeitable, the district court entered a preliminary order forfeiting the earrings and the other four pieces of jewelry as substitute assets, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(p), since the government was unable to locate the $500,000 specified in the special verdict. <i>See United States v.

Nine months later, the district court entered a final order of forfeiture, forfeiting the earrings and the substitute assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre does not object to the forfeiture of the four pieces of jewelry as substitute assets, but rather to the district court's having permitted the government to retain possession of them prior to the 2003 trial. As a remedy, he seeks to have the jewelry (or its monetary equivalent) returned to him now. We review the district court's interpretation of Rule 41(g) de novo. <i>See United States v.

The government introduced the seized jewelry into evidence at the 2003 trial and presented testimony attempting to link the jewelry to the proceeds of the charged conspiracy.

At Pierre's first trial, in 2003, Fernandes testified that Pierre supplied the 504 Boyz with half a kilogram of crack every month for two years. At the sentencing hearing, the district court specifically commented on Fernandes's credibility and concluded that he was \"credible in [his] testimony about the drug quantity.\" This credibility determination was not an abuse of discretion, <i>see Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d at 180, and Fernandes's testimony amply supports the court's drug quantity finding. There was thus no clear error in the district court's drug quantity determination. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Leadership Enhancement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre makes similar objections to the district court's imposition of a four-level enhancement for leadership of extensive criminal activity. He argues first that no jury verdict established that he was \"an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a), and that imposition of the enhancement therefore was improper. He next argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he was a leader of extensive criminal activity, even by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no requirement that the jury find that the leadership enhancement applies. \"Under the advisory guidelines regime, the district court can use the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether an enhancement applies.\" <i>United States v.

The district court stated that it based its determination that Pierre was a leader of extensive criminal activity on \"the number of people involved, the number of places in which drugs were sold, . . . the fact that drugs were sold both at the wholesale level and at the retail level, . . . and at the center of all this is Mr. Pierre.\" The district court also mentioned the quantity of drugs involved and the period of time over which the drug business extended as factors contributing to its conclusion. The record bears out the district court's conclusion. There was testimony that a number of different people assisted Pierre with his drug operations; that Pierre made wholesale drug sales to groups like the 504 Boyz, as well as retail sales at bars in and around Fall River; that Pierre's business involved significant quantities of drugs; and that it extended over a period of at least three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's application of the leadership enhancement thus was not clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v.

He bases this argument on the fact that his sentence is over three times as long as that imposed on any other member of the conspiracy. He makes a related argument that the district court failed to explain adequately the reasons why his sentence is so much longer than his co-conspirators' sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierre fails to present us with any evidence that he is similarly situated to other members of the conspiracy and so therefore arguably should have received a comparable sentence. Our review of the evidence indicates quite the contrary&#8212;that Pierre was not similarly situated to other members of the conspiracy. For example, Pierre is not similarly situated to Mickens, who reported to and took orders from Pierre. Mickens testified that Pierre beat her on a number of occasions, that he threatened to kill her, and that he forced her to have sex with other men while he watched. Likewise, Pierre's criminal history included incidents that distinguished him from his co-conspirators. Pierre's pre-sentence report, which included information from the grand jury investigation that had been excluded at trial, stated that Pierre previously had been convicted of threatening to kill a former girlfriend and \"cut up her face and dump her body.\" Moreover, both Mickens and Fernandes pled guilty and provided substantial assistance to the government. A defendant's sentence is not \"unreasonable simply because his co-defendants agreed to help the government in exchange for reduced sentences.\" <i>United States v.

The court repeatedly expressed disappointment that Pierre, in his statement to the court, refused to take any responsibility for the situation in which he found himself and failed to express any remorse for his actions. In its Statement of Reasons, the court wrote that it viewed Pierre as \"an unrepentant and dangerous dealer in illicit drugs and firearms.\" It explained that it found a sentence of 432 months \"sufficient to punish [Pierre] and to deter him and others from similar conduct,\" while still preserving the possibility that Pierre would \"have some period of freedom in the sunset of his life.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not explicitly state why it imposed on Pierre a sentence much more substantial than those received by other members of the conspiracy, we can infer its reasoning \"by comparing what was argued by the parties . . . with what the [court] did.\" <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519. Pierre argued in his sentencing memorandum and at his sentencing hearing that he should receive a sentence no greater than that imposed on his co-conspirators.
