Padró\n\nbrought suit against Elaine L. Chao, Secretary of Labor, and Robert\n\nJ. Semler, Regional Administrator for the Department of Labor's\n\nEmployment    and   Training   Administration     for   Region   I,   Boston\n\n(collectively, \"Defendants\"), alleging employment discrimination on\n\nthe basis of national origin and retaliation for asserting his\n\nemployment rights.       He subsequently amended his complaint to add\n\nfurther   claims    of   discrimination.     On   summary   judgment,   the\n\nmagistrate judge dismissed Padró's action in its entirety because\n\nof the failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.             Although\n\nthe magistrate judge correctly granted summary judgment on some of\n\nPadró's claims, he failed to address others. As a result, granting\n\nsummary judgment on the entirety of Padró's claim was an error.\n\nTherefore, we must vacate part of the judgment and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                    I.\n\n           Padró began working for the Employment and Training\n\nAdministration of the Department of Labor (\"DOL\") in 1972. In 1982\n\nand   1987,   respectively,     Padró     filed   two   Equal    Employment\n\nOpportunity (\"EEO\") complaints for employment discrimination.            He\n\nsettled these two EEO complaints in 1990.         In November 1986, Padró\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fwas assigned to the position of Regional Monitor Advocate (\"MA\").1\n\nPadró remained in the MA position, at a pay grade of GS-13, for the\n\nnext fifteen (15) years, without reassignment or promotion.\n\n            In March 1999, Padró filed an informal complaint2 (the\n\n\"1999 EEO claim\") with the DOL alleging continuing discrimination\n\nbased on national origin and retaliation for filing his prior\n\ncomplaints.   On or about June 30, 1999, Padró received a telephone\n\ncall from DOL EEO Counselor Zenon Brena. During that conversation,\n\nBrena told Padró that the agency would not mediate his informal\n\ncomplaint and that he had fifteen days on receipt of his NOFI\n\nletter to file his formal complaint.       The NOFI letter arrived on or\n\nabout July 12, 1999.   Padró, acting pro se, did not file his formal\n\ncomplaint   until   August   11,   1999,   after   the   fifteen   days   had\n\n\n\n     1\n       \"Regional Monitor Advocate\" was the title given to Padró's\n\"Labor Employment Specialist\" position.       An MA handled the\nimplementation of regulations governing migrant farm workers for\nhis particular Region. In Padró's Region, New England, the migrant\nworkers were predominantly Puerto Ricans. Padró spoke Spanish as\nhis first language but was also fluent in English.\n     2\n       The term \"informal complaint\" is used to distinguish the\ninitial complaint a government employee must file with his own\nagency (or department) -- which gives the agency time to\ninvestigate and decide whether the dispute can be mediated -- from\na \"formal complaint\", which an employee later files with the agency\non receipt of a Notice of Final Interview (\"NOFI\") letter from his\nagency, denying mediation.      The formal complaint, if decided\nagainst the employee, can then be appealed to the EEOC. If the\ngovernment employee is unsatisfied with the EEOC's decision, that\nemployee may file a civil action in federal district court. See,\ne.g., National Nuclear Security Administration, \"EEO Complaint\nProcess\", available at http://www.doeal.gov/eeo/complaints.html\n(last visited June 17, 2006).\n\n                                    -3-\n\felapsed.       Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(d), the DOL dismissed\n\nhis complaint for failure to file within the fifteen-day time\n\nperiod.       On January 23, 2000, Padró appealed this dismissal.           On\n\nMay 10, 2000, the EEOC denied Padró's appeal, also on the ground\n\nthat he had failed to act in a timely fashion.            On March 19, 2001,\n\nPadró filed suit in federal district court to appeal the dismissal.\n\n               Meanwhile, on January 22, 2001, Padró's request to attend\n\na training conference was denied (the \"Sturbridge\" conference). As\n\na result, Padró filed a second EEO informal complaint on April 18,\n\n2001       (the     \"2001    EEO   claim\"),    again    alleging   continuing\n\ndiscrimination based on national origin and reprisal for his prior\n\nEEO activities.           This second EEO complaint also added a hostile\n\nwork environment claim.            On June 4, 2001, the DOL accepted the\n\nsecond EEO claim for investigation.               On March 16, 2002, the DOL\n\ndismissed          this   second   EEO   claim,    pursuant   to   29   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.107(a)(3), \"for being a matter that is pending in a United\n\nStates District Court.\"3           On September 16, 2002, the EEOC affirmed\n\n\n       3\n      In relevant part, 29 C.F.R. § 1016.107, entitled \"Dismissals\nof complaints\" states:\n\n       (a) Prior to a request for a hearing in a case, the\n       agency shall dismiss an entire complaint:\n\n           . . .\n\n       (3) That is the basis of a pending civil action in a\n       United States District Court in which the complainant is\n       a party provided that at least 180 days have passed since\n       the filing of the administrative complaint, or that was\n       the basis of a civil action decided by a United States\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthe DOL's dismissal of the 2001 EEO claim pursuant to 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.107(a)(3) and advised Padró of his right to file a civil\n\naction in district court.\n\n            While Padró could have filed his second EEO claim as a\n\nseparate civil action in district court, he chose to consolidate\n\nhis 1999 and 2001 EEO claims into a single district court action.\n\nOn December 17, 2002, Padró moved to amend his first complaint,\n\nwhich focused on his 1999 EEO claim, in order to add the 2001 EEO\n\nclaim.    The motion was granted on January 23, 2003.        On July 18,\n\n2003, after discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment.\n\nFollowing oral argument, the magistrate judge granted Defendants'\n\nmotion, holding that Padró had failed to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies because he had \"filed his administrative complaint after\n\nthe applicable filing deadline.\"       This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                    II.\n\nA.   Standard of review\n\n            We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.    Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 2005).             An\n\norder granting summary judgment should be reversed if \"there\n\nexisted any factual issues that needed to be resolved before the\n\nlegal    issues   could   be   decided.\"   Sabree   v.   United   Bhd.   of\n\nCarpenters & Joiners Local No. 33, 921 F.2d 396, 399 (1st Cir.\n\n\n     District Court in which the complainant was a party;\n\n                                    -5-\n\f1990) (quoting Rossy v. Roche Prods., Inc., 880 F.2d 621, 624 (1st\n\nCir. 1989)).     When reviewing the facts cited by the party moving\n\nfor summary judgment, those facts are reviewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences\n\nare drawn in favor of that party.           See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,\n\n950 F.2d 816, 820 (1st Cir. 1991).           Here, that party is Padró.\n\nB.   The magistrate judge's order and the 1999 EEO claim\n\n           In his decision granting Defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment, the magistrate judge focused exclusively on the 1999 EEO\n\nclaim in Padró's amended complaint. The facts the magistrate judge\n\nrelied on in his decision only describe the factual and procedural\n\nhistory of Padró's 1999 EEO claim.          There is no mention of the 2001\n\nEEO claim even though the magistrate judge granted summary judgment\n\non that claim.\n\n           In    explaining     his   decision,     the    magistrate   judge\n\nrecounted Defendants' argument that they were entitled to summary\n\njudgment   \"because    Mr.   Padró    failed   to   exhaust   administrative\n\nremedies   for   his   claims    of   retaliation    and    discrimination.\"\n\nRelying on this argument alone, the magistrate judge concluded that\n\n\"a failure by Mr. Padró to file a formal complaint within the\n\nfifteen day period specified in the regulations, absent a showing\n\nof excuse by waiver, estoppel or equitable tolling, would bar him\n\nfrom filing a civil action based on that discriminatory complaint.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f           The magistrate judge devoted the balance of his decision\n\nto an explanation of why the doctrine of equitable tolling -- which\n\nis available to a plaintiff who is \"excusably ignorant\" of the\n\nstatutory filing period and has been affirmatively misled by the\n\nopposing party -- did not apply to Padró's complaint.           See Thomas\n\nv. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 53 (1st Cir. 1999); Mercado-\n\nGarcia v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 979 F.2d 890, 896 (1st Cir. 1992).            The\n\nmagistrate judge found that \"[t]here [wa]s no factual or legal\n\nbasis to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling in this case\"; and\n\nthat   Padró   had   \"not    specifically   asserted   claims   of   waiver,\n\nestoppel or equitable tolling . . . .\"             The magistrate judge\n\nexplained that Padró rather \"argue[d] in his memorandum that the\n\ntime limitation should not be imposed in his case because the\n\ndiscrimination was a continuing violation.\"            Finding no merit to\n\nthis argument, the magistrate judge granted Defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment as to Padró's amended complaint, which included\n\nboth the 1999 and 2001 EEO claims.\n\n           Padró does not appeal the magistrate judge's dismissal of\n\nhis 1999 EEO claim.         As the magistrate judge pointed out in his\n\norder, \"Mr. Padro admits that the filing of his [1999] formal\n\ncomplaint was untimely.\" But Padró emphasizes that his \"whole case\n\nwas dismissed [by the magistrate judge] for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies\" (emphasis added) even though his 2001 EEO\n\nclaim -- now part of his complaint as the result of an amendment --\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwas timely filed.      This disposition of his 2001 claim, he insists,\n\nwas an error.\n\nB.   The 2001 EEO claim\n\n            In an effort to defend the magistrate judge's decision,\n\nthe government notes his reference in the body of his decision to\n\nPadró's continuing violation claim and the footnote attached to\n\nthat reference: \"[e]ven if I were to consider the substance of the\n\n'continuing violation' argument proposed by Mr. Padro in his\n\nmemorandum,    there    are    insufficient    facts        to   support   such    a\n\ncontention.\"      The government argues that the magistrate judge's\n\nreference    to   a   \"continuing       violation\"    claim      means   that    the\n\nmagistrate judge \"was fully cognizant of Padro's second EEOC\n\nComplaint     being    separate   and     distinct        from   his   first    EEOC\n\ncomplaint.\"\n\n            We are not convinced.         In the body of his opinion, the\n\nmagistrate judge links Padró's continuing violation argument to\n\nwhat   he   thought    was    Padró's    attempt     to    circumvent    the    time\n\nlimitation period applicable to his 1999 EEO claim.                      This time\n\nlimitation issue has nothing to do with Padró's 2001 EEO claim.                   To\n\nthe extent that the government argues that the magistrate judge's\n\nreference in his footnote to the \"substance\" of Padró's continuing\n\nviolation argument is a separate reference to Padró's 2001 claim,\n\nwe note that Padró's 1999 claim also set forth a continuing\n\nviolation argument.      This oblique reference in a footnote does not\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fassure us that the magistrate judge analyzed Padró's 2001 claim at\n\nall, especially since every fact mentioned in the opinion relates\n\nto the 1999 claim.4\n\n             Moreover, the government's own actions belie its position\n\nthat the 2001 EEO claim was addressed by the magistrate judge.    The\n\nDOL dismissed the 2001 EEO claim on March 16, 2002 \"for being a\n\n\n     4\n       During the oral argument on Defendants' motion for summary\njudgment, the magistrate judge and Padró had the following\nexchange, in which Padró unmistakably advises the magistrate judge\nthat there were two separate cases, and two distinct complaints,\nbefore him:\n\n     Padró: First of all, I believe that you made an\n     observation here, your Honor, and it is appropriate to\n     say that there were two cases that we are talking about\n     it. In the government document it sort of, the second\n     one is mentioned but it's broad painting a brush . . . .\n     And I believe that to, it's appropriate to focus on the\n     fact that there are two separate cases that we are\n     dealing with although they have been consolidated.\n\n     Magistrate Judge: Why don't you tell me what those cases\n     are?\n\n     . . .\n\n     Padró: Yes, the first case that was filed on 3/19/01.\n     And the second case -- that was filed by me over motion\n     of consolidation on December, some time in December,\n     almost two years subsequent to it.\n\n     . . .\n\n     Magistrate Judge: So what you're telling me is that in\n     your view there's one case which was filed on 3/19/01,\n     and you're saying a second case was filed on 12/17/02?\n\n     Padró: From the start of having filed in court, from the\n     point of the administrative process they were two\n     distinct complaints. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fmatter that is pending in a United States District Court.\"   In its\n\naffirmation of this dismissal on September 16, 2002, the EEOC\n\nreasoned that \"the claims raised [in the first district court\n\naction] encompass the claim raised in the [2001 EEO claim].\"   But\n\nit was not until December 17, 2002 that Padró moved to amend his\n\nfirst complaint, which focused on his 1999 EEO claim, to add the\n\n2001 EEO claim.     That motion was granted on January 23, 2003.\n\nPadró's 2001 EEO claim was not a matter pending in the United\n\nStates District Court at the time the DOL and the EEOC dismissed\n\nthat claim.\n\n          Once the DOL considered the two EEO complaints one and\n\nthe same, it has never addressed them independently, on the merits\n\nor otherwise.     For example, after the magistrate judge allowed\n\nPadró to amend his initial complaint and add allegations from his\n\n2001 EEO complaint, the DOL did not file an amended answer to\n\nrespond to the new allegations.       Additionally, even now, the\n\ngovernment has not defended the EEOC's affirmation of the DOL's\n\ndismissal of the 2001 EEO complaint, choosing instead to address\n\nthe 1999 EEO complaint alone.5 The 2001 EEO complaint has been\n\nneglected by everyone -- the DOL, the EEOC, and the magistrate\n\njudge -- except Padró himself.6\n\n\n     5\n       It appears that the EEOC conflated Padró's two EEO claims,\nconsidering overlap to be the same as identity.\n     6\n       In his motion to consolidate, Padró noted that \"[t]he EEOC\naccepted and investigated [his 2001 EEO complaint] as a timely\n\n                               -10-\n\f           In comparable situations, when a district court has\n\ngranted summary judgment on a complaint while overlooking legal\n\nclaims properly before the court, we have remanded for further\n\nanalysis by the district court.   For example, in Colón-Santiago v.\n\nRosario, 438 F.3d 101 (1st Cir. 2006), we stated that \"[w]e have\n\npreviously remanded cases to the district court where there is at\n\nleast one significant legal issue, not squarely addressed by the\n\ndistrict court, that remains unresolved.\"     Id. at 112 (internal\n\ncitation, brackets, and quotation marks omitted).     In In re San\n\nJuan DuPont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 45 F.3d 564 (1st Cir. 1995),\n\nwe stated that when \"there [] remain[s] unresolved a significant\n\nlegal issue, not squarely addressed by the district court, [] we\n\nare persuaded that a remand is the most appropriate solution.\" Id.\n\nat 568.    Here, the magistrate judge did not address Padró's\n\ncontinuing violation theory of national origin discrimination, his\n\nretaliation claim, or his hostile work environment claim as set\n\nforth in his timely 2001 EEO claim.     The court should have done\n\nthat.   We remand for that purpose.\n\n\n\n\nseparate complaint. [I] also considered the Civil Action before\nthe Court and the administrative complaint separate and distinct\ncases, although . . . the resolution of the administrative\ncomplaint [the 2001 EEO complaint] would have also resolved the\ncaptioned civil action [the 1999 complaint], in as much as both\ncases entail charges of continuing discrimination.\" He also asked\nthat \"if the Court disallows the motion, [I] respectfully request[]\nthat the attached amendment be accepted as a new civil action.\"\n\n                               -11-\n\f                               III.\n\n          In summary, we affirm the magistrate judge's entry of\n\nsummary judgment on Padró's 1999 EEO claim.   We vacate the entry of\n\nsummary judgment on his 2001 claim, and remand for consideration of\n\nthat claim by the district court.   Costs are awarded to appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

The facts the magistrate judge relied on in his decision only describe the factual and procedural history of Padr&#243;'s 1999 EEO claim. There is no mention of the 2001 EEO claim even though the magistrate judge granted summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explaining his decision, the magistrate judge recounted Defendants' argument that they were entitled to summary judgment \"because Mr. Padr&#243; failed to exhaust administrative remedies for his claims of retaliation and discrimination.\" Relying on this argument alone, the magistrate judge concluded that \"a failure by Mr. Padr&#243; to file a formal complaint within the fifteen day period specified in the regulations, absent a showing of excuse by waiver, estoppel or equitable tolling, would bar him from filing a civil action based on that discriminatory complaint.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge devoted the balance of his decision to an explanation of why the doctrine of equitable tolling &#8212; which is available to a plaintiff who is \"excusably ignorant\" of the statutory filing period and has been affirmatively misled by the opposing party &#8212; did not apply to Padr&#243;'s complaint. <i>See Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co.,</i> 183 F.3d 38, 53 (1st Cir. 1999); <i>Mercado-Garcia v. Ponce Fed. Bank,</i> 979 F.2d 890, 896 (1st Cir.1992). The magistrate judge found that \"[t]here [wa]s no factual or legal basis to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling in this case\"; and that Padr&#243; had \"not specifically asserted claims of waiver, estoppel or equitable tolling....\" The magistrate judge explained that Padr&#243; rather \"argue[d] in his memorandum that the time limitation should not be imposed in his case because the discrimination was a continuing violation.\" Finding no merit to this argument, the magistrate judge granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Padr&#243;'s amended complaint, which included both the 1999 and 2001 EEO claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Padr&#243; does not appeal the magistrate judge's dismissal of his 1999 EEO claim. As the magistrate judge pointed out in his order, \"Mr. Padro admits that the filing of his [1999] formal complaint was untimely.\" But Padr&#243; emphasizes that his <i>\"whole case</i> was dismissed [by the magistrate judge] for failure to exhaust administrative remedies\" (emphasis added) even though his 2001 EEO claim &#8212; now part of his complaint as the result of an amendment &#8212; was timely filed. This disposition of his 2001 claim, he insists, was an error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The 2001 EEO claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to defend the magistrate judge's decision, the government notes his reference in the body of his decision to Padr&#243;'s continuing violation claim and the footnote attached to that reference: \"[e]ven if I were to consider the substance of the `continuing violation' argument proposed by Mr. Padro in his memorandum, there are insufficient facts to support such a contention.\" The government argues that the magistrate judge's reference to a \"continuing violation\" claim means that the magistrate judge \"was fully cognizant of Padro's second EEOC Complaint being separate and distinct from his first EEOC complaint.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not convinced. In the body of his opinion, the magistrate judge links Padr&#243;'s continuing violation argument to what he thought was Padr&#243;'s attempt to circumvent the time limitation period applicable to his 1999 EEO claim. This time limitation issue has nothing to do with Padr&#243;'s 2001 EEO claim. To the extent that the government argues that the magistrate judge's reference in his footnote to the \"substance\" of Padr&#243;'s continuing violation argument is a separate reference to Padr&#243;'s 2001 claim, we note that Padr&#243;'s 1999 claim also set forth a continuing violation argument. This oblique reference in a footnote does not assure us that the magistrate judge analyzed Padr&#243;'s 2001 claim at all, especially since every fact mentioned in the opinion relates to the 1999 claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the government's own actions belie its position that the 2001 EEO claim was addressed by the magistrate judge. The DOL dismissed the 2001 EEO claim on March 16, 2002 \"for being a matter that is pending in a United States District Court.\" In its affirmation of this dismissal on September 16, 2002, the EEOC reasoned that \"the claims raised [in the first district court action] encompass the claim raised in the [2001 EEO claim].\" But it was not until December 17, 2002 that Padr&#243; moved to amend his first complaint, which focused on his 1999 EEO claim, to add the 2001 EEO claim. That motion was granted on January 23, 2003. Padr&#243;'s 2001 EEO claim was not a matter pending in the United States District Court at the time the DOL and the EEOC dismissed that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the DOL considered the two EEO complaints one and the same, it has never addressed them independently, on the merits or otherwise. For example, after the magistrate judge allowed Padr&#243; to amend his initial complaint and add allegations from his 2001 EEO complaint, the DOL did not file an amended answer to respond to the new allegations. Additionally, even now, the government has not defended the EEOC's affirmation of the DOL's dismissal of the 2001 EEO complaint, choosing instead to address the 1999 EEO complaint alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The 2001 EEO complaint has been neglected by everyone &#8212; the DOL, the EEOC, and the magistrate judge &#8212; except Padr&#243; himself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In comparable situations, when a district court has granted summary judgment on a complaint while overlooking legal claims properly before the court, we have remanded for further analysis by the district court. For example, in <i>Col&#243;n-Santiago v. Rosario,</i> 438 F.3d 101 (1st Cir.2006), we stated that \"[w]e have previously remanded cases to the district court where there is at least one significant legal issue, not squarely addressed by the district court, that remains unresolved.\" <i>Id.</i> at 112 (internal citation, brackets, and quotation marks omitted). In <i>In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> 45 F.3d 564 (1st Cir.1995), we stated that when \"there [] remain[s] unresolved a significant legal issue, not squarely addressed by the district court, [] we are persuaded that a remand is the most appropriate solution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 568. Here, the magistrate judge did not address Padr&#243;'s continuing violation theory of national origin discrimination, his retaliation claim, or his hostile work environment claim as set forth in his timely 2001 EEO claim. The court should have done that. We remand for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we <i>affirm</i> the magistrate judge's entry of summary judgment on Padr&#243;'s 1999 EEO claim. We <i>vacate</i> the entry of summary judgment on his 2001 claim, and <i>remand</i> for consideration of that claim by the district court.

Here, that party is Padr&#243;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The magistrate judge's order and the 1999 EEO claim</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his decision granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment, the magistrate judge focused exclusively on the 1999 EEO claim in Padr&#243;'s amended complaint. The facts the magistrate judge relied on in his decision only describe the factual and procedural history of Padr&#243;'s 1999 EEO claim. There is no mention of the 2001 EEO claim even though the magistrate judge granted summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explaining his decision, the magistrate judge recounted Defendants' argument that they were entitled to summary judgment \"because Mr. Padr&#243; failed to exhaust administrative remedies for his claims of retaliation and discrimination.\" Relying on this argument alone, the magistrate judge concluded that \"a failure by Mr. Padr&#243; to file a formal complaint within the fifteen day period specified in the regulations, absent a showing of excuse by waiver, estoppel or equitable tolling, would bar him from filing a civil action based on that discriminatory complaint.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge devoted the balance of his decision to an explanation of why the doctrine of equitable tolling &#8212; which is available to a plaintiff who is \"excusably ignorant\" of the statutory filing period and has been affirmatively misled by the opposing party &#8212; did not apply to Padr&#243;'s complaint. <i>See Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765085\"><a href=\"/opinion/765085/myrtle-thomas-v-eastman-kodak-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir. 1999); <i>Mercado-Garcia v.

The magistrate judge found that \"[t]here [wa]s no factual or legal basis to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling in this case\"; and that Padr&#243; had \"not specifically asserted claims of waiver, estoppel or equitable tolling....\" The magistrate judge explained that Padr&#243; rather \"argue[d] in his memorandum that the time limitation should not be imposed in his case because the discrimination was a continuing violation.\" Finding no merit to this argument, the magistrate judge granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Padr&#243;'s amended complaint, which included both the 1999 and 2001 EEO claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Padr&#243; does not appeal the magistrate judge's dismissal of his 1999 EEO claim. As the magistrate judge pointed out in his order, \"Mr. Padro admits that the filing of his [1999] formal complaint was untimely.\" But Padr&#243; emphasizes that his <i>\"whole case</i> was dismissed [by the magistrate judge] for failure to exhaust administrative remedies\" (emphasis added) even though his 2001 EEO claim &#8212; now part of his complaint as the result of an amendment &#8212; was timely filed. This disposition of his 2001 claim, he insists, was an error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The 2001 EEO claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to defend the magistrate judge's decision, the government notes his reference in the body of his decision to Padr&#243;'s continuing violation claim and the footnote attached to that reference: \"[e]ven if I were to consider the substance of the `continuing violation' argument proposed by Mr. Padro in his memorandum, there are insufficient facts to support such a contention.\" The government argues that the magistrate judge's reference to a \"continuing violation\" claim means that the magistrate judge \"was fully cognizant of Padro's second EEOC Complaint being separate and distinct from his first EEOC complaint.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not convinced. In the body of his opinion, the magistrate judge links Padr&#243;'s continuing violation argument to what he thought was Padr&#243;'s attempt to circumvent the time limitation period applicable to his 1999 EEO claim. This time limitation issue has nothing to do with Padr&#243;'s 2001 EEO claim. To the extent that the government argues that the magistrate judge's reference in his footnote to the \"substance\" of Padr&#243;'s continuing violation argument is a separate reference to Padr&#243;'s 2001 claim, we note that Padr&#243;'s 1999 claim also set forth a continuing violation argument. This oblique reference in a footnote does not assure us that the magistrate judge analyzed Padr&#243;'s 2001 claim at all, especially since every fact mentioned in the opinion relates to the 1999 claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the government's own actions belie its position that the 2001 EEO claim was addressed by the magistrate judge. The DOL dismissed the 2001 EEO claim on March 16, 2002 \"for being a matter that is pending in a United States District Court.\" In its affirmation of this dismissal on September 16, 2002, the EEOC reasoned that \"the claims raised [in the first district court action] encompass the claim raised in the [2001 EEO claim].\" But it was not until December 17, 2002 that Padr&#243; moved to amend his first complaint, which focused on his 1999 EEO claim, to add the 2001 EEO claim. That motion was granted on January 23, 2003. Padr&#243;'s 2001 EEO claim was not a matter pending in the United States District Court at the time the DOL and the EEOC dismissed that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the DOL considered the two EEO complaints one and the same, it has never addressed them independently, on the merits or otherwise. For example, after the magistrate judge allowed Padr&#243; to amend his initial complaint and add allegations from his 2001 EEO complaint, the DOL did not file an amended answer to respond to the new allegations. Additionally, even now, the government has not defended the EEOC's affirmation of the DOL's dismissal of the 2001 EEO complaint, choosing instead to address the 1999 EEO complaint alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The 2001 EEO complaint has been neglected by everyone &#8212; the DOL, the EEOC, and the magistrate judge &#8212; except Padr&#243; himself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In comparable situations, when a district court has granted summary judgment on a complaint while overlooking legal claims properly before the court, we have remanded for further analysis by the district court. For example, in <i>Col&#243;n-Santiago v. Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202068\"><a href=\"/opinion/202068/colon-santiago-v-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006), we stated that \"[w]e have previously remanded cases to the district court where there is at least one significant legal issue, not squarely addressed by the district court, that remains unresolved.\" <i>Id.</i> at 112 (internal citation, brackets, and quotation marks omitted). In <i>In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195867\"><a href=\"/opinion/195867/in-re-san-juan-v-american-internation/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), we stated that when \"there [] remain[s] unresolved a significant legal issue, not squarely addressed by the district court, [] we are persuaded that a remand is the most appropriate solution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 568. Here, the magistrate judge did not address Padr&#243;'s continuing violation theory of national origin discrimination, his retaliation claim, or his hostile work environment claim as set forth in his timely 2001 EEO claim. The court should have done that. We remand for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we <i>affirm</i> the magistrate judge's entry of summary judgment on Padr&#243;'s 1999 EEO claim. We <i>vacate</i> the entry of summary judgment on his 2001 claim, and <i>remand</i> for consideration of that claim by the district court.

The formal complaint, if decided against the employee, can then be appealed to the EEOC.
