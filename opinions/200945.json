Lagueux, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jennifer A. Appleyard, by appointment of the court, on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Craig N. Moore, Acting United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart and Zechariah Chafee, Assistant United States Attorneys,\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             March 30, 2004\n\f          Per   Curiam.    Defendant-appellant   Gary   C.   Pettiford\n\npleaded guilty to two counts of bank robbery in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2113(a).   The district court, taking note of Pettiford's\n\nlong criminal record, sentenced him on April 22, 2003 as a career\n\noffender, USSG §4B1.1(a)-(b), to a 151-month incarcerative term.\n\nPettiford now appeals.    His able counsel, heroically trying to do\n\nmuch with little, has raised two issues. Despite the excellence of\n\ncounsel's efforts, neither warrants extended discussion.\n\n          First, Pettiford argues that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for a downward departure on the ground that the\n\ncareer offender designation overstated the gravity of his criminal\n\nhistory. See id. §4A1.3. The principal problem with this argument\n\n— there are several others, but we need not reach them — is the\n\ngeneral rule that a sentencing court's discretionary refusal to\n\ndepart is unreviewable. See United States v. Sanchez, 354 F.3d 70,\n\n76 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).     At first glance, that rule seems to control here\n\nbecause the decision whether to grant an \"overstatement\" departure\n\npursuant to section 4A1.3 lies primarily within the discretion of\n\nthe sentencing court.\n\n          Pettiford acknowledges this fact, but says that his case\n\nfalls within an exception to the unreviewability doctrine because\n\nthe sentencing court misapprehended its authority to depart.      Such\n\nan exception does exist.     See United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f14, 30 (1st Cir. 2001) (discussing this exception).               However, the\n\nrecord belies any suggestion that the exception pertains here.\n\n             No useful purpose would be served by a blow-by-blow\n\naccount of the colloquy at the disposition hearing.               The short of\n\nit is that the sentencing court voiced some uncertainty about its\n\nauthority to depart in the circumstances of this case,1 but made it\n\nperfectly clear that, if it had such authority, it would choose, as\n\na   matter   of   discretion,   not   to    exercise    that    discretion   in\n\nPettiford's favor. No more was exigible. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Londono-Quintero, 289 F.3d 147, 155 (1st Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 69 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             Pettiford's   attempt     to    blunt     the     force   of   this\n\nalternative holding fails.        He wrests a single sentence in the\n\ndistrict court's bench decision from its contextual moorings and\n\nattempts to use that sentence to prove his point.                  However, in\n\nanswering questions of this sort, appellate courts must read the\n\nrecord as a whole.     DeLeon, 187 F.3d at 69.         On an holistic view,\n\nthere is no plausible basis for a claim that the district court\n\nmisunderstood the extent of its authority.             See United States v.\n\nGrandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 564-65 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that\n\nmere ambiguity in the sentencing record is insufficient to render\n\n\n      1\n      The sentencing court's uncertainty was warranted.      This\ncourt, sitting en banc, has divided equally over whether district\ncourts may grant \"overstatement\" or \"smallness\" departures in\ncareer offender cases. See United States v. Perez, 160 F.3d 87,\n88-90 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc) (per curiam).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe   court's   refusal     to   depart   reviewable    on   appeal).      This\n\nassignment of error is, therefore, not properly before us.\n\n           Pettiford's      second   assignment   of    error   is    no   more\n\nrewarding. In it, he vigorously challenges a reckless endangerment\n\nenhancement, see USSG §3C1.2, proposed by the probation department\n\nand arguably accepted by the district court.2                The difficulty,\n\nhowever, is that this enhancement dropped out of the case once the\n\ndistrict court completed its factfinding and sentenced Pettiford\n\nunder the alternative career offender formulation.                See United\n\nStates v. Ventura, 353 F.3d 84, 90 (1st Cir. 2003) (describing the\n\nalternative sentencing calculations required in career offender\n\ncases).   The propriety of the proposed enhancement is, therefore,\n\nimmaterial.     See, e.g., United States v. Frazier, 340 F.3d 5, 7-8\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 971 (2003); United States v.\n\nRuiz-Garcia, 886 F.2d 474, 476 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           We   need   go   no   further.     Shortly   after   the     initial\n\npromulgation of the federal sentencing guidelines, we wrote that\n\n\"[s]entencing appeals prosecuted . . . in the tenuous hope that\n\nlightning may strike, ought not to be dignified with exegetic\n\nopinions, intricate factual synthesis, or full-dress explications\n\nof accepted legal principles.\" Ruiz-Garcia, 886 F.2d at 477. That\n\n\n\n      2\n      This proposed enhancement was based on Pettiford's behavior\nwhen the arresting officer initially attempted to apprehend him.\nFor reasons that soon will become apparent, the details need not\nconcern us.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fapothegm applies here.   Consequently, we content ourselves with\n\nthis brief description of why we reject Pettiford's appeal and\n\nsummarily affirm his conviction and sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
