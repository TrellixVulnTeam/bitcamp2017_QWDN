Plaintiffs-Appellants Isla\n\nNena Air Services, Inc. and its successor in interest San Juan Jet\n\nCharter,   Inc.   (hereinafter   \"Isla    Nena\")   brought   suit   against\n\ndefendants-appellees Cessna Aircraft Company (\"Cessna\") and Pratt\n\n& Whitney Canada Corporation (\"PWC\") in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico.             The complaint alleged\n\nclaims arising from an airplane crash near Culebra, an island\n\nmunicipality of Puerto Rico.         Isla Nena now appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of its complaint for failure to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief may be granted.        After careful review, we\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           Isla Nena is a Puerto Rico corporation that operates a\n\nshort-haul commercial airline in Puerto Rico.         Cessna is a Kansas\n\ncorporation that designs, manufactures, and sells aircraft. PWC is\n\na   Canadian   corporation   that   designs,   manufactures,   and   sells\n\naircraft engines.    On November 26, 2001, Isla Nena purchased a new\n\nCessna 208B (the \"Aircraft\") from Cessna and took delivery at\n\nCessna's factory delivery center in Wichita, Kansas.         The Aircraft\n\nwas powered by a PWC engine.\n\n           On August 30, 2003, the Aircraft was carrying nine\n\npassengers and a pilot from Fajardo, a city on the northeast coast\n\nof Puerto Rico, to Culebra, an island municipality of Puerto Rico\n\napproximately twenty miles east of Fajardo.         About five miles west\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fof the Culebra airport at an altitude of 2500 feet, in clear\n\nweather, the engine failed and the Aircraft lost power.   The pilot\n\nwas able to glide the Aircraft toward Flamenco Beach near Culebra\n\nand performed a controlled emergency water landing just off the\n\nbeach.   Following the landing, the pilot assisted all of the\n\npassengers -- none of whom were seriously injured -- to shore.   The\n\nAircraft suffered major damage to all of its components and the\n\nengine was destroyed.\n\n          After the accident, the National Transportation Safety\n\nBoard (\"NTSB\") conducted an investigation.     The NTSB determined\n\nthat certain rivets installed around an engine inlet duct were\n\neither fractured or corroded.   After the NTSB examined the engine,\n\nit was shipped back to PWC.     PWC examined the engine's component\n\nparts and found that the damage to the engine was consistent with\n\ningestion of a foreign object.     Isla Nena's theory is that the\n\nrivets were defectively designed or installed, causing them to\n\nbreak off, and that the rest of the engine failed when it ingested\n\none of the broken rivets.\n\n          On September 20, 2004, Isla Nena filed a six-count\n\ncomplaint against Cessna and PWC1 in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico.      The complaint asserted\n\ndiversity jurisdiction and contained claims for strict liability\n\n\n\n1\n   The complaint also alleged as defendants a John Doe, Jane Doe,\nRiver Doe, and Insurance Companies A, B, and C.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f(Counts I and II) and negligence (Counts III and IV).2                  The\n\ncomplaint sought to recover damages for loss of value to the\n\nAircraft and engine, cost to repair the Aircraft and engine, loss\n\nof use of the Aircraft, and lost profits.\n\n             On November 12, 2004, PWC filed a motion to dismiss\n\nCounts I-IV pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.      Cessna joined the motion.       The motion argued that,\n\ndespite   the     fact   that     the    complaint   asserted     diversity\n\njurisdiction,     federal    admiralty    jurisdiction   and    substantive\n\nadmiralty law applied.          Federal admiralty law has adopted the\n\n\"economic loss rule.\"       Under the economic loss rule as articulated\n\nby the United States Supreme Court, a party generally may not\n\nrecover damages in tort if a defective product damages only itself.\n\nSee E. River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., 476 U.S.\n\n858, 876 (1986).     Because the Aircraft damaged only itself, the\n\nmotion argued that Isla Nena's claims were barred by the economic\n\nloss rule.    In the alternative, the motion argued that Puerto Rico\n\nsubstantive law would also apply the economic loss rule.3              Isla\n\nNena opposed the motion, arguing that admiralty jurisdiction did\n\n\n\n2\n   The complaint also asserted a direct claim against Insurance\nCompanies A, B, and C (Count V), and a claim for indemnity for any\nclaims brought by the Aircraft's passengers (Count VI). Neither\ncount is part of this appeal.\n3\n   The parties do not appear to dispute whether Isla Nena has\nclaimed damages for only economic loss -- that is, to the Aircraft\nitself.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fnot apply and that the economic loss rule did not apply under\n\nPuerto Rico law.   In January 2005, the parties filed replies and\n\nsur-replies.   On March 16, 2005, an initial scheduling conference\n\nwas held and the issues raised in the motions were discussed.\n\nSimultaneous supplemental briefs were filed on April 11, 2005, and\n\nsimultaneous supplemental responses were filed on April 22, 2005.\n\nOn July 11, 2005, Isla Nena filed a motion for leave to supplement\n\nthe record, arguing for the first time that, even if federal\n\nadmiralty jurisdiction applied, under the Puerto Rico Dock and\n\nHarbor Act the court was bound to apply Puerto Rico law.\n\n           On August 9, 2005, the district court granted the motion\n\nto dismiss.    The court found that admiralty jurisdiction applied\n\nand therefore that Isla Nena's tort claims were barred by the\n\neconomic loss rule.   The court also found that, even if Puerto Rico\n\nlaw applied, the result would be the same because Puerto Rico law\n\nwould follow the economic loss rule.     Finally, the court denied\n\nIsla Nena's motion to supplement but stated that, even if it were\n\nto allow the motion, the economic loss rule would still apply.   The\n\ncourt therefore entered partial judgment with respect to Counts I-\n\nIV.   Thereafter, Isla Nena agreed to drop Counts V and VI, and the\n\npartial judgment was modified to a final judgment on August 30,\n\n2005.   Isla Nena has timely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f                                     II.\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review a district court's decision to grant a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo, taking as true the well-pleaded\n\nfacts in the complaint.       Vistamar, Inc. v. Fagundo-Fagundo, 430\n\nF.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nB.   The Economic Loss Rule\n\n            Under the economic loss rule, a party generally may not\n\nrecover in tort when a defective product harms only the product\n\nitself (instead of a person or other property).            See, e.g., East\n\nRiver, 476 U.S. at 867-68; Lockheed Martin Corp. v. RFI Supply,\n\nInc., 440 F.3d 549, 552-53 (1st Cir. 2006) (applying New Hampshire\n\nlaw); Restatement (Third) of Torts: Prod. Liab. § 21, comment d\n\n(1998).     Under the formulation of the rule that the majority of\n\ncourts have adopted, a party may not recover in tort \"[e]ven when\n\nthe harm to the product itself occurs through an abrupt, accident-\n\nlike event.\"    East River, 476 U.S. at 870.\n\n            East River is an admiralty case; therefore, if we were to\n\napply federal admiralty law, Isla Nena's claims would be barred by\n\nthe economic loss rule, as it is undisputed that the defect in the\n\nAircraft caused damage to the Aircraft and nothing else.             However,\n\nthe instant case presents an unresolved question as to whether\n\nadmiralty    jurisdiction   should    apply,   and   the   Supreme    Court's\n\nprecedents on this issue have not been entirely clear.                If the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\feconomic loss rule applies under Puerto Rico law, we need not reach\n\nthe question of admiralty jurisdiction and could leave that issue\n\naside for the Court to clarify at a later date.                  Because we find\n\nthat Puerto Rico courts would apply the economic loss rule, we\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court and do not address\n\nwhether admiralty jurisdiction should apply.\n\nC.   Puerto Rico Law and the Economic Loss Rule\n\n            The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has not directly addressed\n\nwhether the economic loss rule is applicable under Puerto Rico law.\n\nWe therefore \"look to analogous state court decisions, persuasive\n\nadjudications by courts of the states, learned treatises, and\n\npublic policy considerations . . . in order to make an informed\n\nprophecy of how the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would rule.\"                   Pérez-\n\nTrujillo    v.   Volvo     Car   Corp.,       137   F.3d   50,   55   (1st    Cir.\n\n1998)(quoting Rodríguez-Surís v. Montesinos, 123 F.3d 10, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 1997))(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Article 1802 of Puerto Rico's Civil Code, 31 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. § 5141, provides for a right of action stemming from a\n\nperson's negligence.       Although neither Article 1802 nor any other\n\nprovision   of   the     Civil   Code   has     explicitly   incorporated      the\n\ndoctrine of strict liability, it is well-settled that Puerto Rico\n\ncourts have adopted that doctrine under Article 1802.                 See Guevara\n\nv. Dorsey Labs., Inc., 845 F.2d 364, 365 (1st Cir. 1988)(stating\n\nthat, under Article 1802, \"the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdeveloped    a   strict   liability    standard   for   manufacturers   of\n\ndefective products\");     Rivera-Santana v. Superior Packaging, Inc.,\n\n132 P.R. Dec. 115, 126, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830, 1992 WL 754830\n\n(1992).   We begin by discussing Article 1802 and the economic loss\n\nrule.\n\n            1.   Article 1802 and the Economic Loss Rule\n\n            Article 1802 provides that \"[a] person who by an act or\n\nomission causes damage to another party through fault or negligence\n\nshall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\"         31 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§ 5141.     After careful consideration, we believe that the Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court would rule that the economic loss rule bars an\n\naction under Article 1802 where a defective product harms only\n\nitself.\n\n            We addressed an issue similar to the present one in\n\nBetancourt v. W.D. Schock Corp., 907 F.2d 1251 (1st Cir. 1990).         In\n\nthat case, a plaintiff found a serious defect in a sailboat he had\n\npurchased and sued the manufacturer.        The plaintiff sued in both\n\ntort and contract under Puerto Rico law, seeking damages for his\n\ninvestment in the boat, upkeep of the boat, and alleged pain and\n\nmental anguish he suffered because the boat did not work properly.\n\nWe held that the plaintiff could not assert a tort claim because\n\n\"Puerto Rico's negligence statute, [31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5141], does\n\nnot apply in the context of a commercial transaction.\"        Id. at 1255\n\n(citing Stainless Steel & Metal Mfg. v. Sacal V.I., Inc., 452 F.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fSupp. 1073, 1081 (D.P.R. 1978)); see also Nieves Domenech v. Dymax\n\nCorp., 952 F. Supp. 57, 65 (D.P.R. 1996).          We also stated that the\n\nplaintiff could not re-label what was in essence a warranty action\n\nas a tort action.    In support of this point, we quoted from East\n\nRiver:\n\n           Even when the harm to the product itself\n           occurs through an abrupt, accident-like event,\n           the resulting loss . . . is essentially the\n           failure of the purchaser to receive the\n           benefit of its bargain . . . .             [A]\n           manufacturer in a commercial relationship has\n           no duty under either a negligence or strict\n           products-liability theory to prevent a product\n           from injuring itself.\n\nBetancourt, 907 F.2d at 1255 (quoting East River, 476 U.S. at 870-\n\n72).\n\n           The instant case presents basically the same situation as\n\nBetancourt.    However,    Isla   Nena    argues   that   our   decision   in\n\nBetancourt misapprehended Puerto Rico law because Puerto Rico law\n\n\"does not preclude claims for strict liability or negligence simply\n\nbecause a warranty claim is not available or not pursued.\"             Isla\n\nNena argues that, under the doctrine of concurrence of actions, a\n\nparty may elect which cause of action to bring if the party has a\n\nchoice between valid contract and tort claims.            Isla Nena relies\n\nprincipally on two cases in support of its argument:             Márquez v.\n\nTorres   Campos,   111   P.R.   Dec.     854   (1982)   (official   English\n\ntranslation: No. R-79-101, slip op. (P.R. Jan. 18, 1982)), and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fRamos Lozada v. Orientalist Rattan Furniture, Inc., 130 P.R. Dec.\n\n712 (1992).4   We discuss each in turn.\n\n          In Márquez -- which we discussed in Betancourt -- the\n\ndefendant sold the plaintiff cattle that had tuberculosis and\n\nfailed to tell the plaintiff that the cattle had been quarantined.\n\nAs a result, the plaintiff's farm was put under quarantine and the\n\nplaintiff suffered damage to other cattle and farm animals.      The\n\nplaintiff brought suit, and the defendant claimed that the suit was\n\nbarred by a statute of limitations governing suits for hidden\n\nproduct defects.    The Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled that \"the\n\naction of warranty for hidden defects does not by itself exclude\n\nother actions that may lie under the special circumstances of the\n\ncase.\" Id. at 1094.   The court eventually held that the suit could\n\nbe brought under a theory of contractual deceit, as opposed to\n\nwarranty, and that a longer limitation period applied.     In support\n\nof this holding, the court emphasized that\n\n          plaintiff's cause of action arises, not from\n          the objective fact of the defect in the object\n          of the contract, which is what gives life to\n          an action of warranty, but from a subjective\n          circumstance provoked by the defendant's\n          deceitful action which resulted in damages\n          that go beyond the defect in the object of the\n          contract and which is thus outside the frame\n          of the concept of warranty.\n\n\n4\n   Although Ramos Lozada has not yet been included in the Official\nTranslations of the Opinions of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico,\nthe parties have provided an official English translation. When we\ncite to specific pages of the case, we are referring to the pages\nof the translation provided by the parties.\n\n                               -10-\n\fId. at 1105 (emphasis added).     Unlike the plaintiff in Márquez,\n\nIsla Nena's claims rest solely upon \"the objective fact of the\n\ndefect in the object of the contract.\"    Id.   Further, the damages\n\nthat resulted from the defect did not go beyond the defect in the\n\nobject of the contract; they were limited to the product itself.\n\nIn other words, the damages that Isla Nena seeks are squarely\n\ninside \"the frame of the concept of warranty.\"    Id.   We thus find\n\nthat Márquez is unhelpful to Isla Nena's case.\n\n           Isla Nena also argues that our holding in Betancourt has\n\nbeen undermined by Ramos Lozada, which was decided two years after\n\nBetancourt.    In that case, some leased property was destroyed\n\nfollowing a fire that was attributable to the lessee's negligence.\n\nThe lessor sued under a theory of breach of contract (the lease\n\nagreement), which had a longer statute of limitations than an\n\naction under Article 1802.     However, because the lessor's theory\n\nwas that the fire was the result of the lessee's negligence, the\n\ntrial court held that Article 1802 -- along with its statute of\n\nlimitations -- applied and dismissed the action as untimely.      On\n\nappeal, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court reversed.      The court held\n\nthat \"a claim for noncontractual damages resulting from the breach\n\nof a contract lies if the act that caused the damage constitutes a\n\nbreach of a general duty not to injure anyone and, at the same\n\ntime, a breach of contract.\"    Ramos Lozada, 130 P.R. Dec. 712 at\n\n*8.   However, the court also emphasized that an action for breach\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fof contract only lies \"when the damage suffered arises exclusively\n\nas a consequence of the breach of an obligation specifically agreed\n\nupon, which damage would not occur without the existence of a\n\ncontract.\"   Id.\n\n          After careful consideration, we do not think that Ramos\n\nLozada changes the result we reached in Betancourt.   We base this\n\nconclusion on several factors.     First, Ramos Lozada involved a\n\nlessor-lessee relationship.     It did not involve a commercial\n\ntransaction, and we see nothing in the case to indicate that the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court intended to replace the general rule that\n\nArticle 1802 does not apply in commercial transactions.\n\n          Second, Ramos Lozada in no way implicated the economic\n\nloss rule, which is a     rule peculiar to the law of products\n\nliability and applies only where a defective product harms itself.\n\nRamos Lozada holds only that if a party has valid claims stemming\n\nfrom both tort and contract, that party may choose under which\n\ntheory to bring her claims.   However, the argument in this case is\n\nthat Isla Nena does not have a valid tort claim due to the economic\n\nloss rule.   Ramos Lozada never addressed this particular point --\n\nwhat it means to have a valid tort claim in the product liability\n\ncontext -- and for good reason, since the case involved a lessor-\n\nlessee relationship and did not implicate the economic loss rule.\n\nIn other words, in Ramos-Lozada, the injury arose not from a defect\n\nin the leased property but from the lessee's negligence.   There is\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fsimply no indication that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court intended to\n\napply Ramos Lozada in the products liability context or intended to\n\nmake a pronouncement on the economic loss rule or our decision in\n\nBetancourt, even though it must have been aware of that decision.5\n\n            Third, Ramos-Lozada emphasized that a party may not\n\nchoose whether to proceed in contract or tort \"when the damage\n\nsuffered exclusively arises as a consequence of the breach of an\n\nobligation specifically agreed upon, which damage would not occur\n\nwithout the existence of a contract.\"                   Id.; see also Nieves\n\nDomenech, 952 F. Supp. at 66 (explaining that, under Ramos Lozada,\n\nin order to bring a negligence claim based on a contractual\n\nrelationship, the \"general duty not to act negligently must arise\n\nout of conditions separate from the parties' contract.                     If a\n\nplaintiff's damages arise exclusively from a defendant's alleged\n\nbreach of contract, the plaintiff does not have a separate cause of\n\naction    for    negligence\")   (emphasis     added)     (internal     citations\n\nomitted).       In the instant case, assuming Isla Nena's claims are\n\ntrue, the damage suffered -- harm to the product contracted for --\n\narose    exclusively   as   a   consequence    of   a    breach   of   contract.\n\nFurther, the damages would not have occurred without the existence\n\n\n\n5\n  If Isla Nena were arguing that the appellees' alleged negligence\nbreached a contract or warranty and also caused damage to other\nproperty besides the defective product, Isla Nena would potentially\nhave valid contract and tort claims and could, under the doctrine\nof concurrence of actions, choose whether to proceed in contract or\ntort.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fof a contract.         Therefore, even assuming that the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme     Court    intended   Ramos    Lozada   to   apply   in   the   present\n\ncontext, Isla Nena still would not have any valid claims under\n\nArticle 1802.\n\n             We also think that application of the economic loss rule\n\nis in accord with the policies underlying contract and tort law,\n\nwhich the United States Supreme Court has extensively discussed in\n\nEast River.         Although East River is an admiralty case, and its\n\ndecision is therefore not controlling in determining Puerto Rico\n\nlaw,   we   think     the   policy   rationales    explained    by    the   Court\n\nlogically apply to the decision we reach today.                     See Lockheed\n\nMartin, 440 F.3d at 553-54 (applying the policy rationales in East\n\nRiver to a case involving New Hampshire law after finding that New\n\nHampshire had adopted the economic loss doctrine).                    First, the\n\ndamages suffered by Isla Nena in this case are essentially those\n\nfor which the law of warranty is best suited.             In East River, the\n\nCourt stated that, where a malfunctioning product harms only\n\nitself, \"the resulting loss due to repair costs, decreased value,\n\nand lost profits is essentially the failure of the purchaser to\n\nreceive the benefit of its bargain -- traditionally the core\n\nconcern of contract law.\"            476 U.S. at 870.     Second, commercial\n\ntransactions such as the one involved in this case \"generally [do]\n\nnot involve large disparities of bargaining power.\"                  Id. at 873.\n\nThe law of warranty is therefore particularly well-suited to govern\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fsuch   commercial   controversies    because    \"[t]he   manufacturer   can\n\nrestrict its liability . . . by disclaiming warranties or limiting\n\nremedies.    In exchange, the purchaser pays less for the product.\"\n\nId. (internal citations omitted).      We think this particular policy\n\nconcern helps explain the general rule in Puerto Rico that Article\n\n1802 does not apply in commercial transactions.              Finally, the\n\napplication of the economic loss rule in this context prevents the\n\nerasure of the line between tort law and contract law.             As the\n\nCourt explained, \"[p]roducts liability grew out of a public policy\n\njudgment that people need more protection from dangerous products\n\nthan is afforded by the law of warranty.           It is clear, however,\n\nthat if this development were allowed to progress too far, contract\n\nlaw would drown in a sea of tort.\"         Id. at 866 (internal citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            In conclusion, we see nothing in Ramos Lozada to indicate\n\nan intention to set aside our holding in Betancourt or to provide\n\nfor the application of Article 1802 in commercial transactions.\n\nFurther, even if we were to read Ramos Lozada that broadly, it\n\nwould be of no use to Isla Nena because the damages claimed arose\n\nentirely from the parties' contractual relationship and would not\n\nhave occurred apart from the parties' contract.          We therefore find\n\nthat, under Puerto Rico law, Isla Nena's claims are barred by the\n\neconomic loss rule.     See Torres-Mas v. Carver Boat Corp., 233 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 253, 255-56 (D.P.R. 2002)(stating that, where plaintiff\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\falleged damages for defects in a boat, \"[t]here are no allegations\n\n. . . regarding specific damages or injuries to plaintiff which\n\nwould intimate either an action in torts or a products liability\n\nsuit\") (citing Betancourt, 907 F.2d at 1254).\n\n          2.   Strict Liability\n\n          Although the previous section applies to both Isla Nena's\n\nnegligence   and   strict   liability    claims,   there   are   additional\n\nreasons -- that do not apply to Isla Nena's negligence claims -- to\n\nfind that the economic loss rule bars Isla Nena's strict liability\n\nclaims due to the history and evolution of the doctrine of strict\n\nliability in Puerto Rico.     We address these briefly.\n\n          As we stated above, the doctrine of strict liability is\n\nfound nowhere in Puerto Rico's Civil Code.         Instead, the doctrine\n\nhas been adopted by the Puerto Rico courts under principles flowing\n\nfrom Article 1802.     Guevara, 845 F.2d at 365.           In adopting the\n\nstrict liability doctrine, the Puerto Rico courts have relied upon\n\nUnited States common law product liability principles \"to fill a\n\ngap in our body of laws.\"      Rivera-Santana, 132 P.R. Dec. at 126\n\nn.4, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830 n.4.6        In particular, the Puerto Rico\n\n\n6\n  We have stated that \"[t]he Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has made\nclear that the common law of the United States is not controlling,\nwhen filling gaps in the civil law system.\" See Guevara, 845 F.2d\nat 366. However, in Guevara we also noted that \"when faced with a\nlack of authority, it may be appropriate to search for relevant\nprinciples in the common law.\" Id. (internal citations omitted).\nWe then went on to state that \"[s]ince the [Puerto Rico] Supreme\nCourt has freely taken from common law decisions in developing the\nconcept of strict liability, and since the principles we find there\n\n                                  -16-\n\fSupreme Court has consistently relied upon the precedent of the\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court for its strict liability jurisprudence.\n\nCollazo-Santiago v. Toyota Motor Corp., 149 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    We think this background provides additional reasons to\n\nfind that the Puerto Rico courts would apply the economic loss rule\n\nto Isla Nena's strict liability claims.\n\n             First,    one   of      the   seminal    cases     setting    forth   the\n\neconomic loss rule is from the California Supreme Court.                    In Seely\n\nv.   White    Motor   Co.,     403    P.2d    145,    150-51     (Cal.    1965),   the\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that a party could not recover in\n\ntort -- under either negligence or strict liability theories -- if\n\na defective product damaged only itself.7                  Since the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme      Court    has    borrowed       much     of   its    strict    liability\n\njurisprudence from the California Supreme Court, we think it likely\n\nthat   the    court    would      also     incorporate    this    portion    of    the\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court's strict liability jurisprudence. Second,\n\nit is undisputed that the vast majority of courts have adopted the\n\neconomic loss rule in some form. See, e.g., Lockheed Martin Corp.,\n\n440 F.3d at 553 n.6 (noting that \"the majority of courts have held\n\n\n\nare useful and persuasive, we believe the Supreme Court of Puerto\nRico would follow essentially the same path we follow today.\" Id.\nWe follow that same course today.\n7\n   In East River, the United States Supreme Court cited to and\ndiscussed Seely with approval and also noted that Seely represented\nthe majority view on the economic loss rule. East River, 476 U.S.\nat 868.\n\n                                           -17-\n\fthat a party may not recover in tort when a product's malfunction\n\ndamages only the product itself\").     Given the fact that the Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court has relied on United States common law in\n\nformulating its strict liability jurisprudence, we think it likely\n\nthat the court would also adopt the majority view as to the\n\neconomic loss rule.\n\n           In sum, the majority common law view, including the view\n\nof the California Supreme Court, is that a party may not recover in\n\nstrict liability if a product's defect damages only the product\n\nitself.   Given the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's general reliance on\n\nUnited States common law strict liability principles and its\n\nspecific reliance on California Supreme Court precedent -- and\n\nabsent any indication to the contrary -- we think it clear that the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court would hold that the economic loss rule\n\nbars Isla Nena's strict liability claims.8\n\n\n\n\n8\n   Isla Nena cites to several cases that, it argues, indicate that\nthe Puerto Rico courts would not adopt the economic loss rule in\ncases involving strict liability.         These cases are easily\ndistinguishable from the present case.      For example, Isla Nena\nrelies on In Re Dupont-Benlate Litig., 877 F. Supp. 779 (D.P.R.\n1995). However, as appellees point out, that case did not involve\na defective product causing injury only to itself. Rather, the\ncase involved a claim that a defect in a fungicide caused damage to\nother property (plaintiffs' crops).       Id. at 782.    Thus, the\ndistrict court's discussion of strict liability and \"economic loss\"\nis inapposite to the instant case because \"economic loss\" as used\nby the Dupont-Benlate court clearly referred to \"injury to property\nbesides the defective product,\" as opposed to \"injury to the\ndefective product itself.\"\n\n                                -18-\n\f                              III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f",

(hereinafter \"Isla Nena\") brought suit against defendants-appellees Cessna Aircraft Company (\"Cessna\") and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada Corporation (\"PWC\") in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The complaint alleged claims arising from an airplane crash near Culebra, an island municipality of Puerto Rico. Isla Nena now appeals from the district court's dismissal of its complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. After careful review, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isla Nena is a Puerto Rico corporation that operates a short-haul commercial airline in Puerto Rico. Cessna is a Kansas corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells aircraft. PWC is a Canadian corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells aircraft engines. On November 26, 2001, Isla Nena purchased a new Cessna 208B (the \"Aircraft\") from Cessna and took delivery at Cessna's factory delivery center in Wichita, Kansas. The Aircraft was powered by a PWC engine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 30, 2003, the Aircraft was carrying nine passengers and a pilot from Fajardo, a city on the northeast coast of Puerto Rico, to Culebra, an island municipality of Puerto Rico approximately twenty miles east of Fajardo. About five miles west of the Culebra airport at an altitude of 2500 feet, in clear weather, the engine failed and the Aircraft lost power. The pilot was able to glide the Aircraft toward Flamenco Beach near Culebra and performed a controlled emergency water landing just off the beach. Following the landing, the pilot assisted all of the passengers &#8212; none of whom were seriously injured &#8212; to shore. The Aircraft suffered major damage to all of its components and the engine was destroyed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board (\"NTSB\") conducted an investigation. The NTSB determined that certain rivets installed around an engine inlet duct were either fractured or corroded. After the NTSB examined the engine, it was shipped back to PWC. PWC examined the engine's component parts and found that the damage to the engine was consistent with ingestion of a foreign object. Isla Nena's theory is that the rivets were defectively designed or installed, causing them to break off, and that the rest of the engine failed when it ingested one of the broken rivets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, 2004, Isla Nena filed a six-count complaint against Cessna and PWC<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The complaint asserted diversity jurisdiction and contained claims for strict liability (Counts I and II) and negligence (Counts III and IV).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The complaint sought to recover damages for loss of value to the Aircraft and engine, cost to repair the Aircraft and engine, loss of use of the Aircraft, and lost profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 12, 2004, PWC filed a motion to dismiss Counts I-IV pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Cessna joined the motion. The motion argued that, despite the fact that the complaint asserted diversity jurisdiction, federal admiralty jurisdiction and substantive admiralty law applied. Federal admiralty law has adopted the \"economic loss rule.\" Under the economic loss rule as articulated by the United States Supreme Court, a party generally may not recover damages in tort if a defective product damages only itself. <i>See E. River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc.,</i> 476 U.S. 858, 876, 106 S.Ct. 2295, 90 L.Ed.2d 865 (1986). Because the Aircraft damaged only itself, the motion argued that Isla Nena's claims were barred by the economic loss rule. In the alternative, the motion argued that Puerto Rico substantive law would also apply the economic loss rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Isla Nena opposed the motion, arguing that admiralty jurisdiction did not apply and that the economic loss rule did not apply under Puerto Rico law. In January 2005, the parties filed replies and surreplies. On March 16, 2005, an initial scheduling conference was held and the issues raised in the motions were discussed. Simultaneous supplemental briefs were filed on April 11, 2005, and simultaneous supplemental responses were filed on April 22, 2005. On July 11, 2005, Isla Nena filed a motion for leave to supplement the record, arguing for the first time that, even if federal admiralty jurisdiction applied, under the Puerto Rico Dock and Harbor Act the court was bound to apply Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 9, 2005, the district court granted the motion to dismiss. The court found that admiralty jurisdiction applied and therefore that Isla Nena's tort claims were barred by the economic loss rule. The court also found that, even if Puerto Rico law applied, the result would be the same because Puerto Rico law would follow the economic loss rule. Finally, the court denied Isla Nena's motion to supplement but stated that, even if it were to allow the motion, the economic loss rule would still apply. The court therefore entered partial judgment with respect to Counts I-IV. Thereafter, Isla Nena agreed to drop Counts V and VI, and the partial judgment was modified to a final judgment on August 30, 2005. Isla Nena has timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Under the formulation of the rule that the majority of courts have adopted, a party may not recover in tort \"[e]ven when the harm to the product itself occurs through an abrupt, accident-like event.\" <i>East River,</i> 476 U.S. at 870, 106 S.Ct. 2295.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>East River</i> is an admiralty case; therefore, if we were to apply federal admiralty law, Isla Nena's claims would be barred by the economic loss rule, as it is undisputed that the defect in the Aircraft caused damage to the Aircraft and nothing else. However, the instant case presents an unresolved question as to whether admiralty jurisdiction should apply, and the Supreme Court's precedents on this issue have not been entirely clear. If the economic loss rule applies under Puerto Rico law, we need not reach the question of admiralty jurisdiction and could leave that issue aside for the Court to clarify at a later date. Because we find that Puerto Rico courts would apply the economic loss rule, we affirm the judgment of the district court and do not address whether admiralty jurisdiction should apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Laws Ann. &#167; 5141, provides for a right of action stemming from a person's negligence. Although neither Article 1802 nor any other provision of the Civil Code has explicitly incorporated the doctrine of strict liability, it is well-settled that Puerto Rico courts have adopted that doctrine under Article 1802. <i>See Guevara v. Dorsey Labs., Inc.,</i> 845 F.2d 364, 365 (1st Cir.1988)(stating that, under Article 1802, \"the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has developed a strict liability standard for manufacturers of defective products\"); <i>Rivera-Santana v. Superior Packaging, Inc.,</i> 132 P.R. Dec. 115, 126, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830, 1992 WL 754830 (1992).

W.D. Schock Corp.,</i> 907 F.2d 1251 (1st Cir.1990). In that case, a plaintiff found a serious defect in a sailboat he had purchased and sued the manufacturer. The plaintiff sued in both tort and contract under Puerto Rico law, seeking damages for his investment in the boat, upkeep of the boat, and alleged pain and mental anguish he suffered because the boat did not work properly. We held that the plaintiff could not assert a tort claim because \"Puerto Rico's negligence statute, [31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5141], does not apply in the context of a commercial transaction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1255 (citing <i>Stainless Steel &amp; Metal Mfg. v.

We also stated that the plaintiff could not re-label what was in essence a warranty action as a tort action. In support of this point, we quoted from <i>East River:</i> Even when the harm to the product itself occurs through an abrupt, accident-like event, the resulting loss ... is essentially the failure of the purchaser to receive the benefit of its bargain .... [A] manufacturer in a commercial relationship has no duty under either a negligence or strict products-liability theory to prevent a product from injuring itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Betancourt,</i> 907 F.2d at 1255 (quoting <i>East River,</i> 476 U.S. at 870-72, 106 S.Ct. 2295).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case presents basically the same situation as <i>Betancourt.</i> However, Isla Nena argues that our decision in <i>Betancourt</i> misapprehended Puerto Rico law because Puerto Rico law \"does not preclude claims for strict liability or negligence simply because a warranty claim is not available or not pursued.\" Isla Nena argues that, under the doctrine of concurrence of actions, a party may elect which cause of action to bring if the party has a choice between valid contract and tort claims. Isla Nena relies principally on two cases in support of its argument: <i>M&#225;rquez v. Torres Campos,</i> 111 P.R.

The plaintiff brought suit, and the defendant claimed that the suit was barred by a statute of limitations governing suits for hidden product defects. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled that \"the action of warranty for hidden defects does not by itself exclude other actions that may lie under the special circumstances of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1094. The court eventually held that the suit could be brought under a theory of contractual deceit, as opposed to warranty, and that a longer limitation period applied. In support of this holding, the court emphasized that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">plaintiff's cause of action arises, <i>not from the objective fact of the defect in the object of the contract,</i> which is what gives life to an action of warranty, but from a subjective circumstance provoked by the defendant's deceitful action <i>which resulted in damages that go beyond the defect in the object of the contract</i> and which is thus outside the frame of the concept of warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1105 (emphasis added). Unlike the plaintiff in <i>M&#225;rquez,</i> Isla Nena's claims rest solely upon \"the objective fact of the defect in the object of the contract.\" <i>Id.</i> Further, the damages that resulted from the defect did <i>not</i> go beyond the defect in the object of the contract; they were limited to the product itself. In other words, the damages that Isla Nena seeks are squarely inside \"the frame of the concept of warranty.\" <i>Id.</i> We thus find that <i>M&#225;rquez</i> is unhelpful to Isla Nena's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isla Nena also argues that our holding in <i>Betancourt</i> has been undermined by <i>Ramos Lozada,</i> which was decided two years after <i>Betancourt.</i> In that case, some leased property was destroyed following a fire that was attributable to the lessee's negligence. The lessor sued under a theory of breach of contract (the lease agreement), which had a longer statute of limitations than an action under Article 1802. However, because the lessor's theory was that the fire was the result of the lessee's negligence, the trial court held that Article 1802 &#8212; along with its statute of limitations &#8212; applied and dismissed the action as untimely. On appeal, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court reversed. The court held that \"a claim for noncontractual damages resulting from the breach of a contract lies if the act that caused the damage constitutes a breach of a general duty not to injure anyone and, at the same time, a breach of contract.\" <i>Ramos Lozada,</i> 130 P.R. Dec. 712 at *8, 1992 WL 755597. However, the court also emphasized that an action for breach of contract only lies \"when the damage suffered arises exclusively as a consequence of the breach of an obligation specifically agreed upon, which damage would not occur without the existence of a contract.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration, we do not think that <i>Ramos Lozada</i> changes the result we reached in <i>Betancourt.</i> We base this conclusion on several factors. First, <i>Ramos Lozada</i> involved a lessor-lessee relationship. It did not involve a commercial transaction, and we see nothing in the case to indicate that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court intended to replace the general rule that Article 1802 does not apply in commercial transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Ramos Lozada</i> in no way implicated the economic loss rule, which is a rule peculiar to the law of products liability and applies only where a defective product harms itself. <i>Ramos Lozada</i> holds only that if a party has <i>valid</i> claims stemming from both tort and contract, that party may choose under which theory to bring her claims. However, the argument in this case is that Isla Nena does not have a valid tort claim due to the economic loss rule. <i>Ramos Lozada</i> never addressed this particular point &#8212; what it means to have a valid tort claim in the product liability context &#8212; and for good reason, since the case involved a lessor-lessee relationship and did not implicate the economic loss rule. In other words, in <i>Ramos-Lozada,</i> the injury arose not from a defect in the leased property but from the lessee's negligence. There is simply no indication that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court intended to apply <i>Ramos Lozada</i> in the products liability context or intended to make a pronouncement on the economic loss rule or our decision in <i>Betancourt,</i> even though it must have been aware of that decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, <i>Ramos-Lozada</i> emphasized that a party may not choose whether to proceed in contract or tort \"when the damage suffered exclusively arises as a consequence of the breach of an obligation specifically agreed upon, which damage would not occur without the existence of a contract.\" <i>Id.; see also Nieves Domenech,</i> 952 F.Supp. at 66 (explaining that, under <i>Ramos Lozada,</i> in order to bring a negligence claim based on a contractual relationship, the \"general duty not to act negligently must arise out of conditions <i>separate from the parties' contract.</i> If a plaintiff's damages arise exclusively from a defendant's alleged breach of contract, the plaintiff does not have a separate cause of action for negligence\") (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). In the instant case, assuming Isla Nena's claims are true, the damage suffered &#8212; harm to the product contracted for &#8212; arose exclusively as a consequence of a breach of contract. Further, the damages would not have occurred without the existence of a contract. Therefore, even assuming that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court intended <i>Ramos Lozada</i> to apply in the present context, Isla Nena still would not have any valid claims under Article 1802.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also think that application of the economic loss rule is in accord with the policies underlying contract and tort law, which the United States Supreme Court has extensively discussed in <i>East River.</i> Although <i>East River</i> is an admiralty case, and its decision is therefore not controlling in determining Puerto Rico law, we think the policy rationales explained by the Court logically apply to the decision we reach today. <i>See Lockheed Martin,</i> 440 F.3d at 553-54 (applying the policy rationales in <i>East River</i> to a case involving New Hampshire law after finding that New Hampshire had adopted the economic loss doctrine). First, the damages suffered by Isla Nena in this case are essentially those for which the law of warranty is best suited. In <i>East River,</i> the Court stated that, where a malfunctioning product harms only itself, \"the resulting loss due to repair costs, decreased value, and lost profits is essentially the failure of the purchaser to receive the benefit of its bargain &#8212; traditionally the core concern of contract law.\" 476 U.S. at 870, 106 S.Ct. 2295. Second, commercial transactions such as the one involved in this case \"generally [do] not involve large disparities of bargaining power.\" <i>Id.</i> at 873, 106 S.Ct. 2295. The law of warranty is therefore particularly well-suited to govern such commercial controversies because \"[t]he manufacturer can restrict its liability .. . by disclaiming warranties or limiting remedies. In exchange, the purchaser pays less for the product.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). We think this particular policy concern helps explain the general rule in Puerto Rico that Article 1802 does not apply in commercial transactions. Finally, the application of the economic loss rule in this context prevents the erasure of the line between tort law and contract law. As the Court explained, \"[p]roducts liability grew out of a public policy judgment that people need more protection from dangerous products than is afforded by the law of warranty. It is clear, however, that if this development were allowed to progress too far, contract law would drown in a sea of tort.\" <i>Id.</i> at 866, 106 S.Ct. 2295 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we see nothing in <i>Ramos Lozada</i> to indicate an intention to set aside our holding in <i>Betancourt</i> or to provide for the application of Article 1802 in commercial transactions. Further, even if we were to read <i>Ramos Lozada</i> that broadly, it would be of no use to Isla Nena because the damages claimed arose entirely from the parties' contractual relationship and would not have occurred apart from the parties' contract. We therefore find that, under Puerto Rico law, Isla Nena's claims are barred by the economic loss rule. <i>See Torres-Mas v. Carver Boat Corp.,</i> 233 F.Supp.2d 253, 255-56 (D.P.R.2002)(stating that, where plaintiff alleged damages for defects in a boat, \"[t]here are no allegations ... regarding specific damages or injuries to plaintiff which would intimate either an action in torts or a products liability suit\") (citing <i>Betancourt,</i> 907 F.2d at 1254).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Strict Liability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the previous section applies to both Isla Nena's negligence and strict liability claims, there are additional reasons &#8212; that do not apply to Isla Nena's negligence claims &#8212; to find that the economic loss rule bars Isla Nena's strict liability claims due to the history and evolution of the doctrine of strict liability in Puerto Rico. We address these briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated above, the doctrine of strict liability is found nowhere in Puerto Rico's Civil Code. Instead, the doctrine has been adopted by the Puerto Rico courts under principles flowing from Article 1802. <i>Guevara,</i> 845 F.2d at 365. In adopting the strict liability doctrine, the Puerto Rico courts have relied upon United States common law product liability principles \"to fill a gap in our body of laws.\" <i>Rivera-Santana,</i> 132 P.R. Dec. at 126 n. 4, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830 n. 4, 1992 WL 754830.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In particular, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has consistently relied upon the precedent of the California Supreme Court for its strict liability jurisprudence. <i>Collazo-Santiago v. Toyota Motor Corp.,</i> 149 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1998). We think this background provides additional reasons to find that the Puerto Rico courts would apply the economic loss rule to Isla Nena's strict liability claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, one of the seminal cases setting forth the economic loss rule is from the California Supreme Court. In <i>Seely v. White Motor Co.,</i> 63 Cal.2d 9, 45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d 145, 150-51 (1965), the California Supreme Court held that a party could not recover in tort &#8212; under either negligence or strict liability theories &#8212; if a defective product damaged only itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Since the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has borrowed much of its strict liability jurisprudence from the California Supreme Court, we think it likely that the court would also incorporate this portion of the California Supreme Court's strict liability jurisprudence. Second, it is undisputed that the vast majority of courts have adopted the economic loss rule in some form. <i>See, e.g., Lockheed Martin Corp.,</i> 440 F.3d at 553 n. 6 (noting that \"the majority of courts have held that a party may not recover in tort when a product's malfunction damages only the product itself\"). Given the fact that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has relied on United States common law in formulating its strict liability jurisprudence, we think it likely that the court would also adopt the majority view as to the economic loss rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the majority common law view, including the view of the California Supreme Court, is that a party may not recover in strict liability if a product's defect damages only the product itself. Given the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's general reliance on United States common law strict liability principles and its specific reliance on California Supreme Court precedent &#8212; and absent any indication to the contrary &#8212; we think it clear that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would hold that the economic loss rule bars Isla Nena's strict liability claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint also alleged as defendants a John Doe, Jane Doe, River Doe, and Insurance Companies A, B, and C</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint also asserted a direct claim against Insurance Companies A, B, and C (Count V), and a claim for indemnity for any claims brought by the Aircraft's passengers (Count VI).

However, in <i>Guevara</i> we also noted that \"when faced with a lack of authority, it may be appropriate to search for relevant principles in the common law.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). We then went on to state that \"[s]ince the [Puerto Rico] Supreme Court has freely taken from common law decisions in developing the concept of strict liability, and since the principles we find there are useful and persuasive, we believe the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would follow essentially the same path we follow today.\" <i>Id.</i> We follow that same course today.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In<i>East River,</i> the United States Supreme Court cited to and discussed <i>Seely</i> with approval and also noted that <i>Seely</i> represented the majority view on the economic loss rule. <i>East River,</i> 476 U.S. at 868, 106 S.Ct. 2295.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Isla Nena cites to several cases that, it argues, indicate that the Puerto Rico courts would not adopt the economic loss rule in cases involving strict liability. These cases are easily distinguishable from the present case. For example, Isla Nena relies on<i>In Re Dupont-Benlate Litig.,</i> 877 F.Supp. 779 (D.P.R.1995). However, as appellees point out, that case did not involve a defective product causing injury only to itself. Rather, the case involved a claim that a defect in a fungicide caused damage to <i>other property</i> (plaintiffs' crops). <i>Id.</i> at 782. Thus, the district court's discussion of strict liability and \"economic loss\" is inapposite to the instant case because \"economic loss\" as used by the <i>Dupont-Benlate</i> court clearly referred to \"injury to property besides the defective product,\" as opposed to \"injury to the defective product itself.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(hereinafter \"Isla Nena\") brought suit against defendants-appellees Cessna Aircraft Company (\"Cessna\") and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada Corporation (\"PWC\") in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The complaint alleged claims arising from an airplane crash near Culebra, an island municipality of Puerto Rico. Isla Nena now appeals from the district court's dismissal of its complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. After careful review, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isla Nena is a Puerto Rico corporation that operates a short-haul commercial airline in Puerto Rico. Cessna is a Kansas corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells aircraft. PWC is a Canadian corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells aircraft engines. On November 26, 2001, Isla Nena purchased a new Cessna 208B (the \"Aircraft\") from Cessna and took delivery at Cessna's factory delivery center in Wichita, Kansas. The Aircraft was powered by a PWC engine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 30, 2003, the Aircraft was carrying nine passengers and a pilot from Fajardo, a city on the northeast coast of Puerto Rico, to Culebra, an island municipality of Puerto Rico approximately twenty miles east of Fajardo. About five miles west of the Culebra airport at an altitude of 2500 feet, in clear weather, the engine failed and the Aircraft lost power. The pilot was able to glide the Aircraft toward Flamenco Beach near Culebra and performed a controlled emergency water landing just off the beach. Following the landing, the pilot assisted all of the passengers &#8212; none of whom were seriously injured &#8212; to shore. The Aircraft suffered major damage to all of its components and the engine was destroyed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board (\"NTSB\") conducted an investigation. The NTSB determined that certain rivets installed around an engine inlet duct were either fractured or corroded. After the NTSB examined the engine, it was shipped back to PWC. PWC examined the engine's component parts and found that the damage to the engine was consistent with ingestion of a foreign object. Isla Nena's theory is that the rivets were defectively designed or installed, causing them to break off, and that the rest of the engine failed when it ingested one of the broken rivets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, 2004, Isla Nena filed a six-count complaint against Cessna and PWC<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The complaint asserted diversity jurisdiction and contained claims for strict liability (Counts I and II) and negligence (Counts III and IV).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The complaint sought to recover damages for loss of value to the Aircraft and engine, cost to repair the Aircraft and engine, loss of use of the Aircraft, and lost profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 12, 2004, PWC filed a motion to dismiss Counts I-IV pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Cessna joined the motion. The motion argued that, despite the fact that the complaint asserted diversity jurisdiction, federal admiralty jurisdiction and substantive admiralty law applied. Federal admiralty law has adopted the \"economic loss rule.\" Under the economic loss rule as articulated by the United States Supreme Court, a party generally may not recover damages in tort if a defective product damages only itself. <i>See E.

In the alternative, the motion argued that Puerto Rico substantive law would also apply the economic loss rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Isla Nena opposed the motion, arguing that admiralty jurisdiction did not apply and that the economic loss rule did not apply under Puerto Rico law. In January 2005, the parties filed replies and surreplies. On March 16, 2005, an initial scheduling conference was held and the issues raised in the motions were discussed. Simultaneous supplemental briefs were filed on April 11, 2005, and simultaneous supplemental responses were filed on April 22, 2005. On July 11, 2005, Isla Nena filed a motion for leave to supplement the record, arguing for the first time that, even if federal admiralty jurisdiction applied, under the Puerto Rico Dock and Harbor Act the court was bound to apply Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 9, 2005, the district court granted the motion to dismiss. The court found that admiralty jurisdiction applied and therefore that Isla Nena's tort claims were barred by the economic loss rule. The court also found that, even if Puerto Rico law applied, the result would be the same because Puerto Rico law would follow the economic loss rule. Finally, the court denied Isla Nena's motion to supplement but stated that, even if it were to allow the motion, the economic loss rule would still apply. The court therefore entered partial judgment with respect to Counts I-IV. Thereafter, Isla Nena agreed to drop Counts V and VI, and the partial judgment was modified to a final judgment on August 30, 2005.

In support of this point, we quoted from <i>East River:</i> Even when the harm to the product itself occurs through an abrupt, accident-like event, the resulting loss ... is essentially the failure of the purchaser to receive the benefit of its bargain ....

Isla Nena relies principally on two cases in support of its argument: <i>M&#225;rquez v.

Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></span> (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We discuss each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>M&#225;rquez</i> &#8212; which we discussed in <i>Betancourt</i> &#8212; the defendant sold the plaintiff cattle that had tuberculosis and failed to tell the plaintiff that the cattle had been quarantined. As a result, the plaintiff's farm was put under quarantine and the plaintiff suffered damage to other cattle and farm animals. The plaintiff brought suit, and the defendant claimed that the suit was barred by a statute of limitations governing suits for hidden product defects. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled that \"the action of warranty for hidden defects does not by itself exclude other actions that may lie under the special circumstances of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1094. The court eventually held that the suit could be brought under a theory of contractual deceit, as opposed to warranty, and that a longer limitation period applied. In support of this holding, the court emphasized that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">plaintiff's cause of action arises, <i>not from the objective fact of the defect in the object of the contract,</i> which is what gives life to an action of warranty, but from a subjective circumstance provoked by the defendant's deceitful action <i>which resulted in damages that go beyond the defect in the object of the contract</i> and which is thus outside the frame of the concept of warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1105 (emphasis added). Unlike the plaintiff in <i>M&#225;rquez,</i> Isla Nena's claims rest solely upon \"the objective fact of the defect in the object of the contract.\" <i>Id.</i> Further, the damages that resulted from the defect did <i>not</i> go beyond the defect in the object of the contract; they were limited to the product itself. In other words, the damages that Isla Nena seeks are squarely inside \"the frame of the concept of warranty.\" <i>Id.</i> We thus find that <i>M&#225;rquez</i> is unhelpful to Isla Nena's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isla Nena also argues that our holding in <i>Betancourt</i> has been undermined by <i>Ramos Lozada,</i> which was decided two years after <i>Betancourt.</i> In that case, some leased property was destroyed following a fire that was attributable to the lessee's negligence. The lessor sued under a theory of breach of contract (the lease agreement), which had a longer statute of limitations than an action under Article 1802. However, because the lessor's theory was that the fire was the result of the lessee's negligence, the trial court held that Article 1802 &#8212; along with its statute of limitations &#8212; applied and dismissed the action as untimely. On appeal, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court reversed. The court held that \"a claim for noncontractual damages resulting from the breach of a contract lies if the act that caused the damage constitutes a breach of a general duty not to injure anyone and, at the same time, a breach of contract.\" <i>Ramos Lozada,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></span> at *8, 1992 WL 755597. However, the court also emphasized that an action for breach of contract only lies \"when the damage suffered arises exclusively as a consequence of the breach of an obligation specifically agreed upon, which damage would not occur without the existence of a contract.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration, we do not think that <i>Ramos Lozada</i> changes the result we reached in <i>Betancourt.</i> We base this conclusion on several factors. First, <i>Ramos Lozada</i> involved a lessor-lessee relationship. It did not involve a commercial transaction, and we see nothing in the case to indicate that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court intended to replace the general rule that Article 1802 does not apply in commercial transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Ramos Lozada</i> in no way implicated the economic loss rule, which is a rule peculiar to the law of products liability and applies only where a defective product harms itself. <i>Ramos Lozada</i> holds only that if a party has <i>valid</i> claims stemming from both tort and contract, that party may choose under which theory to bring her claims. However, the argument in this case is that Isla Nena does not have a valid tort claim due to the economic loss rule. <i>Ramos Lozada</i> never addressed this particular point &#8212; what it means to have a valid tort claim in the product liability context &#8212; and for good reason, since the case involved a lessor-lessee relationship and did not implicate the economic loss rule. In other words, in <i>Ramos-Lozada,</i> the injury arose not from a defect in the leased property but from the lessee's negligence. There is simply no indication that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court intended to apply <i>Ramos Lozada</i> in the products liability context or intended to make a pronouncement on the economic loss rule or our decision in <i>Betancourt,</i> even though it must have been aware of that decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, <i>Ramos-Lozada</i> emphasized that a party may not choose whether to proceed in contract or tort \"when the damage suffered exclusively arises as a consequence of the breach of an obligation specifically agreed upon, which damage would not occur without the existence of a contract.\" <i>Id.; see also Nieves Domenech,</i> 952 F.Supp. at 66 (explaining that, under <i>Ramos Lozada,</i> in order to bring a negligence claim based on a contractual relationship, the \"general duty not to act negligently must arise out of conditions <i>separate from the parties' contract.</i> If a plaintiff's damages arise exclusively from a defendant's alleged breach of contract, the plaintiff does not have a separate cause of action for negligence\") (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). In the instant case, assuming Isla Nena's claims are true, the damage suffered &#8212; harm to the product contracted for &#8212; arose exclusively as a consequence of a breach of contract. Further, the damages would not have occurred without the existence of a contract. Therefore, even assuming that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court intended <i>Ramos Lozada</i> to apply in the present context, Isla Nena still would not have any valid claims under Article 1802.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also think that application of the economic loss rule is in accord with the policies underlying contract and tort law, which the United States Supreme Court has extensively discussed in <i>East River.</i> Although <i>East River</i> is an admiralty case, and its decision is therefore not controlling in determining Puerto Rico law, we think the policy rationales explained by the Court logically apply to the decision we reach today. <i>See Lockheed Martin,</i> 440 F.3d at 553-54 (applying the policy rationales in <i>East River</i> to a case involving New Hampshire law after finding that New Hampshire had adopted the economic loss doctrine). First, the damages suffered by Isla Nena in this case are essentially those for which the law of warranty is best suited. In <i>East River,</i> the Court stated that, where a malfunctioning product harms only itself, \"the resulting loss due to repair costs, decreased value, and lost profits is essentially the failure of the purchaser to receive the benefit of its bargain &#8212; traditionally the core concern of contract law.\" 476 U.S. at 870, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111693\"><a href=\"/opinion/111693/east-river-ss-corp-v-transamerica-delaval-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2295</span></a></span>. Second, commercial transactions such as the one involved in this case \"generally [do] not involve large disparities of bargaining power.\" <i>Id.</i> at 873, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111693\"><a href=\"/opinion/111693/east-river-ss-corp-v-transamerica-delaval-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2295</span></a></span>. The law of warranty is therefore particularly well-suited to govern such commercial controversies because \"[t]he manufacturer can restrict its liability .. . by disclaiming warranties or limiting remedies. In exchange, the purchaser pays less for the product.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). We think this particular policy concern helps explain the general rule in Puerto Rico that Article 1802 does not apply in commercial transactions. Finally, the application of the economic loss rule in this context prevents the erasure of the line between tort law and contract law. As the Court explained, \"[p]roducts liability grew out of a public policy judgment that people need more protection from dangerous products than is afforded by the law of warranty. It is clear, however, that if this development were allowed to progress too far, contract law would drown in a sea of tort.\" <i>Id.</i> at 866, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111693\"><a href=\"/opinion/111693/east-river-ss-corp-v-transamerica-delaval-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Further, even if we were to read <i>Ramos Lozada</i> that broadly, it would be of no use to Isla Nena because the damages claimed arose entirely from the parties' contractual relationship and would not have occurred apart from the parties' contract. We therefore find that, under Puerto Rico law, Isla Nena's claims are barred by the economic loss rule. <i>See Torres-Mas v. Carver Boat Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2309947\"><a href=\"/opinion/2309947/torres-mas-v-carver-boat-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We address these briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated above, the doctrine of strict liability is found nowhere in Puerto Rico's Civil Code. Instead, the doctrine has been adopted by the Puerto Rico courts under principles flowing from Article 1802. <i>Guevara,</i> 845 F.2d at 365. In adopting the strict liability doctrine, the Puerto Rico courts have relied upon United States common law product liability principles \"to fill a gap in our body of laws.\" <i>Rivera-Santana,</i> 132 P.R. Dec. at 126 n. 4, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830 n. 4, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">754830</span></span>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In particular, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has consistently relied upon the precedent of the California Supreme Court for its strict liability jurisprudence. <i>Collazo-Santiago v.

Second, it is undisputed that the vast majority of courts have adopted the economic loss rule in some form. <i>See, e.g., Lockheed Martin Corp.,</i> 440 F.3d at 553 n. 6 (noting that \"the majority of courts have held that a party may not recover in tort when a product's malfunction damages only the product itself\"). Given the fact that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has relied on United States common law in formulating its strict liability jurisprudence, we think it likely that the court would also adopt the majority view as to the economic loss rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the majority common law view, including the view of the California Supreme Court, is that a party may not recover in strict liability if a product's defect damages only the product itself. Given the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's general reliance on United States common law strict liability principles and its specific reliance on California Supreme Court precedent &#8212; and absent any indication to the contrary &#8212; we think it clear that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would hold that the economic loss rule bars Isla Nena's strict liability claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint also alleged as defendants a John Doe, Jane Doe, River Doe, and Insurance Companies A, B, and C</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint also asserted a direct claim against Insurance Companies A, B, and C (Count V), and a claim for indemnity for any claims brought by the Aircraft's passengers (Count VI).

However, in <i>Guevara</i> we also noted that \"when faced with a lack of authority, it may be appropriate to search for relevant principles in the common law.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). We then went on to state that \"[s]ince the [Puerto Rico] Supreme Court has freely taken from common law decisions in developing the concept of strict liability, and since the principles we find there are useful and persuasive, we believe the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would follow essentially the same path we follow today.\" <i>Id.</i> We follow that same course today.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In<i>East River,</i> the United States Supreme Court cited to and discussed <i>Seely</i> with approval and also noted that <i>Seely</i> represented the majority view on the economic loss rule. <i>East River,</i> 476 U.S. at 868, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111693\"><a href=\"/opinion/111693/east-river-ss-corp-v-transamerica-delaval-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These cases are easily distinguishable from the present case. For example, Isla Nena relies on<i>In Re Dupont-Benlate Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1397348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1397348/in-re-dupont-benlate-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">779</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1995). However, as appellees point out, that case did not involve a defective product causing injury only to itself. Rather, the case involved a claim that a defect in a fungicide caused damage to <i>other property</i> (plaintiffs' crops). <i>Id.</i> at 782. Thus, the district court's discussion of strict liability and \"economic loss\" is inapposite to the instant case because \"economic loss\" as used by the <i>Dupont-Benlate</i> court clearly referred to \"injury to property besides the defective product,\" as opposed to \"injury to the defective product itself.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
