Morris E.

Rao, Attorney, Criminal Division, Appellate\nSection, United States Department of Justice, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Peter K.\nLevitt, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                      September 11, 2009\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the Tenth Circuit, “sitting by designation”.\n\f       EBEL, Circuit Judge.             In this direct criminal appeal,\n\nSean    Bucci   challenges        his    sixteen   convictions    for   drug\n\ntrafficking, money laundering and tax evasion, his resulting\n\n151-month prison sentence, and a forfeiture order.                  Having\n\njurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1291,\n\nwe AFFIRM.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       The evidence presented at trial established that Bucci’s\n\nco-defendant Anthony Belmonte sold Bucci approximately 300\n\nto 350 pounds of marijuana eight or nine times each year,\n\nover the course of three and one-half years.                 Following a\n\nnine-month investigation, the United States charged Bucci\n\nwith sixteen counts of drug trafficking, money laundering\n\nand tax evasion.          At trial, Bucci acknowledged that he was\n\na marijuana dealer, but disputed the amount of marijuana\n\nwith which he was charged.               The jury found Bucci guilty on\n\nall sixteen charges and specifically found that the charged\n\ndrug-trafficking conspiracy involved over 1,000 kilograms of\n\nmarijuana.          The    jury     also     returned   several    special\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\fforfeiture verdicts against Bucci. 1          The district court then\n\nsentenced Bucci to 151 months in prison.\n\nII.       DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Challenges to the indictments\n\n      1.      Vindictive prosecution\n\n      The United States initially indicted Bucci, along with\n\nBelmonte      and   another   co-defendant,   Darren   Martin,    on   two\n\ndrug-trafficking charges: 1) conspiring to possess at least\n\n100 kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; and 2) possessing at least 100\n\nkilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(vii).                 The\n\nindictment also charged that any of Bucci’s property that\n\nrepresented proceeds from his drug-trafficking offenses was\n\nforfeitable under 21 U.S.C. § 853.\n\n      A year later, in August 2004, Bucci started a website,\n\nwhosarat.com, where individuals could post information about\n\ngovernment informants.         Six months after Bucci started this\n\nwebsite,      the   Government,   on   February   3,   2005,     filed   a\n\nsuperseding indictment which charged only Bucci and Martin\n\n\n      1\n     Specifically, the jury found $2 million forfeitable as\ndrug proceeds, and $700,000 forfeitable as part of Bucci’s\nmoney laundering conspiracy.   In addition, the jury found\nthat Bucci’s home, vehicle, boat, and the funds in three of\nhis bank accounts and an investment account should all be\nforfeited.\n\n                                  - 3 -\n\fwith the same two drug-trafficking counts, but increased the\n\namount of marijuana charged in the alleged conspiracy from\n\n100 to at least 1000 kilograms.                         The increased amount of\n\nmarijuana       charged      raised      the    statutory        mandatory         minimum\n\nsentence       Bucci       faced    for        the      conspiracy        offense,      if\n\nconvicted,          from   five     to       ten     years.         See      21     U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A)(vii).\n\n       A year after Bucci started whosarat.com, the Government,\n\non    July    28,    2005,   filed       a   second        superseding       indictment\n\ncharging Bucci with the same two drug-trafficking offenses,\n\nbut    adding       fourteen       additional           counts     involving         money\n\nlaundering,          tax     evasion,          and        unlawfully       structuring\n\nfinancial transactions to avoid reporting requirements.                                The\n\nsecond       superseding      indictment           also    added    Bucci’s        mother,\n\nCatherine Bucci, as a co-defendant.\n\n       Bucci claims that the Government’s decision to file the\n\ntwo superseding indictments in his case—which increased the\n\nnumber of charges against him from two to sixteen and the\n\namount of marijuana charged in the alleged drug-trafficking\n\nconspiracy from 100 to at least 1,000 kilograms—amounted to\n\nvindictive prosecution intended to punish him for exercising\n\nhis    First        Amendment       right          to     operate      his        website,\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 4 -\n\fwhosarat.com. 2   Bucci sought to prove vindictive prosecution\n\nby demonstrating circumstances establishing a likelihood of\n\nvindictiveness sufficient to create a presumption that the\n\nprosecution was, in fact, acting vindictively.           See United\n\nStates v. Jenkins, 537 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2008), cert.\n\ndenied, 129 S. Ct. 433 (2008).       It is difficult to make such\n\na   showing   pretrial,   however,     in   light   of   the   broad\n\ndiscretion afforded the prosecutor to determine who should\n\nbe prosecuted and for what crime, and the presumption that\n\nthe prosecutor has exercised that discretion in good faith. 3\n\n\n\n     2\n     The Government does not dispute that Bucci’s website\nenjoys First Amendment protection.     We therefore assume,\nwithout deciding, that that is so.     See United States v.\nCarmichael, 326 F. Supp. 2d 1267, 1270 (holding similar\nwebsite “constitutes protected speech”), supplemented by 326\nF. Supp. 2d 1303 (M.D. Ala. 2004).\n     3\n     In   contrast  to  a  pretrial   claim  of  vindictive\nprosecution, like the one presented here, the Supreme Court\nhas recognized that the Government’s decision to increase\nthe charges brought against a defendant after he has once\nbeen convicted may more readily create a presumption of\nvindictiveness:\n\n     [O]nce a trial begins—and certainly by the time a\n     conviction has been obtained—it is much more likely\n     that the [Government] has discovered and assessed\n     all of the information against an accused and has\n     made a determination, on the basis of that\n     information, of the extent to which he should be\n     prosecuted.    Thus, a change in the charging\n     decision made after an initial trial is completed\n     is much more likely to be improperly motivated than\n     is a pretrial decision.\n\nUnited States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 381 (1982).\n\n                             - 5 -\n\fSee   United    States    v.   Goodwin,       457   U.S.   368,     377,   380-81\n\n(1982); cf. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464-65\n\n(1996)         (discussing           presumption       in      context         of\n\nselective-prosecution claim).\n\n      In our system, so long as the prosecutor has\n      probable  cause   to   believe   that the   accused\n      committed an offense defined by statute, the\n      decision whether or not to prosecute, and what\n      charge to file or bring before a grand jury,\n      generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s]\n      discretion.     Within   the   limits set   by  the\n      legislature’s constitutionally valid definition of\n      chargeable offenses, the conscious exercise of some\n      selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a\n      federal constitutional violation so long as the\n      selection was not deliberately based upon an\n      unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or\n      other arbitrary classification.\n\nBordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364 (1978) (quotation,\n\ncitation, alteration, footnote omitted).\n\n           a.     Denial of Bucci’s discovery request\n\n      In the district court, Bucci sought discovery from the\n\nGovernment in order to support his vindictive-prosecution\n\nclaim.    The district court denied that request.                     We review\n\nthat decision for an abuse of discretion.                   See United States\n\nv.    Lewis,    517    F.3d    20,    23   (1st     Cir.    2008)    (reviewing\n\nselective-prosecution claim).\n\n                  i.     Applicable standard\n\n      In light of the presumption that a prosecutor has acted\n\nin good faith in exercising his discretion to make charging\n\ndecisions,      courts    require      a   defendant       seeking    discovery\n\n                                      - 6 -\n\ffirst to come forth with “some” objective evidence tending\n\nto show the existence of prosecutorial vindictiveness.                               See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Wilson, 262 F.3d 305, 315 (4th Cir.\n\n2001); United States v. Sanders, 211 F.3d 711, 717 (2d Cir.\n\n2000).       These courts derive this standard from United States\n\nv. Armstrong, see 517 U.S. at 468, in which the Supreme\n\nCourt     addressed         discovery      sought       in        support        of     a\n\nselective-prosecution          claim.        See      Wilson,          262     F.3d    at\n\n315-16; Sanders, 211 F.3d at 717.               This is the standard that\n\nthe district court applied in Bucci’s case, and we adopt it\n\nhere.\n\n                  ii.   Whether Bucci made such a showing here\n\n       In order to obtain discovery, then, Bucci first had to\n\nadvance        some     evidence        tending         to        establish           his\n\nvindictive-prosecution claim.              He failed to do so.\n\n       In support of his discovery motion, Bucci relied on “the\n\nstatements       of   law    enforcement        and     government            officers\n\nreporting       whosarat.com       contained       in    .        .     .    newspaper\n\narticles,       documents,     and   security       reports.”                While    the\n\nreported      statements      of   these   officers          expressed         serious\n\nconcern about the danger to informants posed by postings\n\nmade    on    Bucci’s    website,       Bucci     set    forth          no    evidence\n\nsuggesting that this concern ever affected the prosecutors\n\nmaking    the    specific     charging     decisions         in       his    case.     To\n\n\n                                     - 7 -\n\fobtain discovery, Bucci must do more than simply “identify\n\na potential motive for prosecutorial animus.”                     Sanders, 211\n\nF.3d at 718.        He must connect any vindictive animus to those\n\nmaking the challenged charging decisions in his case.                        See\n\nUnited States v. Goulding, 26 F.3d 656, 662 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n       Bucci also relied on evidence regarding the Government’s\n\nopposition      to      a     pretrial     motion    Bucci’s     co-defendant,\n\nCatherine Bucci, filed in this case seeking early disclosure\n\nof statements made by Government witnesses.                          In opposing\n\nthat request, the Government noted that, while it generally\n\nwould not oppose early disclosure, in this case it would not\n\nagree to it because of the Government’s concern that Bucci\n\nwas    trying      to       intimidate     Government      witnesses     through\n\nwhosarat.com.               In   opposing    Catherine      Bucci’s      motion,\n\nhowever,     the     Government      was    only    asserting    a    legitimate\n\nlitigation strategy.             The fact that it was based in part on\n\nthe effects the information posted on Bucci’s website might\n\nhave    on   this    specific       prosecution      did   not   suggest    that\n\nprosecutors filed the superseding indictments against Bucci\n\nto retaliate against him for operating the website.                          See\n\nUnited States v. Segal, 495 F.3d 826, 833 (7th Cir. 2007)\n\n(“A prosecutor cannot be said to act vindictively by taking\n\ninto account a defendant’s perceived efforts to intimidate\n\nwitnesses.”).\n\n\n                                         - 8 -\n\f       In    support       of      his    discovery      request,         Bucci       further\n\nrelied       on     the    general          circumstances      attendant              to     his\n\nprosecution,           asserting         that    the   prosecutor         all    along       had\n\nenough evidence to charge him with the added offenses and\n\nincreased         amount      of    marijuana,         but   did    not        bring       those\n\ncharges until after Bucci started whosarat.com.                                      Assuming\n\nthat    the       Government        had     enough     evidence      to    indict          Bucci\n\ninitially         on    the     increased        charges,     this       fact     alone       is\n\ninsufficient to establish that the Government later filed\n\nthe      superseding               indictments         to    punish            Bucci         for\n\nwhosarat.com.             See United States v. Roach, 502 F.3d 425,\n\n444-45 (6th Cir. 2007) (rejecting argument that the fact\n\nthat the Government could have brought charges initially,\n\nbut      did        not       do      so,        indicated         the         prosecutor’s\n\nvindictiveness), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 2051 (2008).\n\n       Moreover, “evidence of suspicious timing alone does not\n\nindicate prosecutorial animus.”                        United States v. Cooper,\n\n461 F.3d 850, 856 (7th Cir. 2006) (quotations omitted).                                       In\n\nany event, the district court noted that “the sequence of\n\nevents       in    this    case      is    not    so   remarkable         as    to    justify\n\ndiscovery.”            We agree.         Bucci began operating his website in\n\nAugust 2004.            It was six months later that the Government\n\nfiled       the    first      superseding         indictment,       and        another       six\n\nmonths before the Government filed the second superseding\n\n\n                                             - 9 -\n\findictment          against         Bucci.           These        superseding           indictments\n\nwere     not        so     close         in      time       to     Bucci’s            starting     the\n\nwhosarat.com             website         to    provide       strong         evidence      that     the\n\nprosecutor          acted           vindictively.                 See       United       States     v.\n\nMarrapese, 826 F.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting two\n\nevents    that       were       “well          removed       in    time”      were      not    strong\n\nevidence of actual vindictiveness).\n\n       For all of these reasons, we cannot conclude that the\n\ndistrict       court           abused          its   discretion             in    denying        Bucci\n\ndiscovery in support of his vindictive-prosecution claim.\n\n               b.        Denial of motion to dismiss indictment\n\n       Despite           not    being         able     to    conduct         discovery,          Bucci\n\nnevertheless              moved          for     the        dismissal            of    the     second\n\nsuperseding indictment, asserting that it was the result of\n\nvindictive prosecution.                        The district court denied Bucci’s\n\nmotion.    We review that decision for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSee United States v. Poole, 407 F.3d 767, 772 (6th Cir.\n\n2005).    But in applying this deferential standard, we review\n\nany ancillary factual findings for clear error and relevant\n\nlegal     determinations                  de     novo.            See       United       States     v.\n\nAviles-Sierra, 531 F.3d 123, 126 (1st Cir. 2008).                                            We agree\n\nwith the Government that the “subsidiary question” presented\n\nhere,     whether               Bucci          established              a     presumption           of\n\nvindictiveness,                is    a    legal      determination               that    we    should\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\freview de novo.    See United States v. Barner, 441 F.3d 1310,\n\n1315 n.5 (11th Cir. 2006); Wilson, 262 F.3d at 316.\n\n    Bucci argues that he presented evidence to the district\n\ncourt     sufficient   to     establish        a   presumption       of\n\nvindictiveness and shift the burden to the prosecution to\n\nshow it had legitimate reasons for increasing the charges\n\nagainst him.    We reject that argument, for the same reasons\n\ndiscussed above.\n\n    2.     Denial of motion to dismiss Count 5 as time-barred\n\n    Bucci moved for the dismissal of the second superseding\n\nindictment’s fifth count, arguing that it was time-barred.\n\nBecause   the   pertinent   facts    are    undisputed,   this    court\n\nreviews de novo the district court’s decision to deny that\n\nmotion.    See United States v. DeLeon, 444 F.3d 41, 51 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n    The    relevant    statute      of     limitations,   18     U.S.C.\n\n§ 3282(a), provides that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by\n\nlaw, no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for\n\nany offense, not capital, unless the indictment is found or\n\nthe information is instituted within five years next after\n\nsuch offense shall have been committed.”             Ordinarily the\n\nlimitation period begins to run when the crime is complete,\n\nsee Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S. 112, 115 (1970), and\n\nthe parties do not argue otherwise here.\n\n\n                              - 11 -\n\f    The fifth count of the second superseding indictment\n\ncharged that Bucci,\n\n    [o]n or about July 28, 2000 . . . did knowingly\n    and intentionally engage in a monetary transaction\n    in  property   derived  from   specified  unlawful\n    activity–to wit: the deposit of approximately\n    $222,179.88 into his Checking Account . . . at\n    First Massachusetts Bank . . . with proceeds\n    derived from the sale of controlled substances.\n\n         All in violation of Title 18, United States\n    Code, Section 1957. 4\n\n    The Government filed the second superseding indictment\n\non July 28, 2005, exactly five years to the day after the\n\ncharged offense.      But the parties agree that Bucci actually\n\nsubmitted the deposit at issue to the bank after 2:30 p.m.\n\non July 27, 2000.      The bank did not credit that deposit to\n\n\n\n    4\n        18 U.S.C. § 1957 provides, in relevant part, that\n\n    (a) Whoever, in any of the circumstances set forth\n    in subsection (d), knowingly engages or attempts to\n    engage in a monetary transaction in criminally\n    derived property of a value greater than $10,000\n    and is derived from specified unlawful activity,\n    shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).\n\n            . . . .\n\n    (f) As used in this section —\n\n         (1) the term “monetary transaction” means the\n    deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or\n    affecting   interstate  or  foreign  commerce,  of\n    funds . . . by, through, or to a financial\n    institution . . . , but such term does not include\n    any transaction necessary to preserve a person’s\n    right to representation as guaranteed by the sixth\n    amendment to the Constitution.\n\n                              - 12 -\n\fBucci’s account until the next business day, July 28.                                           The\n\nquestion     presented               in   this    case,    then,          is    when    was    this\n\ncharged offense complete: when Bucci submitted the deposit\n\non July 27 or when the bank credited Bucci’s account on July\n\n28.     The parties do not cite, and we have not found, any\n\nauthority addressing this exact question.\n\n      In    resolving            this     question,       we       look    to     the    relevant\n\nlanguage of § 1957(a).                      The statute proscribes knowingly\n\nengaging         in   a     monetary       transaction.              The       transaction       at\n\nissue      here       was      the     deposit     of   funds.             Pursuant       to    the\n\nexpress      terms          of   the      bank’s    policy,          of        which    the    bank\n\ninformed Bucci, a submission of funds to the bank after 2:00\n\np.m. would not be deposited into the depositor’s account\n\nuntil      the    following            business     day.           Thus,        Bucci    did    not\n\n“engage” in this monetary transaction until July 28, 2000,\n\nand   the    indictment              charging      this    offense             was,    therefore,\n\ntimely filed.\n\nB.    Fourth Amendment issues\n\n      Bucci claims that law enforcement officials violated the\n\nFourth       Amendment               by    1)      conducting             almost         constant\n\nsurveillance              of     his      home    using        a     video        camera;       and\n\n2)    stopping         his       vehicle         without       probable          cause.         The\n\ndistrict court denied Bucci’s motion to suppress asserted on\n\nthese grounds.              In considering the district court’s decision\n\n\n                                             - 13 -\n\fto    deny    a    suppression      motion,    this    court    reviews       legal\n\nquestions de novo and any factual findings for clear error.\n\nSee    United      States    v.    McMullin,   568    F.3d    1,   5   (1st    Cir.\n\n2009),       petition      for    cert.   filed,     (U.S.    Aug.     24,    2009)\n\n(No. 09-6112).\n\n       1.     Video surveillance of Bucci’s residence\n\n       Law enforcement authorities installed a video camera on\n\na    utility      pole    across    the   street   from      Bucci’s    home    and\n\nconducted surveillance of the front of his house for eight\n\nmonths.        “The camera was placed in a fixed location that\n\nenabled agents to monitor activity on the driveway [and]\n\nafforded agents a view of the garage” door and inside the\n\ngarage when the door was open.                 “The video camera had no\n\nremote capabilities that allowed agents to either change the\n\nview or magnification of the camera without being physically\n\nat the scene.”\n\n       Before a court can address the merits of a motion to\n\nsuppress, see United States v. Rodriguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d\n\n29, 37 (1st Cir. 2009), petition for cert filed, (U.S. May\n\n19, 2009) (No. 09-5537), the defendant must first establish\n\nthat    his       own    Fourth    Amendment   rights     were     violated      by\n\nshowing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 14 -\n\fthe place searched. 5    See United States v. Rheault, 561 F.3d\n\n55, 59 (1st Cir. 2009), petition for cert. filed, (U.S. June\n\n18, 2009) (No. 08-11022).        To establish such an expectation\n\nof privacy, Bucci must show that 1) he “has exhibited an\n\nactual,   subjective    expectation       of    privacy”   in   the   area\n\nsearched; and 2) “such subjective expectation is one that\n\nsociety is prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable.”\n\nId. (citing Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740 (1979)).\n\n    Bucci has failed to establish either a subjective or an\n\nobjective expectation of privacy in the front of his home,\n\nas viewed by the camera.     We focus here only on the lack of\n\na reasonable objective expectation of privacy because this\n\nfailure    is   so      clear.            See    United     States      v.\n\nVilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2008), cert.\n\ndenied, 129 S. Ct. 208 (2008).        “There are no fences, gates\n\nor shrubbery located in front of [Bucci’s residence] that\n\nobstruct the view of the driveway or the garage from the\n\nstreet.   Both [are] plainly visible.”             An individual does\n\nnot have an expectation of privacy in items or places he\n\nexposes to the public.     See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S.\n\n\n\n    5\n     Although courts often refer to this inquiry as a\nquestion of standing, it is more appropriately treated as a\nsubstantive Fourth Amendment legal question.     See United\nStates v. Rheault, 561 F.3d 55, 58 n.8 (1st Cir. 2009),\npetition   for   cert.   filed,  (U.S.   June   18,   2009)\n(No. 08-11022).\n\n                                 - 15 -\n\f347, 351 (1967) (“[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people,\n\nnot places.        What a person knowingly exposes to the public,\n\neven in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth\n\nAmendment protection.”); see also California v. Ciraolo, 476\n\nU.S. 207, 213 (1986).          That legal principle is dispositive\n\nhere.    See Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 31-33 (2001)\n\n(noting lawfulness of unenhanced visual surveillance of a\n\nhome).\n\n    2.        Search of Bucci’s vehicle on June 4, 2003\n\n    Bucci also moved to suppress over three hundred pounds\n\nof marijuana that officers found in Bucci’s vehicle when\n\nthey pulled him over on June 4, 2003, alleging the officers\n\ndid not have probable cause to stop him at that time.                          “If\n\nthere    is    probable    cause      to    believe    a     vehicle    contains\n\nevidence      of   criminal    activity,”         officers    may,     without   a\n\nwarrant,      search    “any   area    of     the    vehicle    in     which   the\n\nevidence might be found.”           Arizona v. Gant, 129 S. Ct. 1710,\n\n1721 (2009).         To prove “the applicability of this exception\n\nto the warrant requirement,” United States v. Dickerson, 514\n\nF.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir. 2008), cert denied, 128 S. Ct. 1690\n\n(2008),       “the     government          must     demonstrate        that    law\n\nenforcement officers had a belief, reasonably arising out of\n\ncircumstances known to the seizing officer, that the vehicle\n\ncontained that which by law is subject to seizure,” United\n\n\n                                    - 16 -\n\fStates    v.     Lopez,   380      F.3d   538,    543      (1st         Cir.   2004)\n\n(quotation, alterations omitted).                Whether a particular set\n\nof facts rises to the level of probable cause is a legal\n\ndetermination that this court reviews de novo.                          See United\n\nStates v. Rodrigue, 560 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n       Here, at the time officers stopped and searched Bucci’s\n\nvehicle, they knew the following: A confidential informant\n\ntold     officers    that     Bucci       was    involved          in     marijuana\n\ntrafficking.         Over     the     next      eight      months,        officers\n\nthemselves     observed     what    appeared     to   be   deliveries          being\n\nmade to Bucci’s home through vehicles driven into his garage\n\nand unloaded out of public view.                 After these deliveries,\n\nofficers would find empty boxes and bags in Bucci’s garbage\n\nwhich    contained    marijuana       residue.          Soon   thereafter,         a\n\nnumber of individuals would come to Bucci’s home, take other\n\nboxes or bags from the house, and depart in short order.\n\n       On June 2, 2003, the confidential informant told agents\n\nthat    “Bucci    might   have     recently      received      a    shipment      of\n\nmarijuana.”\n\n            On the morning of June 4, 2003, the pole\n       camera showed Bucci and another man — later\n       identified as defendant Belmonte — carrying eight\n       large cardboard boxes (similar to the size and\n       construction to those seized during the garbage\n       searches) into the garage of Bucci’s residence.\n       Once the boxes were in the garage, the door was\n       closed, and Bucci and Belmonte remained inside the\n       residence for approximately two hours. . . .\n\n\n                                    - 17 -\n\f         Belmonte and Bucci eventually emerged from the\n    garage carrying a box which appeared to be very\n    heavy. The two walked towards [Belmonte’s] trailer\n    and returned to the garage empty handed.     Within\n    minutes, Belmonte exited the garage, got into the\n    pick-up truck with the trailer attached, and drove\n    off.\n\n    Thereafter, “[a]gents ordered police officers to stop\n\nthe vehicle driven by Belmonte.” 6\n\n         While Belmonte was being stopped by police,\n    another man pulled into Bucci’s driveway.     Bucci\n    came out of the house, and the driver of the\n    vehicle — later identified as Defendant Martin —\n    parked the vehicle, and entered the residence with\n    Bucci. Moments later, Bucci and Martin came out of\n    the residence and got into their respective\n    vehicles.  Martin moved his vehicle so that Bucci\n    could drive his vehicle out of the garage, and\n    Martin immediately drove his vehicle into the\n    garage, and the garage door was closed.     Several\n    minutes later, Bucci drove his vehicle into the\n    garage. Bucci reentered the garage, and the garage\n    door was closed again. A few minutes later, Bucci\n    and Martin came out of the garage and drove away in\n    their respective vehicles.\n\nOfficers then stopped Bucci and searched his vehicle.   Based\n\non all the information known to the officers at the time\n\nthey stopped Bucci, they had probable cause to believe there\n\n\n\n\n    6\n     There was a factual dispute as to whether or not agents\nfound marijuana in Belmonte’s trailer before they stopped\nBucci.  But the district court expressly did “not rely on\nthe evidence seized from Belmonte’s trailer in assessing\nwhether the Government possessed probable cause to stop and\nsearch Bucci’s motor vehicle.”\n\n                           - 18 -\n\fwas evidence of criminal activity in his vehicle at that\n\ntime. 7\n\nC.   Government’s rebuttal opening statement\n\n     Bucci challenges both the district court’s decision, at\n\ntrial, to permit the Government to give a rebuttal opening\n\nstatement and the substance of that statement.                        Although\n\nrebuttal     opening    statements        are      rare,     generally     the\n\nmanagement    of   a   trial    is    left    to   the     district    court’s\n\ndiscretion.    See United States v. Moore, 923 F.2d 910, 913\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).        So, too, is “[t]he scope and extent of\n\nan opening” statement.         United States v. Hershenow, 680 F.2d\n\n847, 858 (1st Cir. 1982).            Here, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in allowing the Government a rebuttal\n\nopening statement.      Nor does the substance of that statement\n\nwarrant relief.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n     Bucci’s chief argument on appeal is that there was\nnever any previous indication that he had ever delivered\ndrugs in his own vehicle.    First, that is not true.    The\ndistrict court determined that, on March 28, 2003, the video\nsurveillance camera captured Bucci and another man loading\nseveral large bags into Bucci’s car and then driving away;\nBucci returned home alone an hour later.    Bucci has never\nspecifically challenged any of the district court’s factual\nrecitation. Moreover, even without any previous connection\nspecifically between Bucci’s vehicle and the prior observed\nconduct, probable cause existed to believe that, on June 4,\n2003, there was evidence of criminal activity in his\nvehicle.\n\n                                     - 19 -\n\fD.   Sentencing issues\n\n     1.        Basing Bucci’s sentence on                 the    amount      of    drugs\n               found by the district court\n\n     Bucci       contends      that    the     district     court       violated       his\n\nSixth Amendment right to a jury trial by basing his sentence\n\non the court’s factual finding, made by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence, that Bucci was responsible for 2,900 kilograms\n\nof marijuana. 8        Because Bucci did not raise this argument in\n\nthe district court, we review for plain error.                           See Fed. R.\n\nCrim.     P.    52(b);     see    also     Puckett   v.     United      States,        129\n\nS. Ct. 1423, 1428-29 (2009).                   Here, we find no error.\n\n     The       jury   found      beyond    a    reasonable      doubt     that     Bucci\n\nparticipated          in   a   conspiracy        involving       more    than      1,000\n\nkilograms of marijuana.               That finding established both the\n\nstatutory       mandatory        minimum       sentence   Bucci       faced       on   his\n\ndrug-trafficking           conspiracy          conviction       and   “the    maximum\n\npenalty the district court may impose.”                          United States v.\n\nSantiago,       560    F.3d    62,    67   (1st    Cir.   2009),        petition       for\n\ncert. filed, (U.S. June 6, 2009) (No. 08-10809).                                  But in\n\n\n\n     8\n     Bucci     also    argues    that     “increasing    the\nmandatory-minimum [statutory] sentence” required by his\ndrug-trafficking conspiracy conviction, “based upon judicial\nfindings [made] by a preponderance of the evidence[,]\nviolates the Sixth Amendment.” But Bucci acknowledges that\nthe Supreme Court, as well as the First Circuit, has already\nrejected this argument. See Harris v. United States, 536\nU.S. 545, 557 (2002) (plurality opinion); United States v.\nGoodine, 326 F.3d 26, 27-32 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fcalculating       Bucci’s       offense      level       under    the    sentencing\n\nguidelines, the court properly found by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that Bucci’s offenses and his related conduct\n\nactually involved 2,900 kilograms of marijuana.                          See United\n\nStates v. Cruz-Rodriguez, 541 F.3d 19, 32 (1st Cir. 2008),\n\ncert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1017, 1923 (2009).\n\n       Under    United    States      v.   Booker,       543   U.S.     220   (2005),\n\nSixth Amendment error does not occur because the district\n\njudge found facts, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\n\nincreased the defendant’s sentence beyond that authorized by\n\nthe    jury’s    verdict;      rather,      Sixth    Amendment        error    occurs\n\nwhen     the     district      court       does     so    while    treating         the\n\nsentencing       guidelines      as    mandatory         rather   than    advisory.\n\nSee United States v. Luciano, 414 F.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).      And that did not happen here.\n\n       2.      Whether the district court realized the discretion\n               it had to impose a below-guideline sentence\n\n       Bucci    next    argues    that     the    sentencing      court       did   not\n\nrealize the extent to which it had discretion to impose a\n\nsentence       below    the    advisory     guideline       range.       As    proof,\n\nBucci    points    to    the    district     judge’s       announcement,        after\n\nimposing a sentence at the bottom of the advisory guideline\n\nrange, that “I, myself, don’t believe in sentences as long\n\nas I imposed today, but I couldn’t in my conscience as a\n\njudge find reasons that I should go below the guidelines;\n\n                                       - 21 -\n\fand accordingly, I’ve sentenced you to the bottom of the\n\nguidelines.” 9\n\n       Viewing   the    sentencing       proceeding        as   a    whole,    we\n\nconclude, instead, that the district court was fully aware\n\nof its discretion to impose a below-guideline sentence.                       See\n\nGall       v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 128 S. Ct. 586, 591,\n\n596-97, 602 (2007); Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338,\n\n350-55 (2007).        The court’s awareness is best illustrated by\n\na spirited exchange the court had with the prosecutor during\n\nthe first of two sentencing hearings: In response to the\n\nGovernment’s     argument     that     the   court    could     only   “legally\n\nsentence”     Bucci    as   low   as   the   bottom   of    the     Presentence\n\nReport’s recommended guideline range, the court inquired\n\n             THE COURT: I don’t quite understand.\n\n             [PROSECUTOR]: Here’s why.\n\n            THE COURT: A Court is authorized to go below\n       that.\n\n             [PROSECUTOR]: I understand, your Honor.                   But—\n\n\n\n\n       9\n     In light of this statement, the Government concedes\nthat Bucci’s case should be remanded for the limited purpose\nof allowing the district court to resentence Bucci. We are\nnot bound by the Government’s concession, however.       See\nOrloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 87 (1953); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 433 F.3d 411, 414 n.6 (4th Cir.\n2006) (noting that “we are not at liberty to vacate and\nremand for resentencing on the Government’s concession\nalone,” citing supporting authority).\n\n                                   - 22 -\n\f         THE COURT: I’m not saying in this particular\n    case that I should or I would, but I certainly have\n    the power to do so.\n\n         [PROSECUTOR]: I’m not saying you don’t have\n    the power, I’m saying . . . I don’t think the\n    Court on this record could deviate below 151 months\n    [the bottom of the Presentence Report’s recommended\n    guideline range] in a way that would be legally\n    tentative [sic], okay, and here’s why: The Supreme\n    Court in United States versus Rita on June 21st\n    held that the sentencing guideline range is\n    presumptively reasonable.\n\n         THE COURT: Yes. 10\n\n         [PROSECUTOR]: Of  course  courts have  the\n    discretion to go below it, but if they do, they\n    need to, in detail, justify why they’re going\n    below.\n\n         THE COURT: Of course.\n\n        [PROSECUTOR] And I don’t think it can be done\n    on this record. . . .\n\n         . . . .\n\n        [PROSECUTOR]: What the government is asking\n    for is a sentence that is based on the law —\n\n         THE COURT: Oh, come on.\n\n\n    10\n      During the second sentencing hearing, defense counsel\naccurately asserted that\n\n    when we were here the last time, certain statements\n    were made by the government in terms of what Rita\n    v. United States means and about a presumption of\n    reasonableness, and I’ll just point out that Rita\n    very clearly says on page 12 of the majority\n    decision that the presumption that they’re talking\n    about here does not apply to the district court;\n    that is an appellate review standard.\n\nSee Rita, 551 U.S. at 351. The court responded, “I’ve read\nRita since the last time and I’m aware of that, yes.”\n\n                              - 23 -\n\f            [PROSECUTOR]: — and the evidence.\n            Well, your Honor, you make a statement like\n       that, and I’m sorry, but with all due respect, the\n       government is asking for a sentence —\n\n            THE COURT: Are you aware of the words in [18\n       U.S.C.]   3553  which  say  “sufficient  but  not\n       unnecessary” or “not excessive”?\n\n             [PROSECUTOR]: I am aware of that, your Honor.\n\n             THE COURT: Well, those words are important.\n\nThis    exchange,     as     well    as    the    entire    sentencing     record\n\nconsidered as a whole, reflects the district court’s clear\n\nunderstanding         that      it    had        discretion     to    impose    a\n\nbelow-guideline sentence.\n\n       On   appeal,     Bucci   also      points    to   Kimbrough    v.   United\n\nStates, 552 U.S. 85, 128 S. Ct. 558, 564 (2007), which the\n\nSupreme Court decided after Bucci’s sentencing, as affording\n\na   district      court      even    greater       discretion    to   impose    a\n\nbelow-guideline sentence than the district court had at the\n\ntime it sentenced Bucci.             Kimbrough recognized the “district\n\ncourts’ authority to vary from the crack cocaine Guidelines\n\nbased on [the sentencing court’s] policy disagreement with\n\nthem,       and   not      simply         based     on     an   individualized\n\ndetermination that they yield an excessive sentence in a\n\nparticular case.”          Spears v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 840,\n\n843 (2009); see also Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 564.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 24 -\n\f      Relying on Kimbrough, Bucci appears to argue, for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, that drug-trafficking sentences under\n\nthe guidelines are unnecessarily long as a policy matter.\n\nThe   First     Circuit         has    “remanded         pre-Kimbrough         sentences\n\nwithout    preserved        claims          where    ‘there      was    some       explicit\n\nindication      that     the     district        court     might       well    alter    its\n\nsentence.’”      Santiago, 560 F.3d at 68 (quoting United States\n\nv. Boardman, 528 F.3d 86, 87 (1st Cir. 2008)) (alterations\n\nomitted).          But     we     do    not      read      the    district         court’s\n\ncomment — “I, myself, don’t believe in sentences as long as\n\nI imposed today, but I couldn’t in my conscience as a judge\n\nfind reasons that I should go below the guidelines,” — as\n\nindicating that the court might well alter the sentence it\n\nimposed    on   remand.           Instead,          we   interpret       the       district\n\ncourt’s remarks as an indication that there was no reason\n\nthe   court     could      find        in    this    case     that      would       justify\n\nimposing a below-guideline sentence.                        See United States v.\n\nOlivero, 552 F.3d 34, 42 (1st Cir. 2009) (holding district\n\ncourt’s remarks that “it could not act on an ‘individual\n\nsense of justice’ and that it had to apply rules that ‘it\n\nwould     rather     not        apply       if   [it]      were    free       to     decide\n\notherwise’”      did     not     show       that     the    sentencing         court    was\n\nunaware of discretion to impose below-guideline sentence;\n\ninstead, the remark indicated that the sentencing court did\n\n\n                                            - 25 -\n\fnot    believe     “there       was       [any]    reason       to    depart        from       the\n\nGuidelines”), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2174 (2009).                                       And a\n\ndistrict court, in exercising its discretion to impose a\n\nbelow-guideline sentence, must still do so in a reasoned\n\nmanner.        See Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 596-97; see also United\n\nStates      v.    Taylor,       532        F.3d     68,    70     (1st       Cir.     2008).\n\nTherefore,        we         decline       to      remand        Bucci’s           case        for\n\nresentencing on this basis.                     See United States v. King, 554\n\nF.3d 177, 182 (1st Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2169\n\n(2009).\n\n       3.      Whether the district court adequately considered\n               Bucci’s argument for a below-guideline sentence\n\n       Bucci argues that the district court did not adequately\n\nconsider his argument for a below-guideline sentence, based\n\nupon     the     sentencing          disparity          between        Bucci        and        his\n\nco-conspirators.             Bucci acknowledges that he did not object\n\nat    sentencing        to    the    alleged       inadequacy         of     the    district\n\ncourt’s     consideration            of    his     argument;         Bucci,    therefore,\n\nconcedes       this     court       should       review    this       issue    for        plain\n\nerror.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\n       Even assuming for argument’s sake there was error, Bucci\n\nmust    also     show    that       such    error       affected       his    substantial\n\nrights.     See Puckett, 129 S. Ct. at 1429.                         In the sentencing\n\ncontext,       that     means       Bucci        must     show       that    there        is     a\n\n“reasonable        probability             that,    but     for       the     error,           the\n\n                                           - 26 -\n\fdistrict      court    would    have     imposed   a    different,       more\n\nfavorable sentence.”           United States v. Gonzalez-Castillo,\n\n562 F.3d 80, 83 (1st Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).                   Bucci\n\nhas not shown that here.\n\nE.    Whether the district court erred in instructing the\n      jury that “proceeds” from Bucci’s drug trafficking, for\n      purposes of forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. § 853, meant\n      gross receipts\n\n      Bucci challenges the instruction the district court gave\n\njurors defining “proceeds” for forfeiture purposes.                   Because\n\nBucci did not object to this instruction after the trial\n\ncourt gave it to the jury, this court reviews for plain\n\nerror.      See United States v. Roberson, 459 F.3d 39, 45 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n      The    forfeiture      provision    at   issue    here,    21    U.S.C.\n\n§ 853(a)(1), provides in relevant part that “[a]ny person\n\nconvicted of a violation of this subchapter” addressing drug\n\ntrafficking           “shall       forfeit         to      the        United\n\nStates . . . (1) any property constituting or derived from,\n\nany proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as\n\nthe   result    of    such   violation.”       (Emphasis    added.)        In\n\nBucci’s case, the district court instructed the jury that\n\n      [p]roceeds of drug trafficking include any monies\n      or other property that a defendant obtained\n      directly or indirectly as the result of his\n      drug-trafficking violations. Proceeds include the\n      total amount of gross proceeds obtained by the\n      defendant as a result of his drug trafficking and\n      is not reduced by any amounts the defendant paid\n\n                                  - 27 -\n\f       for the drugs he later sold or for any other costs\n       or expenses he incurred.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       This     instruction      is    consistent   with   First     Circuit\n\nauthority.           In United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 21 (1st\n\nCir.        1995),     we   previously    held   that   “proceeds,”      for\n\nforfeiture purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1963, were not limited\n\nto net profits.             Although we reached this conclusion in a\n\ncase involving the similarly worded forfeiture statute under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1963, rather than 21 U.S.C. § 853, 11 we have\n\n       11\n      The forfeiture statute at issue                   here,   21    U.S.C.\n§ 853(a), provides in pertinent part:\n\n       [a]ny person convicted of a violation of this\n       subchapter . . . punishable by imprisonment for\n       more than one year shall forfeit to the United\n       States, irrespective of any provision of State law—\n\n       (1) any property constituting, or derived from, any\n       proceeds   the   person   obtained,   directly   or\n       indirectly, as the result of such violation;\n\n              . . . .\n\n       The court, in imposing sentence on such person,\n       shall order, in addition to any other sentence\n       imposed pursuant to this subchapter . . . , that\n       the person forfeit to the United States all\n       property described in this subsection. In lieu of\n       a fine otherwise authorized by this part, a\n       defendant who derives profits or other proceeds\n       from an offense may be fined not more than twice\n       the gross profits or other proceeds.\n\n(Emphasis   added.)    The   concluding paragraph   of  the\nforfeiture provision found at 18 U.S.C. § 1963(a) is worded\nalmost   identically.      Furthermore, Congress   expanded\n                                            (continued...)\n\n                                      - 28 -\n\ffurther recognized that “case law under 18 U.S.C. § 1963 is\n\npersuasive in construing 21 U.S.C. § 853, and vice versa,”\n\nUnited States v. White, 116 F.3d 948, 950 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nThus, the question of whether the forfeiture instruction the\n\ndistrict   court   gave   Bucci’s    jurors   complied   with    First\n\nCircuit precedent is an easy call; it did.\n\n    The    legislative    history   underlying   §   853’s   enactment\n\nbolsters our conclusion.\n\n    Congress substantially amended § 853 along with\n    other   forfeiture  provisions   as  part   of  the\n    Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 to enhance\n    the effectiveness of then existing forfeiture\n    statutes under both the Organized Crime Control\n    Act, which was aimed at “racketeer influenced and\n    corrupt organizations” (RICO), and the Drug Control\n    Act. The legislative history leaves no doubt that\n    Congress intended to impose the sanction of\n    criminal forfeiture against drug traffickers in\n    order to strip these offenders and organizations of\n    their economic power.\n\nUnited States v. Caparotta, 571 F. Supp.2d 195, 200 (D. Me.\n\n2008) (citations omitted).\n\n    The legislative history underlying the similarly worded\n\n§ 1963 further “explains without qualification that the term\n\n‘proceeds’ has been used in lieu of the term ‘profits’ in\n\norder to alleviate the unreasonable burden on the government\n\n\n    11\n      (...continued)\n§ 1963(a) at the same time that it created § 853’s\n“drug-related forfeiture provision.”   United States v.\nWhite, 116 F.3d 948, 950 (1st Cir. 1997).   And, at that\ntime, Congress noted that § 853(a) “closely parallel[s]”\n§ 1963(a). See White, 116 F.3d at 950.\n\n                              - 29 -\n\fof proving net profits.”         Hurley, 63 F.3d at 21 (quotation\n\nomitted).     The same is true in forfeiture proceedings under\n\n§ 853(a).     See Caparotta, 571 F. Supp.2d at 200.           For these\n\nreasons, we conclude that, at the time the district court\n\ngave this instruction, it was correct under First Circuit\n\nauthority.     Bucci concedes as much.\n\n     Bucci argues, however, that a subsequent Supreme Court\n\ncase,     United   States   v.   Santos,   128   S.   Ct.   2020   (2008)\n\n(plurality opinion), now makes the forfeiture instruction\n\ngiven in his case wrong. 12       We cannot agree.\n\n     In Santos, a plurality of the Court held that the term\n\n“proceeds,” as used in yet another forfeiture statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(a), meant “‘profits’ rather than ‘receipts,’\n\nat least when the predicate offense is an illegal lottery\n\noperation.” 13     Levesque, 546 F.3d at 82 (citing Santos, 128\n\n\n     12\n      This precise issue was raised in United                States v.\nLevesque, 546 F.3d 78, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2008). In             that case,\nwe remanded the question to the district court to            address it\nin the first instance and thus we did not resolve            the issue.\nSee id. at 82-83.\n     13\n      18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1), which is codified among\ngeneral federal racketeering and money laundering statutes,\nsee 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951-1960, provides in pertinent part that\n\n     [w]hoever, knowing that the property involved in a\n     financial transaction represents proceeds of some\n     form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to\n     conduct such a financial transaction which in fact\n     involves the proceeds of unspecified unlawful\n     activity—\n                                            (continued...)\n\n                                 - 30 -\n\fS. Ct. at 2025 (plurality opinion), and Santos, 128 S. Ct.\n\nat   2033-34    (Stevens,   J.,    concurring   in   the   judgment)).\n\nBased upon Santos, Bucci submits that the question presented\n\nhere is whether “the monies which may be forfeited under a[]\n\n[21] U.S.C. § 853 money judgment are the gross proceeds of\n\nthe offense or [instead are] the gross profits after the\n\ncost of the drugs sold is subtracted.” 14\n\n     Contrary to Bucci’s argument, Santos is not controlling\n\nhere. The forfeiture statute at issue in Santos, 18 U.S.C.\n\n\n     13\n          (...continued)\n\n             (A)(i) with the intent to promote the\n             carrying  on   of  specified  unlawful\n             activity;\n\n             . . . .\n\n     shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than\n     $500,000 or twice the value of the property\n     involved in the transaction, whichever is greater,\n     or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or\n     both. For purposes of this paragraph, a financial\n     transaction shall be considered to be one involving\n     the proceeds of specified unlawful activity if it\n     is part of a set of parallel or dependent\n     transactions, any one of which involves the\n     proceeds of specified unlawful activity, and all of\n     which are part of a single plan or arrangement.\n\n(Emphasis added.)   Section 1956, then, not only addresses\nforfeiture, but also sets forth a substantive money\nlaundering offense.\n     14\n      Bucci argues, then, that “proceeds” means “gross\nprofits”—the gross proceeds minus the cost of the drugs. He\ndoes not contend that “proceeds” means “profits,” which\nBucci defines as the gross proceeds minus all expenses\nincurred in Bucci’s drug-trafficking business.\n\n                                  - 31 -\n\f§   1956(a),     is   distinguishable           from   the   statute      at    issue\n\nhere, 21 U.S.C. § 853, in at least two critical respects.\n\nFirst, § 1956(a) refers only to “proceeds,” and does not use\n\nthe   phrase     “profits    or     other    proceeds”       that    is   found    in\n\n§   853.    To    interpret       the    term    “proceeds”     in    the      phrase\n\n“profits or other proceeds” to mean profits would render the\n\nword “profits” redundant.               See Caparotta, 571 F. Supp.2d at\n\n199; see also Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Defenders of\n\nWildlife,      551    U.S.   644,    669     (2007)    (cautioning        “against\n\nreading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant”).\n\nThe language found in § 1956(a), on the other hand, which\n\nwas at issue in Santos, refers only to “proceeds” and does\n\nnot contain the additional word “profits,” and thus does not\n\npresent this redundancy problem.\n\n      Second, § 1956(a) sets forth not simply a forfeiture\n\nprovision, but also a substantive criminal offense.                              That\n\nwas a critical point for the Santos plurality.                        In Santos,\n\nthe defendant was convicted of both conducting an illegal\n\ngambling business, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1955, and\n\nmoney laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), which required\n\nproof that the defendant used the proceeds of the illegal\n\ngambling operation to “promote” that illegal business.                            See\n\nSantos, 128 S. Ct. at 2023.                 Justice Stevens, who provided\n\nthe fifth vote in Santos, see id. at 2031, was particularly\n\n\n                                        - 32 -\n\fconcerned about the “perverse” result that would occur if\n\nthe Government were allowed “to treat the mere payment of\n\nthe expense of operating an illegal gambling business,” the\n\noperation       of    which       is     itself       a    federal     offense,       as   a\n\nseparate money laundering offense under § 1956(a).                                 Santos,\n\n128 S. Ct. at 2032-33.                  According to Justice Stevens, that\n\n“perverse” result is “tantamount to double jeopardy, which\n\nis     particularly         unfair           in    [Santos’]    case        because    the\n\npenalties for money laundering are substantially more severe\n\nthan    those        for    the    underlying             offense    of     operating      a\n\ngambling    business.”                 Id.    at    2033.      This       same   “merger”\n\nproblem     also      concerned          the       four    members     of    the    Santos\n\nplurality.       See id. at 2026-28.\n\n       Under 21 U.S.C. § 853, however, there is no possibility\n\nof   such   a   “perverse”             merger      problem    because,       unlike    the\n\nforfeiture       statute          at    issue       in    Santos,     the     forfeiture\n\nstatute here, § 853(a), does not set forth a substantive\n\ncriminal     offense.             Instead,          “[t]o    become       subject     to   a\n\nforfeiture under § 853, a defendant has to be convicted of\n\na predicate crime under Title 21, and, upon such conviction,\n\n§ 853 simply assures that a drug dealer is deprived of the\n\neconomic    power          generated          by   illegally        deprived     wealth.”\n\nCaparotta, 571 F. Supp.2d at 199-200.\n\n\n\n\n                                             - 33 -\n\f       For these reasons, the district court did not plainly\n\nerr in instructing Bucci’s jury that “proceeds” meant “gross\n\nproceeds.”\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n       We   AFFIRM   Bucci’s   convictions,   sentence   and   the\n\nforfeiture orders in all respects.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 34 -\n\f",

Rao, Attorney, Criminal Division, Appellate Section, United States Department of Justice, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Peter K. Levitt, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before HOWARD, SELYA, and EBEL,<sup>[*]</sup> Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>EBEL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this direct criminal appeal, Sean Bucci challenges his sixteen convictions for drug trafficking, money laundering and tax evasion, his resulting 151-month prison sentence, and a forfeiture order. Having jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The evidence presented at trial established that Bucci's co-defendant Anthony Belmonte sold Bucci approximately 300 to 350 pounds of marijuana eight or nine times each year, over the course of three and one-half years. Following a nine-month investigation, the United States charged Bucci with sixteen counts of drug trafficking, money laundering and tax evasion. At trial, Bucci acknowledged that he was a marijuana dealer, but disputed the amount of marijuana with which he was charged. The jury found Bucci guilty on all sixteen charges and specifically found that the charged drug-trafficking conspiracy involved over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. The jury also returned several special forfeiture verdicts against Bucci.<sup>[1]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> district court then sentenced Bucci to 151 months in prison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Challenges to the indictments</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Vindictive prosecution</h2>\n<p>The United States initially indicted Bucci, along with Belmonte and another co-defendant, Darren Martin, on two drug-trafficking charges: 1) conspiring to possess at least 100 kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; and 2) possessing at least 100 kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(vii). The indictment also charged that any of Bucci's property that represented proceeds from his drug-trafficking offenses was forfeitable under 21 U.S.C. § 853.</p>\n<p>A year later, in August 2004, Bucci started a website, whosarat.com, where individuals could post information about government informants. Six months after Bucci started this website, the Government, on February 3, 2005, filed a superseding indictment which charged only Bucci and Martin with the same two drug-trafficking counts, but increased the amount of marijuana charged in the alleged conspiracy from 100 to at least 1000 kilograms. The increased amount of marijuana charged raised the statutory mandatory minimum sentence Bucci faced for the conspiracy offense, if convicted, from five to ten years. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p>A year after Bucci started whosarat.com, the Government, on July 28, 2005, filed a second superseding indictment charging Bucci with the same two drug-trafficking offenses, but adding fourteen additional counts involving money laundering, tax evasion, and unlawfully structuring financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements. The second superseding indictment also added Bucci's mother, Catherine Bucci, as a co-defendant.</p>\n<p>Bucci claims that the Government's decision to file the two superseding indictments in his case-which increased the number of charges against him from two to sixteen and the amount of marijuana charged in the alleged drug-trafficking conspiracy from 100 to at least 1,000 kilograms-amounted to vindictive prosecution intended to punish him for exercising his First Amendment right to operate his website, whosarat.com.<sup>[2]</sup> Bucci sought to prove vindictive prosecution by demonstrating circumstances establishing a likelihood of vindictiveness sufficient to create a presumption that the prosecution was, in fact, acting vindictively. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jenkins,</i> 537 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 433, 172 L.Ed.2d 313 (2008). It is difficult to make such a showing pretrial, however, in light of the broad discretion afforded the prosecutor to determine who should be prosecuted and for what crime, and the presumption that the prosecutor has exercised that discretion in good faith.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> <i>United States v. Goodwin,</i> 457 U.S. 368, 377, 380-81, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Armstrong,</i> 517 U.S. 456, 464-65, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996) (discussing presumption in context of selective-prosecution claim).</p>\n<blockquote>In our system, so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor's] discretion. Within the limits set by the legislature's constitutionally valid definition of chargeable offenses, the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a federal constitutional violation so long as the selection was not deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Bordenkircher v. Hayes,</i> 434 U.S. 357, 364, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) (quotation, citation, alteration, footnote omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Denial of Bucci's discovery request</h2>\n<p>In the district court, Bucci sought discovery from the Government in order to support his vindictive-prosecution claim. The district court denied that request. We review that decision for an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 517 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.2008) (reviewing selective-prosecution claim).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. Applicable standard</h2>\n<p>In light of the presumption that a prosecutor has acted in good faith in exercising his discretion to make charging decisions, courts require a defendant seeking discovery first to come forth with \"some\" objective evidence tending to show the existence of prosecutorial vindictiveness. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Wilson,</i> 262 F.3d 305, 315 (4th Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Sanders,</i> 211 F.3d 711, 717 (2d Cir.2000). These courts derive this standard from <i>United States v. Armstrong</i><i>, see</i> 517 U.S. at 468, 116 S.Ct. 1480, in which the Supreme Court addressed discovery sought in support of a selective-prosecution claim. <i>See </i><i>Wilson,</i> 262 F.3d at 315-16; <i>Sanders,</i> 211 F.3d at 717. This is the standard that the district court applied in Bucci's case, and we adopt it here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. Whether Bucci made such a showing here</h2>\n<p>In order to obtain discovery, then, Bucci first had to advance some evidence tending to establish his vindictive-prosecution claim. He failed to do so.</p>\n<p>In support of his discovery motion, Bucci relied on \"the statements of law enforcement and government officers reporting whosarat.com contained in ... newspaper articles, documents, and security reports.\" While the reported statements of these officers expressed serious concern about the danger to informants posed by postings made on Bucci's website, Bucci set forth no evidence suggesting that this concern ever affected the prosecutors making the specific charging decisions in his case. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> To obtain discovery, Bucci must do more than simply \"identify a potential motive for prosecutorial animus.\" <i>Sanders,</i> 211 F.3d at 718. He must connect any vindictive animus to those making the challenged charging decisions in his case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Goulding,</i> 26 F.3d 656, 662 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>Bucci also relied on evidence regarding the Government's opposition to a pretrial motion Bucci's co-defendant, Catherine Bucci, filed in this case seeking early disclosure of statements made by Government witnesses. In opposing that request, the Government noted that, while it generally would not oppose early disclosure, in this case it would not agree to it because of the Government's concern that Bucci was trying to intimidate Government witnesses through whosarat.com. In opposing Catherine Bucci's motion, however, the Government was only asserting a legitimate litigation strategy. The fact that it was based in part on the effects the information posted on Bucci's website might have on this specific prosecution did not suggest that prosecutors filed the superseding indictments against Bucci to retaliate against him for operating the website. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Segal,</i> 495 F.3d 826, 833 (7th Cir.2007) (\"A prosecutor cannot be said to act vindictively by taking into account a defendant's perceived efforts to intimidate witnesses.\").</p>\n<p>In support of his discovery request, Bucci further relied on the general circumstances attendant to his prosecution, asserting that the prosecutor all along had enough evidence to charge him with the added offenses and increased amount of marijuana, but did not bring those charges until after Bucci started whosarat.com. Assuming that the Government had enough evidence to indict Bucci initially on the increased charges, this fact alone is insufficient to establish that the Government later filed the superseding indictments to punish Bucci for whosarat.com. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Roach,</i> 502 F.3d 425, 444-45 (6th Cir.2007) (rejecting argument that the fact that the Government could have brought charges initially, but did not do so, indicated the prosecutor's vindictiveness), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2051, 170 L.Ed.2d 797 (2008).</p>\n<p>Moreover, \"evidence of suspicious timing alone does not indicate prosecutorial animus.\" <i>United States v. Cooper,</i> 461 F.3d 850, 856 (7th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). In any event, the district court noted that \"the sequence of events in this case is not so remarkable as to justify discovery.\" We agree. Bucci began operating his website in August 2004. It was six months later that the Government filed the first superseding indictment, and another six months before the Government filed the second superseding indictment against Bucci. These superseding indictments were not so close in time to Bucci's starting the whosarat.com website to provide strong evidence that the prosecutor acted vindictively. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marrapese,</i> 826 F.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir.1987) (noting two events that were \"well removed in time\" were not strong evidence of actual vindictiveness).</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying Bucci discovery in support of his vindictive-prosecution claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Denial of motion to dismiss indictment</h2>\n<p>Despite not being able to conduct discovery, Bucci nevertheless moved for the dismissal of the second superseding indictment, asserting that it was the result of vindictive prosecution. The district court denied Bucci's motion. We review that decision for an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Poole,</i> 407 F.3d 767, 772 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> (6th Cir.2005). But in applying this deferential standard, we review any ancillary factual findings for clear error and relevant legal determinations de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Aviles-Sierra,</i> 531 F.3d 123, 126 (1st Cir.2008). We agree with the Government that the \"subsidiary question\" presented here, whether Bucci established a presumption of vindictiveness, is a legal determination that we should review de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barner,</i> 441 F.3d 1310, 1315 n. 5 (11th Cir.2006); <i>Wilson,</i> 262 F.3d at 316.</p>\n<p>Bucci argues that he presented evidence to the district court sufficient to establish a presumption of vindictiveness and shift the burden to the prosecution to show it had legitimate reasons for increasing the charges against him. We reject that argument, for the same reasons discussed above.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Denial of motion to dismiss Count 5 as time-barred</h2>\n<p>Bucci moved for the dismissal of the second superseding indictment's fifth count, arguing that it was time-barred. Because the pertinent facts are undisputed, this court reviews de novo the district court's decision to deny that motion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. DeLeon,</i> 444 F.3d 41, 51 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The relevant statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a), provides that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.\" Ordinarily the limitation period begins to run when the crime is complete, <i>see </i><i>Toussie v. United States,</i> 397 U.S. 112, 115, 90 S.Ct. 858, 25 L.Ed.2d 156 (1970), and the parties do not argue otherwise here.</p>\n<p>The fifth count of the second superseding indictment charged that Bucci,</p>\n<blockquote>[o]n or about July 28, 2000 ... did knowingly and intentionally engage in a monetary transaction in property derived from specified unlawful activity-to wit: the deposit of approximately $222,179.88 into his Checking Account... at First Massachusetts Bank ... with proceeds derived from the sale of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957.<sup>[4]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The Government filed the second superseding indictment on July 28, 2005, exactly five years to the day after the charged offense. But the parties agree that Bucci actually submitted the deposit at issue to the bank after 2:30 p.m. on July 27, 2000. The bank did not credit that deposit to Bucci's account until the next business day, July 28. The question presented in this case, then, is when was this charged offense complete: when Bucci submitted the deposit on July 27 or when the bank credited Bucci's account on July 28. The parties do not cite, and we have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> not found, any authority addressing this exact question.</p>\n<p>In resolving this question, we look to the relevant language of § 1957(a). The statute proscribes knowingly engaging in a monetary transaction. The transaction at issue here was the deposit of funds. Pursuant to the express terms of the bank's policy, of which the bank informed Bucci, a submission of funds to the bank after 2:00 p.m. would not be deposited into the depositor's account until the following business day. Thus, Bucci did not \"engage\" in this monetary transaction until July 28, 2000, and the indictment charging this offense was, therefore, timely filed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Fourth Amendment issues</h2>\n<p>Bucci claims that law enforcement officials violated the Fourth Amendment by 1) conducting almost constant surveillance of his home using a video camera; and 2) stopping his vehicle without probable cause. The district court denied Bucci's motion to suppress asserted on these grounds. In considering the district court's decision to deny a suppression motion, this court reviews legal questions de novo and any factual findings for clear error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McMullin,</i> 568 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2009), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> (U.S. Aug. 24, 2009) (No. 09-6112).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Video surveillance of Bucci's residence</h2>\n<p>Law enforcement authorities installed a video camera on a utility pole across the street from Bucci's home and conducted surveillance of the front of his house for eight months. \"The camera was placed in a fixed location that enabled agents to monitor activity on the driveway [and] afforded agents a view of the garage\" door and inside the garage when the door was open. \"The video camera had no remote capabilities that allowed agents to either change the view or magnification of the camera without being physically at the scene.\"</p>\n<p>Before a court can address the merits of a motion to suppress, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Lozada,</i> 558 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir.2009), <i>petition for cert filed,</i> (U.S. May 19, 2009) (No. 09-5537), the defendant must first establish that his own Fourth Amendment rights were violated by showing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Rheault,</i> 561 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir.2009), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> (U.S. June 18, 2009) (No. 08-11022). To establish such an expectation of privacy, Bucci must show that 1) he \"has exhibited an actual, subjective expectation of privacy\" in the area searched; and 2) \"such subjective expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Smith v. Maryland,</i> 442 U.S. 735, 740, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979)).</p>\n<p>Bucci has failed to establish either a subjective or an objective expectation of privacy in the front of his home, as viewed by the camera. We focus here only on the lack of a reasonable objective expectation of privacy because this failure is so clear. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 208, 172 L.Ed.2d 168 (2008). \"There are no fences, gates or shrubbery located in front of [Bucci's residence] that obstruct the view <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> of the driveway or the garage from the street. Both [are] plainly visible.\" An individual does not have an expectation of privacy in items or places he exposes to the public. <i>See </i><i>Katz v. United States,</i> 389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (\"[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\"); <i>see also </i><i>California v. Ciraolo,</i> 476 U.S. 207, 213, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986). That legal principle is dispositive here. <i>See </i><i>Kyllo v. United States,</i> 533 U.S. 27, 31-33, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001) (noting lawfulness of unenhanced visual surveillance of a home).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Search of Bucci's vehicle on June 4, 2003</h2>\n<p>Bucci also moved to suppress over three hundred pounds of marijuana that officers found in Bucci's vehicle when they pulled him over on June 4, 2003, alleging the officers did not have probable cause to stop him at that time. \"If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity,\" officers may, without a warrant, search \"any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found.\" <i>Arizona v. Gant,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1721, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009). To prove \"the applicability of this exception to the warrant requirement,\" <i>United States v. Dickerson,</i> 514 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1690, 170 L.Ed.2d 384 (2008), \"the government must demonstrate that law enforcement officers had a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer, that the vehicle contained that which by law is subject to seizure,\" <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 380 F.3d 538, 543 (1st Cir.2004) (quotation, alterations omitted). Whether a particular set of facts rises to the level of probable cause is a legal determination that this court reviews de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodrigue,</i> 560 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Here, at the time officers stopped and searched Bucci's vehicle, they knew the following: A confidential informant told officers that Bucci was involved in marijuana trafficking. Over the next eight months, officers themselves observed what appeared to be deliveries being made to Bucci's home through vehicles driven into his garage and unloaded out of public view. After these deliveries, officers would find empty boxes and bags in Bucci's garbage which contained marijuana residue. Soon thereafter, a number of individuals would come to Bucci's home, take other boxes or bags from the house, and depart in short order.</p>\n<p>On June 2, 2003, the confidential informant told agents that \"Bucci might have recently received a shipment of marijuana.\"</p>\n<blockquote>On the morning of June 4, 2003, the pole camera showed Bucci and another man  later identified as defendant Belmonte  carrying eight large cardboard boxes (similar to the size and construction to those seized during the garbage searches) into the garage of Bucci's residence. Once the boxes were in the garage, the door was closed, and Bucci and Belmonte remained inside the residence for approximately two hours....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Belmonte and Bucci eventually emerged from the garage carrying a box which appeared to be very heavy. The two walked towards [Belmonte's] trailer and returned to the garage empty handed. Within minutes, Belmonte exited the garage, got into the pick-up truck with the trailer attached, and drove off.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> Thereafter, \"[a]gents ordered police officers to stop the vehicle driven by Belmonte.\"<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>While Belmonte was being stopped by police, another man pulled into Bucci's driveway. Bucci came out of the house, and the driver of the vehicle  later identified as Defendant Martin  parked the vehicle, and entered the residence with Bucci. Moments later, Bucci and Martin came out of the residence and got into their respective vehicles. Martin moved his vehicle so that Bucci could drive his vehicle out of the garage, and Martin immediately drove his vehicle into the garage, and the garage door was closed. Several minutes later, Bucci drove his vehicle into the garage. Bucci reentered the garage, and the garage door was closed again. A few minutes later, Bucci and Martin came out of the garage and drove away in their respective vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p>Officers then stopped Bucci and searched his vehicle. Based on all the information known to the officers at the time they stopped Bucci, they had probable cause to believe there was evidence of criminal activity in his vehicle at that time.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Government's rebuttal opening statement</h2>\n<p>Bucci challenges both the district court's decision, at trial, to permit the Government to give a rebuttal opening statement and the substance of that statement. Although rebuttal opening statements are rare, generally the management of a trial is left to the district court's discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Moore,</i> 923 F.2d 910, 913 (1st Cir.1991). So, too, is \"[t]he scope and extent of an opening\" statement. <i>United States v. Hershenow,</i> 680 F.2d 847, 858 (1st Cir.1982). Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the Government a rebuttal opening statement. Nor does the substance of that statement warrant relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Sentencing issues</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Basing Bucci's sentence on the amount of drugs found by the district court</h2>\n<p>Bucci contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by basing his sentence on the court's factual finding, made by a preponderance of the evidence, that Bucci was responsible for 2,900 kilograms of marijuana.<sup>[8]</sup> Because Bucci did not raise this argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> in the district court, we review for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <i>see also </i><i>Puckett v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428-29, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Here, we find no error.</p>\n<p>The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that Bucci participated in a conspiracy involving more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. That finding established both the statutory mandatory minimum sentence Bucci faced on his drug-trafficking conspiracy conviction and \"the maximum penalty the district court may impose.\" <i>United States v. Santiago,</i> 560 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir.2009), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> (U.S. June 6, 2009) (No. 08-10809). But in calculating Bucci's offense level under the sentencing guidelines, the court properly found by a preponderance of the evidence that Bucci's offenses and his related conduct actually involved 2,900 kilograms of marijuana. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d 19, 32 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1017, 1023, 173 L.Ed.2d 306 (2009).</p>\n<p>Under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Sixth Amendment error does not occur because the district judge found facts, by a preponderance of the evidence, that increased the defendant's sentence beyond that authorized by the jury's verdict; rather, Sixth Amendment error occurs when the district court does so while treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir.2005). And that did not happen here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Whether the district court realized the discretion it had to impose a below-guideline sentence</h2>\n<p>Bucci next argues that the sentencing court did not realize the extent to which it had discretion to impose a sentence below the advisory guideline range. As proof, Bucci points to the district judge's announcement, after imposing a sentence at the bottom of the advisory guideline range, that \"I, myself, don't believe in sentences as long as I imposed today, but I couldn't in my conscience as a judge find reasons that I should go below the guidelines; and accordingly, I've sentenced you to the bottom of the guidelines.\"<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Viewing the sentencing proceeding as a whole, we conclude, instead, that the district court was fully aware of its discretion to impose a below-guideline sentence. <i>See </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 596-97, 602, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. 338, 350-55, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The court's awareness is best illustrated by a spirited exchange the court had with the prosecutor during the first of two sentencing hearings: In response to the Government's argument that the court could only \"legally sentence\" Bucci as low as the bottom of the Presentence Report's recommended guideline range, the court inquired</p>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I don't quite understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: Here's why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: A Court is authorized to go below that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: I understand, your Honor. But </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> THE COURT: I'm not saying in this particular case that I should or I would, but I certainly have the power to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: I'm not saying you don't have the power, I'm saying ... I don't think the Court on this record could deviate below 151 months [the bottom of the Presentence Report's recommended guideline range] in a way that would be legally tentative [sic], okay, and here's why: The Supreme Court in United States versus Rita on June 21st held that the sentencing guideline range is presumptively reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Yes.<sup>[10]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: Of course courts have the discretion to go below it, but if they do, they need to, in detail, justify why they're going below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR] And I don't think it can be done on this record....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: What the government is asking for is a sentence that is based on the law </blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Oh, come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]:  and the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, your Honor, you make a statement like that, and I'm sorry, but with all due respect, the government is asking for a sentence </blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Are you aware of the words in [18 U.S.C.] 3553 which say \"sufficient but not unnecessary\" or \"not excessive\"?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: I am aware of that, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Well, those words are important.</blockquote>\n<p>This exchange, as well as the entire sentencing record considered as a whole, reflects the district court's clear understanding that it had discretion to impose a below-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Bucci also points to <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which the Supreme Court decided after Bucci's sentencing, as affording a district court even greater discretion to impose a below-guideline sentence than the district court had at the time it sentenced Bucci. <i>Kimbrough</i> recognized the \"district courts' authority to vary from the crack cocaine Guidelines based on [the sentencing court's] <i>policy</i> disagreement with them, and not simply based on an individualized determination that they yield an excessive sentence in a particular case.\" <i>Spears v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 840, 843, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009); <i>see also </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 564.</p>\n<p>Relying on <i>Kimbrough,</i> Bucci appears to argue, for the first time on appeal, that drug-trafficking sentences under the guidelines are unnecessarily long as a policy matter. The First Circuit has \"remanded pre-<i>Kimbrough</i> sentences without preserved claims where `there was some explicit indication that the district court might well alter its sentence.'\" <i>Santiago,</i> 560 F.3d at 68 (quoting <i>United States v. Boardman,</i> 528 F.3d 86, 87 (1st Cir.2008)) (alterations omitted). But we do not read the district court's comment  \"I, myself, don't believe in sentences as long as I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> imposed today, but I couldn't in my conscience as a judge find reasons that I should go below the guidelines,\"as indicating that the court might well alter the sentence it imposed on remand. Instead, we interpret the district court's remarks as an indication that there was no reason the court could find in this case that would justify imposing a below-guideline sentence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Olivero,</i> 552 F.3d 34, 42 (1st Cir.2009) (holding district court's remarks that \"it could not act on an `individual sense of justice' and that it had to apply rules that `it would rather not apply if [it] were free to decide otherwise'\" did not show that the sentencing court was unaware of discretion to impose below-guideline sentence; instead, the remark indicated that the sentencing court did not believe \"there was [any] reason to depart from the Guidelines\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2174, 173 L.Ed.2d 1168 (2009). And a district court, in exercising its discretion to impose a below-guideline sentence, must still do so in a reasoned manner. <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 596-97; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 532 F.3d 68, 70 (1st Cir.2008). Therefore, we decline to remand Bucci's case for resentencing on this basis. <i>See </i><i>United States v. King,</i> 554 F.3d 177, 182 (1st Cir.2009), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2169, 173 L.Ed.2d 1165 (2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Whether the district court adequately considered Bucci's argument for a below-guideline sentence</h2>\n<p>Bucci argues that the district court did not adequately consider his argument for a below-guideline sentence, based upon the sentencing disparity between Bucci and his co-conspirators. Bucci acknowledges that he did not object at sentencing to the alleged inadequacy of the district court's consideration of his argument; Bucci, therefore, concedes this court should review this issue for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p>Even assuming for argument's sake there was error, Bucci must also show that such error affected his substantial rights. <i>See </i><i>Puckett,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1429. In the sentencing context, that means Bucci must show that there is a \"reasonable probability that, but for the error, the district court would have imposed a different, more favorable sentence.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Castillo,</i> 562 F.3d 80, 83 (1st Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted). Bucci has not shown that here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Whether the district court erred in instructing the jury that \"proceeds\" from Bucci's drug trafficking, for purposes of forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. § 853, meant gross receipts</h2>\n<p>Bucci challenges the instruction the district court gave jurors defining \"proceeds\" for forfeiture purposes. Because Bucci did not object to this instruction after the trial court gave it to the jury, this court reviews for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The forfeiture provision at issue here, 21 U.S.C. § 853(a)(1), provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny person convicted of a violation of this subchapter\" addressing drug trafficking \"shall forfeit to the United States ... (1) any property constituting or derived from, any <i>proceeds</i> the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation.\" (Emphasis added.) In Bucci's case, the district court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote>[p]roceeds of drug trafficking include any monies or other property that a defendant obtained directly or indirectly as the result of his drug-trafficking violations. Proceeds include the total amount of <i>gross proceeds</i> obtained by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> the defendant as a result of his drug trafficking and is not reduced by any amounts the defendant paid for the drugs he later sold or for any other costs or expenses he incurred.</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>This instruction is consistent with First Circuit authority. In <i>United States v. Hurley,</i> 63 F.3d 1, 21 (1st Cir.1995), we previously held that \"proceeds,\" for forfeiture purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1963, were not limited to net profits. Although we reached this conclusion in a case involving the similarly worded forfeiture statute under 18 U.S.C. § 1963, rather than 21 U.S.C. § 853,<sup>[11]</sup> we have further recognized that \"case law under 18 U.S.C. § 1963 is persuasive in construing 21 U.S.C. § 853, and vice versa,\" <i>United States v. White,</i> 116 F.3d 948, 950 (1st Cir.1997). Thus, the question of whether the forfeiture instruction the district court gave Bucci's jurors complied with First Circuit precedent is an easy call; it did.</p>\n<p>The legislative history underlying § 853's enactment bolsters our conclusion.</p>\n<blockquote>Congress substantially amended § 853 along with other forfeiture provisions as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 to enhance the effectiveness of then existing forfeiture statutes under both the Organized Crime Control Act, which was aimed at \"racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations\" (RICO), and the Drug Control Act. The legislative history leaves no doubt that Congress intended to impose the sanction of criminal forfeiture against drug traffickers in order to strip these offenders and organizations of their economic power.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Caparotta,</i> 571 F.Supp.2d 195, 200 (D.Me.2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The legislative history underlying the similarly worded § 1963 further \"explains without qualification that the term `proceeds' has been used in lieu of the term `profits' in order to alleviate the unreasonable burden on the government of proving net profits.\" <i>Hurley,</i> 63 F.3d at 21 (quotation omitted). The same is true in forfeiture proceedings under § 853(a). <i>See </i><i>Caparotta,</i> 571 F.Supp.2d at 200. For these reasons, we conclude that, at the time the district court gave this instruction, it was correct under First Circuit authority. Bucci concedes as much.</p>\n<p>Bucci argues, however, that a subsequent Supreme Court case, <i>United States v. Santos,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008) (plurality opinion), now makes the forfeiture instruction given <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> in his case wrong.<sup>[12]</sup> We cannot agree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Santos,</i> a plurality of the Court held that the term \"proceeds,\" as used in yet another forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), meant \"`profits' rather than `receipts,' at least when the predicate offense is an illegal lottery operation.\"<sup>[13]</sup><i>Levesque,</i> 546 F.3d at 82 (citing <i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2025 (plurality opinion), and <i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2033-34 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment)). Based upon <i>Santos,</i> Bucci submits that the question presented here is whether \"the monies which may be forfeited under a[ ][21] U.S.C. § 853 money judgment are the gross proceeds of the offense or [instead are] the gross profits after the cost of the drugs sold is subtracted.\"<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Contrary to Bucci's argument, <i>Santos</i> is not controlling here. The forfeiture statute at issue in <i>Santos,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), is distinguishable from the statute at issue here, 21 U.S.C. § 853, in at least two critical respects. First, § 1956(a) refers only to \"proceeds,\" and does not use the phrase \"profits or other proceeds\" that is found in § 853. To interpret the term \"proceeds\" in the phrase \"profits or other proceeds\" to mean profits would render the word \"profits\" redundant. <i>See </i><i>Caparotta,</i> 571 F.Supp.2d at 199; <i>see also </i><i>Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 551 U.S. 644, 669, 127 S.Ct. 2518, 168 L.Ed.2d 467 (2007) (cautioning \"against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant\"). The language found in § 1956(a), on the other hand, which was at issue in <i>Santos,</i> refers only to \"proceeds\" and does not contain the additional word \"profits,\" and thus does not present this redundancy problem.</p>\n<p>Second, § 1956(a) sets forth not simply a forfeiture provision, but also a substantive criminal offense. That was a critical point for the <i>Santos</i> plurality. In <i>Santos,</i> the defendant was convicted of both conducting an illegal gambling business, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1955, and money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), which required proof that the defendant used the proceeds of the illegal gambling operation to \"promote\" that illegal business. <i>See </i><i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2023. Justice Stevens, who provided the fifth vote in <i>Santos,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> <i>see id.</i> at 2031, was particularly concerned about the \"perverse\" result that would occur if the Government were allowed \"to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business,\" the operation of which is itself a federal offense, as a separate money laundering offense under § 1956(a). <i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2032-33. According to Justice Stevens, that \"perverse\" result is \"tantamount to double jeopardy, which is particularly unfair in [Santos'] case because the penalties for money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the underlying offense of operating a gambling business.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2033. This same \"merger\" problem also concerned the four members of the <i>Santos</i> plurality. <i>See id.</i> at 2026-28.</p>\n<p>Under 21 U.S.C. § 853, however, there is no possibility of such a \"perverse\" merger problem because, unlike the forfeiture statute at issue in <i>Santos,</i> the forfeiture statute here, § 853(a), does not set forth a substantive criminal offense. Instead, \"[t]o become subject to a forfeiture under § 853, a defendant has to be convicted of a predicate crime under Title 21, and, upon such conviction, § 853 simply assures that a drug dealer is deprived of the economic power generated by illegally deprived wealth.\" <i>Caparotta,</i> 571 F.Supp.2d at 199-200.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the district court did not plainly err in instructing Bucci's jury that \"proceeds\" meant \"gross proceeds.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We AFFIRM Bucci's convictions, sentence and the forfeiture orders in all respects.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, \"sitting by designation\".</p>\n<p>[1]  Specifically, the jury found $2 million forfeitable as drug proceeds, and $700,000 forfeitable as part of Bucci's money laundering conspiracy. In addition, the jury found that Bucci's home, vehicle, boat, and the funds in three of his bank accounts and an investment account should all be forfeited.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Government does not dispute that Bucci's website enjoys First Amendment protection. We therefore assume, without deciding, that that is so. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Carmichael,</i> 326 F.Supp.2d 1267, 1270 (holding similar website \"constitutes protected speech\"), <i>supplemented by</i> 326 F.Supp.2d 1303 (M.D.Ala. 2004).</p>\n<p>[3]  In contrast to a pretrial claim of vindictive prosecution, like the one presented here, the Supreme Court has recognized that the Government's decision to increase the charges brought against a defendant <i>after</i> he has once been convicted may more readily create a presumption of vindictiveness:\n</p>\n<p>[O]nce a trial begins-and certainly by the time a conviction has been obtained-it is much more likely that the [Government] has discovered and assessed all of the information against an accused and has made a determination, on the basis of that information, of the extent to which he should be prosecuted. Thus, a change in the charging decision made after an initial trial is completed is much more likely to be improperly motivated than is a pretrial decision.</p>\n<p><i>United States v. Goodwin,</i> 457 U.S. 368, 381, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982).</p>\n<p>[4]  18 U.S.C. § 1957 provides, in relevant part, that\n</p>\n<p>(a) Whoever, in any of the circumstances set forth in subsection (d), knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from specified unlawful activity, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).</p>\n<p>....</p>\n<p>(f) As used in this section </p>\n<p>(1) the term \"monetary transaction\" means the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, of funds ... by, through, or to a financial institution ..., but such term does not include any transaction necessary to preserve a person's right to representation as guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>[5]  Although courts often refer to this inquiry as a question of standing, it is more appropriately treated as a substantive Fourth Amendment legal question. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rheault,</i> 561 F.3d 55, 58 n. 8 (1st Cir.2009), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> (U.S. June 18, 2009) (No. 08-11022).</p>\n<p>[6]  There was a factual dispute as to whether or not agents found marijuana in Belmonte's trailer <i>before</i> they stopped Bucci. But the district court expressly did \"not rely on the evidence seized from Belmonte's trailer in assessing whether the Government possessed probable cause to stop and search Bucci's motor vehicle.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Bucci's chief argument on appeal is that there was never any previous indication that he had ever delivered drugs <i>in his own vehicle.</i> First, that is not true. The district court determined that, on March 28, 2003, the video surveillance camera captured Bucci and another man loading several large bags into Bucci's car and then driving away; Bucci returned home alone an hour later. Bucci has never specifically challenged any of the district court's factual recitation. Moreover, even without any previous connection specifically between Bucci's vehicle and the prior observed conduct, probable cause existed to believe that, on June 4, 2003, there was evidence of criminal activity in his vehicle.</p>\n<p>[8]  Bucci also argues that \"increasing the mandatory-minimum [statutory] sentence\" required by his drug-trafficking conspiracy conviction, \"based upon judicial findings [made] by a preponderance of the evidence[,] violates the Sixth Amendment.\" But Bucci acknowledges that the Supreme Court, as well as the First Circuit, has already rejected this argument. <i>See </i><i>Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 557, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (plurality opinion); <i>United States v. Goodine,</i> 326 F.3d 26, 27-32 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>[9]  In light of this statement, the Government concedes that Bucci's case should be remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to resentence Bucci. We are not bound by the Government's concession, however. <i>See </i><i>Orloff v. Willoughby,</i> 345 U.S. 83, 87, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 433 F.3d 411, 414 n. 6 (4th Cir.2006) (noting that \"we are not at liberty to vacate and remand for resentencing on the Government's concession alone,\" citing supporting authority).</p>\n<p>[10]  During the second sentencing hearing, defense counsel accurately asserted that\n</p>\n<p>when we were here the last time, certain statements were made by the government in terms of what <i>Rita v. United States</i> means and about a presumption of reasonableness, and I'll just point out that Rita very clearly says on page 12 of the majority decision that the presumption that they're talking about here does not apply to the district court; that is an appellate review standard.</p>\n<p><i>See </i><i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S. at 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456. The court responded, \"I've read Rita since the last time and I'm aware of that, yes.\"</p>\n<p>[11]  The forfeiture statute at issue here, 21 U.S.C. § 853(a), provides in pertinent part:\n</p>\n<p>[a]ny person convicted of a violation of this subchapter ... punishable by imprisonment for more than one year shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law</p>\n<p>(1) any property constituting, or derived from, any <i>proceeds</i> the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation;</p>\n<p>....</p>\n<p>The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this subchapter..., that the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this part, a defendant who derives <i>profits or other proceeds</i> from an offense may be fined not more than twice the <i>gross profits or other proceeds.</i></p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) The concluding paragraph of the forfeiture provision found at 18 U.S.C. § 1963(a) is worded almost identically. Furthermore, Congress expanded § 1963(a) at the same time that it created § 853's \"drug-related forfeiture provision.\" <i>United States v. White,</i> 116 F.3d 948, 950 (1st Cir. 1997). And, at that time, Congress noted that § 853(a) \"closely parallel[s]\" § 1963(a). <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 116 F.3d at 950.</p>\n<p>[12]  This precise issue was raised in <i>United States v. Levesque,</i> 546 F.3d 78, 81-82 (1st Cir.2008). In that case, we remanded the question to the district court to address it in the first instance and thus we did not resolve the issue. <i>See id.</i> at 82-83.</p>\n<p>[13]  18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1), which is codified among general federal racketeering and money laundering statutes, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951-1960, provides in pertinent part that\n</p>\n<p>[w]hoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents <i>proceeds</i> of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of unspecified unlawful activity</p>\n<p>(A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity;</p>\n<p>....</p>\n<p>shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.

Section 1956, then, not only addresses forfeiture, but also sets forth a substantive money laundering offense.</p>\n<p>[14]  Bucci argues, then, that \"proceeds\" means \"gross profits\"the gross proceeds minus the cost of the drugs.

Levitt, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before HOWARD, SELYA, and EBEL,<sup>[*]</sup> Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>EBEL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this direct criminal appeal, Sean Bucci challenges his sixteen convictions for drug trafficking, money laundering and tax evasion, his resulting 151-month prison sentence, and a forfeiture order. Having jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The evidence presented at trial established that Bucci's co-defendant Anthony Belmonte sold Bucci approximately 300 to 350 pounds of marijuana eight or nine times each year, over the course of three and one-half years. Following a nine-month investigation, the United States charged Bucci with sixteen counts of drug trafficking, money laundering and tax evasion. At trial, Bucci acknowledged that he was a marijuana dealer, but disputed the amount of marijuana with which he was charged. The jury found Bucci guilty on all sixteen charges and specifically found that the charged drug-trafficking conspiracy involved over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. The jury also returned several special forfeiture verdicts against Bucci.<sup>[1]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> district court then sentenced Bucci to 151 months in prison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Challenges to the indictments</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Vindictive prosecution</h2>\n<p>The United States initially indicted Bucci, along with Belmonte and another co-defendant, Darren Martin, on two drug-trafficking charges: 1) conspiring to possess at least 100 kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; and 2) possessing at least 100 kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(vii). The indictment also charged that any of Bucci's property that represented proceeds from his drug-trafficking offenses was forfeitable under 21 U.S.C. § 853.</p>\n<p>A year later, in August 2004, Bucci started a website, whosarat.com, where individuals could post information about government informants. Six months after Bucci started this website, the Government, on February 3, 2005, filed a superseding indictment which charged only Bucci and Martin with the same two drug-trafficking counts, but increased the amount of marijuana charged in the alleged conspiracy from 100 to at least 1000 kilograms. The increased amount of marijuana charged raised the statutory mandatory minimum sentence Bucci faced for the conspiracy offense, if convicted, from five to ten years. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p>A year after Bucci started whosarat.com, the Government, on July 28, 2005, filed a second superseding indictment charging Bucci with the same two drug-trafficking offenses, but adding fourteen additional counts involving money laundering, tax evasion, and unlawfully structuring financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements. The second superseding indictment also added Bucci's mother, Catherine Bucci, as a co-defendant.</p>\n<p>Bucci claims that the Government's decision to file the two superseding indictments in his case-which increased the number of charges against him from two to sixteen and the amount of marijuana charged in the alleged drug-trafficking conspiracy from 100 to at least 1,000 kilograms-amounted to vindictive prosecution intended to punish him for exercising his First Amendment right to operate his website, whosarat.com.<sup>[2]</sup> Bucci sought to prove vindictive prosecution by demonstrating circumstances establishing a likelihood of vindictiveness sufficient to create a presumption that the prosecution was, in fact, acting vindictively. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jenkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203400\"><a href=\"/opinion/203400/united-states-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is difficult to make such a showing pretrial, however, in light of the broad discretion afforded the prosecutor to determine who should be prosecuted and for what crime, and the presumption that the prosecutor has exercised that discretion in good faith.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> <i>United States v.

Denial of Bucci's discovery request</h2>\n<p>In the district court, Bucci sought discovery from the Government in order to support his vindictive-prosecution claim. The district court denied that request. We review that decision for an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203160\"><a href=\"/opinion/203160/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2008) (reviewing selective-prosecution claim).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. Applicable standard</h2>\n<p>In light of the presumption that a prosecutor has acted in good faith in exercising his discretion to make charging decisions, courts require a defendant seeking discovery first to come forth with \"some\" objective evidence tending to show the existence of prosecutorial vindictiveness. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774599\"><a href=\"/opinion/774599/united-states-v-wiley-gene-wilson-united-states-of-america-v-wiley-gene/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 315 (4th Cir.2001); <i>United States v.

These courts derive this standard from <i>United States v. Armstrong</i><i>, see</i> 517 U.S. at 468, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></a></span>, in which the Supreme Court addressed discovery sought in support of a selective-prosecution claim. <i>See </i><i>Wilson,</i> 262 F.3d at 315-16; <i>Sanders,</i> 211 F.3d at 717. This is the standard that the district court applied in Bucci's case, and we adopt it here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. Whether Bucci made such a showing here</h2>\n<p>In order to obtain discovery, then, Bucci first had to advance some evidence tending to establish his vindictive-prosecution claim. He failed to do so.</p>\n<p>In support of his discovery motion, Bucci relied on \"the statements of law enforcement and government officers reporting whosarat.com contained in ... newspaper articles, documents, and security reports.\" While the reported statements of these officers expressed serious concern about the danger to informants posed by postings made on Bucci's website, Bucci set forth no evidence suggesting that this concern ever affected the prosecutors making the specific charging decisions in his case. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> To obtain discovery, Bucci must do more than simply \"identify a potential motive for prosecutorial animus.\" <i>Sanders,</i> 211 F.3d at 718. He must connect any vindictive animus to those making the challenged charging decisions in his case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Goulding,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672079\"><a href=\"/opinion/672079/united-states-v-randall-s-goulding-and-michael-m-ushijima/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>, 662 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>Bucci also relied on evidence regarding the Government's opposition to a pretrial motion Bucci's co-defendant, Catherine Bucci, filed in this case seeking early disclosure of statements made by Government witnesses. In opposing that request, the Government noted that, while it generally would not oppose early disclosure, in this case it would not agree to it because of the Government's concern that Bucci was trying to intimidate Government witnesses through whosarat.com. In opposing Catherine Bucci's motion, however, the Government was only asserting a legitimate litigation strategy. The fact that it was based in part on the effects the information posted on Bucci's website might have on this specific prosecution did not suggest that prosecutors filed the superseding indictments against Bucci to retaliate against him for operating the website. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Segal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1395924\"><a href=\"/opinion/1395924/united-states-v-segal/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 833 (7th Cir.2007) (\"A prosecutor cannot be said to act vindictively by taking into account a defendant's perceived efforts to intimidate witnesses.\").</p>\n<p>In support of his discovery request, Bucci further relied on the general circumstances attendant to his prosecution, asserting that the prosecutor all along had enough evidence to charge him with the added offenses and increased amount of marijuana, but did not bring those charges until after Bucci started whosarat.com. Assuming that the Government had enough evidence to indict Bucci initially on the increased charges, this fact alone is insufficient to establish that the Government later filed the superseding indictments to punish Bucci for whosarat.com. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Roach,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1235975\"><a href=\"/opinion/1235975/united-states-v-roach/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 444-45 (6th Cir.2007) (rejecting argument that the fact that the Government could have brought charges initially, but did not do so, indicated the prosecutor's vindictiveness), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2051</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></span> (2008).</p>\n<p>Moreover, \"evidence of suspicious timing alone does not indicate prosecutorial animus.\" <i>United States v. Cooper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795553\"><a href=\"/opinion/795553/united-states-v-cortez-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span>, 856 (7th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). In any event, the district court noted that \"the sequence of events in this case is not so remarkable as to justify discovery.\" We agree. Bucci began operating his website in August 2004. It was six months later that the Government filed the first superseding indictment, and another six months before the Government filed the second superseding indictment against Bucci. These superseding indictments were not so close in time to Bucci's starting the whosarat.com website to provide strong evidence that the prosecutor acted vindictively. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marrapese,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492626\"><a href=\"/opinion/492626/united-states-v-frank-l-marrapese/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 147 (1st Cir.1987) (noting two events that were \"well removed in time\" were not strong evidence of actual vindictiveness).</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying Bucci discovery in support of his vindictive-prosecution claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Denial of motion to dismiss indictment</h2>\n<p>Despite not being able to conduct discovery, Bucci nevertheless moved for the dismissal of the second superseding indictment, asserting that it was the result of vindictive prosecution. The district court denied Bucci's motion. We review that decision for an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Poole,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790207\"><a href=\"/opinion/790207/united-states-v-hampton-poole/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></a></span>, 772 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> (6th Cir.2005). But in applying this deferential standard, we review any ancillary factual findings for clear error and relevant legal determinations de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Aviles-Sierra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203388\"><a href=\"/opinion/203388/united-states-v-aviles-sierra/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 126 (1st Cir.2008). We agree with the Government that the \"subsidiary question\" presented here, whether Bucci established a presumption of vindictiveness, is a legal determination that we should review de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77266\"><a href=\"/opinion/77266/united-states-v-javado-barner/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1310</span></a></span>, 1315 n. 5 (11th Cir.2006); <i>Wilson,</i> 262 F.3d at 316.</p>\n<p>Bucci argues that he presented evidence to the district court sufficient to establish a presumption of vindictiveness and shift the burden to the prosecution to show it had legitimate reasons for increasing the charges against him. We reject that argument, for the same reasons discussed above.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Denial of motion to dismiss Count 5 as time-barred</h2>\n<p>Bucci moved for the dismissal of the second superseding indictment's fifth count, arguing that it was time-barred. Because the pertinent facts are undisputed, this court reviews de novo the district court's decision to deny that motion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. DeLeon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202136\"><a href=\"/opinion/202136/united-states-v-deleon/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The relevant statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a), provides that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.\" Ordinarily the limitation period begins to run when the crime is complete, <i>see </i><i>Toussie v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108084\"><a href=\"/opinion/108084/toussie-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108084\"><a href=\"/opinion/108084/toussie-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span> (1970), and the parties do not argue otherwise here.</p>\n<p>The fifth count of the second superseding indictment charged that Bucci,</p>\n<blockquote>[o]n or about July 28, 2000 ... did knowingly and intentionally engage in a monetary transaction in property derived from specified unlawful activity-to wit: the deposit of approximately $222,179.88 into his Checking Account... at First Massachusetts Bank ... with proceeds derived from the sale of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957.<sup>[4]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The Government filed the second superseding indictment on July 28, 2005, exactly five years to the day after the charged offense. But the parties agree that Bucci actually submitted the deposit at issue to the bank after 2:30 p.m. on July 27, 2000. The bank did not credit that deposit to Bucci's account until the next business day, July 28. The question presented in this case, then, is when was this charged offense complete: when Bucci submitted the deposit on July 27 or when the bank credited Bucci's account on July 28. The parties do not cite, and we have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> not found, any authority addressing this exact question.</p>\n<p>In resolving this question, we look to the relevant language of § 1957(a). The statute proscribes knowingly engaging in a monetary transaction. The transaction at issue here was the deposit of funds. Pursuant to the express terms of the bank's policy, of which the bank informed Bucci, a submission of funds to the bank after 2:00 p.m. would not be deposited into the depositor's account until the following business day. Thus, Bucci did not \"engage\" in this monetary transaction until July 28, 2000, and the indictment charging this offense was, therefore, timely filed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Fourth Amendment issues</h2>\n<p>Bucci claims that law enforcement officials violated the Fourth Amendment by 1) conducting almost constant surveillance of his home using a video camera; and 2) stopping his vehicle without probable cause. The district court denied Bucci's motion to suppress asserted on these grounds. In considering the district court's decision to deny a suppression motion, this court reviews legal questions de novo and any factual findings for clear error. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Whether a particular set of facts rises to the level of probable cause is a legal determination that this court reviews de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Over the next eight months, officers themselves observed what appeared to be deliveries being made to Bucci's home through vehicles driven into his garage and unloaded out of public view. After these deliveries, officers would find empty boxes and bags in Bucci's garbage which contained marijuana residue. Soon thereafter, a number of individuals would come to Bucci's home, take other boxes or bags from the house, and depart in short order.</p>\n<p>On June 2, 2003, the confidential informant told agents that \"Bucci might have recently received a shipment of marijuana.\"</p>\n<blockquote>On the morning of June 4, 2003, the pole camera showed Bucci and another man  later identified as defendant Belmonte  carrying eight large cardboard boxes (similar to the size and construction to those seized during the garbage searches) into the garage of Bucci's residence. Once the boxes were in the garage, the door was closed, and Bucci and Belmonte remained inside the residence for approximately two hours....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Belmonte and Bucci eventually emerged from the garage carrying a box which appeared to be very heavy. The two walked towards [Belmonte's] trailer and returned to the garage empty handed. Within minutes, Belmonte exited the garage, got into the pick-up truck with the trailer attached, and drove off.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> Thereafter, \"[a]gents ordered police officers to stop the vehicle driven by Belmonte.\"<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>While Belmonte was being stopped by police, another man pulled into Bucci's driveway. Bucci came out of the house, and the driver of the vehicle  later identified as Defendant Martin  parked the vehicle, and entered the residence with Bucci. Moments later, Bucci and Martin came out of the residence and got into their respective vehicles. Martin moved his vehicle so that Bucci could drive his vehicle out of the garage, and Martin immediately drove his vehicle into the garage, and the garage door was closed. Several minutes later, Bucci drove his vehicle into the garage. Bucci reentered the garage, and the garage door was closed again. A few minutes later, Bucci and Martin came out of the garage and drove away in their respective vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p>Officers then stopped Bucci and searched his vehicle. Based on all the information known to the officers at the time they stopped Bucci, they had probable cause to believe there was evidence of criminal activity in his vehicle at that time.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Government's rebuttal opening statement</h2>\n<p>Bucci challenges both the district court's decision, at trial, to permit the Government to give a rebuttal opening statement and the substance of that statement. Although rebuttal opening statements are rare, generally the management of a trial is left to the district court's discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554888\"><a href=\"/opinion/554888/united-states-v-iona-m-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 913 (1st Cir.1991). So, too, is \"[t]he scope and extent of an opening\" statement. <i>United States v. Hershenow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405158\"><a href=\"/opinion/405158/united-states-v-steven-v-hershenow-stuart-m-rosenthal-steven-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 858 (1st Cir.1982). Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the Government a rebuttal opening statement. Nor does the substance of that statement warrant relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Sentencing issues</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Basing Bucci's sentence on the amount of drugs found by the district court</h2>\n<p>Bucci contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by basing his sentence on the court's factual finding, made by a preponderance of the evidence, that Bucci was responsible for 2,900 kilograms of marijuana.<sup>[8]</sup> Because Bucci did not raise this argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> in the district court, we review for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <i>see also </i><i>Puckett v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145896\"><a href=\"/opinion/145896/puckett-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span> (2009). Here, we find no error.</p>\n<p>The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that Bucci participated in a conspiracy involving more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. That finding established both the statutory mandatory minimum sentence Bucci faced on his drug-trafficking conspiracy conviction and \"the maximum penalty the district court may impose.\" <i>United States v. Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203762\"><a href=\"/opinion/203762/united-states-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.2009), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> (U.S. June 6, 2009) (No. 08-10809). But in calculating Bucci's offense level under the sentencing guidelines, the court properly found by a preponderance of the evidence that Bucci's offenses and his related conduct actually involved 2,900 kilograms of marijuana. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203469\"><a href=\"/opinion/203469/united-states-v-cruz-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), Sixth Amendment error does not occur because the district judge found facts, by a preponderance of the evidence, that increased the defendant's sentence beyond that authorized by the jury's verdict; rather, Sixth Amendment error occurs when the district court does so while treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Luciano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201685\"><a href=\"/opinion/201685/united-states-v-luciano/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 179 (1st Cir.2005). And that did not happen here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Whether the district court realized the discretion it had to impose a below-guideline sentence</h2>\n<p>Bucci next argues that the sentencing court did not realize the extent to which it had discretion to impose a sentence below the advisory guideline range. As proof, Bucci points to the district judge's announcement, after imposing a sentence at the bottom of the advisory guideline range, that \"I, myself, don't believe in sentences as long as I imposed today, but I couldn't in my conscience as a judge find reasons that I should go below the guidelines; and accordingly, I've sentenced you to the bottom of the guidelines.\"<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Viewing the sentencing proceeding as a whole, we conclude, instead, that the district court was fully aware of its discretion to impose a below-guideline sentence. <i>See </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (2007). The court's awareness is best illustrated by a spirited exchange the court had with the prosecutor during the first of two sentencing hearings: In response to the Government's argument that the court could only \"legally sentence\" Bucci as low as the bottom of the Presentence Report's recommended guideline range, the court inquired</p>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I don't quite understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: Here's why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: A Court is authorized to go below that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: I understand, your Honor. But </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> THE COURT: I'm not saying in this particular case that I should or I would, but I certainly have the power to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: I'm not saying you don't have the power, I'm saying ... I don't think the Court on this record could deviate below 151 months [the bottom of the Presentence Report's recommended guideline range] in a way that would be legally tentative [sic], okay, and here's why: The Supreme Court in United States versus Rita on June 21st held that the sentencing guideline range is presumptively reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Yes.<sup>[10]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: Of course courts have the discretion to go below it, but if they do, they need to, in detail, justify why they're going below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR] And I don't think it can be done on this record....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: What the government is asking for is a sentence that is based on the law </blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Oh, come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]:  and the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, your Honor, you make a statement like that, and I'm sorry, but with all due respect, the government is asking for a sentence </blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Are you aware of the words in [18 U.S.C.] 3553 which say \"sufficient but not unnecessary\" or \"not excessive\"?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[PROSECUTOR]: I am aware of that, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Well, those words are important.</blockquote>\n<p>This exchange, as well as the entire sentencing record considered as a whole, reflects the district court's clear understanding that it had discretion to impose a below-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Bucci also points to <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The First Circuit has \"remanded pre-<i>Kimbrough</i> sentences without preserved claims where `there was some explicit indication that the district court might well alter its sentence.'\" <i>Santiago,</i> 560 F.3d at 68 (quoting <i>United States v.

But we do not read the district court's comment  \"I, myself, don't believe in sentences as long as I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> imposed today, but I couldn't in my conscience as a judge find reasons that I should go below the guidelines,\"as indicating that the court might well alter the sentence it imposed on remand. Instead, we interpret the district court's remarks as an indication that there was no reason the court could find in this case that would justify imposing a below-guideline sentence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Olivero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203616\"><a href=\"/opinion/203616/united-states-v-olivero/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2009) (holding district court's remarks that \"it could not act on an `individual sense of justice' and that it had to apply rules that `it would rather not apply if [it] were free to decide otherwise'\" did not show that the sentencing court was unaware of discretion to impose below-guideline sentence; instead, the remark indicated that the sentencing court did not believe \"there was [any] reason to depart from the Guidelines\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whether the district court adequately considered Bucci's argument for a below-guideline sentence</h2>\n<p>Bucci argues that the district court did not adequately consider his argument for a below-guideline sentence, based upon the sentencing disparity between Bucci and his co-conspirators. Bucci acknowledges that he did not object at sentencing to the alleged inadequacy of the district court's consideration of his argument; Bucci, therefore, concedes this court should review this issue for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p>Even assuming for argument's sake there was error, Bucci must also show that such error affected his substantial rights. <i>See </i><i>Puckett,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1429. In the sentencing context, that means Bucci must show that there is a \"reasonable probability that, but for the error, the district court would have imposed a different, more favorable sentence.\" <i>United States v.

Bucci has not shown that here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Whether the district court erred in instructing the jury that \"proceeds\" from Bucci's drug trafficking, for purposes of forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. § 853, meant gross receipts</h2>\n<p>Bucci challenges the instruction the district court gave jurors defining \"proceeds\" for forfeiture purposes. Because Bucci did not object to this instruction after the trial court gave it to the jury, this court reviews for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Roberson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202345\"><a href=\"/opinion/202345/united-states-v-roberson/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The forfeiture provision at issue here, 21 U.S.C. § 853(a)(1), provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny person convicted of a violation of this subchapter\" addressing drug trafficking \"shall forfeit to the United States ... (1) any property constituting or derived from, any <i>proceeds</i> the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation.\" (Emphasis added.) In Bucci's case, the district court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote>[p]roceeds of drug trafficking include any monies or other property that a defendant obtained directly or indirectly as the result of his drug-trafficking violations. Proceeds include the total amount of <i>gross proceeds</i> obtained by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> the defendant as a result of his drug trafficking and is not reduced by any amounts the defendant paid for the drugs he later sold or for any other costs or expenses he incurred.</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>This instruction is consistent with First Circuit authority. In <i>United States v. Hurley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702294\"><a href=\"/opinion/702294/united-states-v-vincent-hurley-united-states-of-america-v-carlo-demarco/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1995), we previously held that \"proceeds,\" for forfeiture purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1963, were not limited to net profits. Although we reached this conclusion in a case involving the similarly worded forfeiture statute under 18 U.S.C. § 1963, rather than 21 U.S.C. § 853,<sup>[11]</sup> we have further recognized that \"case law under 18 U.S.C. § 1963 is persuasive in construing 21 U.S.C. § 853, and vice versa,\" <i>United States v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197435\"><a href=\"/opinion/197435/united-states-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>, 950 (1st Cir.1997). Thus, the question of whether the forfeiture instruction the district court gave Bucci's jurors complied with First Circuit precedent is an easy call; it did.</p>\n<p>The legislative history underlying § 853's enactment bolsters our conclusion.</p>\n<blockquote>Congress substantially amended § 853 along with other forfeiture provisions as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 to enhance the effectiveness of then existing forfeiture statutes under both the Organized Crime Control Act, which was aimed at \"racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations\" (RICO), and the Drug Control Act. The legislative history leaves no doubt that Congress intended to impose the sanction of criminal forfeiture against drug traffickers in order to strip these offenders and organizations of their economic power.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Caparotta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1493494\"><a href=\"/opinion/1493494/united-states-v-caparotta/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 200 (D.Me.2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The legislative history underlying the similarly worded § 1963 further \"explains without qualification that the term `proceeds' has been used in lieu of the term `profits' in order to alleviate the unreasonable burden on the government of proving net profits.\" <i>Hurley,</i> 63 F.3d at 21 (quotation omitted). The same is true in forfeiture proceedings under § 853(a). <i>See </i><i>Caparotta,</i> 571 F.Supp.2d at 200. For these reasons, we conclude that, at the time the district court gave this instruction, it was correct under First Circuit authority. Bucci concedes as much.</p>\n<p>Bucci argues, however, that a subsequent Supreme Court case, <i>United States v. Santos,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145804\"><a href=\"/opinion/145804/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2020</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145804\"><a href=\"/opinion/145804/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span> (2008) (plurality opinion), now makes the forfeiture instruction given <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> in his case wrong.<sup>[12]</sup> We cannot agree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Santos,</i> a plurality of the Court held that the term \"proceeds,\" as used in yet another forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), meant \"`profits' rather than `receipts,' at least when the predicate offense is an illegal lottery operation.\"<sup>[13]</sup><i>Levesque,</i> 546 F.3d at 82 (citing <i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2025 (plurality opinion), and <i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2033-34 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment)). Based upon <i>Santos,</i> Bucci submits that the question presented here is whether \"the monies which may be forfeited under a[ ][21] U.S.C. § 853 money judgment are the gross proceeds of the offense or [instead are] the gross profits after the cost of the drugs sold is subtracted.\"<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Contrary to Bucci's argument, <i>Santos</i> is not controlling here. The forfeiture statute at issue in <i>Santos,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), is distinguishable from the statute at issue here, 21 U.S.C. § 853, in at least two critical respects. First, § 1956(a) refers only to \"proceeds,\" and does not use the phrase \"profits or other proceeds\" that is found in § 853. To interpret the term \"proceeds\" in the phrase \"profits or other proceeds\" to mean profits would render the word \"profits\" redundant. <i>See </i><i>Caparotta,</i> 571 F.Supp.2d at 199; <i>see also </i><i>Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145703\"><a href=\"/opinion/145703/national-assn-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 669, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145703\"><a href=\"/opinion/145703/national-assn-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2518</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145703\"><a href=\"/opinion/145703/national-assn-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span> (2007) (cautioning \"against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant\"). The language found in § 1956(a), on the other hand, which was at issue in <i>Santos,</i> refers only to \"proceeds\" and does not contain the additional word \"profits,\" and thus does not present this redundancy problem.</p>\n<p>Second, § 1956(a) sets forth not simply a forfeiture provision, but also a substantive criminal offense. That was a critical point for the <i>Santos</i> plurality. In <i>Santos,</i> the defendant was convicted of both conducting an illegal gambling business, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1955, and money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), which required proof that the defendant used the proceeds of the illegal gambling operation to \"promote\" that illegal business. <i>See </i><i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2023. Justice Stevens, who provided the fifth vote in <i>Santos,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> <i>see id.</i> at 2031, was particularly concerned about the \"perverse\" result that would occur if the Government were allowed \"to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business,\" the operation of which is itself a federal offense, as a separate money laundering offense under § 1956(a). <i>Santos,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2032-33. According to Justice Stevens, that \"perverse\" result is \"tantamount to double jeopardy, which is particularly unfair in [Santos'] case because the penalties for money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the underlying offense of operating a gambling business.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2033. This same \"merger\" problem also concerned the four members of the <i>Santos</i> plurality. <i>See id.</i> at 2026-28.</p>\n<p>Under 21 U.S.C. § 853, however, there is no possibility of such a \"perverse\" merger problem because, unlike the forfeiture statute at issue in <i>Santos,</i> the forfeiture statute here, § 853(a), does not set forth a substantive criminal offense. Instead, \"[t]o become subject to a forfeiture under § 853, a defendant has to be convicted of a predicate crime under Title 21, and, upon such conviction, § 853 simply assures that a drug dealer is deprived of the economic power generated by illegally deprived wealth.\" <i>Caparotta,</i> 571 F.Supp.2d at 199-200.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the district court did not plainly err in instructing Bucci's jury that \"proceeds\" meant \"gross proceeds.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We AFFIRM Bucci's convictions, sentence and the forfeiture orders in all respects.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, \"sitting by designation\".</p>\n<p>[1]  Specifically, the jury found $2 million forfeitable as drug proceeds, and $700,000 forfeitable as part of Bucci's money laundering conspiracy. In addition, the jury found that Bucci's home, vehicle, boat, and the funds in three of his bank accounts and an investment account should all be forfeited.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Government does not dispute that Bucci's website enjoys First Amendment protection. We therefore assume, without deciding, that that is so. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Carmichael,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2463708\"><a href=\"/opinion/2463708/united-states-v-carmichael/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>, 1270 (holding similar website \"constitutes protected speech\"), <i>supplemented by</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2463793\"><a href=\"/opinion/2463793/united-states-v-carmichael/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></a></span> (M.D.Ala. 2004).</p>\n<p>[3]  In contrast to a pretrial claim of vindictive prosecution, like the one presented here, the Supreme Court has recognized that the Government's decision to increase the charges brought against a defendant <i>after</i> he has once been convicted may more readily create a presumption of vindictiveness:\n</p>\n<p>[O]nce a trial begins-and certainly by the time a conviction has been obtained-it is much more likely that the [Government] has discovered and assessed all of the information against an accused and has made a determination, on the basis of that information, of the extent to which he should be prosecuted. Thus, a change in the charging decision made after an initial trial is completed is much more likely to be improperly motivated than is a pretrial decision.</p>\n<p><i>United States v. Goodwin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110748\"><a href=\"/opinion/110748/united-states-v-goodwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 381, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110748\"><a href=\"/opinion/110748/united-states-v-goodwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span> (1982).</p>\n<p>[4]  18 U.S.C. § 1957 provides, in relevant part, that\n</p>\n<p>(a) Whoever, in any of the circumstances set forth in subsection (d), knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from specified unlawful activity, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).</p>\n<p>....</p>\n<p>(f) As used in this section </p>\n<p>(1) the term \"monetary transaction\" means the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, of funds ... by, through, or to a financial institution ..., but such term does not include any transaction necessary to preserve a person's right to representation as guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>[5]  Although courts often refer to this inquiry as a question of standing, it is more appropriately treated as a substantive Fourth Amendment legal question. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rheault,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203746\"><a href=\"/opinion/203746/united-states-v-rheault/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 58 n. 8 (1st Cir.2009), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> (U.S. June 18, 2009) (No. 08-11022).</p>\n<p>[6]  There was a factual dispute as to whether or not agents found marijuana in Belmonte's trailer <i>before</i> they stopped Bucci. But the district court expressly did \"not rely on the evidence seized from Belmonte's trailer in assessing whether the Government possessed probable cause to stop and search Bucci's motor vehicle.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Bucci's chief argument on appeal is that there was never any previous indication that he had ever delivered drugs <i>in his own vehicle.</i> First, that is not true. The district court determined that, on March 28, 2003, the video surveillance camera captured Bucci and another man loading several large bags into Bucci's car and then driving away; Bucci returned home alone an hour later. Bucci has never specifically challenged any of the district court's factual recitation. Moreover, even without any previous connection specifically between Bucci's vehicle and the prior observed conduct, probable cause existed to believe that, on June 4, 2003, there was evidence of criminal activity in his vehicle.</p>\n<p>[8]  Bucci also argues that \"increasing the mandatory-minimum [statutory] sentence\" required by his drug-trafficking conspiracy conviction, \"based upon judicial findings [made] by a preponderance of the evidence[,] violates the Sixth Amendment.\" But Bucci acknowledges that the Supreme Court, as well as the First Circuit, has already rejected this argument. <i>See </i><i>Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 557, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We are not bound by the Government's concession, however. <i>See </i><i>Orloff v. Willoughby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105095\"><a href=\"/opinion/105095/orloff-v-willoughby/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105095\"><a href=\"/opinion/105095/orloff-v-willoughby/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792818\"><a href=\"/opinion/792818/united-states-v-efrain-rodriguez-aka-feratu-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 414 n. 6 (4th Cir.2006) (noting that \"we are not at liberty to vacate and remand for resentencing on the Government's concession alone,\" citing supporting authority).</p>\n<p>[10]  During the second sentencing hearing, defense counsel accurately asserted that\n</p>\n<p>when we were here the last time, certain statements were made by the government in terms of what <i>Rita v. United States</i> means and about a presumption of reasonableness, and I'll just point out that Rita very clearly says on page 12 of the majority decision that the presumption that they're talking about here does not apply to the district court; that is an appellate review standard.</p>\n<p><i>See </i><i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S. at 351, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2456</span></a></span>. The court responded, \"I've read Rita since the last time and I'm aware of that, yes.\"</p>\n<p>[11]  The forfeiture statute at issue here, 21 U.S.C. § 853(a), provides in pertinent part:\n</p>\n<p>[a]ny person convicted of a violation of this subchapter ... punishable by imprisonment for more than one year shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law</p>\n<p>(1) any property constituting, or derived from, any <i>proceeds</i> the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation;</p>\n<p>....</p>\n<p>The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this subchapter..., that the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this part, a defendant who derives <i>profits or other proceeds</i> from an offense may be fined not more than twice the <i>gross profits or other proceeds.</i></p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) The concluding paragraph of the forfeiture provision found at 18 U.S.C. § 1963(a) is worded almost identically. Furthermore, Congress expanded § 1963(a) at the same time that it created § 853's \"drug-related forfeiture provision.\" <i>United States v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197435\"><a href=\"/opinion/197435/united-states-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>, 950 (1st Cir. 1997). And, at that time, Congress noted that § 853(a) \"closely parallel[s]\" § 1963(a). <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 116 F.3d at 950.</p>\n<p>[12]  This precise issue was raised in <i>United States v. Levesque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203552\"><a href=\"/opinion/203552/united-states-v-levesque/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 81-82 (1st Cir.2008). In that case, we remanded the question to the district court to address it in the first instance and thus we did not resolve the issue. <i>See id.</i> at 82-83.</p>\n<p>[13]  18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1), which is codified among general federal racketeering and money laundering statutes, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951-1960, provides in pertinent part that\n</p>\n<p>[w]hoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents <i>proceeds</i> of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of unspecified unlawful activity</p>\n<p>(A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity;</p>\n<p>....</p>\n<p>shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both. For purposes of this paragraph, a financial transaction shall be considered to be one involving the <i>proceeds</i> of specified unlawful activity if it is part of a set of parallel or dependent transactions, any one of which involves the <i>proceeds</i> of specified unlawful activity, and all of which are part of a single plan or arrangement.</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) Section 1956, then, not only addresses forfeiture, but also sets forth a substantive money laundering offense.</p>\n<p>[14]  Bucci argues, then, that \"proceeds\" means \"gross profits\"the gross proceeds minus the cost of the drugs. He does not contend that \"proceeds\" means \"profits,\" which Bucci defines as the gross proceeds minus <i>all</i> expenses incurred in Bucci's drug-trafficking business.</p>\n\n</div>",
