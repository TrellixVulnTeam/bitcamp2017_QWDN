This petition for review seeks, on\n\nvarious grounds, to vacate a removal order returning Renson Feliz\n\nto the Dominican Republic, his country of origin and citizenship.\n\n                 One of Feliz's claims is that the Immigration Judge (IJ)\n\nerred       in   failing    to    grant     him    a   continuance.       Despite   the\n\nrespondent's contrary arguments in this case, the Attorney General\n\nhas conceded in another case that this court has jurisdiction to\n\nconsider         claims    that   an   IJ   erred      in   denying   a   continuance.\n\nAlsamhouri v. Gonzales, ___ F.3d ___, No. 05-2800, 2007 WL 1153033,\n\nat *3 (1st Cir. Apr. 19, 2007).\n\n                 While we have jurisdiction over the continuance claim,\n\nthe petitioner's argument based on lack of a continuance still\n\nfails.       At a minimum, the petitioner never asked for or otherwise\n\nindicated clearly to the IJ that he sought a continuance.                      Feliz's\n\nother arguments are also without merit, and as a result, we deny\n\nthe petition for review.\n\n                                             I.\n\n                 Petitioner Renson Feliz was granted conditional permanent\n\nresident status in September 1998 based on his marriage to a United\n\nStates citizen.           In August 2000, he and his wife filed a Form I-751\n\njoint petition to remove the conditions on Feliz's permanent\n\nresident status.1\n\n\n        1\n          Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a conditional\npermanent resident normally must file, jointly with his spouse, a\npetition seeking the removal of conditions during the ninety-day\n\n                                             -2-\n\f           The INS2 scheduled an interview on the petition for\n\nDecember 9, 2002.         Feliz appeared, but his wife did not; he\n\nexplained that she was in the Dominican Republic for medical\n\ntreatment and asked for a postponement.             Feliz was sent by mail\n\nnotice of a new interview date of June 12, 2003, but neither he nor\n\nhis wife appeared.        On May 28, 2004, Feliz was sent a notice of\n\ntermination of his permanent resident status and a notice to appear\n\n(NTA).   The NTA was based on the termination of Feliz's permanent\n\nresident   status   for    failure   to    appear   at   the   June       12,   2003\n\ninterview.       Feliz      was   thus      removable     under       8     U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(1)(D)(i).\n\n           Feliz appeared in removal proceedings before an IJ on\n\nAugust 25, 2004, and he explained his absence from the interview on\n\nhis I-751 petition in June 2003 by saying he had never received\n\nnotice of it.   His wife was not with him on August 25.           The IJ gave\n\nFeliz a new hearing date of February 7, 2005, and told Feliz and\n\nhis counsel twice that Feliz's wife needed to be present at that\n\nhearing.   The IJ stated that evidence would be taken at that time\n\n\nperiod preceding the second anniversary of obtaining conditional\npermanent resident status. 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c), (d)(2)(A). The\ncouple also must attend an interview with an officer of the INS.\nId. § 1186a(c)(1)(B). The purpose of the petition and interview is\nto determine whether or not the marriage is bona fide. See id.\n§ 1186a(d)(1).\n     2\n          On March 1, 2003, the functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, § 471(a), 116 Stat. 2135,\n2205 (codified at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fon whether Feliz and his wife had received notice of the June 12,\n\n2003 hearing.\n\n           Running true to pattern, Feliz appeared at the February\n\n7, 2005 hearing with counsel but without his wife.         Feliz claimed\n\nthat he did not know his wife's presence was needed, although the\n\nIJ had specifically told him on August 25 that she was required to\n\nattend.    Feliz   also   testified    that   his   wife   suffered   from\n\narthritis, and that the cold February weather was bad for her.         The\n\nIJ rejected Feliz's explanations for his wife's failure to attend\n\nthe hearing and found that Feliz had failed to establish lack of\n\nnotice of the June 2003 interview.     Accordingly, the IJ found that\n\nFeliz was removable and granted him the privilege of voluntary\n\ndeparture by April 8, 2005.\n\n           On April 16, 2005, Feliz refiled an I-751 petition.        The\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) thereafter affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision without opinion, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).\n\n           Feliz filed a timely petition for review.3\n\n                                 II.\n\n           Feliz presents three claims of error in his petition for\n\nreview.   He argues that the IJ erred as a matter of law and abused\n\nhis discretion in failing to grant a continuance at the February 7\n\nhearing so that Feliz could refile his I-751 petition.        Feliz also\n\n\n\n     3\n          This court tolled the remaining period of voluntary\ndeparture, pending judicial review.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fargues that the IJ erred in failing to terminate the removal\n\nproceedings against him.    Finally, Feliz argues that the BIA's use\n\nof its summary affirmance procedures in his case exceeded the scope\n\nof the affirmance without opinion (AWO) regulations.\n\nA.        Continuance Claim\n\n          We review claims that an IJ erred in not granting a\n\ncontinuance for abuse of discretion.      Alsamhouri, 2007 WL 1153033,\n\nat *4.\n\n          In his petition for review, Feliz states that the BIA has\n\nestablished   that   IJs   should    grant   continuances   of    removal\n\nproceedings to allow for adjudication of late-filed applications\n\nfor waiver of the joint petition requirement.        See, e.g., In re\n\nStowers, 22 I. & N. Dec. 605, 612-14 (BIA 1999).     Feliz argues that\n\nhis situation is analogous to the waiver application situation, and\n\nthat BIA precedent thus required the IJ to grant a continuance.\n\n          There is no need to explore the issue because no request\n\nfor a continuance was made at the February 7, 2005 hearing.            At\n\nmost, counsel for Feliz indicated that she preferred to refile a\n\nForm I-751 rather than apply for voluntary departure.            Moreover,\n\nFeliz had no I-751 petition pending with the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity, and he has given no explanation for why he could not have\n\nrefiled his I-751 or sought rescheduling of the missed interview,\n\nsee 8 C.F.R. § 216.4(b)(3), before the February 7 hearing.\n\nB.        The IJ's Refusal to Terminate Removal Proceedings\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f              Unless a petitioner shows \"good cause\" for failure to\n\nappear at a joint petition interview, the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity      will    automatically      terminate     an   alien's     conditional\n\npermanent resident status as of the second anniversary of its\n\nconferral.     8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(2)(A)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 216.4(b)(3).\n\nFeliz   argues       that   the   IJ   erred    in   finding    that   he     had   not\n\nestablished \"good cause\" for failing to appear at the June 2003\n\ninterview, and in therefore refusing to terminate the removal\n\nproceedings against him.\n\n              We will uphold the BIA's finding that Feliz did not\n\nestablish good cause if it is supported by substantial evidence.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398\n\nF.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[A]n inquiring court must uphold\n\nthe   BIA's    resolution     of   [fact-driven]       issues    so    long    as   its\n\ndecision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\").\n\nBecause the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's determination, we\n\nreview the opinion of the IJ as if it were that of the BIA.\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              Relying on the Ninth Circuit's decision in Agyeman v.\n\nINS, 296 F.3d 871 (9th Cir. 2002), Feliz appears to argue that his\n\nwife's poor health constituted good cause for their failure to\n\nappear at the interview.               Agyeman is inapposite.          There is no\n\nevidence that this is a case in which ill health accounted for the\n\nfailure to appear at the June 12, 2003 interview.                  Feliz's wife's\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhealth has never before been offered by Feliz as a reason for their\n\nfailure to appear at that interview.    Rather Feliz said he did not\n\nreceive notice of the interview; the IJ's finding that this was not\n\ntrue was based on substantial evidence.\n\n          At the hearing, the government presented evidence that\n\nthe interview notice had been mailed to Feliz at his record address\n\nand that it had not been returned.     The government also indicated\n\nthat the notice for the first interview and the NTA had been mailed\n\nto the same address and apparently had been received. In addition,\n\nFeliz's credibility suffered substantially when he testified about\n\nwhy his wife did not appear at the February 7, 2005 hearing.    When\n\nthe IJ rejected Feliz's brazen claim that he had not known that his\n\nwife's presence was required at the hearing, Feliz added that she\n\nsuffered from arthritis and so couldn't \"be in the cold much.\"    He\n\ndid not assert that she was actually unable to appear, nor had he\n\nearlier told the IJ that there would be any difficulty with her\n\nappearing.\n\n          To the extent Feliz argues that his wife's ill health\n\nconstituted good cause for her failure to appear on February 7, and\n\nthat the IJ therefore should not have found him removable based on\n\nher failure to appear, his argument essentially is that the IJ\n\nshould have granted another continuance.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29.\n\n          In Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2003), this\n\ncourt reversed an IJ's denial of a petitioner's motion to reopen\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fwhen the petitioner's counsel had filed a motion for a continuance\n\nand the petitioner had failed to appear at a hearing.        Id. at 69-\n\n70.   In that case, the petitioner's attorney had filed on the day\n\nof the hearing an emergency motion for a continuance based on the\n\nfact that he was required to appear on a case in federal court at\n\nthe same time.      Id. at 70.     The attorney never notified the\n\npetitioner of the motion or of his conflict, and, primarily because\n\nof    transportation      difficulties,   the   petitioner      arrived\n\napproximately thirty minutes late to the hearing.            Id.    The\n\npetitioner's relatives arrived on time to the hearing and informed\n\ncourt personnel that the petitioner would be arriving shortly. Id.\n\nDespite this assurance and the attorney's motion for a continuance,\n\nhowever, the IJ proceeded in absentia and ordered the petitioner\n\ndeported.    Id.   The petitioner filed a motion to reopen, citing\n\nextraordinary circumstances, see 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii) (2002),\n\nwhich was denied.    Herbert, 325 F.3d at 70.\n\n            In Herbert, we held that if there were indeed a failure\n\nto appear, it was excused by exceptional circumstances. Id. at 72-\n\n73.   We noted that had the petitioner's attorney been able to\n\nappear, he would have informed the IJ that the petitioner was on\n\nhis way.    Id. at 72.     We further noted that had the petitioner\n\narrived on time, he likely would not have elected to proceed\n\nwithout counsel.    Id.   Finally, we observed that the petitioner's\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\ffamily had arrived at the hearing on time, and that their testimony\n\ncould have been taken first, thereby avoiding any delay.                Id.\n\n             The     facts   of   this   case   are   very   different.       No\n\ncontinuance was ever requested here.            Nor was Feliz's wife merely\n\nlate; Feliz indicated that she would not appear at all.                 The case\n\nalready had been continued once before, and there was no indication\n\nthat another continuance would result in the appearance of Feliz's\n\nwife.    The IJ did not abuse his discretion in not granting a\n\ncontinuance to allow Feliz's wife to appear.\n\n             Finally, Feliz also argues that the IJ erred in rejecting\n\nhis counsel's proffer of a joint tax return as evidence that Feliz\n\nand his wife had a bona fide marriage.          The issue before the IJ was\n\nonly whether Feliz and his wife had good cause for failing to\n\nappear for their interview on June 12, 2003.            The IJ indicated that\n\nif both Feliz and his wife had testified that they had not received\n\nnotice and if he had seen evidence that the marriage was bona fide,\n\nthen    he   might    have   been   inclined    to    terminate   the    removal\n\nproceedings.       Given that substantial evidence supports the IJ's\n\ndecision that Feliz failed to establish that he had not received\n\nnotice of the June 12, 2003 interview, the issue of whether the\n\nmarriage was bona fide is, as the IJ stated, irrelevant.                 The IJ\n\ntherefore committed no error in refusing to accept Feliz's evidence\n\nof a bona fide marriage.\n\nC.           Claimed Violation by the BIA of Its Summary Affirmance\n             Procedures\n\n                                         -9-\n\f             Feliz argues that the case should be remanded to the BIA\n\nfor further review because the BIA violated its summary affirmance\n\nregulation, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4), in issuing an AWO. Feliz does\n\nnot argue that the BIA's use of its AWO procedures has denied him\n\ndue process of law.4     Rather, he argues that issuance of an AWO was\n\nnot appropriate in his case because the two predicate prongs of 8\n\nC.F.R.   §   1003.1(e)(4)     were    not    met.     Pursuant    to   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.1(e)(4), summary affirmance is appropriate only when a Board\n\nmember determines that, inter alia, (1) \"the result reached in the\n\ndecision under review was correct\"; and (2) \"any errors in the\n\ndecision under review were harmless or nonmaterial.\"\n\n             There is an initial question about whether we have\n\njurisdiction to review Feliz's claim that the BIA violated its own\n\nAWO procedure.       The circuits have split on this issue.                Compare\n\nKambolli     v.   Gonzales,   449    F.3d   454,    463   (2d   Cir.   2006)   (no\n\njurisdiction), Tsegay v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1347, 1353-58 (10th\n\n\n\n     4\n          In Albathani, this court rejected a claim that the AWO\nprocedure itself, as enhanced in 2002, violates due process,\ninherent principles of administrative law, or any statute. 318\nF.3d at 375-79. The other circuits to have addressed the issue\nhave agreed. Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 272, 282-83\n(4th Cir. 2004); Zhang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 362 F.3d 155, 157\n(2d Cir. 2004); Yuk v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1222, 1229 (10th Cir.\n2004); Loulou v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 706, 708-09 (8th Cir. 2003);\nDia v.

Ashcroft, 324 F.3d 830, 832-33\n(5th Cir. 2003) (per curiam).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fCir. 2004) (same), and Ngure v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 975, 988 (8th\n\nCir. 2004) (same), with Smriko v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 279, 290-95\n\n(3d Cir. 2004) (jurisdiction), and Chong Shin Chen v. Ashcroft, 378\n\nF.3d 1081, 1086-88 (9th Cir. 2004) (same).              In Haoud v. Ashcroft,\n\n350   F.3d   201    (1st    Cir.    2003),   this   court   held   that   we    had\n\njurisdiction       to   review     the   BIA's   decision   to   employ   its   AWO\n\nprocedures in a case involving both reviewable and non-reviewable\n\nbases for the IJ's decision when it was unclear on which basis the\n\nBIA had summarily affirmed and when the BIA may have failed to\n\nconsider a precedent helpful to the petitioner.                  Id. at 206; see\n\nalso Hoxha v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 210, 220-21 (1st Cir. 2006).                   We\n\nremanded so that we would have a reasoned basis on which to conduct\n\njudicial review.           Haoud, 350 F.3d at 207-08.            The breadth of\n\nHaoud's reach beyond its particular facts is something of an open\n\nquestion, see Aguilar v. Gonzales, 475 F.3d 415, 418 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); Hoxha, 446 F.3d at 220-21, and a narrow reading has been\n\nsuggested by the Eighth Circuit in Ngure, 367 F.3d at 988.\n\n             We bypass the jurisdictional question because we have\n\nalready rejected the premise of Feliz's argument -- that the IJ's\n\ndecision was improper.\n\n             The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f",

Scadron, Assistant Director, on brief for respondent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This petition for review seeks, on various grounds, to vacate a removal order returning Renson Feliz to the Dominican Republic, his country of origin and citizenship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of Feliz's claims is that the Immigration Judge (IJ) erred in failing to grant him a continuance. Despite the respondent's contrary arguments in this case, the Attorney General has conceded in another case that this court has jurisdiction to consider claims that an IJ erred in denying a continuance. <i>Alsamhouri v. Gonzales,</i> 484 F.3d 117, 121 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have jurisdiction over the continuance claim, the petitioner's argument based on lack of a continuance still fails. At a minimum, the petitioner never asked for or otherwise indicated clearly to the IJ that he sought a continuance. Feliz's other arguments are also without merit, and as a result, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner Renson Feliz was granted conditional permanent resident status in September 1998 based on his marriage to a United States citizen. In August 2000, he and his wife filed a Form I-751 joint petition to remove the conditions on Feliz's permanent resident status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> scheduled an interview on the petition for December 9, 2002. Feliz appeared, but his wife did not; he explained that she was in the Dominican Republic for medical treatment and asked for a postponement. Feliz was sent by mail notice of a new interview date of June 12, 2003, but neither he nor his wife appeared. On May 28, 2004, Feliz was sent a notice of termination of his permanent resident status and a notice to appear (NTA). The NTA was based on the termination of Feliz's permanent resident status for failure to appear at the June 12, 2003 interview. Feliz was thus removable under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(D)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliz appeared in removal proceedings before an IJ on August 25, 2004, and he explained his absence from the interview on his I-751 petition in June 2003 by saying he had never received notice of it. His wife was not with him on August 25. The IJ gave Feliz a new hearing date of February 7, 2005, and told Feliz and his counsel twice that Feliz's wife needed to be present at that hearing. The IJ stated that evidence would be taken at that time on whether Feliz and his wife had received notice of the June 12, 2003 hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Running true to pattern, Feliz appeared at the February 7, 2005 hearing with counsel but without his wife. Feliz claimed that he did not know his wife's presence was needed, although the IJ had specifically told him on August 25 that she was required to attend. Feliz also testified that his wife suffered from arthritis, and that the cold February weather was bad for her. The IJ rejected Feliz's explanations for his wife's failure to attend the hearing and found that Feliz had failed to establish lack of notice of the June 2003 interview. Accordingly, the IJ found that Feliz was removable and granted him the privilege of voluntary departure by April 8, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 16, 2005, Feliz refiled an I-751 petition. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) thereafter affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Feliz filed a timely petition for review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliz presents three claims of error in his petition for review. He argues that the IJ erred as a matter of law and abused his discretion in failing to grant a continuance at the February 7 hearing so that Feliz could refile his I-751 petition. Feliz also argues that the IJ erred in failing to terminate the removal proceedings against him. Finally, Feliz argues that the BIA's use of its summary affirmance procedures in his case exceeded the scope of the affirmance without opinion (AWO) regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Continuance Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review claims that an IJ erred in not granting a continuance for abuse of discretion. <i>Alsamhouri,</i> 484 F.3d at 122-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his petition for review, Feliz states that the BIA has established that IJs should grant continuances of removal proceedings to allow for adjudication of late-filed applications for waiver of the joint petition requirement. <i>See, e.g., In re Stowers,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 605, 612-14 (BIA 1999). Feliz argues that his situation is analogous to the waiver application situation, and that BIA precedent thus required the IJ to grant a continuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need to explore the issue because no request for a continuance was made at the February 7, 2005 hearing. At most, counsel for Feliz indicated that she preferred to refile a Form I-751 rather than apply for voluntary departure. Moreover, Feliz had no I-751 petition pending with the Department of Homeland Security, and he has given no explanation for why he could not have refiled his I-751 or sought rescheduling of the missed interview, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.4(b)(3), before the February 7 hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The IJ's Refusal to Terminate Removal Proceedings</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unless a petitioner shows \"good cause\" for failure to appear at a joint petition interview, the Department of Homeland Security will automatically terminate an alien's conditional permanent resident status as of the second anniversary of its conferral. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(2)(A)(ii); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.4(b)(3). Feliz argues that the IJ erred in finding that he had not established \"good cause\" for failing to appear at the June 2003 interview, and in therefore refusing to terminate the removal proceedings against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will uphold the BIA's finding that Feliz did not establish good cause if it is supported by substantial evidence. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[A]n inquiring court must uphold the BIA's resolution of [fact-driven] issues so long as its decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\"). Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's determination, we review the opinion of the IJ as if it were that of the BIA. <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Agyeman v. INS,</i> 296 F.3d 871 (9th Cir.2002), Feliz appears to argue that his wife's poor health constituted good cause for their failure to appear at the interview. <i>Agyeman</i> is inapposite. There is no evidence that this is a case in which ill health accounted for the failure to appear <i>at the June 12, 2003 interview.</i> Feliz's wife's health has never before been offered by Feliz as a reason for their failure to appear at that interview. Rather Feliz said he did not receive notice of the interview; the IJ's finding that this was not true was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, the government presented evidence that the interview notice had been mailed to Feliz at his record address and that it had not been returned. The government also indicated that the notice for the first interview and the NTA had been mailed to the same address and apparently had been received. In addition, Feliz's credibility suffered substantially when he testified about why his wife did not appear at the February 7, 2005 hearing. When the IJ rejected Feliz's brazen claim that he had not known that his wife's presence was required at the hearing, Feliz added that she suffered from arthritis and so couldn't \"be in the cold much.\" He did not assert that she was actually <i>unable</i> to appear, nor had he earlier told the IJ that there would be any difficulty with her appearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent Feliz argues that his wife's ill health constituted good cause for her failure to appear on February 7, and that the IJ therefore should not have found him removable based on her failure to appear, his argument essentially is that the IJ should have granted another continuance. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Herbert v. Ashcroft,</i> 325 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.2003), this court reversed an IJ's denial of a petitioner's motion to reopen when the petitioner's counsel had filed a motion for a continuance and the petitioner had failed to appear at a hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 69-70. In that case, the petitioner's attorney had filed on the day of the hearing an emergency motion for a continuance based on the fact that he was required to appear on a case in federal court at the same time. <i>Id.</i> at 70. The attorney never notified the petitioner of the motion or of his conflict, and, primarily because of transportation difficulties, the petitioner arrived approximately thirty minutes late to the hearing. <i>Id.</i> The petitioner's relatives arrived on time to the hearing and informed court personnel that the petitioner would be arriving shortly. <i>Id.</i> Despite this assurance and the attorney's motion for a continuance, however, the IJ proceeded in absentia and ordered the petitioner deported. <i>Id.</i> The petitioner filed a motion to reopen, citing extraordinary circumstances, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.23(b)(4)(iii) (2002), which was denied. <i>Herbert,</i> 325 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Herbert,</i> we held that if there were indeed a failure to appear, it was excused by exceptional circumstances. <i>Id.</i> at 72-73. We noted that had the petitioner's attorney been able to appear, he would have informed the IJ that the petitioner was on his way. <i>Id.</i> at 72. We further noted that had the petitioner arrived on time, he likely would not have elected to proceed without counsel. <i>Id.</i> Finally, we observed that the petitioner's family had arrived at the hearing on time, and that their testimony could have been taken first, thereby avoiding any delay. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are very different. No continuance was ever requested here. Nor was Feliz's wife merely late; Feliz indicated that she would not appear at all. The case already had been continued once before, and there was no indication that another continuance would result in the appearance of Feliz's wife. The IJ did not abuse his discretion in not granting a continuance to allow Feliz's wife to appear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Feliz also argues that the IJ erred in rejecting his counsel's proffer of a joint tax return as evidence that Feliz and his wife had a bona fide marriage. The issue before the IJ was only whether Feliz and his wife had good cause for failing to appear for their interview on June 12, 2003. The IJ indicated that if both Feliz and his wife had testified that they had not received notice and if he had seen evidence that the marriage was bona fide, then he might have been inclined to terminate the removal proceedings. Given that substantial evidence supports the IJ's decision that Feliz failed to establish that he had not received notice of the June 12, 2003 interview, the issue of whether the marriage was bona fide is, as the IJ stated, irrelevant. The IJ therefore committed no error in refusing to accept Feliz's evidence of a bona fide marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Claimed Violation by the BIA of Its Summary Affirmance Procedures</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliz argues that the case should be remanded to the BIA for further review because the BIA violated its summary affirmance regulation, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4), in issuing an AWO. Feliz does not argue that the BIA's use of its AWO procedures has denied him due process of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Rather, he argues that issuance of an AWO was not appropriate in his case because the two predicate prongs of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) were not met. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4), summary affirmance is appropriate only when a Board member determines that, inter alia, (1) \"the result reached in the decision under review was correct\"; and (2) \"any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an initial question about whether we have jurisdiction to review Feliz's claim that the BIA violated its own AWO procedure. The circuits have split on this issue. <i>Compare Kambolli v. Gonzales,</i> 449 F.3d 454, 463 (2d Cir.2006) (no jurisdiction), <i>Tsegay v. Ashcroft,</i> 386 F.3d 1347, 1353-58 (10th Cir.2004) (same), <i>and Ngure v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 975, 988 (8th Cir. 2004) (same), <i>with Smriko v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 279, 290-95 (3d Cir.2004) (jurisdiction), <i>and Chong Shin Chen v. Ashcroft,</i> 378 F.3d 1081, 1086-88 (9th Cir.2004) (same). In <i>Haoud v. Ashcroft,</i> 350 F.3d 201 (1st Cir.2003), this court held that we had jurisdiction to review the BIA's decision to employ its AWO procedures in a case involving both reviewable and non-reviewable bases for the IJ's decision when it was unclear on which basis the BIA had summarily affirmed and when the BIA may have failed to consider a precedent helpful to the petitioner. <i>Id.</i> at 206; <i>see also Hoxha v. Gonzales,</i> 446 F.3d 210, 220-21 (1st Cir.2006). We remanded so that we would have a reasoned basis on which to conduct judicial review. <i>Haoud,</i> 350 F.3d at 207-08. The breadth of <i>Haoud's</i> reach beyond its particular facts is something of an open question, <i>see Aguilar v.

Accordingly, the IJ found that Feliz was removable and granted him the privilege of voluntary departure by April 8, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 16, 2005, Feliz refiled an I-751 petition. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) thereafter affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Feliz filed a timely petition for review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliz presents three claims of error in his petition for review. He argues that the IJ erred as a matter of law and abused his discretion in failing to grant a continuance at the February 7 hearing so that Feliz could refile his I-751 petition. Feliz also argues that the IJ erred in failing to terminate the removal proceedings against him. Finally, Feliz argues that the BIA's use of its summary affirmance procedures in his case exceeded the scope of the affirmance without opinion (AWO) regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Continuance Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review claims that an IJ erred in not granting a continuance for abuse of discretion. <i>Alsamhouri,</i> 484 F.3d at 122-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his petition for review, Feliz states that the BIA has established that IJs should grant continuances of removal proceedings to allow for adjudication of late-filed applications for waiver of the joint petition requirement. <i>See, e.g., In re Stowers,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 605, 612-14 (BIA 1999). Feliz argues that his situation is analogous to the waiver application situation, and that BIA precedent thus required the IJ to grant a continuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need to explore the issue because no request for a continuance was made at the February 7, 2005 hearing. At most, counsel for Feliz indicated that she preferred to refile a Form I-751 rather than apply for voluntary departure. Moreover, Feliz had no I-751 petition pending with the Department of Homeland Security, and he has given no explanation for why he could not have refiled his I-751 or sought rescheduling of the missed interview, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.4(b)(3), before the February 7 hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The IJ's Refusal to Terminate Removal Proceedings</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unless a petitioner shows \"good cause\" for failure to appear at a joint petition interview, the Department of Homeland Security will automatically terminate an alien's conditional permanent resident status as of the second anniversary of its conferral. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(2)(A)(ii); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.4(b)(3). Feliz argues that the IJ erred in finding that he had not established \"good cause\" for failing to appear at the June 2003 interview, and in therefore refusing to terminate the removal proceedings against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will uphold the BIA's finding that Feliz did not establish good cause if it is supported by substantial evidence. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[A]n inquiring court must uphold the BIA's resolution of [fact-driven] issues so long as its decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\"). Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's determination, we review the opinion of the IJ as if it were that of the BIA. <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200413\"><a href=\"/opinion/200413/albathani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 373 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Agyeman v.

There is no evidence that this is a case in which ill health accounted for the failure to appear <i>at the June 12, 2003 interview.</i> Feliz's wife's health has never before been offered by Feliz as a reason for their failure to appear at that interview. Rather Feliz said he did not receive notice of the interview; the IJ's finding that this was not true was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, the government presented evidence that the interview notice had been mailed to Feliz at his record address and that it had not been returned. The government also indicated that the notice for the first interview and the NTA had been mailed to the same address and apparently had been received. In addition, Feliz's credibility suffered substantially when he testified about why his wife did not appear at the February 7, 2005 hearing. When the IJ rejected Feliz's brazen claim that he had not known that his wife's presence was required at the hearing, Feliz added that she suffered from arthritis and so couldn't \"be in the cold much.\" He did not assert that she was actually <i>unable</i> to appear, nor had he earlier told the IJ that there would be any difficulty with her appearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent Feliz argues that his wife's ill health constituted good cause for her failure to appear on February 7, and that the IJ therefore should not have found him removable based on her failure to appear, his argument essentially is that the IJ should have granted another continuance. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Herbert v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200420\"><a href=\"/opinion/200420/herbert-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003), this court reversed an IJ's denial of a petitioner's motion to reopen when the petitioner's counsel had filed a motion for a continuance and the petitioner had failed to appear at a hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 69-70. In that case, the petitioner's attorney had filed on the day of the hearing an emergency motion for a continuance based on the fact that he was required to appear on a case in federal court at the same time. <i>Id.</i> at 70. The attorney never notified the petitioner of the motion or of his conflict, and, primarily because of transportation difficulties, the petitioner arrived approximately thirty minutes late to the hearing. <i>Id.</i> The petitioner's relatives arrived on time to the hearing and informed court personnel that the petitioner would be arriving shortly. <i>Id.</i> Despite this assurance and the attorney's motion for a continuance, however, the IJ proceeded in absentia and ordered the petitioner deported. <i>Id.</i> The petitioner filed a motion to reopen, citing extraordinary circumstances, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.23(b)(4)(iii) (2002), which was denied. <i>Herbert,</i> 325 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Herbert,</i> we held that if there were indeed a failure to appear, it was excused by exceptional circumstances. <i>Id.</i> at 72-73. We noted that had the petitioner's attorney been able to appear, he would have informed the IJ that the petitioner was on his way. <i>Id.</i> at 72. We further noted that had the petitioner arrived on time, he likely would not have elected to proceed without counsel. <i>Id.</i> Finally, we observed that the petitioner's family had arrived at the hearing on time, and that their testimony could have been taken first, thereby avoiding any delay. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are very different. No continuance was ever requested here. Nor was Feliz's wife merely late; Feliz indicated that she would not appear at all. The case already had been continued once before, and there was no indication that another continuance would result in the appearance of Feliz's wife. The IJ did not abuse his discretion in not granting a continuance to allow Feliz's wife to appear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Feliz also argues that the IJ erred in rejecting his counsel's proffer of a joint tax return as evidence that Feliz and his wife had a bona fide marriage. The issue before the IJ was only whether Feliz and his wife had good cause for failing to appear for their interview on June 12, 2003. The IJ indicated that if both Feliz and his wife had testified that they had not received notice and if he had seen evidence that the marriage was bona fide, then he might have been inclined to terminate the removal proceedings. Given that substantial evidence supports the IJ's decision that Feliz failed to establish that he had not received notice of the June 12, 2003 interview, the issue of whether the marriage was bona fide is, as the IJ stated, irrelevant. The IJ therefore committed no error in refusing to accept Feliz's evidence of a bona fide marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Claimed Violation by the BIA of Its Summary Affirmance Procedures</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliz argues that the case should be remanded to the BIA for further review because the BIA violated its summary affirmance regulation, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4), in issuing an AWO. Feliz does not argue that the BIA's use of its AWO procedures has denied him due process of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Rather, he argues that issuance of an AWO was not appropriate in his case because the two predicate prongs of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) were not met. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4), summary affirmance is appropriate only when a Board member determines that, inter alia, (1) \"the result reached in the decision under review was correct\"; and (2) \"any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an initial question about whether we have jurisdiction to review Feliz's claim that the BIA violated its own AWO procedure.
