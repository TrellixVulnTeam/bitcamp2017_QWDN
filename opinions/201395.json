Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                             Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Fred DeWitt on brief pro se.\n     Patricia A. Coyne-Fague on Memorandum in Support of Motion for\nSummary Affirmance.\n\n\n\n                            December 30, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam.    Pro se appellant Fred DeWitt challenges a\n\ndistrict court judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit\n\nagainst various Rhode Island prison officials and employees. After\n\ncareful review of the record and briefs on appeal, we affirm for\n\nthe following reasons.\n\n          1. We affirm the dismissal of the denial of court access\n\nclaim, essentially for the reasons given in the district court's\n\nMemorandum and Order dated August 19, 2003.     The court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in dismissing that claim as a sanction for\n\nDeWitt's behavior during a pre-trial conference.\n\n          2.   In affirming summary judgment for defendants on the\n\nretaliation claim, we rely substantially on the reasoning in the\n\nmagistrate judge's report and recommendation dated January 22,\n\n2004, which the district court adopted in its Memorandum and Order\n\ndated February 19, 2004.   Res judicata barred that claim because\n\nDeWitt initially pursued it unsuccessfully in his state court\n\naction; he then dropped the claim altogether, attempting to re-\n\nlitigate it in federal court.    See DiBattista v. State of Rhode\n\nIsland, 808 A.2d 1081, 1086 (R.I. 2002) (explaining that res\n\njudicata is intended to conserve courts' \"finite resources\" by\n\neliminating \"duplicative litigation,\" so that \"a party defeated in\n\none action may not maintain a later lawsuit based upon a ground\n\nthat properly could have been asserted in the previous litigation\")\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f          3.      Regarding    the    grant   of     summary     judgment   in\n\ndefendants' favor on the due process claims, we agree in part with\n\nthe reasoning in the magistrate judge's report and recommendation\n\ndated January 22, 2004, which the district court adopted in its\n\nMemorandum and Order dated February 19, 2004.                   See Sandin v.\n\nConner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995) (indicating that a due process\n\nliberty interest is implicated only where state action \"imposes\n\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the\n\nordinary incidents of prison life\").\n\n          But we direct the district court to amend its judgment to\n\ndismiss without prejudice the due process claims based on the\n\ndisciplinary    proceedings    against     DeWitt.        The    disciplinary\n\ndecisions took away accrued good-time credits, and DeWitt sought\n\nexpungement of those decisions, restoration of the lost credits,\n\nand damages for the allegedly wrongful disciplinary decisions.               He\n\ncould only obtain restoration of his credits in a habeas action,\n\nPortley-El v. Brill, 288 F.3d 1063, 1066 (8th Cir. 2002) (affirming\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1915A dismissal of such claim) (citing Preiser v.\n\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 488-92 (1973)), and he could only seek\n\ndamages under    §   1983   after   overturning    such   decisions.        Id.\n\n(applying Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), to damages claim\n\nbased on disciplinary decision that caused loss of good-time\n\ncredits); see also Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 646 (1997)\n\n(applying Heck's favorable termination rule to § 1983 damages claim\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fchallenging the procedures used to deprive inmate of good-time\n\ncredits).\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.             The\n\ndistrict court is directed to modify its dismissal of the due\n\nprocess   claims   based   on   the    disciplinary    decisions    against\n\nappellant to be without prejudice.
