Mr. Trevor Charlton was indicted on\n\nthe single count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1):\n\n     (g)  It shall be unlawful for any person-\n          (1) who has been convicted in any court of a crime\n     punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\n     . . . to possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or\n     ammunition . . . .\n\nTrial was held, and the district court declared a mistrial after\n\nruling that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked; the court scheduled\n\na retrial.   United States v. Charlton, No. 1:04-cr-10306-PBS (D.\n\nMass. June 12, 2006). Mr. Charlton moved to dismiss the indictment\n\non the ground of violation of the double jeopardy clause of the\n\nFifth Amendment.1   The district court denied the motion, and this\n\nappeal followed.    See Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 662\n\n(1977) (denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is\n\na final decision within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291); United\n\nStates v. Keene, 287 F.3d 229, 232 (1st Cir. 2002) (the defendant\n\nmay take an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order in a\n\ncriminal case when he presents a colorable claim that further\n\nproceedings will constitute double jeopardy, such as when the\n\ndefendant claims that the district court should not have declared\n\nthe jury hopelessly deadlocked).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       U.S. Const. amend.

In\n\nbrief, on the evening of July 25, 2004 the police in Brockton,\n\nMassachusetts were investigating an incident and were given a\n\ndescription of the persons involved, including a man who had taken\n\na taxi to 37 Ellsworth Street.      At Ellsworth Street the police\n\nfound five men including Mr. Charlton.      A white shirt was on a\n\ncement pillar near where Mr. Charlton was standing, and wrapped in\n\nthe shirt was a loaded firearm.    Mr. Charlton told the police that\n\nearlier that evening he had stabbed a man who had assaulted him,\n\nand that he was concerned about possible \"problems.\"\n\n     The sole count of the indictment, and the only question of the\n\ntrial, was whether Mr. Charlton was in \"possession\" of the firearm\n\nin terms of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1).      The proceedings commenced on\n\nMonday, March 13, 2006, the trial consumed about seven hours, and\n\nthe case was submitted to the jury during the morning of Thursday,\n\nMarch 16.   At about noon on Thursday the jury requested the police\n\nreport of Mr. Charlton's statement; the report had been the subject\n\nof testimony but had not been introduced in evidence.   The jury was\n\ntold that it could not be provided.         The jury continued its\n\ndeliberations all day on Thursday.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f       The next morning, Friday, March 17, the jurors submitted three\n\nquestions: (1) whether they could have a written copy of the jury\n\ninstructions; (2) whether they could have a dictionary; and (3)\n\nwhether it is illegal for a person convicted of a crime punishable\n\nby more than one year in prison to possess a firearm.                               The judge\n\nconsulted       with    counsel,      and    then      told    the     jury       (1)   that     a\n\ntranscript of the jury instructions would be prepared and provided,\n\nand meanwhile the jury should continue to deliberate; (2) that a\n\ndictionary would not be provided; and (3) that the answer to the\n\nthird question is \"yes\" provided that the government proves the\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.                           At mid-morning\n\nthe    jury    submitted        another      question        concerning       a    government\n\nexhibit, and the judge responded that the court could not comment\n\non the evidence.         At 11:10 a.m. on Friday the jurors reported that\n\nthey \"have reached an impasse.\"\n\n       The district court proposed giving the jury a charge pursuant\n\nto    Allen    v.     United    States,      164      U.S.    492,   501   (1896).             Mr.\n\nCharlton's counsel asked that the Allen charge not be given, and\n\nthat the jury simply be instructed to continue to deliberate.                                  The\n\ndistrict court followed the procedure requested by Charlton's\n\ncounsel.\n\n       At     4:39    p.m.     on   Friday      the    jury    again    stated          that    it\n\n\"remain[ed]          deadlocked     on    the      same      issue.\"       The      jury       had\n\ndeliberated for a total of thirteen hours.                           Government counsel\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fagain asked that the Allen charge be given, and defense counsel\n\nagain opposed it, arguing that it was too late in the day on a\n\nFriday.   The district court decided to proceed with the Allen\n\ncharge, and read to the jury the Modified Allen Charge of the First\n\nCircuit Pattern Jury Instructions2, as follows:\n\n          I am going to instruct you to go back and resume\n     your deliberations. I will explain why and give you\n     further instructions. In trials, absolute certainty can\n     neither be expected or attained.\n\n          You should consider that you are selected in the\n     same manner and from the same source as any future jury\n     would be selected. There is no reason to suppose that\n     this case would ever be submitted to twelve men and women\n     more intelligent, more impartial, or more competent to\n     decide it than you, or that more or clearer evidence\n     would be produced in the future. Thus, it is your duty\n     to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so\n     without violence to your individual judgment.\n\n          The verdict which a juror agrees must of course be\n     his or her verdict, the result of his or her own\n     convictions, and not a mere acquiescence in the\n     conclusions of his or her fellow jurors. Yet, in order\n     to bring twelve minds to a unanimous result, you must\n     examine the question submitted to you with an open mind\n     and with proper regard for and deference to the opinion\n     of the other jurors.\n\n          In conferring together, you ought to pay proper\n     respect to each other's opinions, and you ought to listen\n     with a mind open to being convinced by each other's\n     arguments.   Thus, where there is disagreement, jurors\n     favoring acquittal should consider whether a doubt in\n     their own mind is a reasonable one when it makes no\n     impression upon the minds of the other equally honest and\n     intelligent jurors, who have heard the same evidence with\n\n\n\n     2\n       These Instructions are advisory rather than mandatory, and\nhave not been officially adopted by the court. See United States\nv. Gomez, 255 F.3d 31, 39 n.7 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                               -5-\n\f     the same degree of attention and with the same desire to\n     arrive at the truth under the sanction of the same oath.\n\n           On the other hand, jurors favoring conviction ought\n     seriously to ask themselves whether they should not\n     distrust the weight or sufficiency of evidence which\n     fails to dispel reasonable doubt in the minds of the\n     other jurors. Not only should jurors in the minority\n     reexamine their position, but jurors in the majority\n     should do so also, to see whether they have given careful\n     consideration and sufficient weight to the evidence that\n     has favorably impressed the people in disagreement with\n     them.\n\n          Burden of proof is a legal tool for helping you to\n     decide.   The law imposes upon the prosecution a high\n     burden of proof.    The prosecution has the burden to\n     establish with respect to each count each essential\n     element of the offense and to establish that essential\n     element beyond a reasonable doubt. And if with respect\n     to any element of any count you are left in reasonable\n     doubt, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of such\n     doubt and must be acquitted.\n\n          It is your duty to decide the case if you can\n     conscientiously do so without violence to your individual\n     judgment.\n\nThe court also told the jury:\n\n     I want you to go back and talk seriously about whether or\n     not you can come back Monday with a fresh mind after a\n     long weekend and try to resume deliberations based on\n     this charge.\n\nThe jury told the court that it would continue deliberations on\n\nMonday.\n\n     On Monday morning the jury sent the court two questions at\n\nabout   10:00   a.m.:   (1)   whether    the   jury   could   consider   the\n\ndefendant's presumed ignorance of the law under which he was being\n\nprosecuted, and (2) whether \"knowing\" could be separated from\n\n\"possession.\"   After consultation with counsel, the court answered\n\n                                   -6-\n\fboth questions in the negative.          At 11:32 a.m. the jurors sent a\n\nnote stating that they are \"deadlocked and cannot reach a unanimous\n\nverdict.\"\n\n     The    government    asked    the   court   to    declare     a    mistrial,\n\nobserving that the jury had declared itself deadlocked three times;\n\ndefense     counsel   asked    that   the    jury     be   told    to    continue\n\ndeliberating until the end of the day on Monday.                   The district\n\ncourt declared a mistrial over defense counsel's objections, and\n\npolled the jurors to confirm the deadlock.             Mr. Charlton's motion\n\nto dismiss the indictment was denied by the court in a written\n\nopinion    explaining    the   court's   conclusion        that   the   jury   was\n\nhopelessly deadlocked.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n     Mr. Charlton points out that \"[t]he right not to be put twice\n\nto the bar is of a very high order,\" United States v. Hotz, 620\n\nF.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 1980), and argues that the district court\n\nabused its discretion by declaring a mistrial when \"manifest\n\nnecessity\" had not been shown.              He points out that the jury\n\ncontinued to ask questions and review the evidence after the first\n\ntwo declarations of deadlock, and argues that in view of Charlton's\n\nobjection the jury should have been permitted and required to\n\ncontinue to deliberate at least until the end of the day on Monday.\n\nHe states that this \"premature\" declaration of a mistrial shows\n\nthat the district court failed to explore adequately and exhaust\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthe alternatives to mistrial, and that the double jeopardy clause\n\nbars retrial when a mistrial was improperly declared.\n\n       Mr. Charlton stresses his right to have his guilt or innocence\n\ndecided by the jury at a single trial; he stresses the right not to\n\nbe subjected to continued trials after a jury has failed to\n\nconvict.      In Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 503 (1978), the\n\nCourt emphasized the defendant's constitutional right to have his\n\ntrial completed by the same trier of fact in the same proceeding,\n\nwhile also recognizing that a deadlocked jury can lead to retrial.\n\nThis court has explained that the Constitution \"restrains the\n\ngovernment     from    using     its     power    and    resources      to    subject   a\n\ndefendant to serial prosecutions, thus prolonging his ordeal and\n\nunfairly     enhancing     the    prospect       of   his    ultimate       conviction.\"\n\nUnited States v. Toribio-Lugo, 376 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187-88 (1957)).\n\n       The   protection        against    multiple      trials   is     not,    however,\n\nabsolute.     It has long been recognized that a deadlocked jury does\n\nnot raise a double jeopardy bar.                 In United States v. Perez, 22\n\nU.S.   (9    Wheat.)     579    (1824),    Justice       Story   observed      that   the\n\nmanifest necessity flowing from a jury's inability to agree on a\n\nverdict      permitted     the    trial    judge        to   retry    the    defendant,\n\nexplaining that \"the ends of public justice would otherwise be\n\ndefeated.\"     Id. at 580.        See also Richardson v. United States, 468\n\nU.S. 317, 324 (the retrial of a case, after declaration of a\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fmistrial based on a \"hung jury,\" does not generally present a\n\ndouble jeopardy issue); Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 509\n\n(1978) (\"[T]he trial judge may discharge a genuinely deadlocked\n\njury and require the defendant to submit to a second trial.\");\n\nUnited States v. Barboni, 62 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"It is well\n\nsettled that an appeal from a denial of a motion to dismiss\n\nfollowing a 'hung jury' does not normally present a valid Double\n\nJeopardy claim.\").\n\n       Although the district court has discretion in deciding whether\n\nto declare a mistrial, this discretion is constrained by the\n\nconstitutional       safeguards,     such      that          its   exercise        \"entails\n\nheightened rigor and is reviewed accordingly.\"                       Keene, 287 F.3d at\n\n233; see United States v. Ramirez, 884 F.2d 1524, 1529 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (requiring a \"high degree\" of necessity to be present before\n\nconcluding that a mistrial is appropriate). As the Court stated in\n\nPerez, 22 U.S. at 580, the power to declare a mistrial \"ought to be\n\nused with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for\n\nvery   plain   and     obvious    cause.\"         On    appeal,       the    exercise     of\n\ndiscretion is reviewed to ascertain whether the declaration of\n\ndeadlock   and   ensuing       mistrial     met    the        criteria      of    \"manifest\n\nnecessity,\"    United     States    v.    Jorn,        400    U.S.    470,       485   (1971)\n\n(plurality     op.),    with     recognition       of        the   deference       owed    to\n\ndiscretionary rulings of the trial judge who was present throughout\n\nthe proceedings that led to the deadlock.\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f     This court explained in United States v. Brown, 426 F.3d 32,\n\n36 (1st Cir. 2005), that the declaration of a mistrial is case-\n\nspecific    and   cannot   be   reduced     to   a   \"mechanical   checklist.\"\n\nHowever, several interrelated factors form the foundation of the\n\nappellate    inquiry,   including:    \"(i)       whether    alternatives    to   a\n\nmistrial were explored and exhausted; (ii) whether counsel had an\n\nopportunity to be heard; and (iii) whether the judge's decision was\n\nmade after sufficient reflection.\"           Toribio-Lugo, 376 F.3d at 39.\n\nThese factors \"serve only as a starting point.                Each case is sui\n\ngeneris and must be assessed on its idiosyncratic facts.\"                  United\n\nStates v. McIntosh, 380 F.3d 548, 554 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n     As to the first of these factors, Mr. Charlton argues that the\n\njudge should have asked the jury to deliberate for the entire day\n\non Monday.   He points to the several attempts by the jury to obtain\n\ninformation, and suggests that there are complexities of fact and\n\ncredibility that distinguish this case from others in which a\n\nmistrial was sustained.         He argues that the judge erroneously\n\nconsidered the case to be \"a simple one,\" and that the judge did\n\nnot give the jury enough time to deliberate.               He argues that based\n\non the questions asked by the jurors, they were close to a verdict\n\nhad the judge been more patient.\n\n     The prosecution bears the burden of justifying the declaration\n\nof a mistrial.     Keene, 287 F.3d at 234.           The government stresses\n\nthat the judge urged the jury several times to attempt to reach a\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fverdict,    and   did   not   declare      a   mistrial    until   the    jury   had\n\nannounced itself deadlocked for the third time.                    The government\n\npoints out that the jury had deliberated for more than twice the\n\ntime it took to conduct the trial itself, and that the sole issue\n\nwas whether Mr. Charlton knowingly \"possessed\" the firearm.                      The\n\ngovernment states that the nature and timing of the questions asked\n\nby the jury suggest that the jury had been in deadlock for a\n\nsignificant period, and that it was apparent that change was\n\nextremely    unlikely.        We   conclude      that     the   judge    adequately\n\nconsidered    the   alternative       of       requiring    that    deliberations\n\ncontinue, and that the conclusion that the deadlock was hopeless\n\nand that further deliberations would be fruitless was a \"scrupulous\n\nexercise of juridical discretion.\" United States v. Simonetti, 998\n\nF.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     As to the second factor, it is undisputed that the judge\n\nprovided defense counsel with the opportunity to be heard, and\n\naccepted counsel's objection to giving an Allen charge when the\n\njury declared itself deadlocked after the Thursday deliberations.\n\nWhen the jury again declared itself deadlocked after the Friday\n\ndeliberations, the judge decided to give the Allen charge, and the\n\njury stated that it would continue deliberating the following\n\nMonday. Mr. Charlton argues that the giving of the Allen charge at\n\nthe end of the day on a Friday was prejudicial.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f      The district court in its opinion recognized the \"inherently\n\ncoercive nature of the Allen charge,\" and remarked that the jury's\n\ndecision to return on Monday for further deliberations \"blunts any\n\npossible prejudice.\"     Slip op. at 10, 11.      Courts have recognized\n\nthe possibility of pressing a jury into compromise.           See United\n\nStates v. Julien, 318 F.3d 316, 320 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"A jury forced\n\nto   continue   to   deliberate   after   it   reported   deadlock   would\n\ncompromise too easily, simply to be able to go home.\"); Barboni, 62\n\nF.3d at 7 n.1 (\"By disregarding the jurors on this point [deadlock]\n\nand demanding further deliberation, the court might have risked\n\npressuring the jurors into abandoning good faith opinions merely\n\nfor the sake of reaching unanimity.\").         We discern no prejudice to\n\nMr. Charlton; indeed, it is more likely that the Allen exhortation\n\nencouraged the jury to continue its deliberations to the following\n\nMonday.\n\n      As to the third factor, there is no support for Mr. Charlton's\n\ncharge that the district court declared the mistrial precipitously\n\nor without sufficient reflection.         In McIntosh, 380 F.3d at 555,\n\nthis court sustained the district court's exercise of discretion in\n\nnot requiring the jury to continue to deliberate after the jurors\n\nhad sent three notes reporting that they were deadlocked and the\n\njudge had delivered a modified Allen charge.              Mr. Charlton's\n\nsituation is also analogous to that in Barboni, 62 F.3d at 7, where\n\nthe jury deliberated for almost ten hours after a four-day trial,\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fsent two notes declaring deadlock, and the district court concluded\n\nthat further deliberations would be futile. We discern no abuse of\n\nthe rigorous discretionary standard by not requiring the Charlton\n\njury to deliberate until the end of the day on Monday, in the\n\ncircumstances of this jury's continuing deadlock.              \"A hung jury is\n\nthe paradigmatic example of manifest necessity.\"                McIntosh, 380\n\nF.3d at 553; see also Julien, 318 F.3d at 319 (\"A hung jury is the\n\nclassic instance where a mistrial may be warranted, and that has\n\nbeen so in our jurisprudence for at least 175 years.\").                       The\n\ndistrict court's declaration of a mistrial is sustained.\n\n     In    Richardson,      468    U.S.   at   324-26,   the   Court   drew    a\n\ndistinction between circumstances in which the jury's failure to\n\nconvict,    for   example    for   insufficiency    of   evidence,     warrants\n\nrelease of the defendant, and the circumstances in which a trial\n\nthat does not result in a verdict does not end the original\n\njeopardy.    Based on this ground of declaration of a mistrial, the\n\ndecision to order a new trial does not constitute double jeopardy.\n\nNo circumstance has been cited as would support departure from this\n\nwell-established sequel to a hung jury.

Charlton,</i> No. 1:04-cr-10306-PBS (D. Mass. June 12, 2006). Mr. Charlton moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground of violation of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment.<sup>[1]</sup> The district court denied the motion, and this appeal followed. <i>See </i><i>Abney v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977) (denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is a final decision within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291); <i>United States v.

In brief, on the evening of July 25, 2004 the police in Brockton, Massachusetts were investigating an incident and were given a description of the persons involved, including a man who had taken a taxi to 37 Ellsworth Street. At Ellsworth Street the police found five men including Mr. Charlton. A white shirt was on a cement pillar near where Mr. Charlton was standing, and wrapped in the shirt was a loaded firearm. Mr. Charlton told the police that earlier that evening he had stabbed a man who had assaulted him, and that he was concerned about possible \"problems.\"</p>\n<p>The sole count of the indictment, and the only question of the trial, was whether Mr. Charlton was in \"possession\" of the firearm in terms of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1). The proceedings commenced on Monday, March 13, 2006, the trial consumed about seven hours, and the case was submitted to the jury during the morning of Thursday, March 16. At about noon on Thursday the jury requested the police report of Mr. Charlton's statement; the report had been the subject of testimony but had not been introduced in evidence. The jury was told that it could not be provided. The jury continued its deliberations all day on Thursday.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Friday, March 17, the jurors submitted three questions: (1) whether they could have a written copy of the jury instructions; (2) whether they could have a dictionary; and (3) whether it is illegal for a person convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison to possess a firearm. The judge consulted with counsel, and then told the jury (1) that a transcript of the jury instructions would be prepared and provided, and meanwhile the jury should continue to deliberate; (2) that a dictionary would not be provided; and (3) that the answer to the third question is \"yes\" provided that the government proves the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. At mid-morning the jury submitted another question concerning a government exhibit, and the judge responded that the court could not comment on the evidence. At 11:10 a.m. on Friday the jurors reported that they \"have reached an impasse.\"</p>\n<p>The district court proposed giving the jury a charge pursuant to <i>Allen v. United States,</i> 164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> L.Ed. 528 (1896). Mr. Charlton's counsel asked that the <i>Allen</i> charge not be given, and that the jury simply be instructed to continue to deliberate. The district court followed the procedure requested by Charlton's counsel.</p>\n<p>At 4:39 p.m. on Friday the jury again stated that it \"remain[ed] deadlocked on the same issue.\" The jury had deliberated for a total of thirteen hours. Government counsel again asked that the <i>Allen</i> charge be given, and defense counsel again opposed it, arguing that it was too late in the day on a Friday. The district court decided to proceed with the <i>Allen</i> charge, and read to the jury the Modified Allen Charge of the First Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions<sup>[2]</sup>, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>I am going to instruct you to go back and resume your deliberations. I will explain why and give you further instructions. In trials, absolute certainty can neither be expected or attained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You should consider that you are selected in the same manner and from the same source as any future jury would be selected. There is no reason to suppose that this case would ever be submitted to twelve men and women more intelligent, more impartial, or more competent to decide it than you, or that more or clearer evidence would be produced in the future. Thus, it is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so without violence to your individual judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The verdict which a juror agrees must of course be his or her verdict, the result of his or her own convictions, and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusions of his or her fellow jurors. Yet, in order to bring twelve minds to a unanimous result, you must examine the question submitted to you with an open mind and with proper regard for and deference to the opinion of the other jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In conferring together, you ought to pay proper respect to each other's opinions, and you ought to listen with a mind open to being convinced by each other's arguments. Thus, where there is disagreement, jurors favoring acquittal should consider whether a doubt in their own mind is a reasonable one when it makes no impression upon the minds of the other equally honest and intelligent jurors, who have heard the same evidence with the same degree of attention and with the same desire to arrive at the truth under the sanction of the same oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>On the other hand, jurors favoring conviction ought seriously to ask themselves whether they should not distrust the weight or sufficiency of evidence which fails to dispel reasonable doubt in the minds of the other jurors. Not only should jurors in the minority reexamine their position, but jurors in the majority should do so also, to see whether they have given careful consideration and sufficient weight to the evidence that has favorably impressed the people in disagreement with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Burden of proof is a legal tool for helping you to decide. The law imposes upon the prosecution a high burden of proof. The prosecution has the burden to establish with respect to each count each essential element of the offense and to establish that essential element beyond a reasonable doubt. And if with respect to any element of any count you are left in reasonable doubt, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of such doubt and must be acquitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> It is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so without violence to your individual judgment.</blockquote>\n<p>The court also told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote>I want you to go back and talk seriously about whether or not you can come back Monday with a fresh mind after a long weekend and try to resume deliberations based on this charge.</blockquote>\n<p>The jury told the court that it would continue deliberations on Monday.</p>\n<p>On Monday morning the jury sent the court two questions at about 10:00 a.m.: (1) whether the jury could consider the defendant's presumed ignorance of the law under which he was being prosecuted, and (2) whether \"knowing\" could be separated from \"possession.\" After consultation with counsel, the court answered both questions in the negative. At 11:32 a.m. the jurors sent a note stating that they are \"deadlocked and cannot reach a unanimous verdict.\"</p>\n<p>The government asked the court to declare a mistrial, observing that the jury had declared itself deadlocked three times; defense counsel asked that the jury be told to continue deliberating until the end of the day on Monday. The district court declared a mistrial over defense counsel's objections, and polled the jurors to confirm the deadlock. Mr. Charlton's motion to dismiss the indictment was denied by the court in a written opinion explaining the court's conclusion that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Mr. Charlton points out that \"[t]he right not to be put twice to the bar is of a very high order,\" <i>United States v. Hotz,</i> 620 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir.1980), and argues that the district court abused its discretion by declaring a mistrial when \"manifest necessity\" had not been shown. He points out that the jury continued to ask questions and review the evidence after the first two declarations of deadlock, and argues that in view of Charlton's objection the jury should have been permitted and required to continue to deliberate at least until the end of the day on Monday. He states that this \"premature\" declaration of a mistrial shows that the district court failed to explore adequately and exhaust the alternatives to mistrial, and that the double jeopardy clause bars retrial when a mistrial was improperly declared.</p>\n<p>Mr. Charlton stresses his right to have his guilt or innocence decided by the jury at a single trial; he stresses the right not to be subjected to continued trials after a jury has failed to convict. In <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. 497, 503, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), the Court emphasized the defendant's constitutional right to have his trial completed by the same trier of fact in the same proceeding, while also recognizing that a deadlocked jury can lead to retrial. This court has explained that the Constitution \"restrains the government from using its power and resources to subject a defendant to serial prosecutions, thus prolonging his ordeal and unfairly enhancing the prospect of his ultimate conviction.\" <i>United States v. Toribio-Lugo,</i> 376 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Green v. United States,</i> 355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957)).</p>\n<p>The protection against multiple trials is not, however, absolute. It has long been recognized that a deadlocked jury does not raise a double jeopardy bar. In <i>United States v. Perez,</i> 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824), Justice Story observed that the manifest necessity flowing from a jury's inability to agree on a verdict permitted the trial judge to retry the defendant, explaining that \"the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\" <i>Id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> at 580. <i>See also </i><i>Richardson v. United States,</i> 468 U.S. 317, 324, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (the retrial of a case, after declaration of a mistrial based on a \"hung jury,\" does not generally present a double jeopardy issue); <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. 497, 509, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978) (\"[T]he trial judge may discharge a genuinely deadlocked jury and require the defendant to submit to a second trial.\"); <i>United States v. Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1995) (\"It is well settled that an appeal from a denial of a motion to dismiss following a `hung jury' does not normally present a valid Double Jeopardy claim.\").</p>\n<p>Although the district court has discretion in deciding whether to declare a mistrial, this discretion is constrained by the constitutional safeguards, such that its exercise \"entails heightened rigor and is reviewed accordingly.\" <i>Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 233; <i>see </i><i>United States v. Ramirez,</i> 884 F.2d 1524, 1529 (1st Cir.1989) (requiring a \"high degree\" of necessity to be present before concluding that a mistrial is appropriate). As the Court stated in <i>Perez,</i> 22 U.S. at 580, the power to declare a mistrial \"ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious cause.\" On appeal, the exercise of discretion is reviewed to ascertain whether the declaration of deadlock and ensuing mistrial met the criteria of \"manifest necessity,\" <i>United States v. Jorn,</i> 400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) (plurality op.), with recognition of the deference owed to discretionary rulings of the trial judge who was present throughout the proceedings that led to the deadlock.</p>\n<p>This court explained in <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 426 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir.2005), that the declaration of a mistrial is case-specific and cannot be reduced to a \"mechanical checklist.\" However, several interrelated factors form the foundation of the appellate inquiry, including: \"(i) whether alternatives to a mistrial were explored and exhausted; (ii) whether counsel had an opportunity to be heard; and (iii) whether the judge's decision was made after sufficient reflection.\" <i>Toribio-Lugo,</i> 376 F.3d at 39. These factors \"serve only as a starting point. Each case is sui generis and must be assessed on its idiosyncratic facts.\" <i>United States v. McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d 548, 554 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>As to the first of these factors, Mr. Charlton argues that the judge should have asked the jury to deliberate for the entire day on Monday. He points to the several attempts by the jury to obtain information, and suggests that there are complexities of fact and credibility that distinguish this case from others in which a mistrial was sustained. He argues that the judge erroneously considered the case to be \"a simple one,\" and that the judge did not give the jury enough time to deliberate. He argues that based on the questions asked by the jurors, they were close to a verdict had the judge been more patient.</p>\n<p>The prosecution bears the burden of justifying the declaration of a mistrial. <i>Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 234. The government stresses that the judge urged the jury several times to attempt to reach a verdict, and did not declare a mistrial until the jury had announced itself deadlocked for the third time. The government points out that the jury had deliberated for more than twice the time it took to conduct the trial itself, and that the sole issue was whether Mr. Charlton knowingly \"possessed\" the firearm. The government states that the nature and timing of the questions asked by the jury suggest that the jury had been in deadlock for a significant period, and that it was apparent that change was extremely unlikely. We conclude that the judge adequately considered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> the alternative of requiring that deliberations continue, and that the conclusion that the deadlock was hopeless and that further deliberations would be fruitless was a \"scrupulous exercise of juridical discretion.\" <i>United States v. Simonetti,</i> 998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>As to the second factor, it is undisputed that the judge provided defense counsel with the opportunity to be heard, and accepted counsel's objection to giving an <i>Allen</i> charge when the jury declared itself deadlocked after the Thursday deliberations. When the jury again declared itself deadlocked after the Friday deliberations, the judge decided to give the <i>Allen</i> charge, and the jury stated that it would continue deliberating the following Monday. Mr. Charlton argues that the giving of the <i>Allen</i> charge at the end of the day on a Friday was prejudicial.</p>\n<p>The district court in its opinion recognized the \"inherently coercive nature of the <i>Allen</i> charge,\" and remarked that the jury's decision to return on Monday for further deliberations \"blunts any possible prejudice.\" Slip op. at 10, 11. Courts have recognized the possibility of pressing a jury into compromise. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Julien,</i> 318 F.3d 316, 320 (1st Cir.2003) (\"A jury forced to continue to deliberate after it reported deadlock would compromise too easily, simply to be able to go home.\"); <i>Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7 n. 1 (\"By disregarding the jurors on this point [deadlock] and demanding further deliberation, the court might have risked pressuring the jurors into abandoning good faith opinions merely for the sake of reaching unanimity.\"). We discern no prejudice to Mr. Charlton; indeed, it is more likely that the <i>Allen</i> exhortation encouraged the jury to continue its deliberations to the following Monday.</p>\n<p>As to the third factor, there is no support for Mr. Charlton's charge that the district court declared the mistrial precipitously or without sufficient reflection. In <i>McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 555, this court sustained the district court's exercise of discretion in not requiring the jury to continue to deliberate after the jurors had sent three notes reporting that they were deadlocked and the judge had delivered a modified <i>Allen</i> charge. Mr. Charlton's situation is also analogous to that in <i>Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7, where the jury deliberated for almost ten hours after a four-day trial, sent two notes declaring deadlock, and the district court concluded that further deliberations would be futile. We discern no abuse of the rigorous discretionary standard by not requiring the Charlton jury to deliberate until the end of the day on Monday, in the circumstances of this jury's continuing deadlock. \"A hung jury is the paradigmatic example of manifest necessity.\" <i>McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 553; <i>see also </i><i>Julien,</i> 318 F.3d at 319 (\"A hung jury is the classic instance where a mistrial may be warranted, and that has been so in our jurisprudence for at least 175 years.\"). The district court's declaration of a mistrial is sustained.</p>\n<p>In <i>Richardson,</i> 468 U.S. at 324-26, 104 S.Ct. 3081, the Court drew a distinction between circumstances in which the jury's failure to convict, for example for insufficiency of evidence, warrants release of the defendant, and the circumstances in which a trial that does not result in a verdict does not end the original jeopardy. Based on this ground of declaration of a mistrial, the decision to order a new trial does not constitute double jeopardy. No circumstance has been cited as would support departure from this well-established sequel to a hung jury. The district court's order of a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  U.S. Const. amend.

Thus, where there is disagreement, jurors favoring acquittal should consider whether a doubt in their own mind is a reasonable one when it makes no impression upon the minds of the other equally honest and intelligent jurors, who have heard the same evidence with the same degree of attention and with the same desire to arrive at the truth under the sanction of the same oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>On the other hand, jurors favoring conviction ought seriously to ask themselves whether they should not distrust the weight or sufficiency of evidence which fails to dispel reasonable doubt in the minds of the other jurors. Not only should jurors in the minority reexamine their position, but jurors in the majority should do so also, to see whether they have given careful consideration and sufficient weight to the evidence that has favorably impressed the people in disagreement with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Burden of proof is a legal tool for helping you to decide. The law imposes upon the prosecution a high burden of proof. The prosecution has the burden to establish with respect to each count each essential element of the offense and to establish that essential element beyond a reasonable doubt. And if with respect to any element of any count you are left in reasonable doubt, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of such doubt and must be acquitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> It is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so without violence to your individual judgment.</blockquote>\n<p>The court also told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote>I want you to go back and talk seriously about whether or not you can come back Monday with a fresh mind after a long weekend and try to resume deliberations based on this charge.</blockquote>\n<p>The jury told the court that it would continue deliberations on Monday.</p>\n<p>On Monday morning the jury sent the court two questions at about 10:00 a.m.: (1) whether the jury could consider the defendant's presumed ignorance of the law under which he was being prosecuted, and (2) whether \"knowing\" could be separated from \"possession.\" After consultation with counsel, the court answered both questions in the negative. At 11:32 a.m. the jurors sent a note stating that they are \"deadlocked and cannot reach a unanimous verdict.\"</p>\n<p>The government asked the court to declare a mistrial, observing that the jury had declared itself deadlocked three times; defense counsel asked that the jury be told to continue deliberating until the end of the day on Monday. The district court declared a mistrial over defense counsel's objections, and polled the jurors to confirm the deadlock. Mr. Charlton's motion to dismiss the indictment was denied by the court in a written opinion explaining the court's conclusion that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Mr. Charlton points out that \"[t]he right not to be put twice to the bar is of a very high order,\" <i>United States v. Hotz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377154\"><a href=\"/opinion/377154/united-states-v-helenmary-hotz/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1980), and argues that the district court abused its discretion by declaring a mistrial when \"manifest necessity\" had not been shown. He points out that the jury continued to ask questions and review the evidence after the first two declarations of deadlock, and argues that in view of Charlton's objection the jury should have been permitted and required to continue to deliberate at least until the end of the day on Monday. He states that this \"premature\" declaration of a mistrial shows that the district court failed to explore adequately and exhaust the alternatives to mistrial, and that the double jeopardy clause bars retrial when a mistrial was improperly declared.</p>\n<p>Mr. Charlton stresses his right to have his guilt or innocence decided by the jury at a single trial; he stresses the right not to be subjected to continued trials after a jury has failed to convict. In <i>Arizona v.

This court has explained that the Constitution \"restrains the government from using its power and resources to subject a defendant to serial prosecutions, thus prolonging his ordeal and unfairly enhancing the prospect of his ultimate conviction.\" <i>United States v.

Jorn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108233\"><a href=\"/opinion/108233/united-states-v-jorn/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 485, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108233\"><a href=\"/opinion/108233/united-states-v-jorn/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span> (1971) (plurality op.), with recognition of the deference owed to discretionary rulings of the trial judge who was present throughout the proceedings that led to the deadlock.</p>\n<p>This court explained in <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201855\"><a href=\"/opinion/201855/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2005), that the declaration of a mistrial is case-specific and cannot be reduced to a \"mechanical checklist.\" However, several interrelated factors form the foundation of the appellate inquiry, including: \"(i) whether alternatives to a mistrial were explored and exhausted; (ii) whether counsel had an opportunity to be heard; and (iii) whether the judge's decision was made after sufficient reflection.\" <i>Toribio-Lugo,</i> 376 F.3d at 39. These factors \"serve only as a starting point. Each case is sui generis and must be assessed on its idiosyncratic facts.\" <i>United States v. McIntosh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201215\"><a href=\"/opinion/201215/united-states-v-mcintosh/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 554 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>As to the first of these factors, Mr. Charlton argues that the judge should have asked the jury to deliberate for the entire day on Monday. He points to the several attempts by the jury to obtain information, and suggests that there are complexities of fact and credibility that distinguish this case from others in which a mistrial was sustained. He argues that the judge erroneously considered the case to be \"a simple one,\" and that the judge did not give the jury enough time to deliberate. He argues that based on the questions asked by the jurors, they were close to a verdict had the judge been more patient.</p>\n<p>The prosecution bears the burden of justifying the declaration of a mistrial. <i>Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 234. The government stresses that the judge urged the jury several times to attempt to reach a verdict, and did not declare a mistrial until the jury had announced itself deadlocked for the third time. The government points out that the jury had deliberated for more than twice the time it took to conduct the trial itself, and that the sole issue was whether Mr. Charlton knowingly \"possessed\" the firearm. The government states that the nature and timing of the questions asked by the jury suggest that the jury had been in deadlock for a significant period, and that it was apparent that change was extremely unlikely. We conclude that the judge adequately considered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> the alternative of requiring that deliberations continue, and that the conclusion that the deadlock was hopeless and that further deliberations would be fruitless was a \"scrupulous exercise of juridical discretion.\" <i>United States v. Simonetti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610899\"><a href=\"/opinion/610899/united-states-v-domenic-simonetti/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>As to the second factor, it is undisputed that the judge provided defense counsel with the opportunity to be heard, and accepted counsel's objection to giving an <i>Allen</i> charge when the jury declared itself deadlocked after the Thursday deliberations. When the jury again declared itself deadlocked after the Friday deliberations, the judge decided to give the <i>Allen</i> charge, and the jury stated that it would continue deliberating the following Monday. Mr. Charlton argues that the giving of the <i>Allen</i> charge at the end of the day on a Friday was prejudicial.</p>\n<p>The district court in its opinion recognized the \"inherently coercive nature of the <i>Allen</i> charge,\" and remarked that the jury's decision to return on Monday for further deliberations \"blunts any possible prejudice.\" Slip op. at 10, 11. Courts have recognized the possibility of pressing a jury into compromise. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Julien,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200319\"><a href=\"/opinion/200319/united-states-v-julien/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 320 (1st Cir.2003) (\"A jury forced to continue to deliberate after it reported deadlock would compromise too easily, simply to be able to go home.\"); <i>Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7 n. 1 (\"By disregarding the jurors on this point [deadlock] and demanding further deliberation, the court might have risked pressuring the jurors into abandoning good faith opinions merely for the sake of reaching unanimity.\"). We discern no prejudice to Mr. Charlton; indeed, it is more likely that the <i>Allen</i> exhortation encouraged the jury to continue its deliberations to the following Monday.</p>\n<p>As to the third factor, there is no support for Mr. Charlton's charge that the district court declared the mistrial precipitously or without sufficient reflection. In <i>McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 555, this court sustained the district court's exercise of discretion in not requiring the jury to continue to deliberate after the jurors had sent three notes reporting that they were deadlocked and the judge had delivered a modified <i>Allen</i> charge. Mr. Charlton's situation is also analogous to that in <i>Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7, where the jury deliberated for almost ten hours after a four-day trial, sent two notes declaring deadlock, and the district court concluded that further deliberations would be futile. We discern no abuse of the rigorous discretionary standard by not requiring the Charlton jury to deliberate until the end of the day on Monday, in the circumstances of this jury's continuing deadlock. \"A hung jury is the paradigmatic example of manifest necessity.\" <i>McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 553; <i>see also </i><i>Julien,</i> 318 F.3d at 319 (\"A hung jury is the classic instance where a mistrial may be warranted, and that has been so in our jurisprudence for at least 175 years.\"). The district court's declaration of a mistrial is sustained.</p>\n<p>In <i>Richardson,</i> 468 U.S. at 324-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111246\"><a href=\"/opinion/111246/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3081</span></a></span>, the Court drew a distinction between circumstances in which the jury's failure to convict, for example for insufficiency of evidence, warrants release of the defendant, and the circumstances in which a trial that does not result in a verdict does not end the original jeopardy. Based on this ground of declaration of a mistrial, the decision to order a new trial does not constitute double jeopardy. No circumstance has been cited as would support departure from this well-established sequel to a hung jury. The district court's order of a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  U.S. Const. amend.
