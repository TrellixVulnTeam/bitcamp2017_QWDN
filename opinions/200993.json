Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     S. Robert Lyons, Attorney, Tax Division, U.S. Department of\nJustice, with whom Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney General,\nRobert E.

At sentencing, the district court declined to\n\ndetermine the exact amount of the tax loss, and the offense level\n\nthat would result from such a determination, ruling that such a\n\nfinding would not affect the sentence.            The court then departed\n\ndownward     from   the    Sentencing    Guidelines   based   on    Roselli's\n\nextraordinary family circumstances.            The Government now appeals\n\nboth the failure to specify an amount of tax loss and the decision\n\nto depart.    Although we agree that the failure to specify an amount\n\nof tax loss and the related offense level was an error, we find\n\nthat error harmless, and we affirm.1\n\n                                        I.\n\n             In 1989, Antonio Roselli began working as a partner in an\n\naccounting firm where he provided tax services.          In 1997 and 1998,\n\nRoselli prepared tax returns on behalf of his clients that included\n\nfalse     deductions      for   charitable    contributions   and    business\n\nexpenses. He charged his clients approximately $250 for each false\n\nreturn.    Roselli also amended tax returns from prior years, adding\n\n\n     1\n      Prior to oral argument, the district court granted appellee's\nmotion to supplement the appellate record with the probation\nofficer's confidential sentencing recommendation. In granting the\nmotion, the district court explained that it does not normally\nconsult such confidential recommendations when making sentencing\ndecisions, and did not consult the recommendation in this case.\nOne member of this panel has reviewed the probation officer's\nsentencing recommendation. However, that recommendation has not\nbeen discussed among the panel members, and it has not been\nconsidered in the decision of the panel.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\ffalse deductions in an effort to procure retroactive refunds.    For\n\neach amended return he charged approximately one third of the\n\nexpected refund.     The Government contends that, all told, Roselli\n\nprepared more than 140 false tax returns, accounting for $101,524\n\nin tax loss to the United States Treasury.\n\n              On August 29, 2002, Roselli pleaded guilty to one count\n\nof conspiracy to aid, assist, and abet in the filing of materially\n\nfalse tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(2).    In the plea\n\nagreement, the Government stated its belief that the tax loss was\n\n$101,524, indicating a base offense level of 14 pursuant to section\n\n2T1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines.2      The Government argued that\n\nthe appropriate total offense level, after several adjustments, was\n\n13.3       The Government agreed to recommend a sentence of twelve\n\n\n       2\n      All references to the Sentencing Guidelines are to the 1998\nedition, which was in place at the time Roselli committed his most\nrecent offense. Normally, we apply the edition in effect at the\ntime of sentencing.    See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d\n1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990)(\"Barring any ex post facto problem,\na defendant is to be punished according to the guidelines in effect\nat the time of sentencing.\"). However, § 2T4.1 provides for lower\noffense levels in the 1998 guidelines than it does in the current\nedition. \"Because imposition of the amended guidelines would have\nresulted in a higher BOL, and thus raised ex post facto concerns,\"\nwe apply the 1998 Sentencing Guidelines. Harotunian, 920 F.2d at\n1042.\n       3\n      The Government reached this calculation as follows: (1) an\noffense level of 14 for a tax loss greater than $70,000 but less\nthan $120,000 pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2T4.1; (2) a two level\nincrease, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2T1.4(b)(1)(B), because Roselli\nwas in the business of preparing tax returns; (3) a three level\ndecrease for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. §\n3E1.1 (Section 3(e) of the plea agreement stipulated that the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fmonths incarceration, a $20,000 fine, a $100 special assessment,\n\nand three years of supervised release.        Roselli asserted that the\n\ntax loss was not readily ascertainable and, in any event, was far\n\nless than $101,524.    Although he asserted that the proper total\n\noffense level was 10, he nevertheless agreed to recommend the same\n\nsentence as   the   prosecution,   except     that   he   would    seek   home\n\ndetention for the twelve month period rather than incarceration.4\n\n          At the sentencing hearings, Roselli asserted that the tax\n\nloss was between $8,000 and $10,000.        He offered several examples,\n\nthough not an exhaustive list, of tax returns that he alleged\n\nshould not have been included in the government's loss calculation.\n\nThese examples amounted to an alleged overstatement of $52,525,\n\nbringing the tax loss down to no more than $48,999.             Nevertheless,\n\nRoselli   reiterated   that   he    would     accept      the    Government's\n\n\nGovernment would recommend a three level decrease if the court\nfinds the adjusted offense level to be 16 or greater, and would\nrecommend a two level decrease otherwise).     This total offense\nlevel of 13, with a criminal history category of I--which is\nundisputed in this case--corresponds to a guideline range of 12-16\nmonths in Zone D.\n     4\n      Roselli reached his calculation as follows: (1) an offense\nlevel of 10 for a tax loss greater than $8,000 but less than\n$13,500, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2T4.1; (2) a two level increase,\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2T1.4(b)(1)(B), because Roselli was in the\nbusiness of preparing tax returns; (3) a two level decrease for\nacceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. The\nresulting total offense level of 10, with a criminal history\ncategory of I, corresponds to a guideline range of 6-12 months in\nZone B.    Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(c)(3), the court could\nsatisfy the 6-12 month range with a sentence of probation with a\ncondition of home detention.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\frecommendation of a total offense level of 13 so long as the court\n\ndid not make a finding that the tax loss was $10,000 or more.      The\n\nGovernment argued that the court must make a specific finding as to\n\nthe tax loss and calculate the offense level based on that finding.\n\n          During   the   sentencing     hearing,   Roselli's   counsel\n\nexplained that a tax loss finding could have harmful collateral\n\nconsequences in a subsequent deportation proceeding.           Although\n\nRoselli has lived in the United States for approximately 34 years,\n\nhe is a citizen of the United Kingdom and may be subject to\n\ndeportation if he is convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\" 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).    The violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(2)is not\n\nspecifically listed as an aggravated felony, but the definition of\n\n\"aggravated felony\" includes any offense that \"involves fraud or\n\ndeceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).5        If the court made an explicit\n\nfinding that the tax loss was greater than $10,000, such a finding\n\nmight be preclusive in any subsequent deportation proceeding. See,\n\ne.g., Hammer v. INS, 195 F.3d 836, 840-41 (6th Cir. 1999) (findings\n\nmade during a denaturalization proceeding have preclusive effect in\n\na subsequent deportation proceeding).        Roselli would then be\n\n\n     5\n      An alien may also be deported for an offense \"described in\nsection 7201 of Title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the\nrevenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.\"      8 U.S.C. §\n1101(a)(43)(M)(ii).   However, because Roselli pleaded guilty to\nviolation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(2) (assisting in filing a false\nreturn), this provision apparently would not apply.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsubject to deportation if the court found that a violation of 26\n\nU.S.C.   §   7206(2)   fit   the   parameters    outlined    in   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1101(a)(43)(M)(i).\n\n             After receiving supplemental briefs on the issue of the\n\ntax loss finding, the court declined to determine whether the tax\n\nloss was $101,524 as suggested by the Government, between $8,000\n\nand $10,000 as suggested by Roselli, or somewhere between those two\n\nfigures.      The   court    reasoned   that    if   it   accepted    Roselli's\n\nassertion that the tax loss was between $8,000 and $10,000, the\n\nresulting total offense level would be 10, corresponding to a\n\nguideline range of 6 to 12 months and a fine of between $2,000 and\n\n$20,000.     If the court accepted the Government's contention that\n\nthe tax loss was $101,524, the total offense level would be 13,\n\ncorresponding to a guideline range of 12 to 18 months and a fine of\n\n$3,000 to $30,000.     Thus, there was a point of overlap in guideline\n\nranges that corresponded precisely with the Government's sentencing\n\nrecommendation: 12 months of incarceration and a fine of $3,000 to\n\n$20,000.6     The court then stated its conclusion on the tax loss\n\nfinding issue:\n\n             I'm confronted with, I think, a realistic\n             prospect that the tax loss could be disputed.\n             And the process of resolving that dispute\n\n\n     6\n      Imposition of supervised release and a special assessment are\nnot tied to the sentencing range, and therefore the existence of an\noverlap does not affect these aspects of the sentence.          See\nU.S.S.G. § 5D1.1; U.S.S.G. § 5E1.3.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          would be not quite the equivalent of the trial\n          itself, but would be a quite demanding claim\n          upon the Court's resources.     Here, I would\n          have to, I think, hear from [a witness]. I'd\n          have to examine a variety of different tax\n          returns to determine the tax loss. And there\n          seems to me to be no particular benefit to\n          doing that when we're dealing with overlapping\n          Guidelines. And, of course, it's particularly\n          the case that the Government in its plea\n          agreement has committed itself to making a\n          recommendation at that point of overlap under\n          the Guidelines.\n\nHaving   determined     that    the   appropriate   Guidelines   sentence\n\ncorresponded to a point of overlap in the two guideline sentencing\n\nranges suggested by the parties, the court ruled that a finding as\n\nto the exact amount of the tax loss would \"not affect sentencing\"\n\nand was therefore unnecessary.        Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B).7   The\n\ncourt made only the general finding that the tax loss was \"not less\n\nthan $8,000.\"\n\n          The   court    then    considered   Roselli's   request   for   a\n\ndownward departure from the Guidelines sentence based on the harm\n\nthat his incarceration would cause to his family.         Because two of\n\n\n     7\n      The court cited Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c). However, after the\namendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure effective\nDecember 1, 2002, the relevant language is now in Fed. R. Crim. P.\n32(i)(3)(B). Rule 32(i) provides:\n\n     (3) Court Determinations. At sentencing, the court:\n     . . .\n           (B) must--for any disputed portion of the presentence\n           report or other controverted matter--rule on the dispute\n           or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because\n           the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the\n           court will not consider the matter in sentencing . . . .\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fhis four children suffer from cystic fibrosis (CF)8, and because\n\nhis wife suffers from several illnesses, Roselli argued that his\n\nfamily   members     would   suffer    extraordinary      harm   if   he   were\n\nincarcerated   and    unable   to    care   for   them.    To    support   this\n\ncontention, he submitted letters from a doctor, two nurses, and a\n\nsocial worker familiar with his children's condition and the\n\nintegral role of parental care in battling CF.             He also submitted\n\nletters from his wife, Kara, his wife's doctor, and his mother-in-\n\nlaw outlining their daily home life, Kara's illnesses, and the\n\ninability of other friends and relatives to adequately replace the\n\nservices and care that Roselli provides to both his wife and\n\nchildren.    The Government offered no evidence to rebut Roselli's\n\ndescription of the facts.           Rather, it argued that the evidence\n\n\n\n     8\n      In a letter submitted to the district court, Dr. Henry\nDorkin, Director of the Cystic Fibrosis Center at the Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital, describes cystic fibrosis as\n\n            a chronic, incurable, progressive and terminal\n            illness of genetic origin. The basic defect\n            in cystic fibrosis leads to abnormalities in\n            several organ systems of the body, most\n            importantly the lungs and gastrointestinal\n            tract. [CF patients] develop persistent and\n            chronic lung infections as well as obstruction\n            of   the   airways   with   thick,   tenacious\n            secretions. The effect on the lungs over time\n            is to develop respiratory insufficiency,\n            leading to eventual respiratory failure and\n            death.   In a similar fashion, the thickened\n            secretions   obstruct   the   gastrointestinal\n            system, impairing nutrition and leading in\n            some cases to growth failure.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\foffered by Roselli, even if true, did not meet the standard for a\n\ndownward departure based on extraordinary family circumstances.\n\n           The district court disagreed, finding that Roselli was\n\n\"irreplaceable\" to his family.    It granted a downward departure,\n\nstating:\n\n           The focus, obviously, is on the family, not\n           the offender. And it would understate to say\n           that this family will be devastated in a way\n           that is truly extraordinary. . . . The\n           capacity for living that the children have\n           depends upon, I think, Mr. Roselli's presence.\n           It is exacerbated by the physical challenges\n           that Mrs. Roselli faces. And I believe that,\n           while discouraged, this ground of departure is\n           meant to address this extraordinary family\n           circumstance.\n\nThe court stated that it would \"depart to a probationary sentence,\"\n\nbut did not specify the extent of the departure, saying only that\n\nit would depart \"whether [the total offense level] is a 10 or 13.\"\n\nThe court then sentenced Roselli to a three year term of probation,\n\n12 months to be served in home confinement, a $20,000 fine, and a\n\nspecial assessment of $100.9\n\n           The Government now appeals.   It first argues that the\n\ndistrict court was required to determine the tax loss amount and\n\nthe related offense level.       It then argues that the downward\n\ndeparture was unwarranted because Roselli failed to meet the\n\n\n\n     9\n      Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5B1.2(a)(1), a term of probation shall\nbe \"at least one year but not more than five years if the offense\nlevel is 6 or greater.\"\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fstandards    necessary    to     justify     a     departure      for   family\n\ncircumstances.    We address these arguments in turn.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            We review de novo the district court's conclusion that it\n\nwas not required to determine the amount of tax loss and the\n\nrelated offense level. See, e.g., United States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d\n\n11, 13 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[W]e scrutinize the district court's legal\n\ndeterminations    (including     its    application    of   the    sentencing\n\nguidelines) de novo . . . .\").\n\n            A district court does not have to determine the exact\n\noffense level where such a determination would not affect the\n\ncourt's sentencing decision under the Guidelines.                  See United\n\nStates v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 88 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"To be sure, a\n\ndistrict court has inherent power not to decide disputes that are\n\nimmaterial or irrelevant to the ultimate sentence.\"); see also\n\nUnited States v. Concemi, 957 F.2d 942, 953 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(stating in dicta that any error resulting in a reduction of the\n\noffense level, but not moving the district court's sentence outside\n\nthe relevant guideline range, would be harmless).              Under certain\n\ncircumstances,    the   choice   between     two   potentially     applicable\n\noffense levels does not affect a court’s sentencing decision. \"[A]\n\nsentencing court need not choose between two overlapping guideline\n\nranges when the same sentence would have been imposed under either\n\nrange.\"     Carrozza, 4 F.3d at 88.          See also United States v.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fBermingham, 855 F.2d 925, 931 (2nd Cir. 1988)(\"[D]isputes about\n\napplicable guidelines need not be resolved where the sentence falls\n\nwithin either of two arguably applicable guideline ranges and the\n\nsame sentence would have been imposed under either guideline\n\nrange.”).      However, \"a court may not pick a particular sentence\n\nsolely   to    avoid   the   necessity     of    determining   the    guideline\n\nsentencing range.\"      United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 718 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).     Thus, if the district court settled on a sentence that\n\nhappened to fall at the point of overlap in the two potential\n\nguideline ranges, it did not have to determine which offense level,\n\nand thus which guideline range, applied to Roselli.\n\n              Prior to considering Roselli's request for a departure,\n\nthe district court adopted the Government's position that the\n\nappropriate      sentence    under   the        Guidelines   was     12   months\n\nincarceration and a $20,000 fine.           The court did not explicitly\n\nreach this sentence prior to considering whether there was an\n\noverlap in the sentencing ranges indicated by a total offense level\n\nof 10 and a total offense level of 13.               Nevertheless, both the\n\nGovernment and Roselli suggested to the court that 12 months was\n\nthe appropriate sentence under the Guidelines.               Thus, it appears\n\nthat the court settled on that sentence because of the parties'\n\nmutual suggestion, not because it fell at a point of overlap in the\n\ntwo potential sentencing ranges.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f           The Government nevertheless argues that the district\n\ncourt's refusal to make an exact tax loss finding was improperly\n\nmotivated by the desire to prevent Roselli from facing deportation.\n\nSee United States v. Maung, 320 F.3d 1305, 1307-10 (11th Cir. 2003)\n\n(holding that a district court may not depart solely to minimize\n\nthe effects of a conviction on immigration proceedings).            Although\n\nthe record indicates that the court was aware of the potential\n\ncollateral    effects   that   a   tax   loss   finding   might   have   in   a\n\nsubsequent deportation proceeding, it explicitly stated that a tax\n\nloss finding would not affect its sentencing decision and would\n\nwaste judicial resources with unnecessary and burdensome fact-\n\nfinding.   We reject the Government's challenge to the authenticity\n\nof the court's explanation.        Moreover, the court was not required\n\nto spend its resources sorting through disputed facts merely\n\nbecause a tax loss finding might prove beneficial to the government\n\nin a subsequent deportation proceeding.\n\n             If the district court had ended its analysis after\n\nrefusing to make the tax loss finding, and had sentenced Roselli to\n\n12 months imprisonment and a $20,000 fine, our analysis on appeal\n\nwould be complete.        However, the district court's subsequent\n\ndecision to depart from the sentencing ranges indicated by the\n\nGuidelines poses a potential problem appropriately noted by the\n\nGovernment.     Because the district court did not make a tax loss\n\nfinding, and thus did not determine Roselli's exact offense level,\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fit could not specify the degree of its departure.              The Government\n\ncontends    that   the   court's   failure      to   specify   the   degree   of\n\ndeparture was erroneous.\n\n            We agree with the Government that, in most cases, a\n\ndistrict court must determine the defendant's total offense level\n\nprior to departure so that it can specify the degree of departure.\n\nTo determine the defendant's offense level, the district court must\n\nfirst undertake the largely mechanical process of applying the\n\nGuidelines to a variety of objective factors.            In a tax fraud case,\n\none of the objective factors necessary to determine the proper\n\noffense level will be the amount of tax loss.                  See U.S.S.G. §\n\n2T4.1.     The offense level contributes to the determination of a\n\nsentencing range, and a \"court shall impose a sentence of the kind,\n\nand within the range, [indicated by the Guidelines] unless the\n\ncourt    finds   that    there   exists   an    aggravating    or    mitigating\n\ncircumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into\n\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission.\"            18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).\n\nThus, to carry out this analysis, a court must first determine the\n\nproper    sentencing     range   under    the   Guidelines     before   it    can\n\ndetermine whether that range is inappropriate because of factors\n\nthe Commission did not adequately account for in establishing the\n\nGuidelines.\n\n            Although we agree with the Government that the district\n\ncourt erred in failing to make a tax loss finding, we find that the\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\ferror was harmless in this case.     First, the error did not affect\n\nthe sentence imposed by the district court. See Williams v. United\n\nStates, 503 U.S. 193, 203 (1992) (\"[O]nce the court of appeals has\n\ndecided that the district court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand\n\nis appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes on the record\n\nas a whole that the error was harmless, i.e., that the error did\n\nnot   affect   the   district   court's   selection   of   the   sentence\n\nimposed.\").    The district court explicitly stated that it would\n\nimpose the same sentence \"whether [the total offense level] is a 10\n\nor 13,\" indicating its intention to depart to a probationary\n\nsentence regardless of the amount of the tax loss.          There is no\n\nreason to remand the case so that the district court can make a\n\nfactual determination that would have no effect on its sentencing\n\ndecision.\n\n            While the failure to make a tax loss finding did not\n\naffect the court's sentencing decision, it did prevent the court\n\nfrom specifying the offense level and the degree of its departure.\n\nPursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e)(3)(C), we are required to review\n\nwhether the district court's \"sentence departs to an unreasonable\n\ndegree from the applicable guidelines range.\"          See also United\n\nStates v. Bogdan, 302 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that\n\nreview of a district court's decision to depart from the Guidelines\n\nincludes a review of the extent of that departure). Ordinarily, we\n\ncannot perform this appellate function if the district court does\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fnot specify the degree of departure.                 Requiring the court to\n\ndetermine the total offense level prior to a departure decision\n\nestablishes a basis for the specification of a degree of departure.\n\nThus, in most cases, the district court must make the findings\n\nnecessary--including determining the offense level--to establish\n\nthe degree of departure.           Cf. United States v. Roberson, 872 F.2d\n\n597, 608 (5th Cir. 1989) (\"Whether the court incorrectly determined\n\nthe recommended range is relevant to our review of a [departure\n\nbecause a] . . . sentence that exceeds the Guidelines may look\n\nreasonable when compared to one recommended range, but unreasonable\n\nwhen compared to another.\").\n\n            This case, however, presents an unusual circumstance\n\nbecause the sentence imposed allows us to determine what the total\n\noffense level and the maximum degree of departure must have been,\n\nand hence we can review the departure decision.                After departing,\n\nthe court sentenced Roselli to 12 months of probation served under\n\na condition of home detention.            Combined with Roselli's criminal\n\nhistory    category    of     I,   an   offense   level   of   10     indicates   a\n\nsentencing range of 6-12 months of imprisonment, which falls with\n\nZone   B   of   the   sentencing        table.     Pursuant     to    U.S.S.G.    §\n\n5C1.1(c)(3), if the sentencing range falls within Zone B the court\n\nmay order the defendant to serve the required term as probation\n\nwith a condition of home detention rather than as a term of\n\nimprisonment.         Thus,    Roselli's       sentence   after      departure    is\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fconsistent with the maximum term allowed by an offense level of 10,\n\nserved as probation with a condition of home detention pursuant to\n\n§ 5C1.1(c)(3).\n\n            Roselli's sentence after departure is not consistent with\n\nan offense level of less than 10.       An offense level of 9 indicates\n\na sentencing range of only 4-10 months.           Offense levels of less\n\nthan 9 carry a maximum term of six months.                 Thus, Roselli's\n\nsentence of 12 months of home detention exceeds the sentencing\n\nguideline range authorized by any offense level below 10.\n\n            Similarly, Roselli's sentence after departure is not\n\nconsistent    with   an   offense   level   of   greater   than   10.   The\n\nsentencing ranges indicated by offense levels of 11 or 12 fall into\n\nZone C. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(d), a defendant whose offense\n\nlevel places him in Zone C must serve at least half of his term in\n\nprison.10    Sentencing ranges indicated by offense levels of 13 or\n\ngreater fall into Zone D.           Defendants in Zone D, pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(f), must serve their entire term in prison.\n\nRoselli's sentence of 12 months of probation with the condition of\n\nhome detention would not be available under any offense level that\n\nindicated a sentencing range in Zone C or D.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      The other half of the term may be served as supervised\nrelease with a condition of home detention or community\nconfinement.\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f            The district court imposed a sentence that is consistent\n\nonly with an offense level of 10.           We can therefore narrow our\n\ninquiry regarding the degree of departure.           If the district court\n\nhad   decided   the   tax   loss   question,   and   had   agreed    with   the\n\nGovernment's contention that the tax loss was equal to $101,524, it\n\nwould have applied to Roselli a total offense level of 13.                  The\n\nGovernment did not argue, and there is no evidence in the record to\n\nsuggest, that the tax loss was greater than $101,524.               Therefore,\n\nthe maximum offense level that the district court could have\n\napplied to Roselli was 13.           Because the court departed to a\n\nsentence that is consistent only with an offense level of 10, the\n\nmaximum level of departure in this case was three levels, from an\n\noffense level of 13 to an offense level of 10.\n\n            The Government correctly points out that, if the district\n\ncourt had made a finding as to the tax loss, it might have found\n\nthat the correct tax loss figure was somewhere between $10,000 and\n\n$101,524.    Thus, the court might have determined that the correct\n\ntotal offense level was 11 or 12, necessitating a departure of only\n\n1 or 2 levels to achieve an offense level of 10.             Indeed, if the\n\ndistrict court had agreed with Roselli's contention that the tax\n\nloss was less than $10,000, it could have sentenced Roselli in\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\faccordance     with    an   offense   level   of   10   without   making   any\n\ndeparture.11\n\n             Under different circumstances, this uncertainty about the\n\nlevel of departure might prevent us from properly reviewing the\n\nextent of the departure and require us to remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court.       In this case, however, the district court imposed\n\na sentence that is consistent only with an offense level of 10.             We\n\ncan therefore determine that the maximum degree of departure is\n\nthree levels.     Obviously, if the record justifies a three level\n\ndownward departure for extraordinary family circumstances, it would\n\nalso justify a lesser departure.12 Therefore, we turn to the merits\n\nof the departure for extraordinary family circumstances.\n\n\n     11\n      Notwithstanding the possible immigration consequences of\ncertain tax loss findings, Roselli was arguably disadvantaged in\nthis proceeding by the court's refusal to make a loss finding. If\nRoselli had prevailed in his view of the tax loss, a downward\ndeparture based on extraordinary family circumstances would have\nbeen unnecessary to reach a sentence of probation. As the court\nproceeded, however, Roselli was forced to argue for a rare and\ndiscouraged form of departure from the Guidelines.\n     12\n      Contrary to the Government's assertion, our decision does not\nconflict with United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70 (1st Cir. 1993).\nIn Carrozza, there was no point of overlap between the two possible\nsentencing ranges. Rather than determine which offense level, and\ntherefore which sentencing range, was correct, the district court\nsettled on a sentence between the two ranges. Thus, on appeal, we\ncould not determine whether the court had departed upward or\ndownward to reach the sentence it imposed.       In this case, the\ndistrict court determined that the proper sentence under the\nGuidelines was at a point of overlap in the two possible sentencing\nranges, and we can determine that the maximum degree of downward\ndeparture was three levels. Thus, unlike Carrozza, we are able to\nadequately review the degree of departure.\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f                                III.\n\n          We apply a three part analysis to review of departures:\n\n\"(1) we determine whether the stated ground for departure is\n\ntheoretically permissible under the guidelines; (2) if so, we\n\nexamine the record to assess whether there is adequate factual\n\nsupport; and (3) we determine the appropriateness of the degree of\n\ndeparture.\"     Bogdan, 302 F.3d at 16.      We review part one of the\n\ntest de novo.    United States v. Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76, 81 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).   Pursuant to the PROTECT Act, Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117\n\nStat. 650, we review part two of this test de novo for all appeals\n\npending on or filed after April 30, 2003.         See United States v.\n\nThurston, 358 F.3d 51, 70-71 (1st Cir. 2004).         The PROTECT Act did\n\nnot alter our review of the extent of departures, and we therefore\n\ncontinue to review part three of the test only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   Id. at 70-71; see also Koon v. United States, 518 U.S.\n\n81, 96-97 (1996).\n\n          A   court   must   impose    a   sentence   within   the   range\n\nprescribed by the guidelines \"unless the court finds that there\n\nexists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to\n\na degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing\n\nCommission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a\n\nsentence different from that described.\"       18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).     To\n\nwarrant a departure, a circumstance must \"render the case atypical\n\nand take it out of the 'heartland' for which the applicable\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fguideline was designed.\" United States v. Carrion-Cruz, 92 F.3d 5,\n\n6 (1st Cir. 1996). Among potential factors justifying a departure,\n\na   \"discouraged    factor\"   is   one   \"'not   ordinarily     relevant   in\n\ndetermining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable\n\nguideline range.'\"      United States v. Mejia, 309 F.3d 67, 70 (1st\n\nCir. 2002)(quoting U.S.S.G. § 5, part H, intro. cmt.).                 \"The\n\nSentencing Guidelines deem family circumstances a 'discouraged'\n\nground for departure, and a district court may depart on the basis\n\nof a discouraged ground only in an 'exceptional' case.\"               United\n\nStates v. Louis, 300 F.3d 78, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2002); see also\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5H1.6; United States v. Pereira, 272 F.3d 76, 80 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n           We    have   affirmed   departures     for   exceptional   family\n\ncircumstances only on rare occasions, noting that          \"time-consuming\n\nfamily responsibilities, by themselves, are not sufficient to take\n\na case out of the 'heartland.'\"            Pereira, 272 F.3d at 80.        In\n\nUnited States v. Carr, 932 F.2d 67, 72-73 (1st Cir. 1991), we\n\nreversed   a    downward   departure     based   on   family   circumstances\n\nbecause, even though Carr and her husband both faced prison terms,\n\ntheir 4-year-old child could be cared for by Carr's mother during\n\ntheir incarceration.       In United States v. Chestna, 962 F.2d 103\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), we found that incarcerating a single mother of\n\nfour young children (aged thirteen, eleven, four, and less than\n\none) would not cause the exceptional family hardship required to\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fdepart from the guidelines because \"single mother status is not an\n\nidiosyncratic circumstance. . . .\"           Id. at 107 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). In Pereira, we vacated a departure based on the\n\ndefendant's role in caring for his elderly parents because the\n\ndefendant did not provide specialized care, his siblings were\n\navailable to help with the parents' care, and home nursing services\n\nprovided   an   adequate       alternative    during      the   period   of    the\n\ndefendant's incarceration.          272 F.3d at 82-83.          See also United\n\nStates v. Sweeting, 213 F.3d 95, 104-05 (3rd Cir. 2000)(departure\n\nnot appropriate for a single mother of five children, one of whom\n\nhad Tourette Syndrome, where the care provided by the mother was to\n\nengage in daily exercise with the child, to help him keep his\n\nschool and home tasks organized, to administer his medicine when\n\nnecessary, and to remove certain foods from his diet).\n\n           Nevertheless,       we   have    upheld   departures     in   limited\n\ncircumstances    where     a    defendant     was    so   irreplaceable       that\n\nincarceration would cause exceptional hardship to his family.                  In\n\nUnited States v. Sclamo, 997 F.2d 970, 974 (1st Cir. 1993), we\n\naffirmed a departure where the defendant's stepson, who suffered\n\nfrom a psychiatric disorder and had a long history of aggressive\n\nand disruptive behavior, was making dramatic progress largely\n\nbecause of the support and care of the defendant.                        In that\n\ncircumstance, the defendant's important role could not practically\n\nhave been filled by any other person.          In United States v. Rivera,\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f994 F.2d 942, 952-54 (1st Cir. 1993), we ruled that the district\n\ncourt might justifiably depart on remand where defendant was the\n\nsingle mother of three young children, received income only from\n\nwelfare, and had virtually no contact with or support from other\n\nfamily members.    This combination of factors might be enough, on a\n\ncloser review of the facts, to render the defendant irreplaceable\n\nto her young children.     See also United States v. Haversat, 22 F.3d\n\n790, 797 (8th Cir. 1994)(upholding departure because defendant's\n\nwife suffered from a severe psychiatric disorder and defendant was\n\nneeded to \"identify the beginning of any regression and to seek out\n\nimmediate treatment to avoid 'a serious situation.'\").\n\n          A     downward    departure        for   extraordinary      family\n\ncircumstances may be appropriate where the care provided by the\n\ndefendant is \"irreplaceable or otherwise extraordinary.\"           Pereira,\n\n272 F.3d at 82.      This standard requires the district court to\n\ndetermine whether \"there are feasible alternatives of care that are\n\nrelatively    comparable   to   what   the   defendant   provides.\"      Id.\n\n(emphasis added). Thus, a downward departure is appropriate if the\n\ndefendant's role \"is so different in kind or degree from the many\n\nkinds of support that can be important in the [family] relationship\n\nthat it makes the family ties and responsibilities factor . . .\n\nexceptional.\"     Louis, 300 F.3d at 82.\n\n          This case presents an exceptional situation. Roselli has\n\nfour children, each of whom is under the age of 10.            Two of the\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fchildren--Antonio, age 9, and Adyn, age 1--suffer from CF.             Caring\n\nfor Antonio and Adyn requires extensive time and effort by both\n\nRoselli and his wife, Kara.            Antonio must visit his pulmonary\n\ndoctor at least six times per year and has been hospitalized three\n\ntimes    in   the   past   four    years.     After   each   hospitalization,\n\nAntonio's parents must administer intravenous antibiotics three\n\ntimes a day--with each session lasting approximately one hour--for\n\nthree weeks.        Antonio requires a special diet which must be\n\nprepared separately from the other children's meals.             Each morning\n\nand evening, Antonio must undergo 30 minutes of closely monitored\n\ntreatment to combat bacteria that causes deterioration of the\n\nlungs.    The parents also administer several other prescription\n\nmedications each morning, taking approximately 20 minutes, and\n\nmonitor Antonio's chest therapy for 30 to 40 minutes each evening.\n\nFinally, Roselli helps Antonio with his studies and ensures that he\n\nmaintains the level of physical activity prescribed by his doctors\n\nby jogging with him, coaching his baseball and football teams, and\n\ntransporting him to gymnastics and soccer practice.\n\n              Caring for Adyn requires even more attention and effort.\n\nIn addition to CF, Adyn suffers from gastroesophageal reflux\n\ndisease (GERD), which makes it extremely difficult for him to\n\nconsume and digest food.          Doctors have installed a feeding tube to\n\nensure that he gets the nourishment he needs to battle his CF.\n\nRoselli and his wife give Adyn three meals a day via \"bolus\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\ffeeding,\" a process whereby Adyn receives formula through a test-\n\ntube like apparatus attached to his feeding tube.                   This process\n\nrequires both parents: Kara conducts the feeding while Roselli\n\nholds Adyn upright to minimize the chance of vomiting or choking.\n\nEach feeding lasts approximately 45 minutes, requiring significant\n\nstrength and      endurance    to   keep   Adyn    in     an   upright   position.\n\nRoselli has developed a work schedule that allows him to be home\n\nduring the morning and to be present for most of Adyn's bolus\n\nfeedings.     At night, Adyn's feeding tube is attached to a food\n\npump, which provides both nourishment and most of his medication,\n\nfor eight to ten hours.       Because Adyn must tolerate this method of\n\nfeeding while lying on his back, Roselli and his wife must check\n\nthe feeding tube intermittently throughout the night to ensure that\n\nAdyn does not choke or vomit.        Both parents are trained to reinsert\n\nthe feeding tube if it should accidentally be dislodged.                   If the\n\ntube is not reinserted within an hour after coming loose, Adyn\n\nwould   require     surgery.        Roselli       also     administers     several\n\nmedications to Adyn each morning and cleans his feeding tube daily\n\nto prevent infections.\n\n            Comparable   alternatives       to     Roselli's      care   are,   for\n\npractical purposes, nonexistent. Kara cannot care for the children\n\nherself, largely because of her own health problems.                 She suffers\n\nfrom fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes pain in the soft\n\ntissue and joints throughout her body.                   The effects can be so\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fdebilitating that they prevent her from completing simple physical\n\ntasks.   Other symptoms of her condition include severe fatigue,\n\nirritable   bowel   syndrome,   numbness     in     her    hands   and   feet,\n\ndifficulty sleeping and concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling\n\noverwhelmed when faced with multiple tasks.          She also suffers from\n\nchronic migraine headaches, for which she has sought emergency room\n\ntreatment on several occasions.       Finally, Kara has been diagnosed\n\nwith depression and anxiety. She takes a variety of medications to\n\ncontrol each of these illnesses.\n\n            Roselli's   relatives    are   unable    to     provide   adequate\n\nassistance.   Kara's mother lives more than one hour away and cares\n\nfor two terminally ill sons, as well as her husband who suffers\n\nfrom prostate cancer.      Roselli's mother is 74 years old and has\n\ndifficulty walking because of her arthritis.              Roselli's sister is\n\nthe only other family member who lives in Massachusetts, and she\n\ncares for three children of her own.\n\n            In-home health care also does not provide a viable\n\nalternative to Roselli's presence.           To replace the care that\n\nRoselli provides, the family would have to hire a nurse--or likely\n\nseveral nurses working in shifts--on a 24 hour-a-day, seven days-a-\n\nweek basis.    They would have to be trained to provide the special\n\ncare that Adyn requires, including bolus feeding and the overnight\n\nfeeding system.     Even in the event that such care were available\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fand not prohibitively expensive, it would not fulfill Roselli's\n\nrole in Antonio's exercise regimen and schoolwork.\n\n            Finally, emotional support is an important factor under\n\nthese circumstances.       The letter from CF specialist Dr. Dorkin\n\nstates that \"[h]aving one child with CF can be overwhelming for\n\nmany families.    To have two such children can be devastating. . .\n\n.   Only the ability to have [Mr. Roselli] share in the care of the\n\nchildren has kept the children out of the hospital.\"       He further\n\nstates that removal of their father from the home \"will contribute\n\nto a more rapid course in [the children's] deterioration.\"           A\n\nletter from Kara's doctor states that \"I have no doubt that if\n\n[Roselli] is removed from the home and Kara is left with sole\n\nresponsibility for caring for her children, Kara's stress and\n\nactivity levels would be substantially increased, in turn leading\n\nto an overall decline in her own health as well as her ability to\n\ncare for her children.\"      While doubtless the incarceration of a\n\nparent can in many ordinary cases have an unfortunate emotional\n\neffect on other family members, this case is exceptional in that,\n\nbesides the emotional impact upon remaining family members, the\n\nremoval of Roselli's critical services from his home will impact\n\nseverely upon the physical well-being and even the ability to\n\nsurvive of those left behind.\n\n            In Rivera, we wrote that \"at some point, the nature and\n\nmagnitude    of   family   responsibilities   (many   children?   with\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fhandicaps? no money? no place for children to go?) may transform\n\nthe 'ordinary' case . . . into a case that is not at all ordinary.\"\n\n994 F.2d at 948.     Roselli's family circumstances move this case\n\nwell outside the ordinary range.     Under these circumstances, where\n\ntwo children require specialized round-the-clock care because of\n\nCF, where adequate help is not readily available, and where the\n\nother parent is battling her own debilitating health problems, a\n\nthree   level   downward    departure    for   extraordinary    family\n\ncircumstances   is   entirely   appropriate.   The   judgment   of   the\n\ndistrict court is AFFIRMED.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\f",

At sentencing, the district court declined to determine the exact amount of the tax loss, and the offense level that would result from such a determination, ruling that such a finding would not affect the sentence. The court then departed downward from the Sentencing Guidelines based on Roselli's extraordinary family circumstances. The Government now appeals both the failure to specify an amount of tax loss and the decision to depart. Although we agree that the failure to specify an amount of tax loss and the related offense level was an error, we find that error harmless, and we affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, Antonio Roselli began working as a partner in an accounting firm where he provided tax services. In 1997 and 1998, Roselli prepared tax returns on behalf of his clients that included false deductions for charitable contributions and business expenses. He charged his clients approximately $250 for each false return. Roselli also amended tax returns from prior years, adding false deductions in an effort to procure retroactive refunds. For each amended return he charged approximately one third of the expected refund. The Government contends that, all told, Roselli prepared more than 140 false tax returns, accounting for $101,524 in tax loss to the United States Treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 29, 2002, Roselli pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to aid, assist, and abet in the filing of materially false tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(2). In the plea agreement, the Government stated its belief that the tax loss was $101,524, indicating a base offense level of 14 pursuant to section 2T1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Government argued that the appropriate total offense level, after several adjustments, was 13.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Government agreed to recommend a sentence of twelve months incarceration, a $20,000 fine, a $100 special assessment, and three years of supervised release. Roselli asserted that the tax loss was not readily ascertainable and, in any event, was far less than $101,524. Although he asserted that the proper total offense level was 10, he nevertheless agreed to recommend the same sentence as the prosecution, except that he would seek home detention for the twelve month period rather than incarceration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearings, Roselli asserted that the tax loss was between $8,000 and $10,000. He offered several examples, though not an exhaustive list, of tax returns that he alleged should not have been included in the government's loss calculation. These examples amounted to an alleged overstatement of $52,525, bringing the tax loss down to no more than $48,999. Nevertheless, Roselli reiterated that he would accept the Government's recommendation of a total offense level of 13 so long as the court did not make a finding that the tax loss was $10,000 or more. The Government argued that the court must make a specific finding as to the tax loss and calculate the offense level based on that finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the sentencing hearing, Roselli's counsel explained that a tax loss finding could have harmful collateral consequences in a subsequent deportation proceeding. Although Roselli has lived in the United States for approximately 34 years, he is a citizen of the United Kingdom and may be subject to deportation if he is convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(2)is not specifically listed as an aggravated felony, but the definition of \"aggravated felony\" includes any offense that \"involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If the court made an explicit finding that the tax loss was greater than $10,000, such a finding might be preclusive in any subsequent deportation proceeding. <i>See, e.g., Hammer v. INS,</i> 195 F.3d 836, 840-41 (6th Cir.1999) (findings made during a denaturalization proceeding have preclusive effect in a subsequent deportation proceeding). Roselli would then be subject to deportation if the court found that a violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(2) fit the parameters outlined in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving supplemental briefs on the issue of the tax loss finding, the court declined to determine whether the tax loss was $101,524 as suggested by the Government, between $8,000 and $10,000 as suggested by Roselli, or somewhere between those two figures. The court reasoned that if it accepted Roselli's assertion that the tax loss was between $8,000 and $10,000, the resulting total offense level would be 10, corresponding to a guideline range of 6 to 12 months and a fine of between $2,000 and $20,000. If the court accepted the Government's contention that the tax loss was $101,524, the total offense level would be 13, corresponding to a guideline range of 12 to 18 months and a fine of $3,000 to $30,000. Thus, there was a point of overlap in guideline ranges that corresponded precisely with the Government's sentencing recommendation: 12 months of incarceration and a fine of $3,000 to $20,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court then stated its conclusion on the tax loss finding issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm confronted with, I think, a realistic prospect that the tax loss could be disputed. And the process of resolving that dispute would be not quite the equivalent of the trial itself, but would be a quite demanding claim upon the Court's resources. Here, I would have to, I think, hear from [a witness]. I'd have to examine a variety of different tax returns to determine the tax loss. And there seems to me to be no particular benefit to doing that when we're dealing with overlapping Guidelines. And, of course, it's particularly the case that the Government in its plea agreement has committed itself to making a recommendation at that point of overlap under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the appropriate Guidelines sentence corresponded to a point of overlap in the two guideline sentencing ranges suggested by the parties, the court ruled that a finding as to the exact amount of the tax loss would \"not affect sentencing\" and was therefore unnecessary. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The court made only the general finding that the tax loss was \"not less than $8,000.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then considered Roselli's request for a downward departure from the Guidelines sentence based on the harm that his incarceration would cause to his family. Because two of his four children suffer from cystic fibrosis (CF)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>, and because his wife suffers from several illnesses, Roselli argued that his family members would suffer extraordinary harm if he were incarcerated and unable to care for them. To support this contention, he submitted letters from a doctor, two nurses, and a social worker familiar with his children's condition and the integral role of parental care in battling CF. He also submitted letters from his wife, Kara, his wife's doctor, and his mother-in-law outlining their daily home life, Kara's illnesses, and the inability of other friends and relatives to adequately replace the services and care that Roselli provides to both his wife and children. The Government offered no evidence to rebut Roselli's description of the facts. Rather, it argued that the evidence offered by Roselli, even if true, did not meet the standard for a downward departure based on extraordinary family circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court disagreed, finding that Roselli was \"irreplaceable\" to his family. It granted a downward departure, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus, obviously, is on the family, not the offender. And it would understate to say that this family will be devastated in a way that is truly extraordinary.... The capacity for living that the children have depends upon, I think, Mr. Roselli's presence. It is exacerbated by the physical challenges that Mrs. Roselli faces. And I believe that, while discouraged, this ground of departure is meant to address this extraordinary family circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court stated that it would \"depart to a probationary sentence,\" but did not specify the extent of the departure, saying only that it would depart \"whether [the total offense level] is a 10 or 13.\" The court then sentenced Roselli to a three year term of probation, 12 months to be served in home confinement, a $20,000 fine, and a special assessment of $100.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government now appeals. It first argues that the district court was required to determine the tax loss amount and the related offense level. It then argues that the downward departure was unwarranted because Roselli failed to meet the standards necessary to justify a departure for family circumstances. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's conclusion that it was not required to determine the amount of tax loss and the related offense level. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mateo,</i> 271 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[W]e scrutinize the district court's legal determinations (including its application of the sentencing guidelines) de novo....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court does not have to determine the exact offense level where such a determination would not affect the court's sentencing decision under the Guidelines. <i>See United States v. Carrozza,</i> 4 F.3d 70, 88 (1st Cir.1993) (\"To be sure, a district court has inherent power not to decide disputes that are immaterial or irrelevant to the ultimate sentence.\"); <i>see also United States v. Concemi,</i> 957 F.2d 942, 953 (1st Cir.1992) (stating in dicta that any error resulting in a reduction of the offense level, but not moving the district court's sentence outside the relevant guideline range, would be harmless). Under certain circumstances, the choice between two potentially applicable offense levels does not affect a court's sentencing decision. \"[A] sentencing court need not choose between two overlapping guideline ranges when the same sentence would have been imposed under either range.\" <i>Carrozza,</i> 4 F.3d at 88. <i>See also United States v. Bermingham,</i> 855 F.2d 925, 931 (2nd Cir.1988)(\"[D]isputes about applicable guidelines need not be resolved where the sentence falls within either of two arguably applicable guideline ranges and the same sentence would have been imposed under either guideline range.\"). However, \"a court may not pick a particular sentence solely to avoid the necessity of determining the guideline sentencing range.\" <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 718 (1st Cir.1992). Thus, if the district court settled on a sentence that happened to fall at the point of overlap in the two potential guideline ranges, it did not have to determine which offense level, and thus which guideline range, applied to Roselli.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to considering Roselli's request for a departure, the district court adopted the Government's position that the appropriate sentence under the Guidelines was 12 months incarceration and a $20,000 fine. The court did not explicitly reach this sentence prior to considering whether there was an overlap in the sentencing ranges indicated by a total offense level of 10 and a total offense level of 13. Nevertheless, both the Government and Roselli suggested to the court that 12 months was the appropriate sentence under the Guidelines. Thus, it appears that the court settled on that sentence because of the parties' mutual suggestion, not because it fell at a point of overlap in the two potential sentencing ranges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government nevertheless argues that the district court's refusal to make an exact tax loss finding was improperly motivated by the desire to prevent Roselli from facing deportation. <i>See United States v. Maung,</i> 320 F.3d 1305, 1307-10 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that a district court may not depart solely to minimize the effects of a conviction on immigration proceedings). Although the record indicates that the court was aware of the potential collateral effects that a tax loss finding might have in a subsequent deportation proceeding, it explicitly stated that a tax loss finding would not affect its sentencing decision and would waste judicial resources with unnecessary and burdensome fact-finding. We reject the Government's challenge to the authenticity of the court's explanation. Moreover, the court was not required to spend its resources sorting through disputed facts merely because a tax loss finding might prove beneficial to the government in a subsequent deportation proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court had ended its analysis after refusing to make the tax loss finding, and had sentenced Roselli to 12 months imprisonment and a $20,000 fine, our analysis on appeal would be complete. However, the district court's subsequent decision to depart from the sentencing ranges indicated by the Guidelines poses a potential problem appropriately noted by the Government. Because the district court did not make a tax loss finding, and thus did not determine Roselli's exact offense level, it could not specify the degree of its departure. The Government contends that the court's failure to specify the degree of departure was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Government that, in most cases, a district court must determine the defendant's total offense level prior to departure so that it can specify the degree of departure. To determine the defendant's offense level, the district court must first undertake the largely mechanical process of applying the Guidelines to a variety of objective factors. In a tax fraud case, one of the objective factors necessary to determine the proper offense level will be the amount of tax loss. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2T4.1. The offense level contributes to the determination of a sentencing range, and a \"court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range, [indicated by the Guidelines] unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b). Thus, to carry out this analysis, a court must first determine the proper sentencing range under the Guidelines before it can determine whether that range is inappropriate because of factors the Commission did not adequately account for in establishing the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with the Government that the district court erred in failing to make a tax loss finding, we find that the error was harmless in this case. First, the error did not affect the sentence imposed by the district court. <i>See Williams v. United States,</i> 503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (\"[O]nce the court of appeals has decided that the district court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes on the record as a whole that the error was harmless, i.e., that the error did not affect the district court's selection of the sentence imposed.\"). The district court explicitly stated that it would impose the same sentence \"whether [the total offense level] is a 10 or 13,\" indicating its intention to depart to a probationary sentence regardless of the amount of the tax loss. There is no reason to remand the case so that the district court can make a factual determination that would have no effect on its sentencing decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the failure to make a tax loss finding did not affect the court's sentencing decision, it did prevent the court from specifying the offense level and the degree of its departure. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e)(3)(C), we are required to review whether the district court's \"sentence departs to an unreasonable degree from the applicable guidelines range.\" <i>See also United States v. Bogdan,</i> 302 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that review of a district court's decision to depart from the Guidelines includes a review of the extent of that departure). Ordinarily, we cannot perform this appellate function if the district court does not specify the degree of departure. Requiring the court to determine the total offense level prior to a departure decision establishes a basis for the specification of a degree of departure. Thus, in most cases, the district court must make the findings necessary &#8212; including determining the offense level &#8212; to establish the degree of departure. <i>Cf. United States v. Roberson,</i> 872 F.2d 597, 608 (5th Cir.1989) (\"Whether the court incorrectly determined the recommended range is relevant to our review of a [departure because a] ... sentence that exceeds the Guidelines may look reasonable when compared to one recommended range, but unreasonable when compared to another.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case, however, presents an unusual circumstance because the sentence imposed allows us to determine what the total offense level and the maximum degree of departure must have been, and hence we can review the departure decision. After departing, the court sentenced Roselli to 12 months of probation served under a condition of home detention. Combined with Roselli's criminal history category of I, an offense level of 10 indicates a sentencing range of 6-12 months of imprisonment, which falls with Zone B of the sentencing table. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.1(c)(3), if the sentencing range falls within Zone B the court may order the defendant to serve the required term as probation with a condition of home detention rather than as a term of imprisonment. Thus, Roselli's sentence after departure is consistent with the maximum term allowed by an offense level of 10, served as probation with a condition of home detention pursuant to &#167; 5C1.1(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roselli's sentence after departure is not consistent with an offense level of less than 10. An offense level of 9 indicates a sentencing range of only 4-10 months. Offense levels of less than 9 carry a maximum term of six months. Thus, Roselli's sentence of 12 months of home detention exceeds the sentencing guideline range authorized by any offense level below 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Roselli's sentence after departure is not consistent with an offense level of greater than 10. The sentencing ranges indicated by offense levels of 11 or 12 fall into Zone C. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.1(d), a defendant whose offense level places him in Zone C must serve at least half of his term in prison.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Sentencing ranges indicated by offense levels of 13 or greater fall into Zone D. Defendants in Zone D, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.1(f), must serve their entire term in prison. Roselli's sentence of 12 months of probation with the condition of home detention would not be available under any offense level that indicated a sentencing range in Zone C or D.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court imposed a sentence that is consistent <i>only</i> with an offense level of 10. We can therefore narrow our inquiry regarding the degree of departure. If the district court had decided the tax loss question, and had agreed with the Government's contention that the tax loss was equal to $101,524, it would have applied to Roselli a total offense level of 13. The Government did not argue, and there is no evidence in the record to suggest, that the tax loss was greater than $101,524. Therefore, the maximum offense level that the district court could have applied to Roselli was 13. Because the court departed to a sentence that is consistent only with an offense level of 10, the maximum level of departure in this case was three levels, from an offense level of 13 to an offense level of 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government correctly points out that, if the district court had made a finding as to the tax loss, it might have found that the correct tax loss figure was somewhere between $10,000 and $101,524. Thus, the court might have determined that the correct total offense level was 11 or 12, necessitating a departure of only 1 or 2 levels to achieve an offense level of 10. Indeed, if the district court had agreed with Roselli's contention that the tax loss was less than $10,000, it could have sentenced Roselli in accordance with an offense level of 10 without making any departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under different circumstances, this uncertainty about the level of departure might prevent us from properly reviewing the extent of the departure and require us to remand the case to the district court. In this case, however, the district court imposed a sentence that is consistent only with an offense level of 10. We can therefore determine that the maximum degree of departure is three levels. Obviously, if the record justifies a three level downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances, it would also justify a lesser departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Therefore, we turn to the merits of the departure for extraordinary family circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We apply a three part analysis to review of departures: \"(1) we determine whether the stated ground for departure is theoretically permissible under the guidelines; (2) if so, we examine the record to assess whether there is adequate factual support; and (3) we determine the appropriateness of the degree of departure.\" <i>Bogdan,</i> 302 F.3d at 16.

In <i>United States v. Carr,</i> 932 F.2d 67, 72-73 (1st Cir.1991), we reversed a downward departure based on family circumstances because, even though Carr and her husband both faced prison terms, their 4-year-old child could be cared for by Carr's mother during their incarceration. In <i>United States v. Chestna,</i> 962 F.2d 103 (1st Cir.1992), we found that incarcerating a single mother of four young children (aged thirteen, eleven, four, and less than one) would not cause the exceptional family hardship required to depart from the guidelines because \"single mother status is not an idiosyncratic circumstance....\" <i>Id.</i> at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted). In <i>Pereira,</i> we vacated a departure based on the defendant's role in caring for his elderly parents because the defendant did not provide specialized care, his siblings were available to help with the parents' care, and home nursing services provided an adequate alternative during the period of the defendant's incarceration. 272 F.3d at 82-83. <i>See also United States v. Sweeting,</i> 213 F.3d 95, 104-05 (3rd Cir.2000)(departure not appropriate for a single mother of five children, one of whom had Tourette Syndrome, where the care provided by the mother was to engage in daily exercise with the child, to help him keep his school and home tasks organized, to administer his medicine when necessary, and to remove certain foods from his diet).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we have upheld departures in limited circumstances where a defendant was so irreplaceable that incarceration would cause exceptional hardship to his family. In <i>United States v. Sclamo,</i> 997 F.2d 970, 974 (1st Cir.1993), we affirmed a departure where the defendant's stepson, who suffered from a psychiatric disorder and had a long history of aggressive and disruptive behavior, was making dramatic progress largely because of the support and care of the defendant. In that circumstance, the defendant's important role could not practically have been filled by any other person. In <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d 942, 952-54 (1st Cir.1993), we ruled that the district court might justifiably depart on remand where defendant was the single mother of three young children, received income only from welfare, and had virtually no contact with or support from other family members. This combination of factors might be enough, on a closer review of the facts, to render the defendant irreplaceable to her young children. <i>See also United States v. Haversat,</i> 22 F.3d 790, 797 (8th Cir.1994)(upholding departure because defendant's wife suffered from a severe psychiatric disorder and defendant was needed to \"identify the beginning of any regression and to seek out immediate treatment to avoid `a serious situation.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances may be appropriate where the care provided by the defendant is \"irreplaceable or otherwise extraordinary.\" <i>Pereira,</i> 272 F.3d at 82. This standard requires the district court to determine whether \"there are <i>feasible</i> alternatives of care that are relatively comparable to what the defendant provides.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Thus, a downward departure is appropriate if the defendant's role \"is so different in kind or degree from the many kinds of support that can be important in the [family] relationship that it makes the family ties and responsibilities factor... exceptional.\" <i>Louis,</i> 300 F.3d at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents an exceptional situation. Roselli has four children, each of whom is under the age of 10. Two of the children &#8212; Antonio, age 9, and Adyn, age 1 &#8212; suffer from CF. Caring for Antonio and Adyn requires extensive time and effort by both Roselli and his wife, Kara. Antonio must visit his pulmonary doctor at least six times per year and has been hospitalized three times in the past four years. After each hospitalization, Antonio's parents must administer intravenous antibiotics three times a day &#8212; with each session lasting approximately one hour &#8212; for three weeks. Antonio requires a special diet which must be prepared separately from the other children's meals. Each morning and evening, Antonio must undergo 30 minutes of closely monitored treatment to combat bacteria that causes deterioration of the lungs. The parents also administer several other prescription medications each morning, taking approximately 20 minutes, and monitor Antonio's chest therapy for 30 to 40 minutes each evening. Finally, Roselli helps Antonio with his studies and ensures that he maintains the level of physical activity prescribed by his doctors by jogging with him, coaching his baseball and football teams, and transporting him to gymnastics and soccer practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caring for Adyn requires even more attention and effort. In addition to CF, Adyn suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which makes it extremely difficult for him to consume and digest food. Doctors have installed a feeding tube to ensure that he gets the nourishment he needs to battle his CF. Roselli and his wife give Adyn three meals a day via \"bolus feeding,\" a process whereby Adyn receives formula through a test-tube like apparatus attached to his feeding tube. This process requires both parents: Kara conducts the feeding while Roselli holds Adyn upright to minimize the chance of vomiting or choking. Each feeding lasts approximately 45 minutes, requiring significant strength and endurance to keep Adyn in an upright position. Roselli has developed a work schedule that allows him to be home during the morning and to be present for most of Adyn's bolus feedings. At night, Adyn's feeding tube is attached to a food pump, which provides both nourishment and most of his medication, for eight to ten hours. Because Adyn must tolerate this method of feeding while lying on his back, Roselli and his wife must check the feeding tube intermittently throughout the night to ensure that Adyn does not choke or vomit. Both parents are trained to reinsert the feeding tube if it should accidentally be dislodged. If the tube is not reinserted within an hour after coming loose, Adyn would require surgery. Roselli also administers several medications to Adyn each morning and cleans his feeding tube daily to prevent infections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparable alternatives to Roselli's care are, for practical purposes, nonexistent. Kara cannot care for the children herself, largely because of her own health problems. She suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes pain in the soft tissue and joints throughout her body. The effects can be so debilitating that they prevent her from completing simple physical tasks. Other symptoms of her condition include severe fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, numbness in her hands and feet, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling overwhelmed when faced with multiple tasks. She also suffers from chronic migraine headaches, for which she has sought emergency room treatment on several occasions. Finally, Kara has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. She takes a variety of medications to control each of these illnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roselli's relatives are unable to provide adequate assistance. Kara's mother lives more than one hour away and cares for two terminally ill sons, as well as her husband who suffers from prostate cancer. Roselli's mother is 74 years old and has difficulty walking because of her arthritis. Roselli's sister is the only other family member who lives in Massachusetts, and she cares for three children of her own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In-home health care also does not provide a viable alternative to Roselli's presence. To replace the care that Roselli provides, the family would have to hire a nurse &#8212; or likely several nurses working in shifts &#8212; on a 24 hour-a-day, seven days-a-week basis. They would have to be trained to provide the special care that Adyn requires, including bolus feeding and the overnight feeding system. Even in the event that such care were available and not prohibitively expensive, it would not fulfill Roselli's role in Antonio's exercise regimen and schoolwork.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, emotional support is an important factor under these circumstances. The letter from CF specialist Dr. Dorkin states that \"[h]aving one child with CF can be overwhelming for many families. To have two such children can be devastating.... Only the ability to have [Mr. Roselli] share in the care of the children has kept the children out of the hospital.\" He further states that removal of their father from the home \"will contribute to a more rapid course in [the children's] deterioration.\" A letter from Kara's doctor states that \"I have no doubt that if [Roselli] is removed from the home and Kara is left with sole responsibility for caring for her children, Kara's stress and activity levels would be substantially increased, in turn leading to an overall decline in her own health as well as her ability to care for her children.\" While doubtless the incarceration of a parent can in many ordinary cases have an unfortunate emotional effect on other family members, this case is exceptional in that, besides the emotional impact upon remaining family members, the removal of Roselli's critical services from his home will impact severely upon the physical well-being and even the ability to survive of those left behind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Rivera,</i> we wrote that \"at some point, the nature and magnitude of family responsibilities (many children? with handicaps? no money? no place for children to go?) may transform the `ordinary' case ... into a case that is not at all ordinary.\" 994 F.2d at 948. Roselli's family circumstances move this case well outside the ordinary range. Under these circumstances, where two children require specialized round-the-clock care because of CF, where adequate help is not readily available, and where the other parent is battling her own debilitating health problems, a three level downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances is entirely appropriate. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to oral argument, the district court granted appellee's motion to supplement the appellate record with the probation officer's confidential sentencing recommendation.

Thus, on appeal, we could not determine whether the court had departed upward or downward to reach the sentence it imposed. In this case, the district court determined that the proper sentence under the Guidelines was at a point of overlap in the two possible sentencing ranges, and we can determine that the maximum degree of downward departure was three levels.

At sentencing, the district court declined to determine the exact amount of the tax loss, and the offense level that would result from such a determination, ruling that such a finding would not affect the sentence. The court then departed downward from the Sentencing Guidelines based on Roselli's extraordinary family circumstances. The Government now appeals both the failure to specify an amount of tax loss and the decision to depart. Although we agree that the failure to specify an amount of tax loss and the related offense level was an error, we find that error harmless, and we affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, Antonio Roselli began working as a partner in an accounting firm where he provided tax services. In 1997 and 1998, Roselli prepared tax returns on behalf of his clients that included false deductions for charitable contributions and business expenses. He charged his clients approximately $250 for each false return. Roselli also amended tax returns from prior years, adding false deductions in an effort to procure retroactive refunds. For each amended return he charged approximately one third of the expected refund. The Government contends that, all told, Roselli prepared more than 140 false tax returns, accounting for $101,524 in tax loss to the United States Treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 29, 2002, Roselli pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to aid, assist, and abet in the filing of materially false tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(2). In the plea agreement, the Government stated its belief that the tax loss was $101,524, indicating a base offense level of 14 pursuant to section 2T1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Government argued that the appropriate total offense level, after several adjustments, was 13.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Government agreed to recommend a sentence of twelve months incarceration, a $20,000 fine, a $100 special assessment, and three years of supervised release. Roselli asserted that the tax loss was not readily ascertainable and, in any event, was far less than $101,524. Although he asserted that the proper total offense level was 10, he nevertheless agreed to recommend the same sentence as the prosecution, except that he would seek home detention for the twelve month period rather than incarceration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearings, Roselli asserted that the tax loss was between $8,000 and $10,000. He offered several examples, though not an exhaustive list, of tax returns that he alleged should not have been included in the government's loss calculation. These examples amounted to an alleged overstatement of $52,525, bringing the tax loss down to no more than $48,999. Nevertheless, Roselli reiterated that he would accept the Government's recommendation of a total offense level of 13 so long as the court did not make a finding that the tax loss was $10,000 or more. The Government argued that the court must make a specific finding as to the tax loss and calculate the offense level based on that finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the sentencing hearing, Roselli's counsel explained that a tax loss finding could have harmful collateral consequences in a subsequent deportation proceeding. Although Roselli has lived in the United States for approximately 34 years, he is a citizen of the United Kingdom and may be subject to deportation if he is convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(2)is not specifically listed as an aggravated felony, but the definition of \"aggravated felony\" includes any offense that \"involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If the court made an explicit finding that the tax loss was greater than $10,000, such a finding might be preclusive in any subsequent deportation proceeding. <i>See, e.g., Hammer v.

Roselli would then be subject to deportation if the court found that a violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(2) fit the parameters outlined in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving supplemental briefs on the issue of the tax loss finding, the court declined to determine whether the tax loss was $101,524 as suggested by the Government, between $8,000 and $10,000 as suggested by Roselli, or somewhere between those two figures. The court reasoned that if it accepted Roselli's assertion that the tax loss was between $8,000 and $10,000, the resulting total offense level would be 10, corresponding to a guideline range of 6 to 12 months and a fine of between $2,000 and $20,000. If the court accepted the Government's contention that the tax loss was $101,524, the total offense level would be 13, corresponding to a guideline range of 12 to 18 months and a fine of $3,000 to $30,000. Thus, there was a point of overlap in guideline ranges that corresponded precisely with the Government's sentencing recommendation: 12 months of incarceration and a fine of $3,000 to $20,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court then stated its conclusion on the tax loss finding issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm confronted with, I think, a realistic prospect that the tax loss could be disputed. And the process of resolving that dispute would be not quite the equivalent of the trial itself, but would be a quite demanding claim upon the Court's resources. Here, I would have to, I think, hear from [a witness]. I'd have to examine a variety of different tax returns to determine the tax loss. And there seems to me to be no particular benefit to doing that when we're dealing with overlapping Guidelines. And, of course, it's particularly the case that the Government in its plea agreement has committed itself to making a recommendation at that point of overlap under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the appropriate Guidelines sentence corresponded to a point of overlap in the two guideline sentencing ranges suggested by the parties, the court ruled that a finding as to the exact amount of the tax loss would \"not affect sentencing\" and was therefore unnecessary. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The court made only the general finding that the tax loss was \"not less than $8,000.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then considered Roselli's request for a downward departure from the Guidelines sentence based on the harm that his incarceration would cause to his family. Because two of his four children suffer from cystic fibrosis (CF)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>, and because his wife suffers from several illnesses, Roselli argued that his family members would suffer extraordinary harm if he were incarcerated and unable to care for them. To support this contention, he submitted letters from a doctor, two nurses, and a social worker familiar with his children's condition and the integral role of parental care in battling CF. He also submitted letters from his wife, Kara, his wife's doctor, and his mother-in-law outlining their daily home life, Kara's illnesses, and the inability of other friends and relatives to adequately replace the services and care that Roselli provides to both his wife and children. The Government offered no evidence to rebut Roselli's description of the facts. Rather, it argued that the evidence offered by Roselli, even if true, did not meet the standard for a downward departure based on extraordinary family circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court disagreed, finding that Roselli was \"irreplaceable\" to his family. It granted a downward departure, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus, obviously, is on the family, not the offender. And it would understate to say that this family will be devastated in a way that is truly extraordinary.... The capacity for living that the children have depends upon, I think, Mr. Roselli's presence. It is exacerbated by the physical challenges that Mrs. Roselli faces. And I believe that, while discouraged, this ground of departure is meant to address this extraordinary family circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court stated that it would \"depart to a probationary sentence,\" but did not specify the extent of the departure, saying only that it would depart \"whether [the total offense level] is a 10 or 13.\" The court then sentenced Roselli to a three year term of probation, 12 months to be served in home confinement, a $20,000 fine, and a special assessment of $100.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government now appeals. It first argues that the district court was required to determine the tax loss amount and the related offense level. It then argues that the downward departure was unwarranted because Roselli failed to meet the standards necessary to justify a departure for family circumstances. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's conclusion that it was not required to determine the amount of tax loss and the related offense level. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Thus, if the district court settled on a sentence that happened to fall at the point of overlap in the two potential guideline ranges, it did not have to determine which offense level, and thus which guideline range, applied to Roselli.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to considering Roselli's request for a departure, the district court adopted the Government's position that the appropriate sentence under the Guidelines was 12 months incarceration and a $20,000 fine. The court did not explicitly reach this sentence prior to considering whether there was an overlap in the sentencing ranges indicated by a total offense level of 10 and a total offense level of 13. Nevertheless, both the Government and Roselli suggested to the court that 12 months was the appropriate sentence under the Guidelines. Thus, it appears that the court settled on that sentence because of the parties' mutual suggestion, not because it fell at a point of overlap in the two potential sentencing ranges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government nevertheless argues that the district court's refusal to make an exact tax loss finding was improperly motivated by the desire to prevent Roselli from facing deportation. <i>See United States v. Maung,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781026\"><a href=\"/opinion/781026/united-states-v-myat-maung/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span>, 1307-10 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that a district court may not depart solely to minimize the effects of a conviction on immigration proceedings). Although the record indicates that the court was aware of the potential collateral effects that a tax loss finding might have in a subsequent deportation proceeding, it explicitly stated that a tax loss finding would not affect its sentencing decision and would waste judicial resources with unnecessary and burdensome fact-finding. We reject the Government's challenge to the authenticity of the court's explanation. Moreover, the court was not required to spend its resources sorting through disputed facts merely because a tax loss finding might prove beneficial to the government in a subsequent deportation proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court had ended its analysis after refusing to make the tax loss finding, and had sentenced Roselli to 12 months imprisonment and a $20,000 fine, our analysis on appeal would be complete. However, the district court's subsequent decision to depart from the sentencing ranges indicated by the Guidelines poses a potential problem appropriately noted by the Government. Because the district court did not make a tax loss finding, and thus did not determine Roselli's exact offense level, it could not specify the degree of its departure. The Government contends that the court's failure to specify the degree of departure was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Government that, in most cases, a district court must determine the defendant's total offense level prior to departure so that it can specify the degree of departure. To determine the defendant's offense level, the district court must first undertake the largely mechanical process of applying the Guidelines to a variety of objective factors. In a tax fraud case, one of the objective factors necessary to determine the proper offense level will be the amount of tax loss. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2T4.1. The offense level contributes to the determination of a sentencing range, and a \"court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range, [indicated by the Guidelines] unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b). Thus, to carry out this analysis, a court must first determine the proper sentencing range under the Guidelines before it can determine whether that range is inappropriate because of factors the Commission did not adequately account for in establishing the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with the Government that the district court erred in failing to make a tax loss finding, we find that the error was harmless in this case. First, the error did not affect the sentence imposed by the district court. <i>See Williams v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 203, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court explicitly stated that it would impose the same sentence \"whether [the total offense level] is a 10 or 13,\" indicating its intention to depart to a probationary sentence regardless of the amount of the tax loss. There is no reason to remand the case so that the district court can make a factual determination that would have no effect on its sentencing decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the failure to make a tax loss finding did not affect the court's sentencing decision, it did prevent the court from specifying the offense level and the degree of its departure. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e)(3)(C), we are required to review whether the district court's \"sentence departs to an unreasonable degree from the applicable guidelines range.\" <i>See also United States v. Bogdan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200118\"><a href=\"/opinion/200118/united-states-v-bogdan/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that review of a district court's decision to depart from the Guidelines includes a review of the extent of that departure). Ordinarily, we cannot perform this appellate function if the district court does not specify the degree of departure. Requiring the court to determine the total offense level prior to a departure decision establishes a basis for the specification of a degree of departure. Thus, in most cases, the district court must make the findings necessary &#8212; including determining the offense level &#8212; to establish the degree of departure. <i>Cf. United States v. Roberson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521547\"><a href=\"/opinion/521547/united-states-v-eddie-wayne-roberson/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 608 (5th Cir.1989) (\"Whether the court incorrectly determined the recommended range is relevant to our review of a [departure because a] ... sentence that exceeds the Guidelines may look reasonable when compared to one recommended range, but unreasonable when compared to another.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case, however, presents an unusual circumstance because the sentence imposed allows us to determine what the total offense level and the maximum degree of departure must have been, and hence we can review the departure decision. After departing, the court sentenced Roselli to 12 months of probation served under a condition of home detention. Combined with Roselli's criminal history category of I, an offense level of 10 indicates a sentencing range of 6-12 months of imprisonment, which falls with Zone B of the sentencing table. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.1(c)(3), if the sentencing range falls within Zone B the court may order the defendant to serve the required term as probation with a condition of home detention rather than as a term of imprisonment. Thus, Roselli's sentence after departure is consistent with the maximum term allowed by an offense level of 10, served as probation with a condition of home detention pursuant to &#167; 5C1.1(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roselli's sentence after departure is not consistent with an offense level of less than 10. An offense level of 9 indicates a sentencing range of only 4-10 months. Offense levels of less than 9 carry a maximum term of six months. Thus, Roselli's sentence of 12 months of home detention exceeds the sentencing guideline range authorized by any offense level below 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Roselli's sentence after departure is not consistent with an offense level of greater than 10. The sentencing ranges indicated by offense levels of 11 or 12 fall into Zone C. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.1(d), a defendant whose offense level places him in Zone C must serve at least half of his term in prison.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Sentencing ranges indicated by offense levels of 13 or greater fall into Zone D. Defendants in Zone D, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.1(f), must serve their entire term in prison. Roselli's sentence of 12 months of probation with the condition of home detention would not be available under any offense level that indicated a sentencing range in Zone C or D.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court imposed a sentence that is consistent <i>only</i> with an offense level of 10. We can therefore narrow our inquiry regarding the degree of departure. If the district court had decided the tax loss question, and had agreed with the Government's contention that the tax loss was equal to $101,524, it would have applied to Roselli a total offense level of 13. The Government did not argue, and there is no evidence in the record to suggest, that the tax loss was greater than $101,524. Therefore, the maximum offense level that the district court could have applied to Roselli was 13. Because the court departed to a sentence that is consistent only with an offense level of 10, the maximum level of departure in this case was three levels, from an offense level of 13 to an offense level of 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government correctly points out that, if the district court had made a finding as to the tax loss, it might have found that the correct tax loss figure was somewhere between $10,000 and $101,524. Thus, the court might have determined that the correct total offense level was 11 or 12, necessitating a departure of only 1 or 2 levels to achieve an offense level of 10. Indeed, if the district court had agreed with Roselli's contention that the tax loss was less than $10,000, it could have sentenced Roselli in accordance with an offense level of 10 without making any departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under different circumstances, this uncertainty about the level of departure might prevent us from properly reviewing the extent of the departure and require us to remand the case to the district court. In this case, however, the district court imposed a sentence that is consistent only with an offense level of 10. We can therefore determine that the maximum degree of departure is three levels. Obviously, if the record justifies a three level downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances, it would also justify a lesser departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Therefore, we turn to the merits of the departure for extraordinary family circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We apply a three part analysis to review of departures: \"(1) we determine whether the stated ground for departure is theoretically permissible under the guidelines; (2) if so, we examine the record to assess whether there is adequate factual support; and (3) we determine the appropriateness of the degree of departure.\" <i>Bogdan,</i> 302 F.3d at 16.

This standard requires the district court to determine whether \"there are <i>feasible</i> alternatives of care that are relatively comparable to what the defendant provides.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Thus, a downward departure is appropriate if the defendant's role \"is so different in kind or degree from the many kinds of support that can be important in the [family] relationship that it makes the family ties and responsibilities factor... exceptional.\" <i>Louis,</i> 300 F.3d at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents an exceptional situation. Roselli has four children, each of whom is under the age of 10. Two of the children &#8212; Antonio, age 9, and Adyn, age 1 &#8212; suffer from CF. Caring for Antonio and Adyn requires extensive time and effort by both Roselli and his wife, Kara. Antonio must visit his pulmonary doctor at least six times per year and has been hospitalized three times in the past four years. After each hospitalization, Antonio's parents must administer intravenous antibiotics three times a day &#8212; with each session lasting approximately one hour &#8212; for three weeks. Antonio requires a special diet which must be prepared separately from the other children's meals. Each morning and evening, Antonio must undergo 30 minutes of closely monitored treatment to combat bacteria that causes deterioration of the lungs. The parents also administer several other prescription medications each morning, taking approximately 20 minutes, and monitor Antonio's chest therapy for 30 to 40 minutes each evening. Finally, Roselli helps Antonio with his studies and ensures that he maintains the level of physical activity prescribed by his doctors by jogging with him, coaching his baseball and football teams, and transporting him to gymnastics and soccer practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caring for Adyn requires even more attention and effort. In addition to CF, Adyn suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which makes it extremely difficult for him to consume and digest food. Doctors have installed a feeding tube to ensure that he gets the nourishment he needs to battle his CF. Roselli and his wife give Adyn three meals a day via \"bolus feeding,\" a process whereby Adyn receives formula through a test-tube like apparatus attached to his feeding tube. This process requires both parents: Kara conducts the feeding while Roselli holds Adyn upright to minimize the chance of vomiting or choking. Each feeding lasts approximately 45 minutes, requiring significant strength and endurance to keep Adyn in an upright position. Roselli has developed a work schedule that allows him to be home during the morning and to be present for most of Adyn's bolus feedings. At night, Adyn's feeding tube is attached to a food pump, which provides both nourishment and most of his medication, for eight to ten hours. Because Adyn must tolerate this method of feeding while lying on his back, Roselli and his wife must check the feeding tube intermittently throughout the night to ensure that Adyn does not choke or vomit. Both parents are trained to reinsert the feeding tube if it should accidentally be dislodged. If the tube is not reinserted within an hour after coming loose, Adyn would require surgery. Roselli also administers several medications to Adyn each morning and cleans his feeding tube daily to prevent infections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparable alternatives to Roselli's care are, for practical purposes, nonexistent. Kara cannot care for the children herself, largely because of her own health problems. She suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes pain in the soft tissue and joints throughout her body. The effects can be so debilitating that they prevent her from completing simple physical tasks. Other symptoms of her condition include severe fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, numbness in her hands and feet, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling overwhelmed when faced with multiple tasks. She also suffers from chronic migraine headaches, for which she has sought emergency room treatment on several occasions. Finally, Kara has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. She takes a variety of medications to control each of these illnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roselli's relatives are unable to provide adequate assistance. Kara's mother lives more than one hour away and cares for two terminally ill sons, as well as her husband who suffers from prostate cancer. Roselli's mother is 74 years old and has difficulty walking because of her arthritis. Roselli's sister is the only other family member who lives in Massachusetts, and she cares for three children of her own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In-home health care also does not provide a viable alternative to Roselli's presence. To replace the care that Roselli provides, the family would have to hire a nurse &#8212; or likely several nurses working in shifts &#8212; on a 24 hour-a-day, seven days-a-week basis. They would have to be trained to provide the special care that Adyn requires, including bolus feeding and the overnight feeding system. Even in the event that such care were available and not prohibitively expensive, it would not fulfill Roselli's role in Antonio's exercise regimen and schoolwork.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, emotional support is an important factor under these circumstances. The letter from CF specialist Dr. Dorkin states that \"[h]aving one child with CF can be overwhelming for many families. To have two such children can be devastating.... Only the ability to have [Mr. Roselli] share in the care of the children has kept the children out of the hospital.\" He further states that removal of their father from the home \"will contribute to a more rapid course in [the children's] deterioration.\" A letter from Kara's doctor states that \"I have no doubt that if [Roselli] is removed from the home and Kara is left with sole responsibility for caring for her children, Kara's stress and activity levels would be substantially increased, in turn leading to an overall decline in her own health as well as her ability to care for her children.\" While doubtless the incarceration of a parent can in many ordinary cases have an unfortunate emotional effect on other family members, this case is exceptional in that, besides the emotional impact upon remaining family members, the removal of Roselli's critical services from his home will impact severely upon the physical well-being and even the ability to survive of those left behind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Rivera,</i> we wrote that \"at some point, the nature and magnitude of family responsibilities (many children? with handicaps? no money? no place for children to go?) may transform the `ordinary' case ... into a case that is not at all ordinary.\" 994 F.2d at 948. Roselli's family circumstances move this case well outside the ordinary range. Under these circumstances, where two children require specialized round-the-clock care because of CF, where adequate help is not readily available, and where the other parent is battling her own debilitating health problems, a three level downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances is entirely appropriate. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to oral argument, the district court granted appellee's motion to supplement the appellate record with the probation officer's confidential sentencing recommendation.

The basic defect in cystic fibrosis leads to abnormalities in several organ systems of the body, most importantly the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. [CF patients] develop persistent and chronic lung infections as well as obstruction of the airways with thick, tenacious secretions. The effect on the lungs over time is to develop respiratory insufficiency, leading to eventual respiratory failure and death. In a similar fashion, the thickened secretions obstruct the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrition and leading in some cases to growth failure.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5B1.2(a)(1), a term of probation shall be \"at least one year but not more than five years if the offense level is 6 or greater.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The other half of the term may be served as supervised release with a condition of home detention or community confinement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding the possible immigration consequences of certain tax loss findings, Roselli was arguably disadvantaged in this proceeding by the court's refusal to make a loss finding.

As the court proceeded, however, Roselli was forced to argue for a rare and discouraged form of departure from the Guidelines</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Contrary to the Government's assertion, our decision does not conflict with<i>United States v.

In <i>Carrozza,</i> there was no point of overlap between the two possible sentencing ranges. Rather than determine which offense level, and therefore which sentencing range, was correct, the district court settled on a sentence between the two ranges. Thus, on appeal, we could not determine whether the court had departed upward or downward to reach the sentence it imposed. In this case, the district court determined that the proper sentence under the Guidelines was at a point of overlap in the two possible sentencing ranges, and we can determine that the maximum degree of downward departure was three levels. Thus, unlike <i>Carrozza,</i> we are able to adequately review the degree of departure.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
