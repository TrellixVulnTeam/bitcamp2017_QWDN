DEWITT,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                           A.T. WALL,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n          [Hon. Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n          [Hon. Jacob Hagopian, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Fred E. DeWitt on brief pro se.\n     Patricia A. Coyne-Fague on motion for summary affirmance for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 21, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam. Pro se appellant Fred DeWitt, who is an\n\ninmate at the Adult Correctional Institution in Rhode Island,\n\nappeals   from      the    grant   of   summary    judgment   in   favor   of\n\nappellee,    A.T.     Wall,    the      Director   of   the   Rhode   Island\n\nDepartment of Corrections (\"RIDOC\").               In his suit under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, DeWitt sought monetary and injunctive relief\n\nrelative to a new prison policy banning visits by certain\n\nformer correctional employees.                Under the policy, DeWitt's\n\nwife, Pamela, was unable to visit him, but she had alternative\n\nmeans of communicating with him since she could write to him\n\nand speak with him on the telephone.               On appeal, DeWitt has\n\nasserted various claims of error, but we find none of them to\n\nbe persuasive.        Therefore, we affirm, essentially for the\n\nreasons     given     in     the     magistrate     judge's    report      and\n\nrecommendation dated July 31, 2001, which the district court\n\naccepted as the basis for its September 6, 2001 order granting\n\nsummary judgment.         We make only the following comments.\n\n                    First, the case law confirms that the district\n\ncourt properly concluded that a policy like the one at issue\n\nhere is rationally connected to legitimate concerns about\n\nprison security.          See Caraballo-Sandoval v. Honsted, 35 F.3d\n\n521, 525 (11th Cir. 1994) (affirming summary judgment on claim\n\nchallenging ban on visits by former prison employee whom\nplaintiff later married because prison officials were concerned\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fthat former employee might pass on knowledge of security\n\nprocedures); Blair v. Loomis, 1 F. Supp. 2d 769, 771-72 (N.D.\n\nOhio 1998) (denying motions for temporary restraining order and\npreliminary injunction relative to ban on visits by wife, a\n\nformer    correctional   employee,    pursuant     to   policy   that\n\ndiscouraged visits by former employees or persons lacking a\npre-incarceration   relationship     with   the   inmate);   Welz   v.\n\nDegregorio, 646 F. Supp. 522, 523 (E.D. Pa. 1986) (denying\n\nmotion for temporary restraining order relative to ban on\n\ncontact visits by former correctional officer, who had resigned\n\nduring investigation into her fraternization with plaintiff,\n\nwhere the warden had expressed security concerns); State ex\n\nrel. Manson v. Morris, 66 Ohio St. 3d 440, 442, 613 N.E.2d 232,\n234 (1993) (denying petition for writ of mandamus relative to\n\ndenial of visits by girlfriend, who was former correctional\n\nofficer, since defendants could reasonably view her as \"a\nsecurity risk based on her training in security procedures and\n\nknowledge of facility operations\").\n\n                Second, DeWitt claims that the policy, even if\n\nseemingly neutral, actually targets his wife, or is being\n\napplied vindictively.     However, he has not pointed to any\n\nevidence of record that would impugn Director Wall's assertion\n\nthat security concerns motivated the policy, and, on the\n\nundisputed facts of record, the policy applies to Pamela\n\nDeWitt.   Contrary to DeWitt's claim, the June 20, 2000 letter\n\nby Wall to Pamela -- stating that he had referred her request\n\n\n                               -3-\n\ffor visiting privileges to a warden -- does not show that Wall\n\ndid not think that her status as a former correctional officer\n\nmade her a security risk.      There is no evidence that Wall, who\nassumed his present position well after Pamela (then surnamed\n\n\"Manson\") had resigned her employment, knew that the \"Mrs.\n\nPamela DeWitt\" to whom he wrote was a former corrections\nofficer.    Nor does it matter whether Pamela previously had\n\nvisited DeWitt \"without incident,\" as DeWitt says, because Wall\n\ncould act preemptively to prevent breaches of security.                Casey\n\nv. Lewis, 4 F.3d 1516, 1521 (9th Cir. 1993) (sustaining ban on\n\nattorney-inmate contact visits, which was based on desire to\n\nprevent assaults, escapes, and hostage-taking, despite fact\n\nthat defendant had not pointed to prior problems arising out of\nsuch visits).\n\n                  Finally, it may be that former correctional\n\nemployees who are presently incarcerated have visitors, as\nDeWitt claims in unsworn statements.            Nonetheless, that fact\n\ndoes not establish an equal protection violation because DeWitt\n\nis not similarly situated.           He is not a former correctional\n\nemployee who is incarcerated, but an inmate whose spouse is an\n\nunincarcerated former correctional employee, meeting specified\n\ncriteria,   who   seeks   to   visit     him.      The    present      policy\n\nreasonably addresses the security risks posed by the latter\n\nsituation. There is no equal protection violation. See United\n\nStates v.   Bernal-Rojas,      933    F.2d   97,   99    (1st   Cir.   1991)\n\n(indicating that a prima facie equal protection claim would be\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fmade out if the plaintiff were to show that the government had\n\ntreated   similarly   situated   persons   differently);   see   also\n\nCasey, 4 F.3d at 1521 (indicating that the appropriate inquiry\nis whether a prison visitation regulation has a rational\n\nconnection to a legitimate penological goal, not whether the\n\ngoal would be better served by a more comprehensive ban on\nvisitation).\n\n                 We summarily affirm the judgment below.          See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
