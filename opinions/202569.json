Under Massachusetts domestic relations\n\nlaw, a married couple may obtain the benefits of a \"no fault\"\n\ndivorce   by    averring     that   \"an    irretrievable   breakdown   of   the\n\nmarriage exists\" and persuading a probate court judge to approve a\n\nnotarized separation agreement setting forth the terms on which the\n\nmarriage is to be dissolved.          Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 1A.        In\n\nsuch circumstances, the separation agreement \"shall either be\n\nincorporated and merged into [the divorce judgment] or by agreement\n\nof the parties, it shall be incorporated and not merged, but shall\n\nsurvive and remain as an independent contract.\"                 Id.    If the\n\nagreement is incorporated but not merged, it remains binding on the\n\nparties and may serve as the basis for a legal action to enforce\n\nits terms -- e.g., a claim for unpaid alimony -- which may be\n\nbrought separate and apart from any contempt motion filed in the\n\ndivorce case.      See, e.g., Mansur v. Clark, 521 N.E.2d 759, 761\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1988) (collecting cases).\n\n     In this case, plaintiff John Daniel Mooney, a Massachusetts\n\nresident,      brought   a   diversity      action   seeking   rescission   or\n\ncancellation of the separation agreement dated April 1, 1999, and\n\nin effect between himself and his former wife, Deborah A. Mooney,\n\nnow a Maine resident.         The agreement, which requires John to pay\n\nDeborah $650 per week in alimony, was incorporated, but not merged,\n\ninto a no fault judgment of \"divorce nisi\" entered in favor of the\n\ncouple in the Massachusetts Probate Court on June 1, 1999, which by\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\foperation of law became a judgment of \"divorce absolute\" ninety\n\ndays later.          See Mass. Gen. L. Ann. c. 208, § 21.                    The divorce\n\njudgment also requires John to pay Deborah $650 per week in\n\nalimony.       John says that the agreement was procured by duress,\n\ncoercion, and undue influence, and that he did not enter into it of\n\nsound mind.\n\n       Shortly after this action was filed, Deborah filed a contempt\n\nclaim     within      the     divorce     action,       to   which     John    filed     a\n\ncounterclaim.           Originally,       the     counterclaim        made     the    same\n\nallegations challenging the validity of the separation agreement\n\nthat    are    set    forth    in   the   federal    complaint.         Subsequently,\n\nhowever,       John   filed    an   amended      counterclaim        which    omits    the\n\nallegations challenging the validity of the separation agreement\n\nand asks only that, because of changed circumstances, the no fault\n\ndivorce judgment be modified so as to discharge John's alimony\n\nobligations.          Citing the pendency of the probate court action,\n\nDeborah       moved   the     district    court    to    abstain     from     exercising\n\njurisdiction over this case.              The court granted the motion, citing\n\na 1986 decision in which we endorsed abstaining from diversity\n\nclaims \"that are closely related to, though not within,\" what we\n\ndescribed as a \"jurisdictional exception\" to the diversity statute,\n\n28   U.S.C.     §     1332,    encompassing       \"domestic    relations        issues.\"\n\nGonzalez Canevero v. Rexach, 793 F.2d 417, 418 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). John appeals the\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fabstention order, arguing that Rexach has been abrogated by recent\n\nSupreme Court cases emphasizing the narrowness of the domestic\n\nrelations exception.\n\n      John is on solid ground in questioning the continuing vitality\n\nof Rexach. In Ankenbrandt v. Richards, the Supreme Court clarified\n\nthat the domestic relations exception \"encompasses only                  cases\n\ninvolving the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child custody\n\ndecree.\"    504 U.S. 689, 704 (1992).     And more recently, in Marshall\n\nv. Marshall, the Court emphasized, once again, that abstention is\n\nnot   appropriate    when   a   claim,   though    related    to   a   domestic\n\nrelations issue, does not itself challenge a divorce, alimony, or\n\nchild custody decree.       See 126 S. Ct. 1735, 1744-46 (2006).            In\n\nlight of Ankenbrandt and Marshall, abstention is not warranted\n\nsimply because a claim that is \"not within\" the domestic relation\n\nexception    is,    nonetheless,   \"closely       related    to\"   a   domestic\n\nrelations matter.     (We say \"simply\" because, as Ankenbrandt itself\n\nrecognized, there may well be other grounds for abstaining -- e.g.,\n\nthose articulated in Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943) --\n\nin such circumstances.      See 504 U.S. 704-06 & n.8.)\n\n      Even so, the district court properly dismissed this lawsuit.\n\nSee In re Miles, 436 F.3d 291, 293-94 (1st Cir. 2006) (appellate\n\ncourt can affirm on any ground within its power supported by the\n\nrecord).    In a case overlooked by the parties, the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court held that, notwithstanding the availability\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fof a separate cause of action to enforce a separation agreement\n\nincorporated but not merged into a divorce decree, an independent\n\naction seeking rescission of such an agreement does not lie where\n\nthe party seeking rescission also is challenging the validity of\n\nthe divorce decree.        See Saltmarsh v. Saltmarsh, 480 N.E.2d 618,\n\n620-22 (Mass. 1985).         In the SJC's view, a separate rescission\n\naction in such circumstances is \"unnecessary and inappropriate\"\n\nbecause    there     is    \"an   adequate      remedy   within    the    divorce\n\nproceeding.\" Id. at 620-21. A successful challenge to the divorce\n\ndecree    would     have   the   effect   of    nullifying      the    separation\n\nagreement,    the    validity    and   approval    of   which    are    necessary\n\npredicates to the couple receiving the benefits of a no fault\n\ndivorce.     See id. at 621; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 1A.                 Thus,\n\ninsofar as John's counterclaim might be read to challenge the\n\nvalidity of the divorce decree, he is barred by Saltmarsh from\n\npressing his federal claim.\n\n     There is an obvious rejoinder to this line of analysis.                 John\n\ntells us that he is not challenging the validity of the divorce\n\ndecree, and that he has amended his counterclaim in the divorce\n\nproceeding to ask only for its \"modification.\"            Compare Saltmarsh,\n\n480 N.E.2d at 622 (making clear that the party seeking rescission\n\nalleged that she would not have agreed to a no-fault divorce had\n\nshe known the facts grounding her request for rescission).                   And\n\nSaltmarsh does not necessarily stand for the proposition that an\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\findependent action for rescission of a separation agreement is\n\nbarred because the same relief could be obtained in a successful\n\nattack upon the divorce decree.\n\n      But John cannot have it both ways.              John was entitled to the\n\nbenefits of a no fault divorce only because he persuaded the\n\nprobate court to find that he had reached a valid and appropriate\n\nseparation agreement with Deborah.            See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, §\n\n1A.   If he wishes to continue to benefit from that judgment while\n\nseeking a favorable modification of its terms due to changed\n\ncircumstances, equity requires that he be taken to be continuing to\n\nrepresent to the probate court that the judgment's essential\n\npreconditions were met.            Otherwise, the judgment ought to be\n\nvacated, not modified.        Cf. Scholz v. Scholz, 324 N.E.2d 617, 618\n\n(Mass. 1975) (noting that a divorce absolute may be set aside in\n\nthe event of fraud or mistake).               And if John is affirmatively\n\n(albeit implicitly) representing in the divorce proceeding that the\n\nseparation agreement remains valid, he should not be permitted to\n\nobtain equitable relief on the basis of a contrary position taken\n\nin this action.      See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749-51\n\n(2001);    18    Charles   Alan    Wright    et   al.,    Federal    Practice    and\n\nProcedure § 4477, 608-14 (2d ed. West 2002).\n\n      In   the     end,    then,    John     cannot      obtain     rescission    or\n\ncancellation of the separation agreement in this action.                         This\n\ndisposition obviates the need for consideration whether, as Deborah\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fargues in support of alternative grounds for affirmance, there\n\nexist in this case other grounds for abstention.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Clark,</i> 25 Mass.App. Ct. 618, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2213204\"><a href=\"/opinion/2213204/mansur-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span>, 761 (1988) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, plaintiff John Daniel Mooney, a Massachusetts resident, brought a diversity action seeking rescission or cancellation of the separation agreement dated April 1, 1999, and in effect between himself and his former wife, Deborah A. Mooney, now a Maine resident. The agreement, which requires John to pay Deborah $650 per week in alimony, was incorporated, but not merged, into a no fault judgment of \"divorce nisi\" entered in favor of the couple in the Massachusetts Probate Court on June 1, 1999, which by operation of law became a judgment of \"divorce absolute\" ninety days later. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. L. Ann. c. 208, &#167; 21. The divorce judgment also requires John to pay Deborah $650 per week in alimony. John says that the agreement was procured by duress, coercion, and undue influence, and that he did not enter into it of sound mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after this action was filed, Deborah filed a contempt claim within the divorce action, to which John filed a counterclaim. Originally, the counterclaim made the same allegations challenging the validity of the separation agreement that are set forth in the federal complaint. Subsequently, however, John filed an amended counterclaim which omits the allegations challenging the validity of the separation agreement and asks only that, because of changed circumstances, the no fault divorce judgment be modified so as to discharge John's alimony obligations. Citing the pendency of the probate court action, Deborah moved the district court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this case. The court granted the motion, citing a 1986 decision in which we endorsed abstaining from diversity claims \"that are closely related to, though not within,\" what we described as a \"jurisdictional exception\" to the diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, encompassing \"domestic relations issues.\" <i>Gonzalez Canevero v. Rexach,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471759\"><a href=\"/opinion/471759/hannah-gonzalez-canevero-v-richard-rexach-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 418 (1st Cir.1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). John appeals the abstention order, arguing that <i>Rexach</i> has been abrogated by recent Supreme Court cases emphasizing the narrowness of the domestic relations exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John is on solid ground in questioning the continuing vitality of <i>Rexach.</i> In <i>Ankenbrandt v. Richards,</i> the Supreme Court clarified that the domestic relations exception \"encompasses only cases involving the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112752\"><a href=\"/opinion/112752/ankenbrandt-v-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 704, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112752\"><a href=\"/opinion/112752/ankenbrandt-v-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span> (1992). And more recently, in <i>Marshall v. Marshall,</i> the Court emphasized, once again, that abstention is not appropriate when a claim, though related to a domestic relations issue, does not itself challenge a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree. <i>See</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___-___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145660\"><a href=\"/opinion/145660/marshall-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span> (2006). In light of <i>Ankenbrandt</i> and <i>Marshall,</i> abstention is not warranted <i>simply</i> because a claim that is \"not within\" the domestic relation exception is, nonetheless, \"closely related to\" a domestic relations matter. (We say \"simply\" because, as <i>Ankenbrandt</i> itself recognized, there may well be <i>other</i> grounds for abstaining-e.g., those articulated in <i>Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103842\"><a href=\"/opinion/103842/burford-v-sun-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2206</span></a></span>.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, the district court properly dismissed this lawsuit. <i>See In re Miles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202049\"><a href=\"/opinion/202049/miles-v-beneficial/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 293-94 (1st Cir.2006) (appellate court can affirm on any ground within its power supported by the record). In a case overlooked by the parties, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that, notwithstanding the availability of a separate cause of action to <i>enforce</i> a separation agreement incorporated but not merged into a divorce decree, an independent action seeking <i>rescission</i> of such an agreement does not lie where the party seeking rescission also is challenging the validity of the divorce decree. <i>See Saltmarsh v. Saltmarsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146818/saltmarsh-v-saltmarsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146818/saltmarsh-v-saltmarsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 620-22 (1985). In the SJC's view, a separate rescission action in such circumstances is \"unnecessary and inappropriate\" because there is \"an adequate remedy within the divorce proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 620-21. A successful challenge to the divorce decree would have the effect of nullifying the separation agreement, the validity and approval of which are necessary predicates to the couple receiving the benefits of a no fault divorce. <i>See id.</i> at 621; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, &#167; 1A. Thus, insofar as John's counterclaim might be read to challenge the validity of the divorce decree, he is barred by <i>Saltmarsh</i> from pressing his federal claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an obvious rejoinder to this line of analysis. John tells us that he is <i>not</i> challenging the validity of the divorce decree, and that he has amended his counterclaim in the divorce proceeding to ask only for its \"modification.\" <i>Compare Saltmarsh,</i> 480 N.E.2d at 622 (making clear that the party seeking rescission alleged that she would not have agreed to a no-fault divorce had she known the facts grounding her request for rescission). And <i>Saltmarsh</i> does not necessarily stand for the proposition that an independent action for rescission of a separation agreement is barred because the same relief <i>could be</i> obtained in a successful attack upon the divorce decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But John cannot have it both ways. John was entitled to the benefits of a no fault divorce only because he persuaded the probate court to find that he had reached a valid and appropriate separation agreement with Deborah. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, &#167; 1A. If he wishes to continue to benefit from that judgment while seeking a favorable modification of its terms due to changed circumstances, equity requires that he be taken to be continuing to represent to the probate court that the judgment's essential preconditions were met. Otherwise, the judgment ought to be vacated, not modified. <i>Cf. Scholz v. Scholz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2015876\"><a href=\"/opinion/2015876/scholz-v-scholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2015876\"><a href=\"/opinion/2015876/scholz-v-scholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 618 (1975) (noting that a divorce absolute may be set aside in the event of fraud or mistake). And if John is affirmatively (albeit implicitly) representing in the divorce proceeding that the separation agreement remains valid, he should not be permitted to obtain equitable relief on the basis of a contrary position taken in this action. <i>See New Hampshire v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118435\"><a href=\"/opinion/118435/new-hampshire-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 749-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118435\"><a href=\"/opinion/118435/new-hampshire-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

West 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, then, John cannot obtain rescission or cancellation of the separation agreement in this action. This disposition obviates the need for consideration whether, as Deborah argues in support of alternative grounds for affirmance, there exist in this case other grounds for abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
