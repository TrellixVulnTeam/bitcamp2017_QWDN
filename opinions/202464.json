Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n               and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Kimberly Homan for appellant.\n     John T. McNeil, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                            October 20, 2006\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      Of the    Northern     District   of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            BOUDIN,   Chief   Judge.     On   March   31,   2002,     Deepak\n\nJahagirdar was seated next to D.S., a 22-year-old woman, on a\n\ncommercial airline flight from Dallas to Boston.                D.S. later\n\ntestified that she awoke from a nap to find Jahagirdar's hand\n\ninside her underpants.    D.S. cursed at Jahagirdar, pushed her way\n\nto the aisle, and immediately told a flight attendant that \"[t]he\n\nguy next to me had his hand down my pants.\"\n\n            Upon landing, Jahagirdar was arrested. D.S. was asked to\n\nremain onboard the airplane after the other passengers had exited,\n\nand was interviewed by Massachusetts State Trooper Kevin Hogaboom.\n\nAfter disembarking, D.S. was interviewed again and made a written\n\nstatement.     D.S. was then taken to the hospital for a                rape\n\nexamination.\n\n            A grand jury indicted Jahagirdar on February 11, 2004,\n\ncharging him (so far as is relevant to this case) with sexual abuse\n\nand attempted sexual abuse, 18 U.S.C. § 2242(2) (2000), within the\n\nspecial aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, 49 U.S.C.\n\n§   46506   (2000).     Sexual   abuse   includes,    subject    to   other\n\nconditions,1 \"the penetration, however slight, of the . . . genital\n\nopening of another by a hand or finger or by any object.\"                 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2246(2)(C).\n\n\n\n      1\n      The statute requires, in pertinent part, that the penetration\nbe done with requisite intent and to someone incapable of consent.\n§ 2242(2). That these conditions were satisfied in this case is\nnot contested.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f             At trial,    D.S. testified that Jahagirdar's fingers were\n\n\"underneath the lip area of the vagina\" and that his fingers were\n\n\"[u]nderneath the outer lips [labia majora] and the inner lips\n\n[labia minora]\" of her genitals; and she made corresponding marks\n\non an anatomical diagram to illustrate her testimony.\n\n             On   cross-examination      of   D.S.,   Jahagirdar   sought   to\n\nimpeach her by suggesting that she had not told the doctor or nurse\n\nat the hospital that she had been penetrated, and that she had in\n\nfact denied having been penetrated when asked by the doctor.\n\nJahagirdar also implied that she had settled on her description of\n\nthe alleged assault after consulting a lawyer and after concluding\n\nthat Jahagirdar was an attractive target for a civil suit.\n\n             The government was then allowed to offer evidence from\n\nthe trooper who had interviewed D.S. at the scene.               He testified\n\nthat, when he asked D.S. whether she had been penetrated, she\n\nstated that she had been, and that, on the basis of her response,\n\nhe recommended that Jahagirdar be charged with rape.\n\n             There was also testimony from flight attendants and\n\nsecret service agents who were on board the plane as to D.S.'s\n\nvisible emotional distress, and expert testimony that a large\n\nquantity of D.S.'s DNA was found on Jahagirdar's hands, consistent\n\nwith   his   fingers     having   come   into   contact   with   her   vaginal\n\nsecretions.       However, the expert agreed that it was also possible\n\nthat Jahagirdar could have picked up skin cells from the waistband\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fof D.S.'s pants, so this forensic evidence did not incontrovertibly\n\nestablish just where Jahagirdar had placed his hand.\n\n           Jahagirdar testified in his own defense.               He admitted\n\nthat he had placed his hand in D.S.'s pants, but claimed that D.S.\n\nhad begun and encouraged a sexual encounter, that his hand touched\n\nonly her \"pubic hair area,\" and that he withdrew his hand when he\n\nbegan to feel guilty about betraying his wife's trust.\n\n           The jury convicted Jahagirdar of sexual abuse.                       The\n\ndistrict judge sentenced Jahagirdar to 87 months' imprisonment, a\n\nterm of supervised release, and a $25,000 fine.                 Jahagirdar now\n\nappeals, challenging the critical jury instruction as to the scope\n\nof the statute, the admission of D.S.'s statements to the trooper,\n\nand certain of the district court's sentencing determinations.\n\n           Jahagirdar's     first   argument      on   appeal    is   that      the\n\ndistrict court erroneously instructed the jury as to an element of\n\nthe   offense.    Section   2242(2)      criminalizes    \"knowingly       .    .   .\n\nengag[ing] in a sexual act with another person if that other person\n\nis . . . physically incapable of declining participation in, or\n\ncommunicating    unwillingness      to   engage   in,   that     sexual       act.\"\n\nSection 2246(2) in turn defines \"sexual act\" (we underscore the\n\nmost pertinent language) as\n\n       (A) contact between the penis and the vulva or the\n       penis and the anus, and for purposes of this\n       subparagraph contact involving the penis occurs upon\n       penetration, however slight;\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f       (B) contact between the mouth and the penis, the mouth\n       and the vulva, or the mouth and the anus;\n\n       (C) the penetration, however slight, of the anal or\n       genital opening of another by a hand or finger or by\n       any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate,\n       harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual\n       desire of any person; or\n\n       (D) the intentional touching, not through the\n       clothing, of the genitalia of another person who has\n       not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to\n       abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or\n       gratify the sexual desire of any person (emphasis\n       added).\n\n             Jahagirdar requested that the court instruct the jury\n\nthat   \"penetration    of   the   .   .   .    genital   opening\"   in    section\n\n2246(2)(C) refers to the penetration of the \"vaginal orifice.\" The\n\ngovernment requested an instruction stating that \"genital opening\n\n. . . includes not only the vagina itself, but also the anterior\n\nparts known as the vulva and labia,\" so that \"penetration of the\n\nlabia majora, or outer lips, of the vulva is sufficient\" to find\n\nJahagirdar guilty of violating section 2242.\n\n             The district court chose a middle ground, instructing the\n\njury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Jahagirdar \"placed his finger or hand beyond Ms. DS's labia\n\nmajora to at least the labia minora or inner lips . . . . The\n\ngovernment is not required to prove that he penetrated her vaginal\n\nor[i]fice.\"    Jahagirdar objected.           On appeal, Jahagirdar continues\n\nto   press   his   argument   that    \"genital      opening\"   means     \"vaginal\n\norifice.\"\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f             The term \"genital opening\" is not itself a medical term\n\nof art. The term \"genitalia\" refers to the \"external and internal\"\n\norgans of reproduction, Stedman's Medical Dictionary 738 (27th ed.\n\n2000),   but   \"esp[ecially]    the    external          organs,\"    Random    House\n\nDictionary 797 (2d ed. unabridged).                 For women, the \"external\n\ngenitalia\" include the mons pubis, the labia majora, the labia\n\nminora, the clitoris, and the vaginal orifice. Gray's Anatomy 1876\n\n(38th ed. 1995).     \"The term . . . vulva includes all these parts.\"\n\nId.\n\n             Taken   by   itself,   the     term    \"genital       opening\"    could\n\nconceivable refer to any of at least three successive openings in\n\nthe female genitalia: (1) the exterior opening bounded by the outer\n\nlips or labia majora, (2) the interior opening bounded by the\n\ncontained inner lips or labia minora, and (3) the opening, yet\n\nfurther along the same channel, called the vaginal orifice.\n\n             The most straightforward reading of \"genital opening\" is\n\nthat   the   term    encompasses    all     three       orifices    including   the\n\noutermost--a     reading    given   support        by    the   statutory      phrase\n\n\"penetration, however slight.\"        Nor is it clear why Congress would\n\nhave sought to distinguish among them, treating more leniently the\n\ndeliberate insertion of a finger into the outermost orifice--given\n\nthat the perpetrator must be acting without consent and for the\n\nmostly malign purposes described in the statute.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          The literal reading becomes almost conclusive when one\n\ncomes to understand that, under state law, the definition of\n\n\"rape\"--whether penile rape or the variant digital rape with which\n\nJahagirdar was charged--is almost always satisfied under state law\n\nby penetration of the labia majora, regardless of whether the\n\nstatute refers to the \"genital opening\" (as some do), the \"female\n\nsex organ\" (as others do), or even (in a few cases) the \"vagina.\"2\n\n\n\n     2\n      Several state courts have specifically held, in the context\nof digital or object rape, that penetration of the \"genital\nopening\" is satisfied by penetration of the vulva or labia. See\nPeople v. Quintana, 89 Cal. App. 4th 1362, 1366-71 (2001); State v.\nAlbert, 750 A.2d 1037, 1044-46 (Conn. 2000); People v. Bristol, 320\nN.W.2d 229, 230 (Mich. Ct. App. 1982) (per curiam); State v.\nBellamy, 617 S.E.2d 81, 88 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005).       The general\npattern of requiring only penetration of the labia majora existed\nwell before Congress adopted the present statutory scheme in 1986.\nSee, e.g., Thomas v. State, 298 So. 2d 652, 656 (Ala. Crim. App.\n1974); State v. Pollock, 114 P.2d 249, 250 (Ariz. 1941); Hice v.\nState, 593 S.W.2d 169, 170-71 (Ark. 1980); People v. Karsai, 131\nCal.

State, 462 P.2d 722, 726 (Wyo. 1969).\n\n                               -7-\n\fUnder this rule, known as the \"least penetration doctrine,\" rape\n\nlaws    are   \"designed    to    punish     the    fact,     not     the      degree,   of\n\npenetration,\"       State v. Albert, 750 A.2d 1037, 1047 (Conn. 2000).\n\n              \"[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are\n\naccumulated       the   legal   tradition       and    meaning     of    centuries       of\n\npractice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that\n\nwere attached to each borrowed word . . . .\"                  Morissette v. United\n\nStates, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952).               Here, no single term is used in\n\nall of the state statutes, but the cluster of terms has been given\n\nthe same meaning by construction and the rationale of Morissette\n\nstrongly supports the straightforward reading of the statute that\n\nwe adopt.\n\n              Jahagirdar's textual response is to point to use of the\n\nterm    \"vulva\"    in   subsections    (A)       and   (B)   of    the     definitional\n\nstatute,      section 2246(2), and argue that Congress must have meant\n\nto distinguish between \"vulva\" and \"genital opening\" or else it\n\nwould    simply    have   repeated    the       prior,   more      specific      term   in\n\nsubsection (C).         But if Congress had deliberately intended to\n\ndepart from the common-law approach, the obvious way would been to\n\nsay \"vaginal orifice\" instead of \"genital opening.\"\n\n              Although Congress' purpose in using \"genital opening\"\n\nrather    than    repeating     \"vulva\"    cannot      be    known      for    sure,    one\n\nplausible explanation exists and gives Jahagirdar no help.                               In\n\nsubsection (A), Congress' concern was with penetration by the\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpenis, and in subsection (B), with \"contact\" between the mouth and\n\neither \"penis,\" \"vulva,\" or \"anus\"; in both cases, the use of the\n\nfemale-specific   term    \"vulva\"   makes   sense.   By   contrast,   in\n\nsubsection (C), use of the gender neutral term \"genital opening\"\n\nmay well have been intended to encompass the insertion of \"any\n\nobject\" into the penis as well as the vulva.3\n\n          Jahagirdar also relies upon the rule of lenity, namely,\n\nthat ambiguities in criminal statutes are to be resolved in favor\n\nof the defendant; but that rule requires real uncertainty and\n\napplies only when \"after seizing everything from which aid can be\n\nderived, [a court] can make no more than a guess as to what\n\nCongress intended.\"      United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 83\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Reno v. Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 65 (1995)).\n\nIn this case, language, policy, and tradition make this a case in\n\nwhich there is no real uncertainty.\n\n          There is nothing whatever to Jahagirdar's suggestion that\n\nthe statute fails to give constitutionally adequate notice that\n\nsuch digital penetration of the labia majora constitutes sexual\n\n\n\n     3\n      One of Congress' purposes, avowed in the legislative history,\nwas to modernize rape-statute jargon to use gender neutral language\nand provide comparable protection where possible. See H.R. Rep.\nNo. 99-594, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986), at 10 (sexual abuse\nstatute \"modernizes and reforms Federal rape provisions by . . .\ndefining the offenses in gender neutral terms\"); id. at 11 (\"The\noffenses set forth in [the statute] are drafted in gender-neutral\nterms.\"); id. at 12 (statutory language was \"drafted broadly to\ncover the widest possible variety of sexual abuse, and to protect\nboth males and females from that abuse.\").\n\n                                    -9-\n\fabuse.   A criminal statute fails to give adequate notice \"if a\n\nperson of ordinary intelligence examining [only] the language of\n\nthe statute would be in some way surprised that it prohibited the\n\nconduct in question.\"    Sabetti v. DiPaolo, 16 F.3d 16, 17 (1st\n\nCir.) (alteration in original) (citations omitted) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617 (1954); United States v.\n\nColon-Ortiz, 866 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1989)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 916 (1994).\n\n          Here, on a common sense reading, the labia majora frame\n\na genital opening, even if there were other openings that might\n\nalso qualify.   Indulging the acceptable fiction that perpetrators\n\nclosely read statutes before acting, this statute gave Jahagirdar\n\nample warning that he was courting violation.    Moreover, this is\n\nfar from the more troubling case of an ill-defined malum prohibitum\n\nviolation; given the lack of consent, Jahagirdar had to know that\n\nhis conduct was criminal.   Sabetti, 16 F.3d at 18.\n\n          The only close circuit precedent called to our attention\n\nexpressly rejects Jahagirdar's contention that \"genital opening\"\n\nrefers only to the \"vaginal orifice.\"   United States v. Norman T.,\n\n129 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 1997), cert. denied 523 U.S. 1031\n\n(1998) (\"[The defendant] reads ['genital opening'] to require\n\nvaginal penetration, but that is simply not the requirement found\n\nin the statute.\"). Instead, Norman T. holds that \"penetration deep\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fenough to cause injury to the labia minora is sufficient to\n\nviolate\" the statute.      Id.4\n\n          In our case, the district court's instruction seemingly\n\nrequired that penetration be at least within the labia minora.\n\nThis was an understandably conservative approach not objected to by\n\nthe government, which had the necessary evidence.           But Norman T.\n\ndid not require this limitation--it held only that penetration of\n\nthe labia minora was sufficient to violate the statute.            For the\n\nsake of future litigation, we hold explicitly that penetration of\n\nthe labia majora is sufficient for conviction.\n\n          Turning to a different subject, Jahagirdar argues that\n\nthe trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning statements\n\nmade by D.S. during her interview with Trooper Hogaboom. At trial,\n\nD.S. was permitted to testify--over defense counsel's hearsay\n\nobjection--that she had told Hogaboom that Jahagirdar's \"hand was\n\ninside the vagina.\" Hogaboom was permitted to testify--again, over\n\ndefense counsel's objection--that he had asked D.S. \"if there was\n\npenetration,   and   she    stated    yes,\"   that   she   told   him   that\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Injury is not required by the statute, but Norman T. phrased\nits holding in those terms because of direct testimony from a\ndoctor that such injury had been caused.        129 F.3d at 1104.\nJahagirdar seeks to distinguish Norman T. on grounds that it\ninvolved a child and that trial testimony indicated that actual\nvaginal penetration had occurred, but the court clearly stated that\n\"vaginal penetration . . . is simply not [required].\" Id.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fJahagirdar's \"hand penetrated her vagina,\" and that, on this basis,\n\nhe had recommended a charge of rape in his report.5\n\n             The court admitted D.S.'s out-of-court statements under\n\ntwo theories--as prior consistent statements to rebut a charge of\n\nrecent fabrication, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B), and as excited\n\nutterances, Fed. R. Evid. 803(2).           Both are arguably close calls;\n\nwe   think   the   former    a   stronger   ground   than   the   latter    and\n\nsufficient to support admission of the evidence.\n\n             The   excited   utterance      ruling   is   not   without    some\n\nfoundation.     D.S. and others offered detailed testimony that D.S.\n\nremained upset for the duration of the flight and through her\n\ninterview with the trooper, which occurred 90 to 120 minutes after\n\nthe incident. Although \"[t]he time lapse in most excited utterance\n\ncases is usually a few seconds, or a few minutes,\"              United States\n\nv. Taveras, 380 F.3d 532, 537 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations omitted),\n\nthere are exceptions stretching into hours.\n\n             But these cases involve facts arguably more extreme than\n\nthose in the present case--including continuing physical pain after\n\nbeatings or shootings, Webb v. Lane, 922 F.2d 390, 393 (7th Cir.\n\n1991); United States v. Scarpa, 913 F.2d 993, 1017 (2d Cir. 1990),\n\ninvolve continued or renewed insecurity, United States v. Cruz, 156\n\n\n\n      5\n        Although D.S. in talking with the trooper perhaps used the\nterm \"vagina\" as if it included the labia--colloquially common but\nmedically incorrect--the use of a chart during her trial testimony\nmade clear that Jahagirdar had penetrated only the labia.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fF.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1124 (1999);\n\nScarpa, 913 F.2d at 1017, or involve young children who were\n\nsexually abused, Morgan v. Foretich, 846 F.2d 941 (4th Cir. 1988);\n\nGross v. Greer, 773 F.2d 116 (7th Cir. 1985). Having noted our\n\ndoubts, we need not resolve them, given Rule 801(d)(1)(B).\n\n          Rule   801(d)(1)(B)   permits   the   admission   of   a   prior\n\nstatement by a witness when (1) the declarant testifies at trial\n\nand is subject to cross-examination; (2) the prior statement is\n\nconsistent with the declarant's trial testimony; and (3) the prior\n\nstatement is offered \"to rebut an express or implied charge against\n\nthe declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or\n\nmotive.\" Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). The \"prior\n\nstatement\" must be made \"before the charged recent fabrication or\n\nimproper influence or motive.\"     Tome v. United States, 513 U.S.\n\n150, 167 (1995) (emphasis added).\n\n          Jahagirdar says that the prior statements to the trooper\n\nwere not consistent with D.S.'s in-court testimony. In court, D.S.\n\ntestified that Jahagirdar touched her labia minora; but Hogaboom\n\nwas permitted to testify that D.S. told him that Jahagirdar's hand\n\n\"penetrated her vagina.\" The inconsistency is probably superficial\n\n(see note 5, above), and anyhow both statements are consistent in\n\nincluding penetration of the labia minora--which was the central\n\npoint of D.S.'s testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          Jahagirdar also says that he never charged fabrication,\n\nbut the cross examination of D.S. plainly implies fabrication. One\n\nexample will do:\n\n          Q: You did in fact consult with a man named\n          Jeffrey Newman, is that correct?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Q: And Mr. Newman contacted lawyers on your\n          behalf who represented Mr. Jahagirdar, saying\n          that he had been retained by you, is that\n          correct?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Q:   And  he   also  contacted   lawyers who\n          represented Mr. Jahagirdar, asking them if\n          they would settle a claim against him?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Jahagirdar's best objection is that D.S.'s statements to\n\nthe trooper did not predate her motive to fabricate, as Tome (and\n\nthe \"recent\" fabrication language of the rule) require.      Such a\n\nmotive could have existed from the time of the assault; and the\n\nexception would not apply if D.S. was equally conscious, or perhaps\n\njust significantly conscious, of the possibility of profit both\n\nbefore and after her statements to the trooper.\n\n          In admitting the testimony, the judge implicitly ruled\n\nthat the alleged motive to fabricate arose or became substantial\n\nafter D.S.'s statements to the trooper rather than before.   To the\n\nextent that this ruling involved finding of facts, we review for\n\nclear error; to the extent that it reflects a judgment call about\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fthe application of the rule to the facts, we review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    United States v. Young, 105 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nIn either case, we affirm.         There is no indication that D.S. had a\n\ncivil suit in mind when interviewed by the trooper not long after\n\nthe incident itself.       Nor, if she had such a suit in mind, would\n\nshe likely have failed--as Jahagirdar brought out for his own\n\npurposes--to mention penetration to the nurse and doctor who\n\nexamined her.\n\n            Even if the trial judge had erred in admitting D.S.'s\n\nout-of-court       statements,     any    error   would      likely   have    been\n\nharmless.   United States v. Piper, 298 F.3d 47, 56 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThis is so partly, but not exclusively, because the direct evidence\n\nagainst Jahagirdar was quite strong, comprising D.S.'s unqualified\n\ncourt   testimony     bolstered     by     forensic    DNA   evidence   and   the\n\nindependent testimony of the flight attendants and secret service\n\nagents that she was visibly upset at the time.\n\n            What    is   equally    important     is   the    improbability    of\n\nJahagirdar's own testimony.          See United States v. Jimenez-Perez,\n\n869 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1989). Believing Jahagirdar depended upon\n\nbelieving that D.S., a relatively young woman who said she was\n\nthoroughly scared of flying and had taken a sedative prior to\n\nboarding (thus her nap), had invited a sexual encounter in the open\n\ncabin of the aircraft.       It is not surprising that the jury deemed\n\n\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fJahagirdar's story not to be credible--as did the judge in imposing\n\nhis own perjury enhancement at sentencing.\n\n            Finally, Jahagirdar makes two objections to his sentence\n\nof 87 months.     This is the bottom end of the applicable guideline\n\nrange, given the base offense level of 27 plus a two-level perjury\n\nenhancement. U.S.S.G. §§ 2A3.1, 3C1.1 (2001). The first objection\n\nis   that   the    district     court       used    the     term       \"presumptive\"\n\n(\"presumptively reasonable\" and \"presumptively appropriate\") in\n\nreferring    to   the     guideline    range;      the    second       is    that,   in\n\nJahagirdar's view, the sentence was unreasonable under the post-\n\nBooker advisory guideline scheme.\n\n            Unlike many other circuits, we have avoided the term\n\n\"presumptive\" in describing the guideline range.                  United States v.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc),\n\npetition    for   cert.    filed,     No.   06-5727      (U.S.    Aug.       7,   2006).\n\nInstead, we specified in functional terms that the guidelines are\n\na starting point, that they deserve substantial weight, and that\n\nthe party seeking a variance--upward or downward--needs to specify\n\nand establish the supporting circumstances.                      Id.        The gap is\n\nperhaps not large but we thought our formulation more helpful to\n\njudges.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f          Even where the defendant has preserved an objection to\n\n\"presumption\" references--not the case here6--we have generally\n\nupheld the resulting sentence where it seemed fairly clear--from\n\nthe trial judge's explanation and surrounding circumstances--that\n\nrephrasing the matter would not alter the result.            E.g., United\n\nStates v. Sagendorf, 445 F.3d 515, 517 (1st Cir. 2006).          That    is\n\nplainly so in this instance even if the more demanding requirements\n\nof the plain error test are ignored.         United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 732-37 (1993).\n\n          The district court began by determining the applicable\n\nguidelines   range,   and   then   decided    whether   to   exercise   its\n\ndiscretion to impose a non-guidelines sentence, whether by variance\n\nor by a formal departure. The judge noted Jahagirdar's substantial\n\ncommunity service, and the judge expressly stated that--prior to\n\nJahagirdar's allocution--he had been inclined to give a \"somewhat\n\nlower sentence\" than the guidelines minimum.\n\n          But when Jahagirdar failed to express any \"remorse or\n\nconcern for the victim,\" or for \"traumatiz[ing] her again by lying\n\nabout who initiated that sexual contact,\" the judge concluded that\n\nthe section 3553(a) factors did not permit a lower sentence.            The\n\n\n     6\n      Jahagirdar claims he preserved his objection. Although he\nagrees he did not object in court when the judge used the term\n\"presumptive,\" he points out that his sentencing memorandum argued\nthat the post-Booker guidelines were only one factor among the\nseveral mentioned in section 3553(a). But there is no indication\nthat the judge failed to consider the other section 3553(a)\nfactors.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fjudge   explained   that    Jahagirdar's     allocution     \"persuaded    me,\n\nsomewhat to my surprise, that . . . 87 months was necessary and no\n\nmore than sufficient to serve the goal of deterrence, of sending\n\nyou a message that this was a serious offense and you can't do this\n\nagain.\"\n\n           The   judge    also   explained   that    Jahagirdar's     perjury\n\nweighed heavily in his decision:\n\n           If   the    defendant   had    not   committed\n           perjury . . . there probably would have been a\n           compelling case for a downward departure based\n           on a single act of aberrant conduct. But the\n           defendant . . . did not after committing that\n           crime do anything to mitigate or reduce the\n           harm. He acted to aggravate the harm by lying\n           about it and placing into question the\n           victim's character and candor.\n\nStriking   the   word    \"presumption\"     would    not   alter   a   sentence\n\njustified in this systematic fashion.\n\n           The court's thoughtful comments also answer Jahagirdar's\n\nlast argument that the 87-month sentence was unreasonable, given\n\nthe aberrant nature of his conduct, his significant charitable\n\nactivities, and other characteristics.              In Jiménez-Beltre, we\n\nstated that a sentence is reasonable if the court provides a\n\n\"plausible explanation\" and the overall result is \"defensible.\"\n\n440 F.3d at 519.    The district court's thoughtful commentary meets\n\nboth tests.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f",

Mark L.

McNeil, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                            October 20, 2006\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      Of the    Northern     District   of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            BOUDIN,   Chief   Judge.     On   March   31,   2002,     Deepak\n\nJahagirdar was seated next to D.S., a 22-year-old woman, on a\n\ncommercial airline flight from Dallas to Boston.                D.S. later\n\ntestified that she awoke from a nap to find Jahagirdar's hand\n\ninside her underpants.    D.S. cursed at Jahagirdar, pushed her way\n\nto the aisle, and immediately told a flight attendant that \"[t]he\n\nguy next to me had his hand down my pants.\"\n\n            Upon landing, Jahagirdar was arrested. D.S. was asked to\n\nremain onboard the airplane after the other passengers had exited,\n\nand was interviewed by Massachusetts State Trooper Kevin Hogaboom.\n\nAfter disembarking, D.S. was interviewed again and made a written\n\nstatement.     D.S. was then taken to the hospital for a                rape\n\nexamination.\n\n            A grand jury indicted Jahagirdar on February 11, 2004,\n\ncharging him (so far as is relevant to this case) with sexual abuse\n\nand attempted sexual abuse, 18 U.S.C. § 2242(2) (2000), within the\n\nspecial aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, 49 U.S.C.\n\n§   46506   (2000).     Sexual   abuse   includes,    subject    to   other\n\nconditions,1 \"the penetration, however slight, of the . . . genital\n\nopening of another by a hand or finger or by any object.\"                 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2246(2)(C).\n\n\n\n      1\n      The statute requires, in pertinent part, that the penetration\nbe done with requisite intent and to someone incapable of consent.\n§ 2242(2). That these conditions were satisfied in this case is\nnot contested.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f             At trial,    D.S. testified that Jahagirdar's fingers were\n\n\"underneath the lip area of the vagina\" and that his fingers were\n\n\"[u]nderneath the outer lips [labia majora] and the inner lips\n\n[labia minora]\" of her genitals; and she made corresponding marks\n\non an anatomical diagram to illustrate her testimony.\n\n             On   cross-examination      of   D.S.,   Jahagirdar   sought   to\n\nimpeach her by suggesting that she had not told the doctor or nurse\n\nat the hospital that she had been penetrated, and that she had in\n\nfact denied having been penetrated when asked by the doctor.\n\nJahagirdar also implied that she had settled on her description of\n\nthe alleged assault after consulting a lawyer and after concluding\n\nthat Jahagirdar was an attractive target for a civil suit.\n\n             The government was then allowed to offer evidence from\n\nthe trooper who had interviewed D.S. at the scene.               He testified\n\nthat, when he asked D.S. whether she had been penetrated, she\n\nstated that she had been, and that, on the basis of her response,\n\nhe recommended that Jahagirdar be charged with rape.\n\n             There was also testimony from flight attendants and\n\nsecret service agents who were on board the plane as to D.S.'s\n\nvisible emotional distress, and expert testimony that a large\n\nquantity of D.S.'s DNA was found on Jahagirdar's hands, consistent\n\nwith   his   fingers     having   come   into   contact   with   her   vaginal\n\nsecretions.       However, the expert agreed that it was also possible\n\nthat Jahagirdar could have picked up skin cells from the waistband\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fof D.S.'s pants, so this forensic evidence did not incontrovertibly\n\nestablish just where Jahagirdar had placed his hand.\n\n           Jahagirdar testified in his own defense.               He admitted\n\nthat he had placed his hand in D.S.'s pants, but claimed that D.S.\n\nhad begun and encouraged a sexual encounter, that his hand touched\n\nonly her \"pubic hair area,\" and that he withdrew his hand when he\n\nbegan to feel guilty about betraying his wife's trust.\n\n           The jury convicted Jahagirdar of sexual abuse.                       The\n\ndistrict judge sentenced Jahagirdar to 87 months' imprisonment, a\n\nterm of supervised release, and a $25,000 fine.                 Jahagirdar now\n\nappeals, challenging the critical jury instruction as to the scope\n\nof the statute, the admission of D.S.'s statements to the trooper,\n\nand certain of the district court's sentencing determinations.\n\n           Jahagirdar's     first   argument      on   appeal    is   that      the\n\ndistrict court erroneously instructed the jury as to an element of\n\nthe   offense.    Section   2242(2)      criminalizes    \"knowingly       .    .   .\n\nengag[ing] in a sexual act with another person if that other person\n\nis . . . physically incapable of declining participation in, or\n\ncommunicating    unwillingness      to   engage   in,   that     sexual       act.\"\n\nSection 2246(2) in turn defines \"sexual act\" (we underscore the\n\nmost pertinent language) as\n\n       (A) contact between the penis and the vulva or the\n       penis and the anus, and for purposes of this\n       subparagraph contact involving the penis occurs upon\n       penetration, however slight;\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f       (B) contact between the mouth and the penis, the mouth\n       and the vulva, or the mouth and the anus;\n\n       (C) the penetration, however slight, of the anal or\n       genital opening of another by a hand or finger or by\n       any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate,\n       harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual\n       desire of any person; or\n\n       (D) the intentional touching, not through the\n       clothing, of the genitalia of another person who has\n       not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to\n       abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or\n       gratify the sexual desire of any person (emphasis\n       added).\n\n             Jahagirdar requested that the court instruct the jury\n\nthat   \"penetration    of   the   .   .   .    genital   opening\"   in    section\n\n2246(2)(C) refers to the penetration of the \"vaginal orifice.\" The\n\ngovernment requested an instruction stating that \"genital opening\n\n. . . includes not only the vagina itself, but also the anterior\n\nparts known as the vulva and labia,\" so that \"penetration of the\n\nlabia majora, or outer lips, of the vulva is sufficient\" to find\n\nJahagirdar guilty of violating section 2242.\n\n             The district court chose a middle ground, instructing the\n\njury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Jahagirdar \"placed his finger or hand beyond Ms. DS's labia\n\nmajora to at least the labia minora or inner lips . . . . The\n\ngovernment is not required to prove that he penetrated her vaginal\n\nor[i]fice.\"    Jahagirdar objected.           On appeal, Jahagirdar continues\n\nto   press   his   argument   that    \"genital      opening\"   means     \"vaginal\n\norifice.\"\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f             The term \"genital opening\" is not itself a medical term\n\nof art. The term \"genitalia\" refers to the \"external and internal\"\n\norgans of reproduction, Stedman's Medical Dictionary 738 (27th ed.\n\n2000),   but   \"esp[ecially]    the    external          organs,\"    Random    House\n\nDictionary 797 (2d ed. unabridged).                 For women, the \"external\n\ngenitalia\" include the mons pubis, the labia majora, the labia\n\nminora, the clitoris, and the vaginal orifice. Gray's Anatomy 1876\n\n(38th ed. 1995).     \"The term . . . vulva includes all these parts.\"\n\nId.\n\n             Taken   by   itself,   the     term    \"genital       opening\"    could\n\nconceivable refer to any of at least three successive openings in\n\nthe female genitalia: (1) the exterior opening bounded by the outer\n\nlips or labia majora, (2) the interior opening bounded by the\n\ncontained inner lips or labia minora, and (3) the opening, yet\n\nfurther along the same channel, called the vaginal orifice.\n\n             The most straightforward reading of \"genital opening\" is\n\nthat   the   term    encompasses    all     three       orifices    including   the\n\noutermost--a     reading    given   support        by    the   statutory      phrase\n\n\"penetration, however slight.\"        Nor is it clear why Congress would\n\nhave sought to distinguish among them, treating more leniently the\n\ndeliberate insertion of a finger into the outermost orifice--given\n\nthat the perpetrator must be acting without consent and for the\n\nmostly malign purposes described in the statute.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          The literal reading becomes almost conclusive when one\n\ncomes to understand that, under state law, the definition of\n\n\"rape\"--whether penile rape or the variant digital rape with which\n\nJahagirdar was charged--is almost always satisfied under state law\n\nby penetration of the labia majora, regardless of whether the\n\nstatute refers to the \"genital opening\" (as some do), the \"female\n\nsex organ\" (as others do), or even (in a few cases) the \"vagina.\"2\n\n\n\n     2\n      Several state courts have specifically held, in the context\nof digital or object rape, that penetration of the \"genital\nopening\" is satisfied by penetration of the vulva or labia.

Here, no single term is used in\n\nall of the state statutes, but the cluster of terms has been given\n\nthe same meaning by construction and the rationale of Morissette\n\nstrongly supports the straightforward reading of the statute that\n\nwe adopt.\n\n              Jahagirdar's textual response is to point to use of the\n\nterm    \"vulva\"    in   subsections    (A)       and   (B)   of    the     definitional\n\nstatute,      section 2246(2), and argue that Congress must have meant\n\nto distinguish between \"vulva\" and \"genital opening\" or else it\n\nwould    simply    have   repeated    the       prior,   more      specific      term   in\n\nsubsection (C).         But if Congress had deliberately intended to\n\ndepart from the common-law approach, the obvious way would been to\n\nsay \"vaginal orifice\" instead of \"genital opening.\"\n\n              Although Congress' purpose in using \"genital opening\"\n\nrather    than    repeating     \"vulva\"    cannot      be    known      for    sure,    one\n\nplausible explanation exists and gives Jahagirdar no help.                               In\n\nsubsection (A), Congress' concern was with penetration by the\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpenis, and in subsection (B), with \"contact\" between the mouth and\n\neither \"penis,\" \"vulva,\" or \"anus\"; in both cases, the use of the\n\nfemale-specific   term    \"vulva\"   makes   sense.   By   contrast,   in\n\nsubsection (C), use of the gender neutral term \"genital opening\"\n\nmay well have been intended to encompass the insertion of \"any\n\nobject\" into the penis as well as the vulva.3\n\n          Jahagirdar also relies upon the rule of lenity, namely,\n\nthat ambiguities in criminal statutes are to be resolved in favor\n\nof the defendant; but that rule requires real uncertainty and\n\napplies only when \"after seizing everything from which aid can be\n\nderived, [a court] can make no more than a guess as to what\n\nCongress intended.\"      United States v.

Id.4\n\n          In our case, the district court's instruction seemingly\n\nrequired that penetration be at least within the labia minora.\n\nThis was an understandably conservative approach not objected to by\n\nthe government, which had the necessary evidence.           But Norman T.\n\ndid not require this limitation--it held only that penetration of\n\nthe labia minora was sufficient to violate the statute.            For the\n\nsake of future litigation, we hold explicitly that penetration of\n\nthe labia majora is sufficient for conviction.\n\n          Turning to a different subject, Jahagirdar argues that\n\nthe trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning statements\n\nmade by D.S. during her interview with Trooper Hogaboom. At trial,\n\nD.S. was permitted to testify--over defense counsel's hearsay\n\nobjection--that she had told Hogaboom that Jahagirdar's \"hand was\n\ninside the vagina.\" Hogaboom was permitted to testify--again, over\n\ndefense counsel's objection--that he had asked D.S. \"if there was\n\npenetration,   and   she    stated    yes,\"   that   she   told   him   that\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Injury is not required by the statute, but Norman T. phrased\nits holding in those terms because of direct testimony from a\ndoctor that such injury had been caused.        129 F.3d at 1104.\nJahagirdar seeks to distinguish Norman T. on grounds that it\ninvolved a child and that trial testimony indicated that actual\nvaginal penetration had occurred, but the court clearly stated that\n\"vaginal penetration . . . is simply not [required].\" Id.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fJahagirdar's \"hand penetrated her vagina,\" and that, on this basis,\n\nhe had recommended a charge of rape in his report.5\n\n             The court admitted D.S.'s out-of-court statements under\n\ntwo theories--as prior consistent statements to rebut a charge of\n\nrecent fabrication, Fed.

Having noted our\n\ndoubts, we need not resolve them, given Rule 801(d)(1)(B).\n\n          Rule   801(d)(1)(B)   permits   the   admission   of   a   prior\n\nstatement by a witness when (1) the declarant testifies at trial\n\nand is subject to cross-examination; (2) the prior statement is\n\nconsistent with the declarant's trial testimony; and (3) the prior\n\nstatement is offered \"to rebut an express or implied charge against\n\nthe declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or\n\nmotive.\" Fed.

In court, D.S.\n\ntestified that Jahagirdar touched her labia minora; but Hogaboom\n\nwas permitted to testify that D.S. told him that Jahagirdar's hand\n\n\"penetrated her vagina.\" The inconsistency is probably superficial\n\n(see note 5, above), and anyhow both statements are consistent in\n\nincluding penetration of the labia minora--which was the central\n\npoint of D.S.'s testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          Jahagirdar also says that he never charged fabrication,\n\nbut the cross examination of D.S. plainly implies fabrication. One\n\nexample will do:\n\n          Q: You did in fact consult with a man named\n          Jeffrey Newman, is that correct?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Q: And Mr. Newman contacted lawyers on your\n          behalf who represented Mr. Jahagirdar, saying\n          that he had been retained by you, is that\n          correct?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Q:   And  he   also  contacted   lawyers who\n          represented Mr. Jahagirdar, asking them if\n          they would settle a claim against him?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Jahagirdar's best objection is that D.S.'s statements to\n\nthe trooper did not predate her motive to fabricate, as Tome (and\n\nthe \"recent\" fabrication language of the rule) require.      Such a\n\nmotive could have existed from the time of the assault; and the\n\nexception would not apply if D.S. was equally conscious, or perhaps\n\njust significantly conscious, of the possibility of profit both\n\nbefore and after her statements to the trooper.\n\n          In admitting the testimony, the judge implicitly ruled\n\nthat the alleged motive to fabricate arose or became substantial\n\nafter D.S.'s statements to the trooper rather than before.   To the\n\nextent that this ruling involved finding of facts, we review for\n\nclear error; to the extent that it reflects a judgment call about\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fthe application of the rule to the facts, we review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.

There is no indication that D.S. had a\n\ncivil suit in mind when interviewed by the trooper not long after\n\nthe incident itself.       Nor, if she had such a suit in mind, would\n\nshe likely have failed--as Jahagirdar brought out for his own\n\npurposes--to mention penetration to the nurse and doctor who\n\nexamined her.\n\n            Even if the trial judge had erred in admitting D.S.'s\n\nout-of-court       statements,     any    error   would      likely   have    been\n\nharmless.   United States v.

See United States v. Jimenez-Perez,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519199\"><a href=\"/opinion/519199/united-states-v-joaquin-jimenez-perez-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir. 1989). Believing Jahagirdar depended upon\n\nbelieving that D.S., a relatively young woman who said she was\n\nthoroughly scared of flying and had taken a sedative prior to\n\nboarding (thus her nap), had invited a sexual encounter in the open\n\ncabin of the aircraft.       It is not surprising that the jury deemed\n\n\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fJahagirdar's story not to be credible--as did the judge in imposing\n\nhis own perjury enhancement at sentencing.\n\n            Finally, Jahagirdar makes two objections to his sentence\n\nof 87 months.     This is the bottom end of the applicable guideline\n\nrange, given the base offense level of 27 plus a two-level perjury\n\nenhancement. U.S.S.G. §§ 2A3.1, 3C1.1 (2001). The first objection\n\nis   that   the    district     court       used    the     term       \"presumptive\"\n\n(\"presumptively reasonable\" and \"presumptively appropriate\") in\n\nreferring    to   the     guideline    range;      the    second       is    that,   in\n\nJahagirdar's view, the sentence was unreasonable under the post-\n\nBooker advisory guideline scheme.\n\n            Unlike many other circuits, we have avoided the term\n\n\"presumptive\" in describing the guideline range.                  United States v.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc),\n\npetition    for   cert.    filed,     No.   06-5727      (U.S.    Aug.       7,   2006).\n\nInstead, we specified in functional terms that the guidelines are\n\na starting point, that they deserve substantial weight, and that\n\nthe party seeking a variance--upward or downward--needs to specify\n\nand establish the supporting circumstances.                      Id.        The gap is\n\nperhaps not large but we thought our formulation more helpful to\n\njudges.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f          Even where the defendant has preserved an objection to\n\n\"presumption\" references--not the case here6--we have generally\n\nupheld the resulting sentence where it seemed fairly clear--from\n\nthe trial judge's explanation and surrounding circumstances--that\n\nrephrasing the matter would not alter the result.            E.g., United\n\nStates v. Sagendorf, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202175\"><a href=\"/opinion/202175/united-states-v-sagendorf/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517 (1st Cir. 2006).          That    is\n\nplainly so in this instance even if the more demanding requirements\n\nof the plain error test are ignored.         United States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732-37 (1993).\n\n          The district court began by determining the applicable\n\nguidelines   range,   and   then   decided    whether   to   exercise   its\n\ndiscretion to impose a non-guidelines sentence, whether by variance\n\nor by a formal departure. The judge noted Jahagirdar's substantial\n\ncommunity service, and the judge expressly stated that--prior to\n\nJahagirdar's allocution--he had been inclined to give a \"somewhat\n\nlower sentence\" than the guidelines minimum.\n\n          But when Jahagirdar failed to express any \"remorse or\n\nconcern for the victim,\" or for \"traumatiz[ing] her again by lying\n\nabout who initiated that sexual contact,\" the judge concluded that\n\nthe section 3553(a) factors did not permit a lower sentence.            The\n\n\n     6\n      Jahagirdar claims he preserved his objection. Although he\nagrees he did not object in court when the judge used the term\n\"presumptive,\" he points out that his sentencing memorandum argued\nthat the post-Booker guidelines were only one factor among the\nseveral mentioned in section 3553(a). But there is no indication\nthat the judge failed to consider the other section 3553(a)\nfactors.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fjudge   explained   that    Jahagirdar's     allocution     \"persuaded    me,\n\nsomewhat to my surprise, that . . . 87 months was necessary and no\n\nmore than sufficient to serve the goal of deterrence, of sending\n\nyou a message that this was a serious offense and you can't do this\n\nagain.\"\n\n           The   judge    also   explained   that    Jahagirdar's     perjury\n\nweighed heavily in his decision:\n\n           If   the    defendant   had    not   committed\n           perjury . . . there probably would have been a\n           compelling case for a downward departure based\n           on a single act of aberrant conduct. But the\n           defendant . . . did not after committing that\n           crime do anything to mitigate or reduce the\n           harm. He acted to aggravate the harm by lying\n           about it and placing into question the\n           victim's character and candor.\n\nStriking   the   word    \"presumption\"     would    not   alter   a   sentence\n\njustified in this systematic fashion.\n\n           The court's thoughtful comments also answer Jahagirdar's\n\nlast argument that the 87-month sentence was unreasonable, given\n\nthe aberrant nature of his conduct, his significant charitable\n\nactivities, and other characteristics.              In Jiménez-Beltre, we\n\nstated that a sentence is reasonable if the court provides a\n\n\"plausible explanation\" and the overall result is \"defensible.\"\n\n440 F.3d at 519.    The district court's thoughtful commentary meets\n\nboth tests.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f</pre>",
