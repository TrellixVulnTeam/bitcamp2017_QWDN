Pro se appellant Anthony Gulla appeals from\n\norders dismissing his civil action for want of prosecution and\n\ndeclining to grant his motion to vacate the dismissal order. After\n\ncareful review of the record and appellate briefs, we affirm.\n\n                    We conclude that the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in dismissing the case.                 Gulla had been given a\n\ngenerous extension of time to prepare his amended complaint, but he\n\nfailed to timely file it.             Instead, he filed a late request for\n\nanother extension, insisting that it was timely.                But the district\n\ncourt had previously stated that \"no further extensions\" would be\n\ngranted,     and    the     belated    request   for    additional    time      was\n\nsubstantively and formally defective.               It did not show that an\n\nextension of time was justified, and it did not comply with formal\n\nprerequisites for motions that had been specified and emphasized in\n\nprior court orders.          Before dismissing the suit, the court had\n\nwarned Gulla that his suit would be dismissed if he did not timely\n\nfile his amended complaint.           Under these circumstances, there was\n\nno abuse of discretion.          See Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d\n\n645,   647   (1st    Cir.    1990)    (indicating   that   an    action   may    be\n\ndismissed with prejudice for lack of prosecution where a plaintiff\n\nhas disobeyed the court's orders and ignored its warnings).\n\n              We find Gulla's appellate arguments to be unpersuasive.\n\nThe documents he provides on appeal do not establish that his case\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwas meritorious and that he was incapacitated during the critical\n\ntime period.\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
