The district court dismissed\n                                  \n\nplaintiffs'  43-page,  358-paragraph  complaint  because  of  its\n\nfailure  to conform to the  concise pleading requirements of Rule\n\n8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the court erred in  doing so, and in failing to give them an\n\nopportunity to file an amended complaint.  We cannot say that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion and, accordingly, affirm the\n\ndismissal.\n\n                     I. Procedural Background\n                                             \n\n     Plaintiffs David and Jean Kuehl originally filed this lender\n\nliability lawsuit in state court, seeking damages from  two banks\n\nand  numerous bank officers  and directors based  on foreclosures\n\nagainst  their properties and their resulting inability to obtain\n\ncredit.   The state court complaint consisted of 19 single-spaced\n\ntyped pages containing 36 counts against 28 defendants.\n\n     In October  1991, the two  banks were taken over  by federal\n\nagencies, and the action was removed to federal court.  Following\n\na status conference  in early February  1992, a magistrate  judge\n\nordered  plaintiffs to submit  \"an amended complaint\"  to conform\n\nthe pleadings  to the concise  pleading requirements  of Fed.  R.\n\nCiv.  P. 8(a).1   The  order noted  the  magistrate's expectation\n\nthat \"a review of the  proposed amended complaint and the results\n\n                    \n\n1 The relevant portion of Rule 8(a) states:\n\n     A pleading which  sets forth a claim  for relief .  . .\n     shall contain . . . (2)  a short and plain statement of\n     the  claim  showing  that the  pleader  is  entitled to\n     relief . . . .\n\nof  Rule 12(b)(6)  motions [to  dismiss  for failure  to state  a\n\nclaim]  will reduce  considerably  the number  of parties  in the\n\naction.\"\n\n     Several  days later, plaintiffs filed a 43-page, now double-\n\nspaced, complaint with the  same number of counts, and  including\n\nall of the  original defendants, plus  the two federal  agencies.\n\nThe complaint  set forth,  inter alia, eight  separate counts  of\n                                     \n\nrespondeat superior, eight counts  of negligent supervision,  six\n\ncounts  of  breach of  good  faith,  three  counts of  breach  of\n\nfiduciary duty,  three counts  of negligence,  and two  counts of\n\nconspiracy.2\n\n     Defendants  promptly filed motions  to dismiss.   They urged\n\nthat the entire  complaint be dismissed for failure  to provide a\n\n                    \n\n2 The complaint's prolixity is illustrated  by the counts alleged\nagainst  the individual members of HomeBank's board of directors.\nTwo of the negligence counts were against  this group.  One count\n(Count III) alleged breach of a duty to ensure that all terms and\nconditions  of  loans  between  the  Kuehls  and  the  bank  were\nfulfilled and  the other (Count IV)  alleged breach of  a duty to\nsupervise the  officers of the  bank to ensure that  the officers\nfulfilled  the bank's obligations to its customers, including the\nKuehls.   The complaint  also included two  negligent supervision\ncounts (Counts VIII and XII) charging  these same defendants with\nessentially  the  same  conduct.    The  complaint  also  alleged\nmultiple respondeat superior claims  against HomeBank (Counts IX,\nXIII, XV,  XX) as the  responsible employer and principal  of the\nofficers and directors.\n\n     The  counts  against  HomeBank's  president, Charles  Reese,\nincluded one  for negligence (Count II), alleging that he \"failed\nto properly supervise his subordinates  and permitted the bank to\nbreach its  agreement with Kuehl,\"  as well as two  for negligent\nsupervision (Counts  VII and XI),  alleging that he  breached his\nduty   and  responsibility  to   Kuehl  by  failing   to  correct\nmisrepresentations made to Kuehl by Reese's subordinates.\n\n     These examples are by no means exhaustive.\n\n                               -3-\n\nshort  and plain  statement of  the  claims as  required by  Rule\n\n8(a)(2), and  as ordered  by the magistrate  judge.   The motions\n\nalternatively sought dismissal against the individual defendants,\n\nwho had  been sued  only in their  official capacities,  and also\n\nchallenged certain counts as  failing to state claims upon  which\n\nrelief could be granted.\n\n     Plaintiffs objected  to  the  motions,  asserting  that  the\n\ncomplaint did conform to the  requirements of Rule 8(a), and that\n\nevery count stated a  viable cause of action.  They  did not seek\n\nleave to further amend the complaint.\n\n     On July 23, 1992, the magistrate judge issued his Report and\n\nRecommendation  calling for dismissal of the complaint because it\n\nviolated  Rule  8(a).    He  found  that,  despite  the  explicit\n\ndirections  in his February  order, plaintiffs had  \"proceeded to\n\nfile a verbose and redundant complaint containing the same number\n\nof counts as  the original.\"  He  noted that several counts  were\n\nnearly  identical  to  each  other,  several  other  counts  were\n\nambiguous as to  which defendant was  named, and \"[t]he  possible\n\nsubstance of the claim is hidden in prolixity.\"\n\n     The  Kuehls filed an objection to the recommended dismissal,\n\ncomplaining that no consideration had been given to the merits of\n\ntheir  claims  or  to  their  \"right\" to  further  amend.    This\n\ncomplaint  was their  first in  the federal format,  they pointed\n\nout, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) allows a party one amendment \"as a\n\n                               -4-\n\nmatter  of course\"  before  a  responsive  pleading  is  served.3\n\nPlaintiffs did  not, as  part of their  objection, seek  leave to\n\namend or submit a proposed amended complaint.\n\n     Plaintiffs did  attempt to file  a motion to amend  in early\n\nSeptember, attaching  a proposed  amended complaint.   They  also\n\nfiled a dismissal without prejudice  of all claims against the 21\n\ndefendants  who were  directors  of  the two  banks.   The  court\n\nrefused the motion to amend,  however, because plaintiffs had not\n\nsought concurrence from the defendants, as required by Local Rule\n\n11.   No  subsequent attempt  was made  to obtain  concurrence or\n\nrefile the pleading.\n\n     On September 25,  1992, the district  court issued an  order\n\nadopting the magistrate judge's recommendation that the complaint\n\nbe dismissed  in its entirety.   The court noted  that plaintiffs\n\nhad failed to file an amended  complaint meeting the requirements\n\nof  Rule  8(a), as  ordered,  \"even  after  the Magistrate  Judge\n\ngratuitiously  gave plaintiffs rather specific guidance as to how\n\nthe complaint should be amended.\"\n\n     Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Reconsideration, stating that,\n\nin  attempting to  balance the  various  federal pleading  rules,\n\n\"[p]laintiffs' attorney unintentionally  violated Rule 8(a)\"  and\n\n                    \n\n3 The relevant portion of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) states:\n\n          A party  may amend the  party's pleading once\n          as a matter  of course at  any time before  a\n          responsive   pleading  is  served  .  .  .  .\n          Otherwise  a  party  may  amend  the  party's\n          pleading only by leave of court or by written\n          consent of the adverse party; and leave shall\n          be freely given when justice so requires.\n\n                               -5-\n\nthat dismissal with  prejudice was too harsh a  penalty under the\n\ncircumstances.  For the first time, plaintiffs submitted a proper\n\nrequest  for permission to  amend their complaint,  although they\n\ndid  not submit  a proposed  new complaint.   The  district court\n\ndenied the  motion for reconsideration  on March 12, 1993.   This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n     The Kuehls now  attack the dismissal on two  fronts.  First,\n\nthey claim that they are  absolutely entitled to another round of\n\nrepleading under  Rule 15(a)  because  they have  filed only  one\n\nfederal  complaint  and  defendants  have  not  filed  responsive\n\npleadings.4   Second, they argue  that the deficiencies  of their\n\ncomplaint were  not so severe  as to warrant a  dismissal without\n\nthe opportunity to amend.\n\n                      II. The Right to Amend\n                                            \n\n     Under Rule 81(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, an\n\naction that is  removed from state to  federal court need not  be\n\nrepled \"unless  the court so  orders.\"  The Kuehls  maintain that\n\ntheir  original  federal  complaint  was   a  repleading  ordered\n\npursuant  to Rule  81(c), but  that --  contrary to  the district\n\ncourt's conclusion --  that redrafting did not use  up their Rule\n\n15(a) right to amend their complaint once as a matter of course.\n\n     We  can  agree,   generally,  with  the  principle   that  a\n\nrepleading  ordered  under  Rule  81(c)  does  not  automatically\n\ndeprive the plaintiff of the  one-time option to amend granted by\n\n                    \n\n4  It is well established in this circuit that motions to dismiss\nare  not responsive pleadings.  See Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-\n                                                                 \nBelendez, 903 F.2d 49, 59 n.8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n        \n\n                               -6-\n\nRule  15(a).   This  seems particularly  so  when the  repleading\n\ninvolves  simply a  change of  format  to fit  the federal  court\n\nmodel.\n\n     In  this  case,  however,  the magistrate  judge  explicitly\n\nordered  an  amended  complaint  that  was  intended  to  contain\n                    \n\nsubstantive  changes to  meet  Rule  8(a)'s  requirements.    The\n\nplaintiffs,  therefore,   had  a   chance   to  make   meaningful\n\nmodifications to  their complaint  and, indeed,  were given  some\n\nadvice about how to do so.  They point to no authority supporting\n\nthe proposition that they are entitled,  as a matter of right, to\n                                                             \n\na second chance to improve the substance of their complaint.  The\n\nfact that plaintiffs squandered their one  guaranteed opportunity\n\nby making only stylistic changes does not yield them another.\n\n                    III. Too Tough a Sanction?\n                                              \n\n     A district court has the power to dismiss a complaint when a\n\nplaintiff fails  to  comply  with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil\n\nProcedure, including  Rule 8(a)(2)'s \"short and  plain statement\"\n\nrequirement.  Vakalis v. Shawmut Corp., 925 F.2d 34, 36 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1991); Mangan v.  Weinberger, 848 F.2d 909, 911  (8th Cir. 1988).\n                            \n\nSee Fed.  R. Civ. P. 41(b).  Its decision  to do so is reviewable\n   \n\nonly  for abuse  of discretion.   Mangan,  848 F.2d  at 911;  HMG\n                                                                 \n\nProperty Investors v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, 847 F.2d 908, 916-\n                                             \n\n17 (1st Cir. 1988). \n\n     Plaintiffs  now acknowledge  a technical  violation of  Rule\n\n8(a),  conceding that  their complaint  is  excessively long  and\n\nunnecessarily redundant.    They claim,  however, that  dismissal\n\n                               -7-\n\nwith  prejudice  is  too  drastic a  sanction  because  this  was\n\n\"unintentional  error\" on the  part of plaintiffs'  attorney, who\n\nbelieved that it was essential to plead in detail in light of the\n\nmagistrate's  stated  expectation that  many defendants  and some\n\nclaims  would be  dismissed.   By  drafting  counts in  numerous,\n\nshort, separate  paragraphs, plaintiffs explain,  they sought  to\n\npermit any dismissed  counts to be excised without  affecting the\n\nremainder of the claims or the complaint as a whole.\n\n     Were plaintiffs'  confessed overdrafting their only  sin, we\n\nwould be  inclined to  agree that dismissal  was an  overly harsh\n\npenalty.  Our federal rules  promote the disposition of claims on\n\nthe merits rather than on  the basis of technicalities, see Foman\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Davis, 371  U.S. 178,  181-82  (1962), and  courts should  be\n         \n\nreluctant  to  impose  a dismissal  with  prejudice  for  a rules\n\nviolation that  is neither persistent nor vexatious, particularly\n\nwithout some review of the merits.\n\n     These  plaintiffs are  culpable  for  more  than  simply  an\n\noverwritten  complaint, however.   Their faulty pleading  was not\n\ntheir  first,  but  an  amended version  that  had  changed  only\n\nsuperficially  from the state  court complaint, despite  an order\n\nthat  it conform  to the  concise pleading  requirements  of Rule\n                                 \n\n8(a).  Additionally,  the magistrate judge had  fairly explicitly\n\ntelegraphed   that   the   number   of   defendants   should   be\n\n\"considerably\" reduced. Instead, plaintiffs added two more.  When\n\nplaintiffs  finally  attempted six  weeks after  the magistrate's\n\ndecision to file a motion to  amend, they failed to follow  local\n\n                               -8-\n\nrules.   At no time did they properly  offer the court a proposed\n\namended complaint to cure the deficiencies.\n\n     Thus, by the time the district court acted on the magistrate\n\njudge's recommendation, it  had before it a flouted  order and no\n\nindication that plaintiffs were  ready to conform to Rule  8(a)'s\n\nrequirements.  Their one apparent attempt to comply -- the motion\n\nthat ran  afoul of  Local Rule  11 --  had been  abandoned.   And\n\ndefendants  already had  expended considerable  time  and expense\n\nresponding  to   the  defective   complaint.     See  Newman   v.\n                                                            \n\nCommonwealth  of  Mass., 115  F.R.D.  341,  344 (D.  Mass.  1987)\n                       \n\n(recognizing  role of  \"`pragmatic matters,'\"  such  as time  and\n\nexpense for defendants  and court, in deciding  whether complaint\n\nshould be dismissed).\n\n     In these  circumstances, the  district  court's decision  to\n\ndismiss, though  very severe,  does not strike  us as  beyond the\n\npale.   It is  well settled that  the question on  review \"is not\n\nwhether we would have imposed a more lenient penalty had we  been\n\nsitting in the  trial judge's place, but whether  the trial judge\n\nabused his discretion  in imposing the penalty he  did.\"  Spiller\n                                                                 \n\nv. U.S.V. Laboratories, Inc., 842  F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988).\n                            \n\nWe believe  this decision was  within the wide boundaries  of the\n\ncourt's discretion.  See 5 Charles A. Wright &amp;  Arthur R. Miller,\n                        \n\nFederal Practice and Procedure    1217, at 178 (1990) (\"[I]n some\n                              \n\ncircumstances if a party fails or  refuses to file an amended and\n\nsimplified pleading or does not exercise good faith in purporting\n\nto do so, the severe sanction of a dismissal on the merits may be\n\n                               -9-\n\nwarranted.\"); see also Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty, 990 F.2d 1,\n                                                    \n\n5 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Trial judges enjoy great latitude in carrying\n\nout case-management functions.\")\n\n     The order of dismissal is therefore affirmed.\n                                                 \n\n                               -10-\n",

The district court dismissed\n                                  \n\nplaintiffs'  43-page,  358-paragraph  complaint  because  of  its\n\nfailure  to conform to the  concise pleading requirements of Rule\n\n8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the court erred in  doing so, and in failing to give them an\n\nopportunity to file an amended complaint.  We cannot say that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion and, accordingly, affirm the\n\ndismissal.\n\n                     I. Procedural Background\n                                             \n\n     Plaintiffs David and Jean Kuehl originally filed this lender\n\nliability lawsuit in state court, seeking damages from  two banks\n\nand  numerous bank officers  and directors based  on foreclosures\n\nagainst  their properties and their resulting inability to obtain\n\ncredit.   The state court complaint consisted of 19 single-spaced\n\ntyped pages containing 36 counts against 28 defendants.\n\n     In October  1991, the two  banks were taken over  by federal\n\nagencies, and the action was removed to federal court.  Following\n\na status conference  in early February  1992, a magistrate  judge\n\nordered  plaintiffs to submit  \"an amended complaint\"  to conform\n\nthe pleadings  to the concise  pleading requirements  of Fed.  R.\n\nCiv.  P. 8(a).1   The  order noted  the  magistrate's expectation\n\nthat \"a review of the  proposed amended complaint and the results\n\n                    \n\n1 The relevant portion of Rule 8(a) states:\n\n     A pleading which  sets forth a claim  for relief .  . .\n     shall contain . . . (2)  a short and plain statement of\n     the  claim  showing  that the  pleader  is  entitled to\n     relief . . . .\n\nof  Rule 12(b)(6)  motions [to  dismiss  for failure  to state  a\n\nclaim]  will reduce  considerably  the number  of parties  in the\n\naction.\"\n\n     Several  days later, plaintiffs filed a 43-page, now double-\n\nspaced, complaint with the  same number of counts, and  including\n\nall of the  original defendants, plus  the two federal  agencies.\n\nThe complaint  set forth,  inter alia, eight  separate counts  of\n                                     \n\nrespondeat superior, eight counts  of negligent supervision,  six\n\ncounts  of  breach of  good  faith,  three  counts of  breach  of\n\nfiduciary duty,  three counts  of negligence,  and two  counts of\n\nconspiracy.2\n\n     Defendants  promptly filed motions  to dismiss.   They urged\n\nthat the entire  complaint be dismissed for failure  to provide a\n\n                    \n\n2 The complaint's prolixity is illustrated  by the counts alleged\nagainst  the individual members of HomeBank's board of directors.\nTwo of the negligence counts were against  this group.  One count\n(Count III) alleged breach of a duty to ensure that all terms and\nconditions  of  loans  between  the  Kuehls  and  the  bank  were\nfulfilled and  the other (Count IV)  alleged breach of  a duty to\nsupervise the  officers of the  bank to ensure that  the officers\nfulfilled  the bank's obligations to its customers, including the\nKuehls.   The complaint  also included two  negligent supervision\ncounts (Counts VIII and XII) charging  these same defendants with\nessentially  the  same  conduct.    The  complaint  also  alleged\nmultiple respondeat superior claims  against HomeBank (Counts IX,\nXIII, XV,  XX) as the  responsible employer and principal  of the\nofficers and directors.\n\n     The  counts  against  HomeBank's  president, Charles  Reese,\nincluded one  for negligence (Count II), alleging that he \"failed\nto properly supervise his subordinates  and permitted the bank to\nbreach its  agreement with Kuehl,\"  as well as two  for negligent\nsupervision (Counts  VII and XI),  alleging that he  breached his\nduty   and  responsibility  to   Kuehl  by  failing   to  correct\nmisrepresentations made to Kuehl by Reese's subordinates.\n\n     These examples are by no means exhaustive.\n\n                               -3-\n\nshort  and plain  statement of  the  claims as  required by  Rule\n\n8(a)(2), and  as ordered  by the magistrate  judge.   The motions\n\nalternatively sought dismissal against the individual defendants,\n\nwho had  been sued  only in their  official capacities,  and also\n\nchallenged certain counts as  failing to state claims upon  which\n\nrelief could be granted.\n\n     Plaintiffs objected  to  the  motions,  asserting  that  the\n\ncomplaint did conform to the  requirements of Rule 8(a), and that\n\nevery count stated a  viable cause of action.  They  did not seek\n\nleave to further amend the complaint.\n\n     On July 23, 1992, the magistrate judge issued his Report and\n\nRecommendation  calling for dismissal of the complaint because it\n\nviolated  Rule  8(a).    He  found  that,  despite  the  explicit\n\ndirections  in his February  order, plaintiffs had  \"proceeded to\n\nfile a verbose and redundant complaint containing the same number\n\nof counts as  the original.\"  He  noted that several counts  were\n\nnearly  identical  to  each  other,  several  other  counts  were\n\nambiguous as to  which defendant was  named, and \"[t]he  possible\n\nsubstance of the claim is hidden in prolixity.\"\n\n     The  Kuehls filed an objection to the recommended dismissal,\n\ncomplaining that no consideration had been given to the merits of\n\ntheir  claims  or  to  their  \"right\" to  further  amend.    This\n\ncomplaint  was their  first in  the federal format,  they pointed\n\nout, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) allows a party one amendment \"as a\n\n                               -4-\n\nmatter  of course\"  before  a  responsive  pleading  is  served.3\n\nPlaintiffs did  not, as  part of their  objection, seek  leave to\n\namend or submit a proposed amended complaint.\n\n     Plaintiffs did  attempt to file  a motion to amend  in early\n\nSeptember, attaching  a proposed  amended complaint.   They  also\n\nfiled a dismissal without prejudice  of all claims against the 21\n\ndefendants  who were  directors  of  the two  banks.   The  court\n\nrefused the motion to amend,  however, because plaintiffs had not\n\nsought concurrence from the defendants, as required by Local Rule\n\n11.   No  subsequent attempt  was made  to obtain  concurrence or\n\nrefile the pleading.\n\n     On September 25,  1992, the district  court issued an  order\n\nadopting the magistrate judge's recommendation that the complaint\n\nbe dismissed  in its entirety.   The court noted  that plaintiffs\n\nhad failed to file an amended  complaint meeting the requirements\n\nof  Rule  8(a), as  ordered,  \"even  after  the Magistrate  Judge\n\ngratuitiously  gave plaintiffs rather specific guidance as to how\n\nthe complaint should be amended.\"\n\n     Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Reconsideration, stating that,\n\nin  attempting to  balance the  various  federal pleading  rules,\n\n\"[p]laintiffs' attorney unintentionally  violated Rule 8(a)\"  and\n\n                    \n\n3 The relevant portion of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) states:\n\n          A party  may amend the  party's pleading once\n          as a matter  of course at  any time before  a\n          responsive   pleading  is  served  .  .  .  .\n          Otherwise  a  party  may  amend  the  party's\n          pleading only by leave of court or by written\n          consent of the adverse party; and leave shall\n          be freely given when justice so requires.\n\n                               -5-\n\nthat dismissal with  prejudice was too harsh a  penalty under the\n\ncircumstances.  For the first time, plaintiffs submitted a proper\n\nrequest  for permission to  amend their complaint,  although they\n\ndid  not submit  a proposed  new complaint.   The  district court\n\ndenied the  motion for reconsideration  on March 12, 1993.   This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n     The Kuehls now  attack the dismissal on two  fronts.  First,\n\nthey claim that they are  absolutely entitled to another round of\n\nrepleading under  Rule 15(a)  because  they have  filed only  one\n\nfederal  complaint  and  defendants  have  not  filed  responsive\n\npleadings.4   Second, they argue  that the deficiencies  of their\n\ncomplaint were  not so severe  as to warrant a  dismissal without\n\nthe opportunity to amend.\n\n                      II. The Right to Amend\n                                            \n\n     Under Rule 81(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, an\n\naction that is  removed from state to  federal court need not  be\n\nrepled \"unless  the court so  orders.\"  The Kuehls  maintain that\n\ntheir  original  federal  complaint  was   a  repleading  ordered\n\npursuant  to Rule  81(c), but  that --  contrary to  the district\n\ncourt's conclusion --  that redrafting did not use  up their Rule\n\n15(a) right to amend their complaint once as a matter of course.\n\n     We  can  agree,   generally,  with  the  principle   that  a\n\nrepleading  ordered  under  Rule  81(c)  does  not  automatically\n\ndeprive the plaintiff of the  one-time option to amend granted by\n\n                    \n\n4  It is well established in this circuit that motions to dismiss\nare  not responsive pleadings.  See Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-\n                                                                 \nBelendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 n.8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n        \n\n                               -6-\n\nRule  15(a).   This  seems particularly  so  when the  repleading\n\ninvolves  simply a  change of  format  to fit  the federal  court\n\nmodel.\n\n     In  this  case,  however,  the magistrate  judge  explicitly\n\nordered  an  amended  complaint  that  was  intended  to  contain\n                    \n\nsubstantive  changes to  meet  Rule  8(a)'s  requirements.    The\n\nplaintiffs,  therefore,   had  a   chance   to  make   meaningful\n\nmodifications to  their complaint  and, indeed,  were given  some\n\nadvice about how to do so.  They point to no authority supporting\n\nthe proposition that they are entitled,  as a matter of right, to\n                                                             \n\na second chance to improve the substance of their complaint.  The\n\nfact that plaintiffs squandered their one  guaranteed opportunity\n\nby making only stylistic changes does not yield them another.\n\n                    III. Too Tough a Sanction?\n                                              \n\n     A district court has the power to dismiss a complaint when a\n\nplaintiff fails  to  comply  with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil\n\nProcedure, including  Rule 8(a)(2)'s \"short and  plain statement\"\n\nrequirement.

They claim,  however, that  dismissal\n\n                               -7-\n\nwith  prejudice  is  too  drastic a  sanction  because  this  was\n\n\"unintentional  error\" on the  part of plaintiffs'  attorney, who\n\nbelieved that it was essential to plead in detail in light of the\n\nmagistrate's  stated  expectation that  many defendants  and some\n\nclaims  would be  dismissed.   By  drafting  counts in  numerous,\n\nshort, separate  paragraphs, plaintiffs explain,  they sought  to\n\npermit any dismissed  counts to be excised without  affecting the\n\nremainder of the claims or the complaint as a whole.\n\n     Were plaintiffs'  confessed overdrafting their only  sin, we\n\nwould be  inclined to  agree that dismissal  was an  overly harsh\n\npenalty.  Our federal rules  promote the disposition of claims on\n\nthe merits rather than on  the basis of technicalities, see Foman\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Their faulty pleading  was not\n\ntheir  first,  but  an  amended version  that  had  changed  only\n\nsuperficially  from the state  court complaint, despite  an order\n\nthat  it conform  to the  concise pleading  requirements  of Rule\n                                 \n\n8(a).  Additionally,  the magistrate judge had  fairly explicitly\n\ntelegraphed   that   the   number   of   defendants   should   be\n\n\"considerably\" reduced. Instead, plaintiffs added two more.  When\n\nplaintiffs  finally  attempted six  weeks after  the magistrate's\n\ndecision to file a motion to  amend, they failed to follow  local\n\n                               -8-\n\nrules.   At no time did they properly  offer the court a proposed\n\namended complaint to cure the deficiencies.\n\n     Thus, by the time the district court acted on the magistrate\n\njudge's recommendation, it  had before it a flouted  order and no\n\nindication that plaintiffs were  ready to conform to Rule  8(a)'s\n\nrequirements.  Their one apparent attempt to comply -- the motion\n\nthat ran  afoul of  Local Rule  11 --  had been  abandoned.   And\n\ndefendants  already had  expended considerable  time  and expense\n\nresponding  to   the  defective   complaint.     See  Newman   v.\n                                                            \n\nCommonwealth  of  Mass., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span>  <span class=\"page\">341</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  344 (D.
