Petitioner,    Maricza\n\nElizabeth Valdez de Mansilla, a native and citizen of Guatemala,\n\npetitions    for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”)\n\norder affirming the immigration judge’s (“IJ”) decision that she\n\nwas   not   eligible    for   relief   under    §   203    of   the   Nicaraguan\n\nAdjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (“NACARA”).1\n\nShe argues the IJ erred by denying her a merits hearing to\n\ndetermine her NACARA eligibility.              We deny review for reasons\n\nstated hereafter.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Valdez de Mansilla has been in the United States multiple\n\ntimes, the first time between 1985 and 1987.                 She reentered the\n\nUnited States in June 1989 and remained through late 1996 or early\n\n1997.     During that time, she applied for asylum and filed for\n\nrelief under the American Baptist Churches class action.                See Am.\n\nBaptist Churches v. Thornburgh, 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991).\n\nBefore these claims were resolved, she left the United States and\n\n\n\n      1\n      Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193-2201 (Nov. 19, 1997) (as\namended by Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644-45 (Dec. 2, 1997)).\nNACARA allows certain aliens to apply for “special rule”\ncancellation of removal proceedings.        See, e.g., Cuadra v.\nGonzales, 417 F.3d 947, 948-49 (8th Cir. 2005). To be eligible for\nNACARA, Guatemalans such as Valdez de Mansilla must have either (1)\nfiled an asylum application before April 1, 1990, or (2) have\nentered the United States on or before October 1, 1990, and have\nregistered by December 31, 1991, as a member of the class action in\nAmerican Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D.\nCal. 1991).   8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.60, 1240.61(a)(1)(2).      Valdez de\nMansilla meets these minimum requirements.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fremained outside the United States for almost one year.                   She\n\nreturned in 1997 and remained until departing for Guatemala in\n\n2000.      She returned again on or about August 31, 2000, and was\n\nplaced     in   removal   proceedings.      She    sought    “special   rule”\n\ncancellation or suspension of removal under NACARA and also applied\n\nfor asylum and withholding.        In July 2003, she withdrew these\n\napplications after the IJ determined she was ineligible for NACARA\n\nbecause of her absences from the United States.             She departed the\n\nUnited States in August 2003 and reentered in June 2004 when she\n\nwas again placed in removal proceedings.           She sought to renew her\n\nNACARA application.\n\n             Her claim was before the IJ in June 2005.               At this\n\nhearing, the IJ noted that she had determined in July 2003 that\n\nValdez de Mansilla was ineligible for NACARA relief because of her\n\nabsence from the United States in 1997.           Valdez de Mansilla argued\n\nthat she was eligible for NACARA because she had a seven-year\n\ncontinuous presence in the United States from 1997 forward.               She\n\nacknowledged she left the United States for more than 180 days in\n\n2003 but argued “that was not a meaningfully interruptive period.”\n\nShe stated she had a constitutional right to be heard on the issue\n\nof   her   NACARA   eligibility.    After    noting    Valdez   de   Mansilla\n\nconceded she had not been in the United States for seven continuous\n\nyears, the IJ concluded she could not find Valdez de Mansilla\n\neligible because she was absent for almost a year in 1997 and she\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwas absent for more than 180 days from August 2003 through June\n\n2004.   Without opinion, the BIA affirmed the IJ’s decision.\n\n                                            II.\n\n            Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ’s\n\ndecision,    we   review   the       IJ’s     decision     directly.      Stroni   v.\n\nGonzales, 454 F.3d 82, 86-87 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Sulaiman v.\n\nGonzales, 429 F.3d 347, 350 (1st Cir. 2005)).                   We review the IJ’s\n\nfindings of fact under the substantial evidence standard, and such\n\nfindings    shall    not   be    overturned         unless     the   record   compels\n\nreversal.     Id. at 87 (citing Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2004)).        We review conclusions of law de novo, “‘with\n\nappropriate    deference        to    the    agency’s      interpretation     of   the\n\nunderlying     statute     in        accordance       with     administrative      law\n\nprinciples.’”       Id. (quoting Gailus v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 1998)).\n\n            NACARA allows aliens such as Valdez de Mansilla to apply\n\nfor “special rule” cancellation of removal proceedings if, among\n\nother things, they have been present in the United States for at\n\nleast seven years immediately preceding the date their NACARA\n\napplication    was    filed.         See     8    C.F.R.   §   1240.66(b)(2).      In\n\ninterpreting whether an alien has been present for seven years, the\n\nregulations state:\n\n            the applicant shall be considered to have failed to\n            maintain continuous physical presence in the United\n            States if he or she has departed from the United\n            States for any period in excess of 90 days or for\n\n                                            -4-\n\f              any periods in the aggregate exceeding 180 days.\n              The applicant must establish that any period of\n              absence less than 90 days was casual and innocent\n              and did not meaningfully interrupt the period of\n              continuous physical presence in the United States.\n\nId. § 1240.64(b)(2).\n\n     Valdez de Mansilla sought to renew her NACARA application\n\nduring the removal proceeding initiated in June 2004.                   But she\n\nconceded she was absent from the United States for almost one year\n\nin 1997 and more than 180 days from August 2003 through January\n\n2004. Thus, substantial evidence supports the finding that she was\n\nnot continuously in the United States for seven years immediately\n\npreceding the filing of her application, either when she initially\n\nfiled    it   or   when   she   renewed   it   during   the   instant   removal\n\nproceedings.       See Stroni, 454 F.3d at 87 (citing Romilus, 385 F.3d\n\nat 5).    Therefore, the IJ correctly ruled that Valdez de Mansilla\n\nwas ineligible for NACARA relief.           See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.64(b)(2),\n\n1240.66(b)(2).\n\n              On this petition for judicial review, Valdez de Mansilla\n\nargues she was in the United States from June 1989 through late\n\n1996 or early 1997, a continuous period of at least seven years.\n\nHowever, that fact is irrelevant.              She filed for NACARA relief\n\nduring the removal proceedings initiated in 2000 and renewed that\n\napplication during the instant removal proceedings. She was not in\n\nthe United States for a continuous period of at least seven years\n\nimmediately preceding the filing of her NACARA application.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          Accordingly, the IJ did not err in not holding a merits\n\nhearing before concluding that Valdez de Mansilla was ineligible\n\nfor NACARA relief.\n\n                              III.\n\n          For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the order of the BIA.\n\nPetition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",

See Stroni, 454 F.3d at 87 (citing Romilus, 385 F.3d\n\nat 5).    Therefore, the IJ correctly ruled that Valdez de Mansilla\n\nwas ineligible for NACARA relief.           See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.64(b)(2),\n\n1240.66(b)(2).\n\n              On this petition for judicial review, Valdez de Mansilla\n\nargues she was in the United States from June 1989 through late\n\n1996 or early 1997, a continuous period of at least seven years.\n\nHowever, that fact is irrelevant.              She filed for NACARA relief\n\nduring the removal proceedings initiated in 2000 and renewed that\n\napplication during the instant removal proceedings. She was not in\n\nthe United States for a continuous period of at least seven years\n\nimmediately preceding the filing of her NACARA application.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          Accordingly, the IJ did not err in not holding a merits\n\nhearing before concluding that Valdez de Mansilla was ineligible\n\nfor NACARA relief.\n\n                              III.\n\n          For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the order of the BIA.\n\nPetition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f</pre>",
