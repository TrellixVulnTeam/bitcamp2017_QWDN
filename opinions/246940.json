Company, 1 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 386, 388, in which case we declined to review by a writ of mandamus an order of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered April 7, 1958, reading as follows: 'Having examined the Petition for Removal, so-called, and all papers accompanying same filed therewith, the only matter that is clear to the court is that the petition must be, and it hereby is, dismissed, for, among other reasons, lack of jurisdiction.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After our decision in the foregoing case was handed down, there was some correspondence back and forth between Angus M. MacNeil, Esq., and the district court.  Finally, on October 7, 1958, Judge Aldrich made an order, which was duly entered on that date, reading as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Treating the annexed letter from counsel dated October 4, 1958 as a motion under Rule 60 (28 U.S.C.A.), or otherwise, to vacate, amend, or set aside judgment, I see no reason for so doing.  In addition to the isolated sentence quoted from the opinion of the Court of Appeals to the effect that the removal provisions of the Judicial Code make no reference to any such type of order as was here made, the opinion also points out that the Code makes no provision for removal of an action by a person who is not a defendant.  It seems obvious that the Code could not be expected to express what response or disposition should be accorded to an extraordinary petition, for which there was no original provision or authorization.  The so-called removal petition on its face never having brought the state court action here, there was nothing to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The motion is denied.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on October 29, 1958, the following notice of appeal was filed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'MacNeil Bros.

In the caption to the Notice of Appeal, these five corporations are described as 'Third Party Defendants'; but we have before us no record indicating that they ever were admitted as parties.  Indeed, the inference from the order of October 7 is that they never were made parties to the suit for redemption of certain real estate which was instituted in the state court by MacNeil Bros.

But we do not reach the merits because we think the present appeal should be dismissed for failure of appellants to follow the rules governing the prosecution of appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also stated, in MacNeil Bros. Company v. Forte, 253 F.2d at page 501:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Furthermore, appellant filed no bond on appeal as required by Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. Rule 73(c), 28 U.S.C.A.  Paragraph (a) of that Rule provides that although failure to take any of the further steps to secure the review of a judgment appealed from does not affect the validity of the appeal, it may be ground for such action as the appellate court deems appropriate, 'which may include dismissal of the appeal'.  See Hargraves v. Bowden, 9 Cir., 1954, 217 F.2d 839.  Angus M. MacNeil, as attorney, has been faced with this question of the necessity of an appeal bond in several instances including two cases numbered 4999 and 5047 wherein we dismissed the appeals on October 27, 1955, upon failure of this same appellant, MacNeil Bros. Company, to file a bond on appeal in proper form after we had ordered the same to be filed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">References to cases Nos. 4999 and 5047 show that MacNeil is thoroughly familiar with the requirements of the rules regarding cost bonds.  Nevertheless, he attempted to proceed here in disregard of these requirements.  Rule 73(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides that 'a bond for costs on appeal shall be filed with the notice of appeal.'  The rule further provides that the appeal bond 'shall have sufficient surety'.  Rule 73(e) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If a bond on appeal or a supersedeas bond is not filed within the time specified, or if the bond filed is found insufficient, and if the action is not yet docketed with the appellate court, a bond may be filed at such time before the action is so docketed as may be fixed by the district court.  After the action is so docketed, application for leave to file a bond may be made only in the appellate court.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no appeal bond 'filed with the notice of appeal' in the present case.  Therefore, before the docketing of the case in the appellate court, this defect could be cured only by a later filing, pursuant to an order of the district court, as required by Rule 73(e).  On the last day for docketing the case up here, the clerk of the district court accepted from MacNeil for filing, without any order from the district court, a so-called appeal bond.  This bond was defective in many respects, including the defects which were pointed out by the clerk of the district court in Nos. 4999 and 5047, and which led to our dismissal of the appeals in those two cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present posture of the case, it is just as though no proper appeal bond was ever filed in the district court.  That brings into play the last sentence of Rule 73(e).  'After the action is so docketed, application for leave to file a bond may be made only in the appellate court.'  A statement in the memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss may perhaps have been intended as a formal application to this court.  If so, we deny such application as a matter of discretion, in view of our past experiences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems impossible for MacNeil to present appeals to this court unembarrassed by some procedural snarl; and the present case is no exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An order will be entered dismissing the appeal for lack of diligent prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
