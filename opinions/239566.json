It affirmatively appears that said action might have been brought in the District to which it was transferred, and that such transfer vests jurisdiction in the District Court for such District. It further appears that in making the transfer the District Court considered the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interest of justice, and did not abuse its discretion.
