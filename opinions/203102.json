Miles and\n\nGeorge Hamacher appeal pro se from the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment dismissing their federal claim pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1983 for failure to make the requisite showing that the\n\nalleged deprivation of constitutional rights was committed under\n\ncolor of state law, and dismissing their state law claims without\n\nprejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on their\n\nfailure to demonstrate the requisite amount in controversy to\n\nsupport diversity jurisdiction.1\n\n          \"'We review a district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmovant.'   Summary   judgment   is    warranted   'if   the   pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.'    'We may affirm a summary judgment\n\ndecision on any basis apparent in the record.'\" Perry v. Wolaver,\n\n506 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2007) (citations omitted).\n\n          I. Dismissal of Section 1983 Claim: State Action\n\n          Appellants rely upon the following alleged conduct to\n\nestablish state action: \"the state court's actions, enforcing\n\nAppellees' Settlement offer and appointing a Commissioner to sign\n\n\n     1\n       Although one of the state law claims (Count XII) was\ndismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim, appellants\ndo not specifically challenged that ruling in their briefs.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe Settlement offer and to execute a deed to [Clarice Neumann's]\n\nreal estate . . . , which clearly provided Appellees with color of\n\nstate action justifying federal jurisdiction.\" Appellants' Brief at\n\n10.\n\n               There are two components to the \"state\n          action\" requirement:\n          \"First, the deprivation must be caused by the\n          exercise of some right or privilege created by\n          the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by\n          the State or by a person for whom the State is\n          responsible. . . . .\n          Second, the party charged with the deprivation\n          must be a person who may fairly be said to be\n          a state actor. This may be because he is a\n          state official, because he has acted together\n          with or has obtained significant aid from\n          state officials, or because his conduct is\n          otherwise chargeable to the State.\"\n\nCasa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of Puerto Rico for Dist. of\n\nArecibo, 988 F.2d 252, 258 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Lugar v.\n\nEdmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982)).\n\n          Appellants claim that their deprivation was caused by the\n\nappellees'   use   of   state   court   to   enforce   an   allegedly\n\nunconstitutional settlement agreement. However, we have said that\n\n\"something more than resort to state court is required to transform\n\nthe moving party into 'a co-conspirator or a joint actor with the\n\njudge.'\" Id. at 259.    Appellants did not allege that the procedure\n\nfor enforcement of settlement agreements under New Hampshire state\n\nlaw is unconstitutional.    Allegations of private misuse of state\n\nprocedures is not enough.       See Gonzales-Morales v. Hernandez-\n\nArencibia, 221 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2000).    Appellants' reliance\n\n                                 -3-\n\fupon Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., Inc., 500 U.S. 614 (1991),\n\nwhich held that the exercise of peremptory challenges by a private\n\nlitigant in a civil case constituted \"state action,\" is misplaced.\n\nThe Court specifically stated there that \"private use of state-\n\nsanctioned private remedies or procedures does not rise, by itself,\n\nto the level of state action.\" Id. at 622.\n\n          For essentially the reasons stated by the district court\n\nin its May 30, 2006 Order, we agree that there are no genuine\n\nissues as to any material fact with respect to the \"state action\"\n\nrequirement and that defendants are entitled to summary judgment as\n\na matter of law on Count I of the complaint (ยง 1983 claim).\n\n          II. Dismissal of State Law Claims: Amount in Controversy\n\n          \"We review de novo the district court's dismissal for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.\"    Spielman v. Genzyme Corp.,\n\n251 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2001).        Appellants, \"as the part[ies]\n\nseeking to invoke jurisdiction . . . ha[ve] the burden of showing\n\nthat [they] ha[ve] met the statutory requirements.\" Id. Where, as\n\nin this case, the \"amount in controversy\" allegation is questioned,\n\n\"'the party seeking to invoke jurisdiction has the burden of\n\nalleging with sufficient particularity facts indicating that it is\n\nnot a legal certainty that the claim involves less than the\n\njurisdictional amount.'\"   Id. at 5.\n\n          Appellants' brief challenges the district court's \"amount\n\nin controversy\" ruling on the grounds that 1) the plaintiffs'\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fresponse to interrogatories identified the amount of damages that\n\nthe parties to the state court suit expected \"would accrue to the\n\ninterest of the Association (VWTOA)\" as $1,496,000, plus attorneys'\n\nfees,    and     2)    the    district     court      failed    to    recognize    that\n\n\"Appellants' 'rights and recoveries' in the state court litigation\n\nwere a common, single and undivided claim.\" Appellants' Brief at\n\n14.\n\n               \"Courts have repeatedly held that the value of the matter\n\nin controversy is measured . . . by the [potential] judgment's\n\npecuniary      consequences        to   those    involved      in    the   litigation.\"\n\nRichard C. Young & Co., Ltd. v. Leventhal, 389 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2004). In the present action, only the three individual plaintiffs\n\nwere \"involved in the litigation.\"                   As the district court noted,\n\n\"[t]he instant action was not brought as a class action or as a\n\nderivative action.           The . . . plaintiffs do not allege any basis in\n\nthe Complaint for finding that they have standing to recover\n\ndamages on behalf of anyone other than themselves.\" District Court\n\nOrder, 7/20/06, Dkt No. 56, p. 6.\n\n               Nor    was    the   state   court      action    a    class    action   or\n\nderivative action.           The Bill in Equity was specifically amended to\n\nclarify that there was only one petitioner: Clarice Neumann.                            A\n\nsubsequent motion by Attorney Ramsdell to amend the Bill in Equity\n\nto    assert    claims       derivatively       on   behalf    of    the     Village   of\n\nWinnipesaukee Timeshare Owners Association (VWTOA) members was\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fdenied   by    the   Superior   Court.   See   id.,   p.   16.     Therefore,\n\nplaintiffs' reliance upon amounts that allegedly could have been\n\nrecovered on their behalf in the state court action is unfounded.\n\n              Appellants rely upon the principle that \"when several\n\nplaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right in which they\n\nhave a common and undivided interest, it is enough if their\n\ninterests collectively equal the jurisdictional amount.\"              Pinel v.\n\nPinel, 240 U.S. 594, 596 (1916); see 15 James Wm. Moore, Moore's\n\nFederal Practice ยง 102.108[3][b] (3d ed.) (\"aggregation of damages\n\nallegedly owed to separate plaintiffs may be permitted in the\n\nlimited situation in which two or more plaintiffs unite to enforce\n\na single title or right in which they have a common and undivided\n\ninterest\"). However, even if such aggregation were permitted here,\n\nit would not excuse the plaintiffs from the need to identify their\n\nindividual pecuniary interests which they seek to aggregate.             They\n\nhave not done so.\n\n              For the above reasons, and those stated by the district\n\ncourt in its Order dated July 20, 2006, we conclude that the\n\nplaintiffs failed to allege \"with sufficient particularity facts\n\nindicating that it is not a legal certainty\" that the state law\n\nclaims involve less than the jurisdictional amount.              Spielman, 251\n\nF.3d at 5.\n\n              The district court's grant of summary judgment dismissing\n\nCounts I and XII of the complaint with prejudice and dismissing\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fCounts II - XI of the complaint without prejudice for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",
