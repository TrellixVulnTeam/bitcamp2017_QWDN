Robinson González-Mesías, a native\n\nand citizen of Chile, petitions for review of an August 2, 2007\n\ndecision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") finding him\n\nineligible for a waiver of deportability, under section 212(c) of\n\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)\n\n(repealed in 1996 but applicable to petitioner).        We deny the\n\npetition on the basis of our prior circuit precedent, which rejects\n\nthe Second Circuit's rule in Blake v. Carbone, 489 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.\n\n2007).   See Dalombo Fontes v. Gonzales, 483 F.3d 115 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); Kim v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 58 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                  I.\n\n            González-Mesías entered the United States in 1978 on a\n\ntourist visa, and a year later, he became a lawful permanent\n\nresident.    In 1985, González-Mesías pled guilty in Virginia state\n\ncourt to two felonies: one count of aggravated sexual battery, Va.\n\nCode § 18.2-67.3, and one count of sodomy, id. § 18.2-67.1.   He was\n\nsentenced to ten years' imprisonment on each charge with the\n\nsentences to run concurrently.    The court suspended nine years and\n\n335 days of each sentence.\n\n            In January 2005, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\ninitiated removal proceedings against González-Mesías.    The agency\n\ncharged González-Mesías with removability, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.\n\nThe first charge was based on his 1985 conviction for aggravated\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fsexual battery, tying it to the definition of aggravated felony in\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A) (\"murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a\n\nminor\"). The second charge was based on the 1985 sodomy conviction\n\nand was tied to 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) (\"a crime of violence .\n\n. . for which the term of imprisonment [was] at least one year\").1\n\n              González-Mesías   conceded   his    removability    to    the\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") as to the first charge, but challenged the\n\nsecond charge, arguing that his sodomy conviction was not for a\n\n\"crime   of    violence.\"   The   IJ   found   that   González-Mesías   was\n\ndeportable on both grounds, and denied the petitioner's application\n\nfor a waiver of deportation under former INA section 212(c), 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(c), finding that González-Mesías was ineligible.\n\n              The IJ relied on two BIA decisions, In re Brieva, 23 I.\n\n& N. Dec. 766 (B.I.A. 2005), and In re Blake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722\n\n(B.I.A. 2005), which limit waivers of deportation under section\n\n212(c) to only those grounds of deportability for which there is a\n\ncomparable ground of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2).\n\nThe IJ held that González-Mesías was barred from relief because his\n\ntwo grounds of deportability, sexual abuse of a minor and a crime\n\nof violence, had no comparable grounds of inadmissibility.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          The Notice To Appear also included a third charge, that\nGonzález-Mesías was deportable as an alien convicted of a crime of\ndomestic violence, under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), but this\ncharge was later withdrawn.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f              González-Mesías appealed to the BIA. He asked the BIA to\n\nreconsider its rulings in Brieva and Blake in light of the Second\n\nCircuit's     decision    in   Blake    v.     Carbone,   489   F.3d   88,    which\n\ndisagreed with the \"comparable grounds\" test set out in Brieva and\n\nBlake. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision and rejected\n\nthe appeal.      It declined to overrule its decisions in Brieva and\n\nBlake, and while it recognized the Second Circuit's decision to the\n\ncontrary, the BIA noted that it \"decline[d] to follow the Second\n\nCircuit's holding in cases arising outside of that Circuit.\"                   This\n\ntimely petition followed.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              Our jurisdiction is limited by the provisions of the REAL\n\nID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005).                     Under\n\nit, we may review only constitutional claims or questions of law\n\nraised   by    criminal    aliens      under    removal   orders.      8     U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D).\n\n              Our review of constitutional issues is de novo; our\n\nreview of issues of law gives deference to the BIA's interpretation\n\nof the immigration statutes it is charged with enforcing.                    INS v.\n\nAguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424 (1999).\n\n              González-Mesías's main argument is that we should adopt\n\nthe Second Circuit's rationale in Blake v. Carbone and overrule the\n\n\"comparable grounds\" test. He recognizes, however, that this would\n\nrequire us to overrule two prior First Circuit cases, Dalombo\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fFontes, 483 F.3d 115, and Kim, 468 F.3d 58.               The arguments that\n\nGonzález-Mesías makes were squarely presented in both Dalombo\n\nFontes and Kim.   Those cases affirmed the BIA's rule in Brieva and\n\nrejected the arguments that the Second Circuit adopted in Blake v.\n\nCarbone and that González-Mesías repeats here. See Dalombo Fontes,\n\n483 F.3d at 122-23; Kim, 468 F.3d at 61-63.              Our upholding of the\n\nBIA's comparable grounds test is consistent with rules adopted by\n\nthe Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.\n\nSee Caroleo v. Gonzales, 476 F.3d 158 (3d Cir. 2007); Vo v.\n\nGonzales, 482 F.3d 363 (5th Cir. 2007); Valere v. Gonzales, 473\n\nF.3d 757 (7th Cir. 2007); Abebe v. Gonzales, 493 F.3d 1092 (9th\n\nCir. 2007); Falaniko v. Mukasey, No. 07-9516, 2008 WL 1696968 (10th\n\nCir. Apr. 9, 2008) (unpublished opinion); Rubio v. U.S. Attorney\n\nGen., 182 F. App'x 925 (11th Cir. 2006).          Only the Second Circuit's\n\ndecision in Blake v. Carbone is at odds.\n\n           Regardless of the merits of González-Mesías's arguments\n\n(and we do not find them convincing), we are bound by the law of\n\nthe circuit doctrine.     That doctrine \"holds a prior panel decision\n\ninviolate absent either the occurrence of a controlling intervening\n\nevent (e.g., a Supreme Court opinion on the point; a ruling of the\n\ncircuit,   sitting   en   banc;   or    a    statutory   overruling)   or,   in\n\nextremely rare circumstances, where non-controlling but persuasive\n\ncase law suggests such a course.\"             United States v. Chhien, 266\n\nF.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f          González-Mesías argues that our decisions in Dalombo\n\nFontes and Kim are contrary to the Supreme Court's decision in INS\n\nv. St. Cyr, 522 U.S. 289 (2001).           First, St. Cyr precedes our\n\ndecisions in Dalombo Fontes and Kim, and therefore is not a\n\ncontrolling intervening event which would allow this panel to\n\noverrule the two cases in the absence of an en banc sitting of this\n\ncourt.   Second, in both those cases, we specifically analyzed St.\n\nCyr and held that the comparable grounds test was consistent with\n\nthe Court's reasoning in St. Cyr.        See Dalombo Fontes, 483 F.3d at\n\n122-23; Kim, 468 F.3d at 61-63.\n\n          To   the   extent   González-Mesías    is   making   independent\n\nconstitutional arguments, they are without merit.               The BIA's\n\ndecisions in Blake and Brieva are not inconsistent with prior\n\nprecedent and they have not been applied in an arbitrary and\n\ncapricious manner to González-Mesias.        And because he was treated\n\nthe same as similarly situated aliens, there is no equal protection\n\nviolation.   See Dalombo Fontes, 483 F.3d at 123; Kim, 468 F.3d at\n\n62.\n\n          The petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f",

The second charge was based on the 1985 sodomy conviction and was tied to 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) (\"a crime of violence . . . for which the term of imprisonment [was] at least one year\").<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> González-Mesías conceded his removability to the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") as to the first charge, but challenged the second charge, arguing that his sodomy conviction was not for a \"crime of violence.\" The IJ found that González-Mesías was deportable on both grounds, and denied the petitioner's application for a waiver of deportation under former INA section 212(c), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), finding that González-Mesías was ineligible.</p>\n<p>The IJ relied on two BIA decisions, <i>In re Brieva-Perez,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766 (B.I.A.2005), and <i>In re Blake,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (B.I.A.2005), which limit waivers of deportation under section 212(c) to only those grounds of deportability for which there is a comparable ground of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2). The IJ held that González-Mesías was barred from relief because his two grounds of deportability, sexual abuse of a minor and a crime of violence, had no comparable grounds of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p>González-Mesías appealed to the BIA. He asked the BIA to reconsider its rulings in <i>Brieva</i> and <i>Blake</i> in light of the Second Circuit's decision in <i>Blake v. Carbone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797989\"><a href=\"/opinion/797989/leroy-blake-v-john-p-carbone-field-officer-director-of-new-york-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, which disagreed with the \"comparable grounds\" test set out in <i>Brieva</i> and <i>Blake.</i> The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision and rejected the appeal. It declined to overrule its decisions in <i>Brieva</i> and <i>Blake,</i> and while it recognized the Second Circuit's decision to the contrary, the BIA noted that it \"decline[d] to follow the Second Circuit's holding in cases arising outside of that Circuit.\" This timely petition followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Our jurisdiction is limited by the provisions of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005). Under it, we may review only constitutional claims or questions of law raised by criminal aliens under removal orders. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D).</p>\n<p>Our review of constitutional issues is de novo; our review of issues of law gives deference to the BIA's interpretation of the immigration statutes it is charged with enforcing. <i>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span> (1999).</p>\n<p>González-Mesías's main argument is that we should adopt the Second Circuit's rationale in <i>Blake v. Carbone</i> and overrule the \"comparable grounds\" test. He recognizes, however, that this would require us to overrule two prior First Circuit cases, <i>Dalombo Fontes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202683\"><a href=\"/opinion/202683/fontes-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, and <i>Kim,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202503\"><a href=\"/opinion/202503/kim-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>. The arguments that González-Mesías makes were squarely presented in both <i>Dalombo Fontes</i> and <i>Kim.</i> Those cases affirmed the BIA's rule in <i>Brieva</i> and rejected the arguments that the Second Circuit adopted in <i>Blake v. Carbone</i> and that González-Mesías repeats here. <i>See </i><i>Dalombo Fontes,</i> 483 F.3d at 122-23; <i>Kim,</i> 468 F.3d at 61-63. Our upholding of the BIA's comparable grounds test is consistent with rules adopted by the Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits. <i>See </i><i>Caroleo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796747\"><a href=\"/opinion/796747/salvatore-caroleo-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 2007); <i>Vo v.

Apr.9, 2008) (unpublished opinion); <i>Rubio v. U.S. Attorney Gen.,</i> 182 Fed.Appx. 925 (11th Cir. 2006). Only the Second Circuit's decision in <i>Blake v. Carbone</i> is at odds.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> Regardless of the merits of González-Mesías's arguments (and we do not find them convincing), we are bound by the law of the circuit doctrine. That doctrine \"holds a prior panel decision inviolate absent either the occurrence of a controlling intervening event (e.g., a Supreme Court opinion on the point; a ruling of the circuit, sitting en banc; or a statutory overruling) or, in extremely rare circumstances, where non-controlling but persuasive case law suggests such a course.\" <i>United States v. Chhien,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199609\"><a href=\"/opinion/199609/united-states-v-chhien/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>González-Mesías argues that our decisions in <i>Dalombo Fontes</i> and <i>Kim</i> are contrary to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2271</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (2001). First, <i>St. Cyr</i> precedes our decisions in <i>Dalombo Fontes</i> and <i>Kim,</i> and therefore is not a controlling intervening event which would allow this panel to overrule the two cases in the absence of an en banc sitting of this court. Second, in both those cases, we specifically analyzed <i>St. Cyr</i> and held that the comparable grounds test was consistent with the Court's reasoning in <i>St. Cyr. See </i><i>Dalombo Fontes,</i> 483 F.3d at 122-23; <i>Kim,</i> 468 F.3d at 61-63.</p>\n<p>To the extent González-Mesías is making independent constitutional arguments, they are without merit. The BIA's decisions in <i>Blake</i> and <i>Brieva</i> are not inconsistent with prior precedent and they have not been applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner to González-Mesias. And because he was treated the same as similarly situated aliens, there is no equal protection violation. <i>See </i><i>Dalombo Fontes,</i> 483 F.3d at 123; <i>Kim,</i> 468 F.3d at 62.</p>\n<p>The petition is denied.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Notice To Appear also included a third charge, that González-Mesías was deportable as an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence, under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), but this charge was later withdrawn.</p>\n\n</div>",
