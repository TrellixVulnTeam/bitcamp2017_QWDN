Rinden for appellee.\n\n\n                         April 22, 2003\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.          Joseph and Janet A. Bova appeal\n\na decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the First Circuit\n\n(\"BAP\") holding that a New Hampshire state court judgment enforcing\n\nJoseph Bova's outstanding criminal restitution obligation to the\n\nSt. Vincent De Paul Corporation was nondischargeable under Section\n\n13 of the Bankruptcy Code.          We agree that Bova's debt is not\n\ndischargeable and, accordingly, affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           The     facts   relevant    to     our   analysis   are   largely\n\nundisputed.   The matter arises from Joseph Bova's embezzlement of\n\n$104,000 from his former employer, St. Vincent De Paul, during the\n\n1980s.    The State of Illinois prosecuted Bova in Du Page County\n\nCircuit Court, and, on May 17, 1993, Bova pleaded guilty to theft.\n\nThe sentencing court placed him on probation in lieu of prison and,\n\nattendant to his sentence, ordered Bova to pay restitution to St.\n\nVincent De Paul in the amount of $104,000.\n\n            Upon completion of Bova's probation term in 1998, the\n\ncourt    entered   judgment   for     the    outstanding   balance   on   his\n\nrestitution obligation of $69,451.          Thereafter, Bova ceased making\n\nrestitution payments.\n\n            Confronted with Bova's delinquency, St. Vincent De Paul\n\nbrought suit against him in New Hampshire Superior Court (\"the\n\nsuperior court\"), seeking to enforce the Illinois restitution\n\norder.    On May 17, 2000, the New Hampshire court allowed St.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fVincent De Paul's motion for summary judgment on the ground that,\n\nunder Illinois law, St. Vincent De Paul could enforce the criminal\n\nrestitution order in a civil proceeding.             The court awarded St.\n\nVincent De Paul $69,451, plus costs and interest, contingent upon\n\nits producing an attested copy of the Illinois judgment.\n\n           On July 25, 2000, Bova and his wife filed a Chapter 7\n\nbankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\n\nDistrict of New Hampshire. A short time later, St. Vincent De Paul\n\nfiled an adversary action in the bankruptcy proceeding, objecting\n\nto the discharge of the superior court judgment.              In due course,\n\nthe Bovas moved to convert their case to a Chapter 13 petition, and\n\nSt. Vincent De Paul amended its complaint to bring its allegation\n\nof   nondischargeability     under     the    Bankruptcy     Code   provision\n\nappropriate for a Chapter 13 petition, 11 U.S.C. § 1328(a)(3). The\n\nstatute   excepts   from   discharge       debts   \"for   restitution,   or   a\n\ncriminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor's conviction of\n\na crime.\" Id.\n\n           The bankruptcy court subsequently awarded St. Vincent De\n\nPaul summary judgment, holding that the debt arising from the\n\nrestitution obligation was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 1328.\n\nThe Bovas appealed this judgment to the BAP, arguing that the\n\nIllinois judgment had expired pursuant to an Illinois statute which\n\nallegedly established a five-year statute of limitation on criminal\n\nrestitution orders.    Alternatively, the Bovas contended that the\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fIllinois judgment had, by operation of Illinois law, become civil\n\nafter five years, and St. Vincent De Paul was barred by judicial\n\nestoppel from claiming nondischargeability under § 1328(a)(3),\n\nwhich pertains to criminal judgments, after previously seeking to\n\nenforce the Illinois judgment by means of a civil judgment it filed\n\nin New Hampshire.\n\n           The BAP rejected the Bovas' arguments and        held that the\n\nNew   Hampshire   state    court   judgment   enforcing   the   outstanding\n\nbalance on the criminal restitution order was nondischargeable\n\nunder § 1328(a)(3).       In reaching that conclusion, the BAP rejected\n\nthe argument that Illinois law contained a five-year statute of\n\nlimitations for criminal restitution judgments or transformed them\n\ninto civil judgments after five years.         The BAP also rejected the\n\nBovas' judicial estoppel theory, finding no inconsistency in St.\n\nVincent De Paul's pursuit of a civil judgment to secure the unpaid\n\nbalance on an Illinois restitution order and its claim that the\n\norder was nondischargeable.        The Bovas then brought the present\n\nappeal, in which they reiterate the arguments made below.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           We start with the Bovas' contention that, under Illinois\n\nlaw, a criminal restitution judgment expires after five years. The\n\nstatute in question states that a sentencing court \"shall fix a\n\nperiod of time not in excess of 5 years within which payment of\n\nrestitution is to be paid in full.\"           730 Ill. Comp. Stat.     5/5-\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f5/6(f) (emphasis added). The Bovas posit that this statute has the\n\neffect   of    making   Illinois    restitution      judgments   effective    as\n\ncriminal judgments for only five years.\n\n              We do not read the statute as setting forth an expiration\n\ndate for criminal restitution orders.              Rather, it acts to ensure\n\nthat sentencing      judges   do    not    set   unduly   long   schedules   for\n\nsatisfying restitution obligations.                The Illinois courts have\n\nrejected the Bovas' reading of the statute, People v. Harris, 319\n\nIll. App.3d 534, 536 (2001), and so do we.\n\n              The Bovas' alternative argument is that, under Illinois\n\nlaw, Illinois restitution judgments not paid within five years lose\n\ntheir \"criminal\" characteristics and become enforceable solely as\n\ncivil judgments.        The statute states that \"[a] restitution order\n\nunder this Section is a judgment lien in favor of the victim that\n\n. . . [e]xpires in the same manner as a judgment lien created in a\n\ncivil proceeding.\"       730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5/6(m)(4).         The Bovas\n\nread this statute as causing restitution judgments to shed their\n\ncriminal      characteristics      after    five    years.1      Again,   their\n\nconstruction of the statute is not persuasive.\n\n              While an Illinois restitution judgment operates like a\n\n\"judgment lien created in a civil proceeding,\" 730 Ill. Comp. Stat.\n\n5/5-5/6(m)(4), it does not lose its criminal character through the\n\n\n     1\n        The Bovas contend that once a criminal restitution order\n\"expires\" under Illinois law, it remains enforceable as a civil\njudgment.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fpassage of time.       Indeed, the fact that a restitution order\n\n\"expires in the same manner\" as a civil judgment lien suggests that\n\nit is not a civil judgment.2    The statute in question provides for\n\na civil enforcement mechanism designed to assist crime victims in\n\ncircumstances such as these.3\n\n                                  III.\n\n           Bova's restitution obligation to St. Vincent De Paul was\n\npart of his criminal sentence.     People v. Brooks, 158 Ill.2d 269,\n\n265 (1994) (noting that \"under our criminal statutes, restitution\n\nis a sentence and a part of the sentencing scheme\").          In the New\n\nHampshire Superior Court, St. Vincent De Paul neither pursued a new\n\ncause of action nor attempted to litigate the facts underlying the\n\ncriminal   judgment.    Rather,   it     sought   only   extraterritorial\n\nenforcement of an Illinois criminal judgment. Because we find that\n\nSt. Vincent De Paul sought only to enforce the Illinois restitution\n\n     2\n        There are important differences between a criminal\nrestitution judgment and a civil judgment.      Restitution, for\nexample, is only ordered attendant to a determination of guilt.\nMoreover, sentencing courts have the authority to modify criminal\nrestitution orders. See United States v. Timilty, 148 F.3d 1,4\n(1st Cir. 1998) (distinguishing restitution orders from civil\njudgments).\n     3\n       In other contexts, courts of appeals have held that a\nstatutory civil enforcement provision does not transform a criminal\nrestitution order into a civil judgment. E.g., Timilty, 148 F.3d at\n4; United States v. Dubose, 146 F.3d 1141, 1148 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(construing Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. §\n3663A(b)(1)(B)); United States v. Brown, 744 F.2d 905, 910 (2d.\nCir. 1984)(construing Victim Witness and Protection Act, 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 3579, 3580).\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\forder in its New Hampshire action, we need say nothing further\n\nabout the Bovas' argument that judicial estoppel bars St. Vincent\n\nDe Paul from asserting that the order at issue is nondischargeable\n\nin bankruptcy.   The BAP therefore properly concluded that the New\n\nHampshire judgment is nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §\n\n1328(a)(3).\n\n          Affirmed.

The sentencing court placed him on probation in lieu of prison and, attendant to his sentence, ordered Bova to pay restitution to St. Vincent De Paul in the amount of $104,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon completion of Bova's probation term in 1998, the court entered judgment for the outstanding balance on his restitution obligation of $69,451. Thereafter, Bova ceased making restitution payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confronted with Bova's delinquency, St. Vincent De Paul brought suit against him in New Hampshire Superior Court (\"the superior court\"), seeking to enforce the Illinois restitution order. On May 17, 2000, the New Hampshire court allowed St. Vincent De Paul's motion for summary judgment on the ground that, under Illinois law, St. Vincent De Paul could enforce the criminal restitution order in a civil proceeding. The court awarded St. Vincent De Paul $69,451, plus costs and interest, contingent upon its producing an attested copy of the Illinois judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 2000, Bova and his wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Hampshire. A short time later, St. Vincent De Paul filed an adversary action in the bankruptcy proceeding, objecting to the discharge of the superior court judgment. In due course, the Bovas moved to convert their case to a Chapter 13 petition, and St. Vincent De Paul amended its complaint to bring its allegation of nondischargeability under the Bankruptcy Code provision appropriate for a Chapter 13 petition, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1328(a)(3). The statute excepts from discharge debts \"for restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor's conviction of a crime.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court subsequently awarded St. Vincent De Paul summary judgment, holding that the debt arising from the restitution obligation was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1328. The Bovas appealed this judgment to the BAP, arguing that the Illinois judgment had expired pursuant to an Illinois statute which allegedly established a five-year statute of limitation on criminal restitution orders. Alternatively, the Bovas contended that the Illinois judgment had, by operation of Illinois law, become civil after five years, and St. Vincent De Paul was barred by judicial estoppel from claiming nondischargeability under &#167; 1328(a)(3), which pertains to criminal judgments, after previously seeking to enforce the Illinois judgment by means of a civil judgment it filed in New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BAP rejected the Bovas' arguments and held that the New Hampshire state court judgment enforcing the outstanding balance on the criminal restitution order was nondischargeable under &#167; 1328(a)(3). In reaching that conclusion, the BAP rejected the argument that Illinois law contained a five-year statute of limitations for criminal restitution judgments or transformed them into civil judgments after five years. The BAP also rejected the Bovas' judicial estoppel theory, finding no inconsistency in St. Vincent De Paul's pursuit of a civil judgment to secure the unpaid balance on an Illinois restitution order and its claim that the order was nondischargeable. The Bovas then brought the present appeal, in which they reiterate the arguments made below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the Bovas' contention that, under Illinois law, a criminal restitution judgment expires after five years. The statute in question states that a sentencing court \"shall fix a period of time <i>not in excess of 5 years</i> within which payment of restitution is to be paid in full.\" 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5/6(f) (emphasis added). The Bovas posit that this statute has the effect of making Illinois restitution judgments effective as criminal judgments for only five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not read the statute as setting forth an expiration date for criminal restitution orders. Rather, it acts to ensure that sentencing judges do not set unduly long schedules for satisfying restitution obligations. The Illinois courts have rejected the Bovas' reading of the statute, <i>People v. Harris,</i> 319 Ill.App.3d 534, 536, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2181980\"><a href=\"/opinion/2181980/people-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2181980\"><a href=\"/opinion/2181980/people-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span> (2001), and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bovas' alternative argument is that, under Illinois law, Illinois restitution judgments not paid within five years lose their \"criminal\" characteristics and become enforceable solely as civil judgments. The statute states that \"[a] restitution order under this Section is a judgment lien in favor of the victim that ... [e]xpires in the same manner as a judgment lien created in a civil proceeding.\" 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5/6(m)(4). The Bovas read this statute as causing restitution judgments to shed their criminal characteristics after five years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Again, their construction of the statute is not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an Illinois restitution judgment operates like a \"judgment lien created in a civil proceeding,\" 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5/6(m)(4), it does not lose its criminal character through the passage of time. Indeed, the fact that a restitution order \"expires in the <i>same manner</i>\" as a civil judgment lien suggests that it is <i>not</i> a civil judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The statute in question provides for a civil enforcement mechanism designed to <i>assist</i> crime victims in circumstances such as these.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bova's restitution obligation to St. Vincent De Paul was part of his criminal sentence. <i>People v. Brooks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2218866\"><a href=\"/opinion/2218866/people-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span>, 265, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2218866\"><a href=\"/opinion/2218866/people-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

In the New Hampshire Superior Court, St. Vincent De Paul neither pursued a new cause of action nor attempted to litigate the facts underlying the criminal judgment. Rather, it sought only extraterritorial enforcement of an Illinois criminal judgment. Because we find that St. Vincent De Paul sought only to enforce the Illinois restitution order in its New Hampshire action, we need say nothing further about the Bovas' argument that judicial estoppel bars St. Vincent De Paul from asserting that the order at issue is nondischargeable in bankruptcy. The BAP therefore properly concluded that the New Hampshire judgment is nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1328(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Bovas contend that once a criminal restitution order \"expires\" under Illinois law, it remains enforceable as a civil judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There are important differences between a criminal restitution judgment and a civil judgment.
