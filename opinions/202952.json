Defendant     Carlos    Espinola    (\"Espinola\")\n\nappeals     from    his     148-month,      below-guidelines          sentence     for\n\nconspiring to distribute oxycodone1 in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a), 846.       On appeal, Espinola seeks resentencing on the\n\ngrounds that the district court (1) violated his due process rights\n\nby making factual findings by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nrather    than    beyond   a   reasonable      doubt;     (2)   clearly   erred     in\n\ncalculating the drug amount attributable to him and in finding that\n\nhe possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense; (3)\n\nviolated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(1)(a) by failing\n\nto verify that he had read and discussed the Presentence Report\n\n(\"PSR\") with his counsel; (4) abused its discretion in refusing his\n\nmid-sentencing request for a continuance to gather additional\n\nevidence;    and    (5)    erred    in   giving    presumptive      weight   to    the\n\nguidelines.      We will consider those arguments in that order.\n\n            Espinola's       argument     that    due     process   requires      that\n\nsentencing-enhancing facts, including drug weight, be found beyond\n\na reasonable doubt has already been rejected by this court in\n\nUnited States v. Malouf, 466 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2006) (decided\n\nafter United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005)), cert. denied,\n\n127 S. Ct. 1892 (2007).            See also United States v. Goodine, 326\n\n\n\n     1\n      Oxycodone is a Schedule II drug, see 21 U.S.C. § 812(c); 21\nC.F.R. § 1308.12, marketed as OxyContin, United States v. Wall, 349\nF.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fF.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding the \"tail-wagging-the-dog\"\n\nrationale for a higher burden of proof inapplicable to judicial\n\ndeterminations of drug weight).          This panel is not free to revisit\n\nthe issue.       Malouf, 466 F.3d at 27.\n\n            We review the district court's factual findings for clear\n\nerror.    United States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 141 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nUnder that highly deferential standard of review, \"if there are two\n\nplausible views of the record, the sentencing court's choice\n\nbetween them cannot be clearly erroneous.\"              Id.     Deference to a\n\ndistrict    court's     determination    of    drug   weight   for     sentencing\n\npurposes is particularly appropriate since \"a determination need\n\nnot be exact, but, rather, may be approximate, as long as the\n\napproximation represents a reasoned estimate.\"             Id.      Nor must the\n\ndistrict court \"discuss the reasoning underpinning its factual\n\nfinding     as     to   amount   (e.g.,       inferences      and     credibility\n\ndeterminations).\" United States v. Navedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d 54,\n\n59 (1st Cir. 2006).      The standard     for increasing the offense level\n\nwhere a firearm is possessed in connection with a drug offense is\n\nsimilarly undemanding; the \"adjustment should be applied if the\n\nweapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon\n\nwas connected with the offense.\" U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, comment. (n.3).\n\n            Under those standards, the challenged factual findings\n\nreadily withstand appellate review.             Our review of the record,\n\nincluding    the    transcript   of     Espinola's    trial,     at    which   the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fsentencing judge presided, confirms that the district court's\n\nestimate of drug weight was reasonable, conservative, and amply\n\nsupported by the evidence.      We also find reasonable the court's\n\ninference that the gun that Espinola undisputedly possessed for\n\nsecurity during drug transactions was real rather than a toy or a\n\nreplica.\n\n           Espinola next faults the district court for failing, at\n\nsentencing, to \"verify that the defendant and the defendant's\n\nattorney ha[d] read and discussed the presentence report and any\n\naddendum to the report,\" as required by Rule 32(i)(1)(A) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because this argument was not\n\nraised below, we review only for plain error, United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-34 (1993), and find none.      Where, as here,\n\nit is clear from the record that Espinola's counsel was thoroughly\n\nfamiliar with the PSR, \"we will not assume that defense counsel did\n\nnot discuss so critically important a document with his client,\n\nespecially since appellant claims no such dereliction.\"           United\n\nStates v. Cruz, 981 F.2d 613, 620 (1st Cir. 1992).               Nor has\n\nEspinola alleged, much less shown, any prejudice warranting relief\n\nunder the plain error standard.         See United States v. Esparza-\n\nGonzalez, 268 F.3d 272, 273-74 (5th Cir. 2001). As another circuit\n\nrecognized   under   similar   circumstances,   \"[t]o   remand   when   no\n\nprejudice exists is to require the district court to undergo an\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fexercise in futility in order to obtain the same sentence.\" United\n\nStates v. Rangel-Arreola, 991 F.2d 1519, 1526 n.5 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\n            Espinola next argues that the district court's failure to\n\ngrant his mid-sentencing request for a continuance warrants a\n\nremand for resentencing.            Requests for continuances of sentencing\n\nare disfavored given the district court's obligation to \"impose\n\nsentence without unnecessary delay.\"                Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(1).\n\n\"A trial court has wide discretion to grant or deny a request for\n\ncontinuance, and so . . . '[o]nly an unreasoning and arbitrary\n\ninsistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable\n\nrequest for delay' would amount to an abuse of that discretion.\"\n\nUnited States v. Fink, 2007 WL 2326822, at *7 (1st Cir. Aug. 16,\n\n2007).      The    issue    on     which    Espinola      sought    time   to   gather\n\nadditional evidence was mentioned in the PSR, which his counsel\n\nreceived approximately a month before sentencing, and was also\n\nraised in Espinola's sentencing memorandum, filed two weeks before\n\nsentencing.       Yet Espinola did not seek a continuance until the\n\ncourt    ruled    against    him    on     this   issue    during    the   sentencing\n\nhearing.          Under     those     circumstances,         there     was      nothing\n\n\"unreasoning\" or \"arbitrary\" about proceeding with the sentencing\n\nthat day.\n\n            Finally, Espinola argues that the district court erred in\n\ncharacterizing the applicable guidelines range as \"presumptive.\"\n\nIn this circuit, no such presumption applies.                      United States v.\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), cert.\n\ndenied, 127 S. Ct. 1907 (2007).        However, it is clear from the\n\nsentencing proceeding as a whole, not only from what the court said\n\nelsewhere--expressly considering the other factors enumerated in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)--but also from what it did--applying those factors\n\nin sentencing Espinola three months below the applicable guideline\n\nrange--that the court understood the proper role of the guidelines\n\nas articulated in Jiménez-Beltre and its progeny.    Accordingly, no\n\npurpose would be served by remanding this case for resentencing\n\nunder a rephrased standard.   See United States v. Jahagirdar, 466\n\nF.3d 149, 157 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",

However, it is clear from the\n\nsentencing proceeding as a whole, not only from what the court said\n\nelsewhere--expressly considering the other factors enumerated in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)--but also from what it did--applying those factors\n\nin sentencing Espinola three months below the applicable guideline\n\nrange--that the court understood the proper role of the guidelines\n\nas articulated in Jiménez-Beltre and its progeny.    Accordingly, no\n\npurpose would be served by remanding this case for resentencing\n\nunder a rephrased standard.   See United States v.
