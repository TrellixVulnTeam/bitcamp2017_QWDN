MUKASEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL,*\n\n                             Respondent.\n\n\n           ON PETITION FOR REVIEW OF AN ORDER OF THE\n                  BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\n\n\n                              Before\n                   Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jeanette Kain, Maureen O'Sullivan, and Kaplan, O'Sullivan &\nFriedman on brief for petitioners.\n     Hillel R. Smith, Trial Attorney, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, and Terri J. Scadron, Assistant Director,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, U.S. Department of Justice, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          January 31, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey has been substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzales as the respondent herein.\n\f               LYNCH, Circuit Judge.    Nasreddine Chikkeur and his wife,\n\nBaghdadia Meguenine, are both natives and citizens of Algeria. The\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed without opinion the\n\ndecision       of   an   Immigration   Judge   (IJ)   denying    petitioners'\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (CAT).             The BIA denied a later\n\npetition to reopen.        Both denials are the subject of this petition\n\nfor review.1\n\n               Petitioners' asylum application relies on an incident of\n\nextortion that occurred in May 1996, while Chikkeur operated a\n\nsuccessful retail business in his native city of Oran.               Two men\n\nclaiming to belong to the FIS, a radical Islamist group, visited\n\nChikkeur's shop, shoved him to the ground, and took cash from the\n\nstore's register.        The men demanded that Chikkeur hand over a much\n\nmore substantial sum of money within thirty days.               Over the next\n\nthree weeks, Chikkeur's wife received three phone calls from men\n\nthreatening to kill Chikkeur and his family if he did not pay the\n\nFIS.       Chikkeur resolved not to pay the FIS, and decided instead to\n\nleave Algeria.       He closed his shop, left his home to his mother and\n\nbrother to sell, and departed for the United States with his wife.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n              Chikkeur was the lead applicant for relief. Consistent\nwith the     practice of the IJ, the BIA, and the parties themselves,\nwe treat     Chikkeur and Meguenine's collective claims by focusing on\nChikkeur     himself. See Estrada-Canales v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 208,\n210 (1st     Cir. 2006).\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            Petitioners entered the United States on June 4, 1996, on\n\na six-month sightseeing visa. Removal proceedings against Chikkeur\n\ncommenced on May 22, 1998.      After an initial decision by an IJ was\n\nremanded by the BIA for insufficient findings regarding credibility\n\nand past persecution, a new IJ reheard petitioners' testimony and\n\nissued a written decision denying asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand CAT relief on July 29, 2004.         Voluntary removal was granted.\n\nThe BIA summarily affirmed on November 29, 2005.\n\n            Petitioners filed a motion with the BIA to reopen their\n\ncase on February 27, 2006.        The motion was based on Chikkeur's\n\nclaim that he had recently learned that Islamists had burned down\n\nhis old store and killed his brother.         These events, according to\n\nChikkeur,    supported    his   claims   of   a   well-founded    fear     of\n\npersecution should he return to Algeria. The BIA denied the motion\n\nto reopen on May 7, 2007.\n\n            Because petitioners did not challenge the IJ's initial\n\ndenial of withholding of removal or CAT relief before the BIA,\n\nthose issues are not before this court.       See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(d)(1);\n\nSilva v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2006).          Here, we only\n\nconsider petitioners' claim for asylum.\n\n            This court may not grant the petition for review unless\n\nthe evidence compels the conclusion, contrary to the IJ's findings,\n\nthat   petitioner   met   his   burden   of   proving   he   suffered    past\n\npersecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution based\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fon one of five enumerated grounds.      See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A)\n\n(defining \"refugee\" as one who suffers persecution on the basis of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion); see also Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333\n\nF.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003) (substantial evidence standard).\n\n             The IJ supportably found, on the record, that Chikkeur\n\n\"failed to demonstrate the requisite link between the extortion and\n\nhis (imputed) political opinion or membership in a particular\n\nsocial group.\"     See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A).     Chikkeur argues\n\nthat while the attack on his store began as extortion for purely\n\neconomic gain, the FIS members interpreted Chikkeur's refusal to\n\ncomply with their demands as political opposition, which resulted\n\nin a politically motivated escalation of their demands.      However,\n\nnothing in the record compels the conclusion that Chikkeur was\n\ntargeted for anything other than economic motives. Cf. Hincapie v.\n\nGonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 219-20 (1st Cir. 2007) (distinguishing\n\nbetween \"a desire to extort money\" and \"any motive connected to a\n\nstatutorily protected ground\").      No issue of law is presented by\n\nthis case.    The IJ's finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n             Likewise, the motion to reopen does not present any basis\n\nto conclude that Chikkeur's brother was killed \"on account of a\n\nprotected ground, rather [than a] refusal to give in to [the FIS's]\n\nextortion demands.\"      A motion to reopen must be denied unless\n\npetitioners' new evidence establishes a prima facie case for the\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\funderlying substantive relief.   Mabikas v. INS, 358 F.3d 145, 148\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).   It was within the discretion of the BIA to deny\n\nthe motion.   Cf. id.\n\n          The petition for review as to both issues is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
