Antonetti-Stutts, Solicitor General, Maite D.\nOronoz-Rodríguez,   Deputy  Solicitor   General  and   Susana  I.\nPeñagarícano-Brown, Assistant Solicitor General, Department of\nJustice, on brief for appellee Roberto Sanchez-Ramos, in his\nofficial capacity.\n\n\n\n                       December 27, 2006\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge. Miguel Diaz-Reyes, an employee of\n\nthe Puerto Rico Office of the Comptroller, brought an employment\n\ndiscrimination action against several employees of the Office of\n\nthe Comptroller, in their individual and official capacities, and\n\nagainst the Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Justice, in\n\nhis individual and official capacity.                 The complaint asserted\n\nclaims under Title VII,            42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.; the Civil\n\nRights    Act   of   1866,   42    U.S.C.      §   1981;    the    Americans    with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; and various\n\nPuerto Rico statutes.\n\n            Defendants moved to dismiss the Title VII claims to the\n\nextent that they asserted individual liability on the ground that\n\nsuch claims are unavailable under Title VII.1                They also moved to\n\ndismiss   the   remaining    claims       on   various     other   grounds.     The\n\nComptroller defendants did not, however, move to dismiss the\n\nofficial capacity claims under Title VII.2                   The district court\n\nagreed with all of the defendants' arguments.                      Accordingly, it\n\nordered   the   dismissal     of    the    Title     VII    claims    against    the\n\nComptroller defendants \"in their individual capacities\" and the\n\nrest of Diaz's claims.            Two weeks after the court issued this\n\n\n     1\n      The parties agreed to litigate this case before a magistrate\njudge. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\n     2\n      The Secretary of Justice did argue that the official-capacity\nTitle VII action against him had to be dismissed because Diaz had\nnot exhausted administrative remedies by naming him in the Equal\nOpportunity Commission charge.\n\n                                       -3-\n\forder, the district court clerk entered a \"judgment\" dismissing\n\n\"the case . . . with prejudice.\"       Diaz filed a notice of appeal ten\n\ndays later.      For the reasons that follow, we lack jurisdiction to\n\nconsider Diaz's appeal.\n\n            Neither party has challenged our appellate jurisdiction,\n\nbut we have an obligation to inquire into it sua sponte.            Global\n\nNaps, Inc. v. Mass. Dep't of Telecomms. & Energy, 427 F.3d 34, 41\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).        Subject to certain exceptions not relevant here,\n\nCongress has limited the courts of appeals to reviewing final\n\njudgments   of    the    district   courts.   28   U.S.C.   §   1291;3   see\n\nCunningham v. Hamilton County, Ohio, 527 U.S. 198, 203-04 (1999)\n\n(explaining that the final judgment rule serves several purposes\n\nincluding the prevention of piecemeal appeals, the avoidance of\n\nobstruction to just claims, and the promotion of efficient judicial\n\nadministration).\n\n              A judgment is \"any order from which an appeal lies.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(a).           For an order to constitute a final\n\njudgment, there must be \"some clear and unequivocal manifestation\n\nby the [district] court of its belief that the decision made, so\n\nfar as the court is concerned, is the end of the case.\"         Goodwin v.\n\nUnited States, 67 F.3d 149, 151 (8th Cir. 1995); see also United\n\nStates v. F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co., 356 U.S. 227, 232 (1958)\n\n\n     3\n      The statute actually uses the term \"final decision,\" but a\nfinal decision is equivalent to a final \"judgment.\" Sell v. United\nStates, 539 U.S. 166, 176 (2003).\n\n                                     -4-\n\f(holding that a pronouncement amounts to a final judgment where it\n\n\"clearly evidences the judge's intention that it shall be his final\n\nact in the case\").\n\n          It is important to distinguish between the judgment\n\nitself under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(a) and the entry of the judgment\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.   The judgment is \"the act of the court.\"\n\nEx Parte Morgan, 114 U.S. 174, 175 (1885).       The entry of the\n\njudgment \"is the ministerial notation of the judgment by the clerk\n\nof the court.\"   10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary\n\nKay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 2651, at 11 (3d. ed.\n\n1998). While the entry of judgment is crucial to its effectiveness\n\nand to measuring the time to file an appeal, \"the mere entry of a\n\nnotation by the clerk under Rule 58 does not create a judgment\n\nunless the court intended it to have that effect.\"   Id.; see also\n\nIn re Forrester, 177 F.2d 572, 576 (1st Cir. 1949) (stating that\n\n\"the rules differentiate between a judgment and the entry of the\n\njudgment, with the implication that the judgment must pre-exist\n\nbefore the clerk can perform the ministerial act of entering it\")\n\n(internal quotation omitted).\n\n          Here, the clerk entered a judgment, pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 58, two weeks after the district court issued the order\n\nallowing the defendants' motion to dismiss.4   But a review of the\n\n\n     4\n      Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, \"unless the court orders otherwise,\nthe clerk must, without awaiting the court's direction, promptly\nprepare, sign, and enter the judgment when the court denies all\n\n                                -5-\n\fdistrict court's order reveals that the court did not intend this\n\norder to be a final judgment disposing of the litigation.                    The\n\norder stated that the Title VII claims against the Comptroller\n\ndefendants were dismissed only to the extent that they asserted\n\nindividual capacity claims.             These defendants did not move for\n\ndismissal of the official capacity Title VII claims, and the order\n\ndid not mention them.          Moreover, the court's order did not purport\n\nto   end   the    case,   as    it   merely   listed   the   claims   that   were\n\ndismissed. Thus, the clerk's entry of judgment pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 58 appears to have been a clerical error and is without\n\neffect. See Butler v. Stover Bros. Trucking Co., 546 F.2d 544, 548\n\n(7th Cir. 1977) (\"Entry of judgment involves a ministerial duty by\n\nthe clerk.       If the clerk fails to stay within the authority given\n\nhim . . . entry of judgment by the clerk is void.\") (citations\n\nomitted).    Accordingly, there is no judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n54(a), and we lack jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.               See Burke\n\nv. Comm'r, 301 F.2d 903, 903-04 (1st Cir. 1962) (per curiam)\n\n(concluding that there was no appellate jurisdiction, despite the\n\nclerk having entered judgment, where it appeared that the district\n\ncourt did not intend a judgment to issue).5\n\n\nrelief.\"    See generally 11 Federal Practice & Procedure § 2783.\n      5\n      A district court may issue a partial judgment to permit an\ninterlocutory appeal, where, as here, it has dismissed certain\nclaims or certain parties in their entirety.      Fed. R. Civ. P.\n54(b); see generally Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U.S. 737,\n742-44 (1976).   But to do so, the court must make \"an express\n\n                                        -6-\n\f           Appeal dismissed. The district court, on remand, should\n\nvacate   the   judgment   as   void   and   conduct   further   proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.         No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\ndetermination that there is no just reason for delay\" and direct\nthe entry of judgment as to the dismissed claims or parties. Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 54(b); see Spiegel v. Trustees of Tufts Coll., 843 F.2d\n38, 42-44 (1st Cir. 1988) (discussing the elements of a proper Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 54(b) certification).

The complaint asserted claims under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.;</i> the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 <i>et seq.;</i> and various Puerto Rico statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants moved to dismiss the Title VII claims to the extent that they asserted individual liability on the ground that such claims are unavailable under Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They also moved to dismiss the remaining claims on various other grounds. The Comptroller defendants did not, however, move to dismiss the official capacity claims under Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court agreed with all of the defendants' arguments. Accordingly, it ordered the dismissal of the Title VII claims against the Comptroller defendants \"in their individual capacities\" and the rest of Diaz's claims. Two weeks after the court issued this order, the district court clerk entered a \"judgment\" dismissing \"the case . . . with prejudice.\" Diaz filed a notice of appeal ten days later.

Miller, &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure,</i> &#167; 2651, at 11 (3d. ed.1998). While the entry of judgment is crucial to its effectiveness and to measuring the time to file an appeal, \"the mere entry of a notation by the clerk under Rule 58 does not create a judgment unless the court intended it to have that effect.\" <i>Id.; see also In re Forstner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1507391\"><a href=\"/opinion/1507391/in-re-forstner-chain-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span>, 576 (1st Cir.1949) (stating that \"the rules differentiate between a judgment and the entry of the judgment, with the implication that the judgment must pre-exist before the clerk can perform the ministerial act of entering it\") (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the clerk entered a judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 58, two weeks after the district court issued the order allowing the defendants' motion to dismiss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> But a review of the district court's order reveals that the court did not intend this order to be a final judgment disposing of the litigation. The order stated that the Title VII claims against the Comptroller defendants were dismissed only to the extent that they asserted individual capacity claims. These defendants did not move for dismissal of the official capacity Title VII claims, and the order did not mention them. Moreover, the court's order did not purport to end the case, as it merely listed the claims that were dismissed. Thus, the clerk's entry of judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 appears to have been a clerical error and is without effect. <i>See Butler v. Stover Bros.

If the clerk fails to stay within the authority given him . . . entry of judgment by the clerk is void.\") (citations omitted). Accordingly, there is no judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(a), and we lack jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. <i>See Burke v.
