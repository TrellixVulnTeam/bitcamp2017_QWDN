Michele and Frances Grispino\n\nappeal    the    district    court's    dismissal      of    their    action   under\n\nPennsylvania      state     law    against     the   New    England   Mutual    Life\n\nInsurance Company,1 Creative Financial Group, and John F. Mazzola.\n\nAfter reviewing the record, we affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            The Grispinos are Pennsylvania residents who purchased\n\nlife insurance policies in 1989 from New England Mutual. They came\n\nto believe that these policies were sold to them through deceptive\n\nmeans –- notably, by falsely representing that the premiums due\n\nunder the policies would \"vanish\" after nine years -- and that they\n\nwere owed damages.\n\n            The Grispinos were not alone.              As it turns out, others\n\nhad made similar claims against New England Mutual, prompting the\n\nMultidistrict Litigation Panel in 1996 to consolidate a national\n\nclass action against the company in the District of Massachusetts.\n\nOn October 4, 2000, the class action was settled, with the district\n\ncourt    judge   retaining        continuing    jurisdiction     over    any   post-\n\nsettlement issues.          The Grispinos timely opted out of the class\n\nsettlement and, on October 3, 2001, instituted a civil action\n\nagainst New England Mutual, Creative Financial Group (the policy\n\n\n\n     1\n       New England Mutual merged in August 1996 with Metropolitan\nLife Insurance Company, which is the proper defendant in this\naction. Like the parties, we refer to the defendant by its former\nname for clarity and convenience.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fissuing agent for New England Mutual in Pennsylvania), and John F.\n\nMazzola (the Creative Financial Group representative who sold them\n\ntheir policies) in Pennsylvania state court.         The record does not\n\nshow why the Grispinos decided to opt out.\n\n           Like the federal class action suit, the Grispinos' state\n\ncourt complaint included a count for violation of the federal\n\nRacketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1961 et seq.    Based on this federal claim, the defendants\n\nremoved   the   state   court   action   to   the   District   Court   for\n\nPennsylvania.   28 U.S.C. § 1441.   They then filed with the district\n\ncourt a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that most of\n\nthe claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations\n\nand the remaining claim did not state a cause of action.\n\n           Around the same time that they moved to dismiss, the\n\ndefendants notified the MDL panel that the case was a potential\n\n\"tag-along\" action under Panel Rule 1.1 and was eligible to be\n\ntransferred to the District of Massachusetts, where the original\n\nclass action was litigated.2      In response, the Grispinos amended\n\ntheir complaint to withdraw the sole federal claim.            They then\n\nfiled a motion with the Pennsylvania federal district court to\n\nremand the case back to Pennsylvania state court. Rather than rule\n\n\n     2\n      Rule 1.1 of Procedure of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict\nLitigation states, in relevant part, that \"A 'tag-along action'\nrefers to a civil action pending in a district court and involving\ncommon questions of fact with actions previously transferred under\n[28 U.S.C. § 1407].\"\n\n                                   -3-\n\fon either the Grispinos' motion for remand or the defendants'\n\nmotion      to    dismiss,     the     Pennsylvania    federal      court,    at   the\n\ndefendants' request, stayed the proceeding pending a decision from\n\nthe   MDL    panel      on   whether    the   case   should    be   transferred     to\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n                 On   June   26,   2002,   the   MDL   panel   ordered       the   case\n\ntransferred to the District of Massachusetts, where it was assigned\n\nto the judge who had handled the class action case.                   The Grispinos\n\nsubmitted to the MDL panel a motion to vacate the transfer order,\n\nwhich was denied.\n\n                 Now in Massachusetts federal court, the Grispinos filed\n\na motion requesting remand of the case to Pennsylvania federal\n\ncourt or Pennsylvania state court.               On May 20, 2003, the district\n\ncourt denied this motion, explaining that it did not have authority\n\nto transfer or remand the case to Pennsylvania state or federal\n\ncourt; it could only make a recommendation to the MDL panel on\n\nthese issues, and it was not inclined to do so.\n\n                 Having considered the Grispinos' procedural arguments,\n\nthe district court turned to the defendants' motion to dismiss,\n\nwhich had originally been filed in Pennsylvania federal court. The\n\ncourt held that the Grispinos' fraud, negligence and breach of\n\nfiduciary duty claims were barred by the applicable statute of\n\nlimitations and that the contract claims were otherwise defective.\n\nThe one remaining claim, under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fPractices   and   Consumer   Protection   Law,   was   withdrawn   by   the\n\nGrispinos in order to perfect an appeal from the order of dismissal\n\nand the denial of the motion to remand.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Our ruling is limited to the issues raised on appeal and\n\nthe arguments presented.3      United States v. Berrio-Callejas, 219\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000) (claims not argued on appeal are waived).\n\n            First, the Grispinos argue that the district court should\n\nhave granted some form of a remand order because there was no\n\nfederal subject matter jurisdiction once they amended the complaint\n\nto delete the federal RICO claim.         This argument is wrong: the\n\ndismissal of the only federal claim after removal of an action to\n\nfederal court does not by itself deprive the federal court of\n\njurisdiction over the remaining state claims.           See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1367(c) (the district court \"may decline to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over a claim . . . if . . . the district court has\n\n\n     3\n       A portion of the plaintiffs' brief appears to challenge the\nMDL panel's decision to transfer the case to Massachusetts District\nCourt. The language of 28 U.S.C. § 1407(e) only permits the court\nof appeals for the transferee court to review the MDL panel's\ntransfer decision via the issuance of an extraordinary writ\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1651, which the Grispinos have not sought.\nSee In re Patenaude, 210 F.3d 135, 140-41 (3d Cir. 2000).\nRegardless of the Grispinos' failure to bring a mandamus action,\nthe panel's transfer of the case was clearly within its discretion.\nOn its face, this case appeared to be a tag-along action that\nraised issues of fact common to both the class action and the suits\nthat had already been transferred to Massachusetts. The fact that\nthere were pending jurisdictional objections did not deprive the\nMDL panel of the ability to transfer the case. See In re Ivy, 901\nF.2d 7, 9 (2d Cir. 1990).\n\n                                  -5-\n\fdismissed all claims over which is has original jurisdiction\"\n\n(emphasis added)); Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81\n\nF.3d 249, 256-57 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"In a federal-question case, the\n\ntermination of the foundational federal claim does not divest the\n\ndistrict court of power to exercise supplemental jurisdiction but,\n\nrather, sets the stage for an exercise of the court's informed\n\ndiscretion.\").\n\n            While the court could easily have concluded that a\n\nrecommendation for remand was appropriate in light of the many\n\nunsettled questions of Pennsylvania state law that were presented,\n\nour review is only for abuse of discretion.          See Cotter v. City of\n\nBoston, 323 F.3d 160, 172 (1st Cir. 2003).       We find no such abuse\n\nof discretion. The Massachusetts federal court had already handled\n\na large class action involving the same sorts of claims as this\n\ncase and had continuing jurisdiction.        Its familiarity provided a\n\nsufficient basis for its decision to retain jurisdiction over the\n\naction.    See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350\n\n(1988)    (relevant   factors   for    determining    whether   to   retain\n\njurisdiction include judicial economy and procedural convenience).\n\n            The Grispinos' next argument is that the district court\n\nincorrectly found that their negligence, fraud, and breach of\n\nfiduciary duty claims were time-barred.4 Having concentrated their\n\n\n     4\n       The court also found that no viable contract claim was\nstated. Plaintiffs have waived this issue by failing to raise and\nbrief it on appeal.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fammunition on the transfer and remand issue, the Grispinos pay\n\nscant attention to developing this issue; they argue only that\n\ntheir claims did not accrue until New England Mutual actually\n\nterminated their policy, on May 31, 2000.              The district court\n\nflatly rejected this argument, finding that, at the latest, the\n\nGrispinos' cause of action accrued in 1998, when they were still\n\nrequired to make payments on their policy despite the defendants'\n\nearlier representations that the premium would have vanished by\n\nthat point.    The Grispinos' reassertion, without any supporting\n\nauthority, that their cause of action did not accrue until May 2000\n\nborders on frivolous.        The district court's ruling was correct.\n\nSee In re New England Life Ins. Co. Sales Practice Litig., 346 F.3d\n\n218, 221-23 (1st Cir. 2003) (cause of action accrued when the\n\nplaintiffs    received   a    written    notice    indicating   that   their\n\n\"vanishing premiums\" would not vanish at the end of the anticipated\n\npayment period).\n\n          Before dismissing the Grispinos' fraud, negligence, and\n\nfiduciary duty claims, the district court sua sponte considered and\n\nrejected the possibility that the pendency of the class action\n\ntolled the applicable statute of limitations.              See Am. Pipe &\n\nConstr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 553-54 (1974).           It provided no\n\nopportunity for briefing on this issue.           Relying on a Pennsylvania\n\nintermediate appellate court decision, Ravitch v. Price Waterhouse,\n\n793 A.2d 939 (Pa. Super. 2002), the district court concluded that\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fPennsylvania law does not provide for the tolling of a state\n\nstatute of limitations based on a federal class action.       Although\n\nthe district court was correct to identify the class action tolling\n\nissue, we have considerable doubts about the soundness of its\n\nanalysis.   For instance, the court overlooked a consistent line of\n\nfederal circuit court cases holding that the American Pipe tolling\n\ndoctrine applies to plaintiffs who opt out of a class action in\n\nfederal district court.     See Realmonte v. Reeves, 169 F.3d 1280,\n\n1284 (10th Cir. 1999); Adams Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Asbestos Corp., 7\n\nF.3d 717, 718 n.1 (8th Cir. 1993); Tosti v. City of Los Angeles,\n\n754 F.2d 1485, 1488 (9th Cir. 1985); Edwards v. Boeing Vertol Co.,\n\n717 F.3d 761, 766 (3d Cir. 1983).      The district court also failed\n\nto consider the relevance of the fact that the case had been\n\nremoved to federal court from state court in determining how to\n\napproach the tolling issue.     And there are significant questions\n\nabout whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would, in any event,\n\nfollow the rule announced in Ravitch.\n\n            We need not reach a conclusion on these issues.   Despite\n\nthe fact that the district court reached the tolling issue, the\n\nGrispinos make no argument on appeal regarding the class action\n\ntolling doctrine specifically, or even tolling more generally. The\n\nargument has been waived.    See Berrio-Callejas, 219 F.3d at 3.\n\n            Intertwined with these arguments is a final assertion by\n\nthe plaintiffs that they have been denied due process, equal\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fprotection     and    other    constitutional    rights.       This    frivolous\n\nargument is once again premised on the plaintiffs' claim that there\n\nis no federal subject matter jurisdiction.                  But by pleading a\n\nfederal cause of action, the Grispinos' attorney created federal\n\nremoval jurisdiction, and the deletion of that claim once the case\n\nwas   in    federal    court   did   not   deprive   that    court    of   federal\n\njurisdiction.\n\n                                       III.\n\n              The judgment of the district court dismissing the claims\n\nis affirmed.        We do so without approval of its reasoning on the\n\nclass      action    tolling   doctrine.      Costs    are    awarded      to   the\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

Sales Practices Litig.,</i> 346 F.3d 218, 221-23 (1st Cir.2003) (cause of action accrued when the plaintiffs received a written notice indicating that their \"vanishing premiums\" would not vanish at the end of the anticipated payment period).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before dismissing the Grispinos' fraud, negligence, and fiduciary duty claims, the district court <i>sua sponte</i> considered and rejected the possibility that the pendency of the class action tolled the applicable statute of limitations. <i>See Am. Pipe &amp; Constr. Co. v. Utah,</i> 414 U.S. 538, 553-54, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974). It provided no opportunity for briefing on this issue. Relying on a Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court decision, <i>Ravitch v. Pricewaterhouse,</i> 793 A.2d 939 (Pa.Super.2002), the district court concluded that Pennsylvania law does not provide for the tolling of a state statute of limitations based on a <i>federal</i> class action. Although the district court was correct to identify the class action tolling issue, we have considerable doubts about the soundness of its analysis. For instance, the court overlooked a consistent line of federal circuit court cases holding that the <i>American Pipe</i> tolling doctrine applies to plaintiffs who opt out of a class action in federal district court. <i>See Realmonte v. Reeves,</i> 169 F.3d 1280, 1284 (10th Cir. 1999); <i>Adams Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Asbestos Corp.,</i> 7 F.3d 717, 718 n. 1 (8th Cir.1993); <i>Tosti v.

The district court also failed to consider the relevance of the fact that the case had been removed to federal court from state court in determining how to approach the tolling issue. And there are significant questions about whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would, in any event, follow the rule announced in <i>Ravitch.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach a conclusion on these issues.

Mazzola. After reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Grispinos are Pennsylvania residents who purchased life insurance policies in 1989 from New England Mutual. They came to believe that these policies were sold to them through deceptive means &#8212; notably, by falsely representing that the premiums due under the policies would \"vanish\" after nine years &#8212; and that they were owed damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Grispinos were not alone. As it turns out, others had made similar claims against New England Mutual, prompting the Multidistrict Litigation Panel in 1996 to consolidate a national class action against the company in the District of Massachusetts. On October 4, 2000, the class action was settled, with the district court judge retaining continuing jurisdiction over any post-settlement issues. The Grispinos timely opted out of the class settlement and, on October 3, 2001, instituted a civil action against New England Mutual, Creative Financial Group (the policy issuing agent for New England Mutual in Pennsylvania), and John F. Mazzola (the Creative Financial Group representative who sold them their policies) in Pennsylvania state court. The record does not show why the Grispinos decided to opt out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the federal class action suit, the Grispinos' state court complaint included a count for violation of the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961 <i>et seq.</i> Based on this federal claim, the defendants removed the state court action to the District Court for Pennsylvania. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441. They then filed with the district court a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that most of the claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations and the remaining claim did not state a cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the same time that they moved to dismiss, the defendants notified the MDL panel that the case was a potential \"tag-along\" action under Panel Rule 1.1 and was eligible to be transferred to the District of Massachusetts, where the original class action was litigated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In response, the Grispinos amended their complaint to withdraw the sole federal claim. They then filed a motion with the Pennsylvania federal district court to remand the case back to Pennsylvania state court. Rather than rule on either the Grispinos' motion for remand or the defendants' motion to dismiss, the Pennsylvania federal court, at the defendants' request, stayed the proceeding pending a decision from the MDL panel on whether the case should be transferred to Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 2002, the MDL panel ordered the case transferred to the District of Massachusetts, where it was assigned to the judge who had handled the class action case. The Grispinos submitted to the MDL panel a motion to vacate the transfer order, which was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now in Massachusetts federal court, the Grispinos filed a motion requesting remand of the case to Pennsylvania federal court or Pennsylvania state court. On May 20, 2003, the district court denied this motion, explaining that it did not have authority to transfer or remand the case to Pennsylvania state or federal court; it could only make a recommendation to the MDL panel on these issues, and it was not inclined to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered the Grispinos' procedural arguments, the district court turned to the defendants' motion to dismiss, which had originally been filed in Pennsylvania federal court. The court held that the Grispinos' fraud, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that the contract claims were otherwise defective. The one remaining claim, under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, was withdrawn by the Grispinos in order to perfect an appeal from the order of dismissal and the denial of the motion to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our ruling is limited to the issues raised on appeal and the arguments presented.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>United States v. Berrio-Callejas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198999\"><a href=\"/opinion/198999/berrio-callejas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2000) (claims not argued on appeal are waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Grispinos argue that the district court should have granted some form of a remand order because there was no federal subject matter jurisdiction once they amended the complaint to delete the federal RICO claim. This argument is wrong: the dismissal of the only federal claim after removal of an action to federal court does not by itself deprive the federal court of jurisdiction over the remaining state claims. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c) (the district court \"<i>may</i> decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim ... if... the district court has dismissed all claims over which is has original jurisdiction\" (emphasis added)); <i>Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716599\"><a href=\"/opinion/716599/daniel-j-roche-et-ux-valerie-roche-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 256-57 (1st Cir.1996) (\"In a federal-question case, the termination of the foundational federal claim does not divest the district court of power to exercise supplemental jurisdiction but, rather, sets the stage for an exercise of the court's informed discretion.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the court could easily have concluded that a recommendation for remand was appropriate in light of the many unsettled questions of Pennsylvania state law that were presented, our review is only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Cotter v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200392\"><a href=\"/opinion/200392/cotter-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span>, 172 (1st Cir.2003). We find no such abuse of discretion. The Massachusetts federal court had already handled a large class action involving the same sorts of claims as this case and had continuing jurisdiction. Its familiarity provided a sufficient basis for its decision to retain jurisdiction over the action. <i>See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111983\"><a href=\"/opinion/111983/carnegie-mellon-univ-v-cohill/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 350, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111983\"><a href=\"/opinion/111983/carnegie-mellon-univ-v-cohill/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court flatly rejected this argument, finding that, at the latest, the Grispinos' cause of action accrued in 1998, when they were still required to make payments on their policy despite the defendants' earlier representations that the premium would have vanished by that point. The Grispinos' reassertion, without any supporting authority, that their cause of action did not accrue until May 2000 borders on frivolous. The district court's ruling was correct. <i>See In re New England Life Ins. Co. Sales Practices Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200673\"><a href=\"/opinion/200673/s-g-metals-industrie-v-new-england-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 221-23 (1st Cir.2003) (cause of action accrued when the plaintiffs received a written notice indicating that their \"vanishing premiums\" would not vanish at the end of the anticipated payment period).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before dismissing the Grispinos' fraud, negligence, and fiduciary duty claims, the district court <i>sua sponte</i> considered and rejected the possibility that the pendency of the class action tolled the applicable statute of limitations. <i>See Am.
