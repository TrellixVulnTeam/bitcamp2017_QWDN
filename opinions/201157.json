Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n                                  July 3, 2006\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.     Defendant Charles Gravenhorst was convicted\n\nin March 2003 of four counts of using a computer in interstate\n\ncommerce to induce a minor to engage in illegal sex acts, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2422(b); six counts of using a computer in interstate\n\ncommerce to transfer obscene matter to a minor, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1470; and one count of using an interactive computer service for\n\ncarriage of obscene material in interstate commerce, see 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1462.   In July 2003, the district court ordered Gravenhorst to be\n\nimprisoned for 10 concurrent terms of 96 months and one concurrent\n\nterm of 60 months.        We subsequently affirmed his convictions on\n\ndirect appeal.    See United States v. Gravenhorst, 377 F.3d 49 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam).\n\n           In May 2005, the Supreme Court vacated this court's\n\njudgment and remanded the case \"for further consideration in light\n\nof United States v. Booker.\"         Gravenhorst v. United States, 544\n\nU.S. 1029 (2005).    We subsequently ordered supplemental briefing.\n\nWe also permitted Gravenhorst to file a counseled, oversized brief\n\nas well as a pro se brief.         In these briefs, Gravenhorst raised\n\nseveral challenges to his convictions and sentence that are beyond\n\nthe scope of the Supreme Court's remand order.           While not required\n\nto address these issues, we may do so in our discretion.                 See\n\nUnited States v. Estevez, 419 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 2005).           Despite\n\nthe fact that some of these arguments were previously waived by not\n\nbeing   timely   raised    on   appeal,   given   that   we   have   complete\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fbriefing, we exercise the discretion to consider most of these\n\nnewly argued issues, although we ultimately conclude that they are\n\nwithout merit and that Gravenhorst is not entitled to resentencing\n\nunder Booker.1\n\n          The parties are familiar with the record of the case.\n\nSince we are writing primarily for them, we do not provide a\n\nnarrative summary of the evidence.      We will address in turn each of\n\nthe assigned errors and refer to the evidence where necessary to\n\nexplain the disposition.\n\n           1.    The government did not present sufficient\n                 evidence   of   a   violation   of   § 2422(b)\n                 because there was no evidence that Gravenhorst\n                 took     a     substantial      step    toward\n                 committing the substantive offense.\n\n          Conviction   for   a   violation    of   18   U.S.C.   §   2422(b)\n\nrequires the government to show that the defendant attempted to (1)\n\nuse a facility of interstate commerce (2) to knowingly persuade,\n\ninduce, entice, or coerce (3) an individual under the age of 18 (4)\n\nto engage in illegal sexual activity.        See United States v. Munro,\n\n\n     1\n      We decline, however, to exercise discretionary authority to\nconsider Gravenhorst's argument that the obscenity convictions must\nbe overturned on the ground that the images are not obscene as a\nmatter of law.    The record for this claim is incomplete as the\nimages are not before us, and we are therefore without adequate\ninformation to rule at this time. Also, we decline to consider\nGravenhorst's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for waiving\na sentencing argument. Infra at 8-9. As to this claim, there is\ninsufficient factual development, and we therefore see no reason to\ndeviate from our normal practice of requiring ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims to be pursued through a collateral\nproceeding under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. See United States v. Reyes, 352\nF.3d 511, 517 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                  -3-\n\f394 F.3d 865, 869 (10th Cir. 2005).           Gravenhorst argues that the\n\ngovernment did not present sufficient evidence from which a jury\n\ncould conclude that he took a substantial step toward committing a\n\n§   2422(b)    violation.    He   preserved    this   argument   below,   and\n\ntherefore we review it de novo, after analyzing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict.          United States v. Byrne, 435\n\nF.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir. 2006).2\n\n              To prove attempt, the government must establish both an\n\nintent to commit the substantive offense and a substantial step\n\ntoward its commission.      See United States v. Burgos, 254 F.3d 1, 12\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).        A substantial step is something more than\n\npreparation but something less than the last act necessary to\n\ncommit the crime itself.       See United States v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d\n\n36, 47 (1st Cir. 1999).      \"[O]ur caselaw shows, [however], that the\n\ndefendant does not have to get very far along the line toward\n\n\n\n      2\n      We have also considered Gravenhorst's two pro se arguments\nchallenging the indictment as it pertains to the § 2422(b)\nviolations. First, Gravenhorst claims that the indictment charges\na \"non-offense\" because it does not allege that he engaged in a\ncompleted sex act or received consent from one of the young women\nto have sex. We reject this argument. The indictment sets forth\nthe elements of the offense, including the allegation that\nGravenhorst used the internet to induce an underage person to\nengage in illegal sexual activity. This is all that is required.\nSee United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 893 (1st Cir. 1993).\nThere is also no merit to Gravenhorst's argument that the\nindictment did not adequately charge attempt under § 2422(b). The\nlesser included offense of attempt need not be included in the\nindictment where the indictment adequately pleads the substantive\noffense. See United States v. Feinberg, 89 F.3d 333, 339 (7th Cir.\n1996).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fultimate commission of the object crime in order to commit the\n\nattempt offense.\"    See United States v. Doyon, 194 F.3d 207, 211\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The evidence establishes that Gravenhorst sent each young\n\nwoman a sexually explicit message and asked each to meet him to\n\nengage in sexual activity.    If anyone had agreed to Gravenhorst's\n\nproposition, all that remained was working out the details of where\n\nand when to meet.      \"The main purpose of the substantial step\n\nrequirement is to distinguish between those who express criminal\n\naims without doing much to act on them and others who have proved\n\nthemselves dangerous by taking a substantial step down a path of\n\nconduct reasonably calculated to end in the substantive offense.\"\n\nId. (internal citation omitted). A jury could reasonably conclude\n\nthat, once Gravenhorst moved from sending email messages referring\n\ngenerally to sexual matters to asking young women to meet him to\n\nengage in sexual activity, he engaged in a substantial step toward\n\ninducing the women to engage in illegal sexual conduct.3\n\n          2.       The obscenity convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1470\n                   & 18 U.S.C. 1462 should be dismissed because these\n\n\n\n     3\n      Gravenhorst also raises two challenges to the jury\ninstructions concerning the substantive § 2422(b) charges.      He\nclaims that the court should have instructed that a substantive\nviolation of § 2422(b) requires proof of a completed sexual act or\nan agreement to engage in sexual activity. Neither objection was\nraised below, and we therefore review for plain error. See United\nStates v. Mendina-Martinez, 396 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004). Since\n§ 2422(b) criminalizes attempts, a substantive violation clearly\ndoes not require a completed sexual act.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                      statutes are unconstitutional after Lawrence v.\n                      Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003).\n\n              Gravenhorst argues that the Supreme Court's decision\n\nstriking down an anti-sodomy law under the due process clause in\n\nLawrence renders obscenity laws unconstitutional. He contends that\n\nLawrence made unconstitutional any law that mandates a society's\n\nown moral code.       This argument was not raised below, and therefore\n\nwe review only for plain error.                It suffices to say that other\n\ncircuits have concluded that obscenity laws survive Lawrence,\n\nsee United States v. Coil, 442 F.3d 912, 915-16 (5th Cir. 2006);\n\nUnited States v. Extreme Assocs., 432 F.3d 150, 155-59 (3d Cir.\n\n2005)   and    that   no   court   has    reached    a   contrary   conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the statutes are not plainly unconstitutional.\n\n\n              3.      The district court abused its discretion by\n                      permitting the introduction of prior bad act\n                      evidence.\n\n              Gravenhorst contends that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion by permitting evidence that he had visited one of the\n\nwomen to whom he sent sexually explicit images, Heidi K., and\n\nattempted to have sexual relations with her.             Heidi K. was 16 years\n\nold at the time that Gravenhorst visited her, and therefore she was\n\nof legal age to have sexual intercourse under Maine law.                 Since\n\nintercourse with Heidi K. would not have been a crime under §\n\n2422(b), Gravenhorst claims that this evidence was irrelevant and\n\nshould have been excluded.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f           The district court concluded that this \"other wrongful\n\nact\" evidence was admissible because it showed Gravenhorst's intent\n\nin sending sexually explicit images to young women to convince them\n\nto have sexual relations with him.            We review this ruling for an\n\nabuse of discretion.      See United States v. Landrau-Lopez, 444 F.3d\n\n19, 23 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) permits admission of\n\nevidence of other wrongful conduct to prove \"motive, opportunity,\n\nintent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of\n\nmistake or accident.\"         For evidence to be admissible under Rule\n\n404(b), the evidence must have some special relevance other than\n\nthe defendant's propensity to commit a crime and must meet the\n\nstandards set forth Federal Rule of Evidence 403(b).                   See United\n\nStates v. Decicco, 370 F.3d 206, 211 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The    district    court     acted      within    its    discretion    by\n\nadmitting this evidence.           Gravenhorst sent the same explicit\n\nmessages   to    Heidi   K.   as   he   did   to    the     other   women.   That\n\nGravenhorst acted upon his email propositions to Heidi K. was\n\nevidence of his intent in sending emails to the other women.                     See\n\nLandrau-Lopez, 444 F.3d at 24 (\"The other bad act need not be\n\nidentical to the crime charged so long as it is sufficiently\n\nsimilar to allow a juror to draw a reasonable inference probative\n\nof . . . intent.\").       Thus, the evidence had \"special relevance\"\n\nunder Rule 404(b).\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f              We also do not find an abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court's Rule 403 determination.               While this evidence may\n\nhave harmed Gravenhorst's case, it did not do so unfairly.                       See\n\nUnited States v. Candelaria-Silva, 162 F.3d 698, 705 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   The evidence was important in establishing Gravenhorst's\n\nmotive for sending email messages to young women -- an essential\n\nelement of the charged offense.\n\n              4.      Gravenhorst is entitled              to   resentencing    under\n                      advisory guidelines.\n\n              Gravenhorst was sentenced under the mandatory guideline\n\nregime which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional in United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).              He acknowledges that he did\n\nnot   argue     to    the    district       court   that    the    guidelines   were\n\nunconstitutional.           Therefore our review is for plain error.             See\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 80-82 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Under this standard, a defendant must show \"either in the\n\nexisting record or by plausible proffer that there is a reasonable\n\nindication that the district judge might well have reached a\n\ndifferent result under advisory guidelines.\"                       United States v.\n\nJones,   432       F.3d   34,   45   (1st    Cir.   2005)       (internal   citations\n\nomitted).\n\n              Gravenhorst does not present an argument that he would\n\nhave presented additional facts to the district court, or that the\n\ncourt indicated that it would be inclined to impose a more lenient\n\nsentence if not bound by the guidelines.               Rather, he contends that\n\n                                            -8-\n\fthe case should be remanded for resentencing because the court\n\ncommitted a legal error in calculating the guidelines sentencing\n\nrange by erroneously applying a cross-reference.\n\n            We have recognized that a substantive error in the\n\napplication of the guidelines will normally lead to a Booker\n\nremand.    See    Antonakopoulos,   399    F.3d    at   81.    Here,   however,\n\nGravenhorst affirmatively waived the guidelines argument that he\n\nnow seeks to make and stipulated to the sentencing range before the\n\ndistrict court.4      See United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d\n\n50,   55   (1st   Cir.   2005)   (declining   to    consider   Booker   remand\n\nargument based on claimed sentencing error, where the defendant\n\nwaived the argument in his plea agreement).             Moreover, Gravenhorst\n\nadmits that, even if his sentencing argument were correct, the\n\nsentencing range would be unaffected.             In these circumstances, we\n\ndo not foresee any reasonable probability that Gravenhorst would\n\nreceive a more lenient sentence on remand.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      Gravenhorst also argues that his trial counsel provided\nineffective assistance of counsel by waiving his sentencing\nargument.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d 675, 676 (1st Cir.1993). Gravenhorst resided in Concord, New Hampshire, from 1999 through 2002. While living in Concord, he established several email accounts under various aliases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2001 and 2002, Gravenhorst used these email accounts to proposition four females under the age of sixteen and one female who was sixteen years of age, all living in Maine, to engage in sexual conduct with him. Without repeating all of the unseemly details, Gravenhorst, forty-five years old at the time, posed as a nineteen-year-old college student named Justin Foxe and sent numerous graphic emails asking these minors for sex. In addition, Gravenhorst emailed these minors sexually-charged images, including a picture of a man and woman having intercourse and a picture of an erect penis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, a federal grand jury in the District of Maine presented an eleven count indictment charging Gravenhorst with four counts of attempting to induce a minor to engage in unlawful sex acts, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;2422(b) (counts one through four); six counts of transferring obscene matter to a minor, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;1470 (counts five through ten); and one count of using an interactive computer service to carry obscene material in interstate commerce, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;1462 (count eleven). After a two-day trial, a petit jury convicted Gravenhorst on all counts. The district court sentenced Gravenhorst to 96-month concurrent prison terms for each of the first ten counts and a concurrent term of 60 months for count eleven. The court also sentenced Gravenhorst to three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay special assessments in the amount of $1,100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gravenhorst argues that the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the definition of obscenity for counts five through eleven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;1470; 18 U.S.C. &#167;1462. Because Gravenhorst did not object to the instruction, we consider the claim only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Colon Osorio,</i> 360 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.2004) (stating the elements of the plain error standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The challenged instruction provided:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Material is obscene when one, the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the material taken as a whole is in some way erotic and appeals to a degrading, unhealthy or morbid interest in sex, as distinguished from normal healthy desires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two, the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the material depicts or describes ultimate sex acts, masturbation, or lewd exhibition of the genitals in a patently offensive way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, three, a reasonable person would find that the material taken as a whole, lacks serious artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gravenhorst contends that this instruction incorrectly equated eroticism with obscenity and thus permitted a conviction for transferring merely \"erotic\" (i.e., non-obscene material).

In this case an instruction mirroring the Maine obscenity statute, which itself tracks <i>Miller,</i> would have sufficed. <i>See</i> 17 M.R.S.A. &#167;2911.

Gravenhorst resided in Concord, New Hampshire, from 1999 through 2002. While living in Concord, he established several email accounts under various aliases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2001 and 2002, Gravenhorst used these email accounts to proposition four females under the age of sixteen and one female who was sixteen years of age, all living in Maine, to engage in sexual conduct with him. Without repeating all of the unseemly details, Gravenhorst, forty-five years old at the time, posed as a nineteen-year-old college student named Justin Foxe and sent numerous graphic emails asking these minors for sex. In addition, Gravenhorst emailed these minors sexually-charged images, including a picture of a man and woman having intercourse and a picture of an erect penis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, a federal grand jury in the District of Maine presented an eleven count indictment charging Gravenhorst with four counts of attempting to induce a minor to engage in unlawful sex acts, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;2422(b) (counts one through four); six counts of transferring obscene matter to a minor, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;1470 (counts five through ten); and one count of using an interactive computer service to carry obscene material in interstate commerce, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;1462 (count eleven). After a two-day trial, a petit jury convicted Gravenhorst on all counts. The district court sentenced Gravenhorst to 96-month concurrent prison terms for each of the first ten counts and a concurrent term of 60 months for count eleven. The court also sentenced Gravenhorst to three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay special assessments in the amount of $1,100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gravenhorst argues that the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the definition of obscenity for counts five through eleven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;1470; 18 U.S.C. &#167;1462.
