García, United States Attorney,\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Senior\nAppellate Attorney In Charge, and Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                            March 14, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f     JOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge. Germán Narváez-Rosario appeals\n\nthe judgment of the district court sentencing him to 120 months'\n\nimprisonment for possession of heroin with intent to distribute in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) following a guilty plea.     We\n\naffirm.\n\n     On February 6, 2004, Narváez-Rosario arrived at the Pan\n\nAmerican Dock in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on board the cruise ship\n\nM/V Galaxy. At the dock, inspectors with United States Customs and\n\nBorder Protection conducted a search of Narváez-Rosario which\n\nuncovered 1.94 net kilograms of heroin concealed within the sole of\n\nhis tennis shoes and inside a pair of lycra shorts worn underneath\n\nhis pants.   After being advised of his rights and waiving them in\n\nwriting, Narváez-Rosario was interviewed by a special agent of the\n\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   He told the agent\n\nthat a Colombian national in Puerto Rico had offered him $8,000 to\n\nserve as a drug courier.    The Colombian had instructed Narváez-\n\nRosario to travel onboard the M/V Galaxy to pick up the narcotics\n\nin Venezuela, and, upon his return to Puerto Rico, to contact the\n\nColombian for further instructions.\n\n     A grand jury of the District of Puerto Rico indicted Narváez-\n\nRosario: Count One charged him with importing greater than one\n\nkilogram of heroin into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 952(a) and 18 U.S.C. § 2; Count Two charged him with possession\n\nwith intent to distribute greater than one kilogram of heroin in\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fviolation of 21 U.S.C. 841 (a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.              Narváez-\n\nRosario pled guilty to Count Two in exchange for the government's\n\nagreement to dismiss the remaining count.\n\n     Under the terms of the plea agreement, the parties stipulated\n\nthat Narváez-Rosario's sentence would be determined according to\n\nthe federal sentencing guidelines. Narváez-Rosario stipulated that\n\nhe was responsible for between one and three kilograms of heroin\n\nfor a base offense level of 32, and the parties agreed that he\n\nwould    receive   a   three-level   reduction   for   his   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility. See U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(c)(4), 3E1.1(a)-(b).\n\n     The parties also agreed that if Narváez-Rosario met all the\n\nrequirements of the \"safety valve\" of Guideline § 5C1.2, he would\n\nreceive a two-level reduction pursuant to Guideline § 2D1.1(b)(6).\n\nThe plea agreement provided that if Narváez-Rosario were to qualify\n\nfor the two-level safety valve reduction, his total offense level\n\nwould be 27, which, assuming a criminal history category of I,2\n\nwould have carried a sentencing range of between 70 and 87 months.\n\nNarváez-Rosario acknowledged in the plea agreement that if he\n\nfailed to meet all the requirements of the safety valve, he could\n\nnot be sentenced to less than the 120-month statutory minimum. See\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841 (b)(1)(A)(i).        Following a change of plea hearing\n\nbefore a magistrate judge, the district court accepted his guilty\n\n\n\n     2\n      The parties made no stipulation as to Narváez-Rosario's\ncriminal history category.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fplea.\n\n      Although the parties stipulated to an offense level of 27 in\n\nthe     plea    agreement,      the     pre-sentence       investigation     report\n\ncalculated an offense level of 29.                 The report arrived at this\n\noffense level using the same sentencing factors as those recited in\n\nthe   plea     agreement    minus     the    safety    valve   benefit.     At   the\n\nsentencing hearing, the probation officer testified that because\n\nNarváez-Rosario had more than one criminal history point, her\n\noffice recommended that the court find him ineligible for a safety\n\nvalve reduction.        See U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(1) (requiring that the\n\ndefendant have no more than one criminal history point to qualify\n\nfor safety valve).         Although Narváez-Rosario had not objected to\n\nthe criminal history calculation in the presentence investigation\n\nreport, his counsel argued at sentencing that after the United\n\nStates Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005), the district court had the discretion to ignore\n\nthe guidelines' criminal history calculation in determining whether\n\nNarváez-Rosario qualified for a safety valve reduction.                          The\n\ndistrict court rejected this argument and concluded that Narváez-\n\nRosario was ineligible for a safety valve reduction.                   Recognizing\n\nthe     now-advisory       nature     of     the   sentencing    guidelines      and\n\nconsidering      the   sentencing      factors     set   forth   in   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n3553(a),       the   district   court      sentenced     Narváez-Rosario    to   the\n\nstatutory minimum, 120 months' imprisonment.\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\f      On appeal Narváez-Rosario argues that the district court erred\n\nin    finding   him    ineligible       for   the    safety   valve   reduction\n\ncontemplated in the plea agreement.              Because he does not dispute\n\nthe facts relied upon by the district court in rendering his\n\nsentence, we review de novo the court's legal conclusion regarding\n\nhis ineligibility for the safety valve.                 See United States v.\n\nMcLean, 409 F.3d 492, 501-02 (1st Cir.), cert denied, 126 S.Ct. 466\n\n(2005).     Narváez-Rosario had the burden of demonstrating to the\n\ndistrict court that he was entitled to a safety valve reduction.\n\nId. at 502.\n\n      The district court correctly concluded that Narváez-Rosario\n\ndid   not   qualify    for    safety     valve      relief.    Narváez-Rosario\n\nstipulated in the plea agreement that he would receive a safety\n\nvalve reduction only if he satisfied all of § 5C1.2's requirements.\n\nOne such requirement was that he \"not have more than one criminal\n\nhistory point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(1).            Narváez-Rosario did not dispute the\n\ndistrict court's finding that he had three criminal history points\n\nas determined under the sentencing guidelines.                Thus, because he\n\ndid   not   comply    with   all   of   the   requirements    of   Guideline   §\n\n5C1.2(a), he was not entitled to a safety valve reduction under the\n\nterms of the plea agreement.\n\n      Relying on Booker, Narváez-Rosario argues that it was within\n\nthe district court's discretion to disregard the criminal history\n\n                                        -5-\n\fcomputation called for by the sentencing guidelines.          Even if this\n\nargument was not foreclosed by Narváez-Rosario's stipulation in the\n\nplea agreement that his sentence would be determined according to\n\nthe guidelines, his argument fails as a matter of law because there\n\ncan be no Booker error where a defendant is sentenced to a\n\nstatutory minimum based on admitted facts.               United States v.\n\nBermúdez, 407 F.3d 536, 545-46 (1st Cir.), cert.denied, 126 S.Ct.\n\n304 (2005); see also United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68,\n\n75 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"A mandatory minimum sentence imposed as\n\nrequired by a statute based on facts found by a jury or admitted by\n\na defendant is not a candidate for Booker error.\"). Here, Narváez-\n\nRosario admitted in the plea agreement to the facts underlying the\n\ncrime   for   which   he    received   the   mandatory   minimum   sentence.\n\nContrary to Narváez-Rosario's contention, Booker does not give a\n\ndistrict court the discretion to disregard an otherwise applicable\n\nstatutory minimum.         See United States v. Lee, 399 F.3d 864, 866\n\n(7th Cir. 2005).\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f",

Narv&#225;ez-Rosario pled guilty to Count Two in exchange for the government's agreement to dismiss the remaining count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the plea agreement, the parties stipulated that Narv&#225;ez-Rosario's sentence would be determined according to the federal sentencing guidelines. Narv&#225;ez-Rosario stipulated that he was responsible for between one and three kilograms of heroin for a base offense level of 32, and the parties agreed that he would receive a three-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2D1.1(c)(4), 3E1.1(a)-(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also agreed that if Narv&#225;ez-Rosario met <i>all</i> the requirements of the \"safety valve\" of Guideline &#167; 5C1.2, he would receive a two-level reduction pursuant to Guideline &#167; 2D1.1(b)(6). The plea agreement provided that if Narv&#225;ez-Rosario were to qualify for the two-level safety valve reduction, his total offense level would be 27, which, assuming a criminal history category of I,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> would have carried a sentencing range of between 70 and 87 months. Narv&#225;ez-Rosario acknowledged in the plea agreement that if he failed to meet <i>all</i> the requirements of the safety valve, he could not be sentenced to less than the 120-month statutory minimum. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(i). Following a change of plea hearing before a magistrate judge, the district court accepted his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties stipulated to an offense level of 27 in the plea agreement, the pre-sentence investigation report calculated an offense level of 29. The report arrived at this offense level using the same sentencing factors as those recited in the plea agreement minus the safety valve benefit. At the sentencing hearing, the probation officer testified that because Narv&#225;ez-Rosario had more than one criminal history point, her office recommended that the court find him ineligible for a safety valve reduction. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a)(1) (requiring that the defendant have no more than one criminal history point to qualify for safety valve). Although Narv&#225;ez-Rosario had not objected to the criminal history calculation in the presentence investigation report, his counsel argued at sentencing that after the United States Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), the district court had the discretion to ignore the guidelines' criminal history calculation in determining whether Narv&#225;ez-Rosario qualified for a safety valve reduction. The district court rejected this argument and concluded that Narv&#225;ez-Rosario was ineligible for a safety valve reduction. Recognizing the now-advisory nature of the sentencing guidelines and considering the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), the district court sentenced Narv&#225;ez-Rosario to the statutory minimum, 120 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Narv&#225;ez-Rosario argues that the district court erred in finding him ineligible for the safety valve reduction contemplated in the plea agreement. Because he does not dispute the facts relied upon by the district court in rendering his sentence, we review de novo the court's legal conclusion regarding his ineligibility for the safety valve. <i>See United States v. McLean,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790402\"><a href=\"/opinion/790402/united-states-v-dale-mclean-united-states-of-america-v-manolin-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 501-02 (1st Cir.), <i>cert denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></span> (2005). Narv&#225;ez-Rosario had the burden of demonstrating to the district court that he was entitled to a safety valve reduction. <i>Id.</i> at 502.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly concluded that Narv&#225;ez-Rosario did not qualify for safety valve relief. Narv&#225;ez-Rosario stipulated in the plea agreement that he would receive a safety valve reduction only if he satisfied <i>all</i> of &#167; 5C1.2's requirements. One such requirement was that he \"not have more than one criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a)(1). Narv&#225;ez-Rosario did not dispute the district court's finding that he had three criminal history points as determined under the sentencing guidelines. Thus, because he did not comply with all of the requirements of Guideline &#167; 5C1.2(a), he was not entitled to a safety valve reduction under the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>Booker,</i> Narv&#225;ez-Rosario argues that it was within the district court's discretion to disregard the criminal history computation called for by the sentencing guidelines. Even if this argument was not foreclosed by Narv&#225;ez-Rosario's stipulation in the plea agreement that his sentence would be determined according to the guidelines, his argument fails as a matter of law because there can be no <i>Booker</i> error where a defendant is sentenced to a statutory minimum based on admitted facts. <i>United States v. Berm&#250;dez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201598\"><a href=\"/opinion/201598/united-states-v-bermudez/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 545-46 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, Narv&#225;ez-Rosario admitted in the plea agreement to the facts underlying the crime for which he received the mandatory minimum sentence. Contrary to Narv&#225;ez-Rosario's contention, <i>Booker</i> does not give a district court the discretion to disregard an otherwise applicable statutory minimum. <i>See United States v.
