Defendant-appellant       Carlos\n\nHumberto Cabrera-Polo (Cabrera) pleaded guilty to participating in\n\na     drug    conspiracy   and   was   sentenced   to   serve    a    78-month\n\nincarcerative term.        He did not appeal.   Subsequently, however, he\n\nmoved to modify his sentence.            The district court denied that\n\nmotion and Cabrera now invites us to reverse that ruling.                   We\n\ndecline the invitation.\n\n              The historical facts are largely undisputed.            Agents of\n\nthe    Drug    Enforcement   Administration     apprehended     and    detained\n\nCabrera on November 20, 1998, after they caught him red-handed\n\nreceiving a package of heroin at the Luis Muñoz Marín International\n\nAirport in Carolina, Puerto Rico.            To cut to the chase, Cabrera\n\neventually pleaded guilty to one count of a second superseding\n\nindictment charging conspiracy with intent to distribute between\n\n700 grams and one kilogram of heroin.            See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a),\n\n841(b)(1)(B)(i), 846.\n\n              The district court sentenced Cabrera on October 26,\n\n2001.1       The presentence investigation report recommended a base\n\noffense level of 30.         See USSG §2D1.1(c)(5).      With a two-level\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility, see id. §3E1.1(a), his\n\n\n\n       1\n      The November 2000 edition of the sentencing guidelines\ncontrols in this case. See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d\n1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Barring any ex post facto problem,\na defendant is to be punished according to the guidelines in effect\nat the time of sentencing.\"). Thus, we refer throughout to that\nedition.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fadjusted offense level was 28.               Because Cabrera had no prior\n\ncriminal record, the guideline sentencing range (GSR) was 78-97\n\nmonths.        The district court sentenced him to the bottom of the\n\napplicable range.       He did not seek, and the district court did not\n\ngrant,     a     so-called   \"safety    valve\"    adjustment.    See   id.\n\n§§2D1.1(b)(6), 5C1.2; see also United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211\n\nF.3d 146, 150 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining the operation of the\n\nsafety valve).\n\n               Although Cabrera did not appeal from these sentencing\n\ndeterminations, he later discovered a typographical error in the\n\nfinal judgment (which indicated that his crime was not completed\n\nuntil almost a year after his arrest).           In view of this error, he\n\nmoved to vacate the judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.              On\n\nApril 30, 2003, the district court granted the motion, vacated the\n\njudgment, and then reentered it with a corrected description of the\n\noffense.       The sentence itself remained unchanged.\n\n               Twenty-eight days later, Cabrera moved to modify his\n\nsentence.        The gravamen of the motion was his argument that\n\nAmendment 640 to the sentencing guidelines, effective November 1,\n\n2002, applied retroactively to his case and authorized the court to\n\nreduce his sentence by utilizing the safety valve adjustment.2         The\n\n\n     2\n      The amendment relates to USSG §2D1.1(b)(6). It states that\nif a defendant receives a downward adjustment for a mitigating role\nin the offense, \"the base offense level under this subsection shall\nnot be more than level 30.\" USSG supp. to App. C, amend. 640, at\n263.   It then adds a new application note, which explains in\n\n                                       -3-\n\fgovernment objected.         In considering this motion, the district\n\ncourt did not address whether Amendment 640 applied retroactively\n\nor, indeed, whether it had any pertinence to Cabrera's case.\n\nInstead, the court disposed of the motion on the ground that\n\nCabrera was ineligible for safety valve relief because of his\n\nmanagerial    role   in   the    offense       of   conviction.      This   appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n            We are not committed to the district court's reasoning,\n\nbut, rather, may affirm its order on any independent ground made\n\napparent by the record.         Intergen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 141\n\n(1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1127 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).     In this instance, we believe that the district court\n\nproceeded    too   hastily   to    the    merits.       There   is   a   logically\n\nantecedent question involving the propriety vel non of Cabrera's\n\nmotion.   We turn to that question.\n\n            In his brief, Cabrera classifies his motion as a motion\n\nto modify an imposed term of imprisonment.                That taxonomy seems\n\nappropriate.3      Consequently, we inquire first whether Cabrera's\n\n\nrelevant part that \"[t]he applicability of [the safety valve] shall\nbe determined without regard to whether the defendant was convicted\nof an offense that subjects the defendant to a mandatory minimum\nterm of imprisonment.\" Id. at 264.\n     3\n      In other circumstances, it might be possible to construe the\nmotion as one under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 for modification or vacation\nof an illegal sentence. That option is not available to Cabrera\nbecause of his previous section 2255 motion.      See Sepulveda v.\nUnited States, 330 F.3d 55, 66 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting restrictions\non the bringing of \"second or successive\" section 2255 motions);\n\n                                         -4-\n\fsituation    fits    within   the   narrow    confines     of     the     statutory\n\nprovision governing motions to modify judgments in criminal cases,\n\nnamely, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c).\n\n            Section 3582(c) grants federal courts a limited power to\n\nmodify criminal sentences in specific types of situations.                        The\n\nstatute limns three areas in which such relief may be available.\n\nGenerally speaking, these areas are accessible if a defendant can\n\nshow that (i) the requested change is expressly permitted either by\n\nstatute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\n\n(ii) the Sentencing Commission has revised the guidelines in a\n\nfashion that lowers the applicable GSR and clears the way for\n\nretroactive     application    of      the   revision,     or     (iii)     certain\n\nextraordinary       and   compelling     reasons   exist        that    warrant     a\n\nmodification.       This case does not implicate either the first or\n\nthird areas, and Cabrera advances no argumentation that touches\n\nupon them.      Therefore, we focus our attention on the second\n\nalternative.\n\n            The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n            [I]n the case of a defendant who has been\n            sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a\n            sentencing range that has subsequently been\n            lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant\n            to 28 U.S.C. § 994(o) . . . the court may\n            reduce the term of imprisonment . . . if such\n            a reduction is consistent with applicable\n            policy statements issued by the Sentencing\n            Commission.\n\n\nsee also 28 U.S.C. § 2255, ¶ 8.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). Cabrera argues that, in enacting Amendment\n\n640,   the    Sentencing   Commission    effectively   reduced   the   GSR\n\napplicable to his case and anticipated that the amendment would be\n\napplied retroactively.       On this basis, he urges that section\n\n3582(c)(2) authorizes reevaluation of his sentence.\n\n             We do not agree with this construct.         By its terms,\n\nsection 3582(c)(2) authorizes a reduction in sentence only if the\n\nreduction is \"consistent with applicable policy statements issued\n\nby the Sentencing Commission.\"      For present purposes, two policy\n\nstatements are germane.\n\n             The first of these policy statements says that \"if a\n\ncourt applies an earlier edition of the Guidelines Manual, the\n\ncourt shall consider subsequent amendments, to the extent that such\n\namendments are clarifying rather than substantive changes.\"            USSG\n\n§1B1.11(b)(2).     Thus, clarifying amendments — amendments that are\n\npurely expository — may be applied retroactively.            See United\n\nStates v. LaCroix, 28 F.3d 223, 227 n.4 (1st Cir. 1994); Isabel v.\n\nUnited States, 980 F.2d 60, 62 (1st Cir. 1992); see also David v.\n\nUnited States, 134 F.3d 470, 476 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n             Though he does not fully brief the point, Cabrera argues\n\nby implication that one portion of Amendment 640 — providing that\n\nthe safety valve is available regardless of whether there is a\n\nmandatory minimum sentence for the offense, see supra note 2 —\n\nmerely clarifies the existing guideline.       This is true as far as it\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fgoes; indeed, the commentary to the amendment says this explicitly.\n\nSee USSG supp. to App. C, amend. 640, at 265.         But that language\n\ncannot be read in a vacuum.      Amendment 640 also works a substantive\n\nchange in the applicable guideline because its principal effect is\n\nto create a new offense level cap for safety valve purposes.           See\n\nid. at 263.     For that reason, the three courts that have passed\n\nupon the point (including this court, albeit in a non-precedential\n\nopinion) have pronounced Amendment 640 to be substantive in nature.\n\nSee United States v. Diaz-Cardenas, 351 F.3d 404, 409-10 (9th Cir.\n\n2003); United States v. Coneo-Guerrero, 86 Fed. Appx. 438, 439 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam); United States v. Smith, 68 Fed. Appx. 514,\n\n514 (4th Cir. 2003) (per curiam).\n\n             A guideline amendment is either substantive or it is not.\n\nThis amendment is substantive.       See cases supra; see also United\n\nStates v. Descent, 292 F.3d 703, 708 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam)\n\n(directing courts to look at the \"significance of the amendment as\n\na whole\").    Amendment 640 is, therefore, not retroactive under the\n\n\"clarification\" doctrine.\n\n             This conclusion does not end our inquiry.    The fact that\n\na   guideline   amendment   is   substantive   in   character   does   not\n\nnecessarily vitiate all hope that it may apply retroactively. See,\n\ne.g., Desouza v. United States, 995 F.2d 323, 324 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(per curiam); United States v. Havener, 905 F.2d 3, 4-5 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    A second policy statement explains that a substantive\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fguideline amendment may be accorded retroactive effect if it is\n\nlisted in USSG §1B1.10(c).          See USSG §1B1.10(a); see also United\n\nStates v. Sanchez, 81 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1996); Desouza, 995 F.2d\n\nat 324.    Here, however, the Sentencing Commission did not see fit\n\nto include Amendment 640 in the section 1B1.10(c) list. Thus, that\n\npolicy statement closes the door on               Cabrera's claim that the\n\nSentencing Commission anticipated its retroactive application.                As\n\nthe Commission itself has admonished:            \"If none of the amendments\n\nlisted    in    subsection   (c)    is   applicable,   a   reduction    in   the\n\ndefendant's term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) is\n\nnot   consistent     with    this    policy    statement   and   thus   is   not\n\nauthorized.\"      USSG §1B1.10(a).       For this reason, we agree with the\n\nSecond Circuit that the Sentencing Commission's decision not to\n\nlist Amendment 640 (which, as we have said, is substantive) in USSG\n\n§1B1.10(c) deprives the amendment of any possible retroactive\n\neffect.    United States v. Garcia, 339 F.3d 116, 120 (2d Cir. 2003)\n\n(per curiam).\n\n               We add a coda.      Based on the record before us, Cabrera\n\nseems at all times to have satisfied the plain language of the\n\nsafety valve guideline.4        Had he raised his claim of entitlement to\n\n\n      4\n      The reason given by the district court for withholding relief\nunder the safety valve — Cabrera's supposed managerial role in the\noffense of conviction — would be no impediment. After all, the\ncourt did not impose a role-in-the-offense enhancement at\nsentencing, and the absence of such an adjustment defeats the\ncourt's subsequent rationale.       See USSG §5C1.2, cmt. (n.5)\n(explaining that a defendant is ineligible for the safety valve by\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthe safety valve at sentencing and appealed a denial, he may well\n\nhave succeeded in his quest.     See, e.g., Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d\n\nat 152.     But Cabrera never raised the point at the disposition\n\nhearing, and to make matters worse, he took no direct appeal from\n\nthe imposition of the sentence.    Those defaults are insurmountable\n\nin this proceeding.      After all, a motion to modify a sentence\n\ncannot be used as a substitute for a direct appeal.       United States\n\nv. Torres-Aquino, 334 F.3d 939, 941 (10th Cir. 2003) (finding that\n\na   defendant   improvidently   brought   a   section   3582   claim   and\n\nexplaining that \"[a]n argument that a sentence was incorrectly\n\nimposed should be raised on direct appeal or in a [section 2255]\n\nmotion\").\n\n            We need go no further.        Because Cabrera's motion to\n\nmodify his sentence lacks the necessary statutory grounding under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), we refuse to disturb the district court's\n\ndenial of that motion.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\nvirtue of a managerial role only if he has received a role-in-the-\noffense enhancement).\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

He did not appeal. Subsequently, however, he moved to modify his sentence. The district court denied that motion and Cabrera now invites us to reverse that ruling. We decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The historical facts are largely undisputed. Agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration apprehended and detained Cabrera on November 20, 1998, after they caught him red-handed receiving a package of heroin at the Luis Mu&#241;oz Marin International Airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico. To cut to the chase, Cabrera eventually pleaded guilty to one count of a second superseding indictment charging conspiracy with intent to distribute between 700 grams and one kilogram of heroin. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a), 841(b)(1)(B)(i), 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Cabrera on October 26, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The presentence investigation report recommended a base offense level of 30. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1(c)(5). With a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1(a), his adjusted offense level was 28. Because Cabrera had no prior criminal record, the guideline sentencing range (GSR) was 78-97 months. The district court sentenced him to the bottom of the applicable range. He did not seek, and the district court did not grant, a so-called \"safety valve\" adjustment. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 2D1.1(b)(6), 5C1.2; <i>see also United States v.

In view of this error, he moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. On April 30, 2003, the district court granted the motion, vacated the judgment, and then reentered it with a corrected description of the offense. The sentence itself remained unchanged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twenty-eight days later, Cabrera moved to modify his sentence. The gravamen of the motion was his argument that Amendment 640 to the sentencing guidelines, effective November 1, 2002, applied retroactively to his case and authorized the court to reduce his sentence by utilizing the safety valve adjustment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The government objected. In considering this motion, the district court did not address whether Amendment 640 applied retroactively or, indeed, whether it had any pertinence to Cabrera's case. Instead, the court disposed of the motion on the ground that Cabrera was ineligible for safety valve relief because of his managerial role in the offense of conviction. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not committed to the district court's reasoning, but, rather, may affirm its order on any independent ground made apparent by the record. <i>InterGen N.V. v.

But Cabrera never raised the point at the disposition hearing, and to make matters worse, he took no direct appeal from the imposition of the sentence. Those defaults are insurmountable in this proceeding. After all, a motion to modify a sentence cannot be used as a substitute for a direct appeal. <i>United States v. Torres-Aquino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163625\"><a href=\"/opinion/163625/united-states-v-torres-aquino/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">939</span></a></span>, 941 (10th Cir.2003) (finding that a defendant improvidently brought a section 3582 claim and explaining that \"[a]n argument that a sentence was incorrectly imposed should be raised on direct appeal or in a [section 2255] motion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because Cabrera's motion to modify his sentence lacks the necessary statutory grounding under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(2), we refuse to disturb the district court's denial of that motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The November 2000 edition of the sentencing guidelines controls in this case<i>See United States v.

Thus, we refer throughout to that edition.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The amendment relates to USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(6). It states that if a defendant receives a downward adjustment for a mitigating role in the offense, \"the base offense level under this subsection shall not be more than level 30.\" USSG supp. to App. C, amend. 640, at 263. It then adds a new application note, which explains in relevant part that \"[t]he applicability of [the safety valve] shall be determined without regard to whether the defendant was convicted of an offense that subjects the defendant to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.\"<i>Id.</i> at 264.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In other circumstances, it might be possible to construe the motion as one under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 for modification or vacation of an illegal sentence. That option is not available to Cabrera because of his previous section 2255 motion<i>See Sepulveda v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200481\"><a href=\"/opinion/200481/sepulveda-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2003) (noting restrictions on the bringing of \"second or successive\" section 2255 motions); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, &#182; 8.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The reason given by the district court for withholding relief under the safety valve &#8212; Cabrera's supposed managerial role in the offense of conviction &#8212; would be no impediment. After all, the court did not impose a role-in-the-offense enhancement at sentencing, and the absence of such an adjustment defeats the court's subsequent rationale<i>See</i> USSG &#167; 5C1.2, cmt. (n.5) (explaining that a defendant is ineligible for the safety valve by virtue of a managerial role only if he has received a role-in-the-offense enhancement).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
