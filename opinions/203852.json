Hill for appellant.\n          Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney,\n     with whom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and\n     Zechariah Chafee, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\n     brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                             ORDER OF COURT\n                         Entered: June 3, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f             Besosa, District Judge.           Appellant John L. Riccio was\n\nconvicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 by submitting a false\n\nstatement     on    a   background   check     form    (SF-86)   to   his     former\n\nemployer,     the       Transportation      Security    Administration        (TSA).\n\nMr. Riccio was later sentenced to a three-month prison term, with\n\ntwo years of supervised release.                   In an earlier opinion, we\n\naffirmed the judgment of the district court.                   United States v.\n\nRiccio, 529 F.3d 40 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             Appellant filed a Petition for Rehearing and Motion for\n\nClarification requesting that we amend our opinion because the\n\ngovernment had conceded that the trial judge’s oral pronouncement\n\nthat Mr. Riccio continue his current mental health counseling,\n\nwhich was on an outpatient basis, as a condition of release would\n\n“control over the written condition which included in-patient\n\ntreatment as well.”1          The government’s response to the petition\n\nsings a somewhat different tune.               Basing its argument on this\n\ncourt’s opinion, the government stated that because there was no\n\nmaterial     conflict      between   the    oral    sentence   and    the    written\n\njudgment, the government’s statement at oral argument does not\n\nprovide a basis for clarifying our decision.\n\n             Having reviewed the audio-recording of the argument held\n\non   March   4,    2008,    we   conclude    that     the   government      made   the\n\n\n      1\n       Fed. R. App. P. 40(a)(4) provides that if a petition for\nrehearing is granted, the court may “make a final disposition of\nthe case without reargument.”\n\n                                      - 2 -\n\fconcession    the   defendant   argues    for    at   oral    argument.     The\n\ngovernment said the following:\n\n       “We concede that if the defense is willing to live with\n       the oral condition as it was pronounced at sentencing\n       then we are willing to live with it as well.      And as\n       Judge Stahl has pointed out, normally the oral condition\n       controls anyway.    I had thought there was a broader\n       attack on the condition, but if the defense is\n       withdrawing the other facets of its attack. . .”\n\n\n            While we have recently held, in a somewhat different\n\ncontext, that “[t]his court is not bound by a party’s concessions,”\n\nUnited States v. Borrero-Acevedo, 533 F.3d 11, 15 n. 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (citing United States v. Mescual Cruz, 387 F.3d 1, 8 n. 2\n\n(1st Cir. 2004)), w4e have also held that an oral sentence prevails\n\nover a written judgment if there is a material conflict between the\n\ntwo.    See United States v. Sepúlveda-Contreras, 466 F.3d 166, 169\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).        Outpatient mental treatment is sufficiently\n\nmaterially different from inpatient mental treatment for us to\n\nrequire the district court make sure that its written sentencing\n\njudgment is the same as its oral sentencing judgment.\n\n            Appellant’s Motion for Clarification is granted and our\n\noriginal     decision   is   modified    to     reflect      the   government’s\n\nconcession at oral argument.       We remand the case to the district\n\ncourt so that the written judgment may be corrected to conform to\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 3 -\n\fthe judge’s oral pronouncement at the sentencing hearing.\n\n     SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n                              By the Court:\n\n                              /s/ Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n\n\ncc: Hon.
