Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n               Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges,\n                  and Domínguez,* District Judge.\n\n\n     William E. Christie, with whom Shaheen & Gordon, P.A., was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Aixa Maldonado-Quiñones, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, were on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n                           May 29, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f      Domínguez, District Judge. The instant case is an appeal from\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire,\n\nchallenging    the    district    court’s     denial   of   Donald   McMullin’s\n\n(“Appellant/McMullin”) motion to suppress as well as the subsequent\n\ndenial of Appellant’s motion to withdraw guilty plea resulting in\n\nhis conviction.\n\n      Appellant alleges that the district court erred in its finding\n\nof probable cause as there were no facts set forth in the affidavit\n\nin support of the warrant application to establish that Appellant\n\nhad placed Diazinon in the well of his next door neighbor, Mr.\n\nJames Fitzpatrick, or that any Diazinon was located on Appellant’s\n\nproperty.    Appellant further alleges that both the state district\n\njudge1 for the District Court of southern Carroll County, New\n\nHampshire and the federal district judge, incorrectly applied the\n\nlaw   by   citing    to   a   history   of    animus   between   McMullin   and\n\nFitzpatrick as the basis for probable cause when the facts stated\n\nin the affidavit were obtained from the victim, Fitzpatrick, an\n\ninterested, unreliable witness.          Moreover, Appellant contends that\n\nthe “good faith” exception is inapplicable because the affidavit\n\nwas lacking in probable cause and deficient as the Wakefield police\n\nomitted material facts from it.\n\n      As to Appellant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea McMullin\n\n\n1\n   The state district judge originally issued a search warrant\nrelated to a state attempted second degree assault and criminal\nmischief felony.\n\n                                        -2-\n\falleges that because the evidence shows that he did not comprehend\n\nthe law at the time he entered his guilty plea, the district court\n\nabused its discretion in denying his subsequent motion to withdraw\n\nthe guilty plea.\n\n     For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court’s\n\ndenial of Appellant’s motion to suppress and motion to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea.\n\n                          I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     On November 17, 2004, members of the Wakefield, New Hampshire\n\nPolice Department (\"WPD\") executed a state search warrant, issued\n\nby a state district court, of McMullin’s residence.   The original\n\nsearch warrant, which was based upon a search warrant application\n\nand supporting affidavit submitted by Sergeant Mark O’Brien, was\n\npart of an investigation into the poisoning or attempted poisoning\n\nof McMullin’s next door neighbor, Fitzpatrick.   The incriminating\n\nevidence recovered during the search, which consisted of more that\n\ntwo pounds of marijuana (found in a trash bag and in smaller bags\n\non different levels of the house), several firearms and ammunition,\n\nprompted the filing of the instant federal criminal indictment\n\ncharging McMullin with being an unlawful user in possession of a\n\nfirearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) (counts one and two),\n\nand an unlawful user in possession of ammunition in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(3) (counts three and four).\n\n     On December 5, 2005, Appellant sought to suppress both the\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fevidence seized and the self-incriminatory statements made to the\n\npolice during the execution of the warrant.             On May 3, 2006, the\n\ndistrict court denied on the record Appellant’s motion to suppress\n\nvia an endorsed order indicating that an opinion would follow.\n\nThereafter, Appellant entered into a conditional plea agreement,\n\nsigned on June 6, 2006, for which a plea hearing was held on June\n\n21, 2006.     During the plea colloquy the district court clarified\n\nthat McMullin had reserved the right to appeal the court’s endorsed\n\norder explaining its earlier denial of his motion to suppress.\n\nSubsequently, on July 8, 2006, the court issued an opinion denying\n\nAppellant’s    motion    to    suppress,      finding   that    there    was   a\n\nsubstantial    basis    from   which    the   issuing   state    judge    could\n\nreasonably conclude that a crime had been committed and that\n\nevidence of the crime would be found within Appellant’s premises.\n\nIn the alternative, the court found that the good faith exception\n\nto the Fourth Amendment’s exclusionary rule, set forth in United\n\nStates v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), applied to this case.\n\n     On August 15, 2006, nearly two months after Appellant’s change\n\nof plea hearing, wherein he was adjudicated guilty, but prior to\n\nsentencing, Appellant moved to withdraw his guilty plea as to\n\ncounts one and three of the indictment charging him with being an\n\nunlawful user of drugs in possession of a firearm and ammunition.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, Appellant filed a memorandum in support of his\n\noriginal motion.       In said motion McMullin alleged for the first\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\ftime that his guilty plea as to counts one and three had not been\n\nvoluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made.    Appellant alleged\n\nthat he was pressured into pleading guilty, that he had a short\n\ntime to make up his mind,2 and that he did not understand what\n\nbeing a user in possession of a firearm meant.       On January 31,\n\n2007, the district court held a hearing on McMullin’s petition to\n\nwithdraw his plea and on July 3, 2007, the district court denied\n\nhis request and entered judgment sentencing McMullin to a prison\n\nterm of twelve (12) months and one (1) day and three (3) years of\n\nsupervised release on each count.     The court found that Appellant\n\nhad failed to show that a fair and just reason existed to authorize\n\nthe withdrawal of his plea.      Consequently, on July 5, 2007,\n\nMcMullin timely filed a notice of appeal, contesting the district\n\ncourt’s denial of his motion to suppress as well as his request to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea as to counts one and three of the\n\nindictment.\n\n                          II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n     In this circuit a review of the denial of a motion to suppress\n\nis bifurcated: a district court’s legal conclusion that a given set\n\nof facts constituted probable cause will be reviewed de novo,\n\nwhereas factual findings are reviewed for clear error.        United\n\n\n\n2\n   Appellant signed his plea agreement on June 6, 2006. The plea\nhearing was held on June 21, 2006.\n\n                                -5-\n\fStates v. Vongkaysone, 434 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir. 2006).   “‘A clear\n\nerror exists only if, after considering all of the evidence, we are\n\nleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n\nmade.’” United States v. Woodbury, 511 F.3d 93, 96 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(quoting United States v. Charles, 213 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)).   The applicability of the Leon good faith exception is\n\nreviewed de novo.   See id. at 93 (citing United States v. Brunette,\n\n256 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 2001)).       However, “‘we will uphold a\n\ndistrict court’s decision to deny a suppression motion provided\n\nthat any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision.’”\n\nId. at 96-97 (quoting Charles, 213 F.3d at 18).\n\n     As to the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we\n\nreview for abuse of discretion.    United States v. Moore, 364 F.3d\n\n129, 134 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nB.   Motion to Suppress\n\n     In issuing the search warrant the state district judge found\n\nthat the Appellant had a motive to contaminate Fitzpatrick’s well\n\nconsidering that Fitzpatrick was to be a witness in a pending case\n\nagainst the Appellant. Furthermore, the state district judge found\n\nthat there was sufficient evidence to believe that crimes probably\n\nhad been committed and that evidence of those crimes would likely\n\nbe found in Appellant’s premises.3      On the other hand Appellant\n\n\n\n3\n   It should be noted that during the execution of the warrant the\npolice also located one opened bag of Diazinon in McMullin’s shed.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fcontends that at the time the Wakefield police requested the search\n\nwarrant, probable cause was absent.              Appellant further contends\n\nthat   since   the    affidavit    lacked      good    faith,   included   false\n\nstatements and material omissions, and was facially invalid, the\n\ngood faith exception is inapplicable to the instant case.\n\n       We disagree with Appellant’s contentions and conclude that the\n\ndistrict    court    did   not   err    in   denying   Appellant’s    motion   to\n\nsuppress.       We    concur     with    the    district    court’s    ultimate\n\ndetermination that the state district judge had a substantial basis\n\nfor concluding that probable cause existed to believe that McMullin\n\nhad contaminated Fitzpatrick’s well with Diazinon and that a fair\n\nprobability existed that the pesticide would still be at McMullin’s\n\nproperty.\n\n       1.   Probable Cause\n\n             The issuance of a warrant must satisfy two\n             requirements for constitutionality under the\n             Fourth Amendment, “ . . . [it] must\n             demonstrate probable cause to believe that (1)\n             a crime has been committed — the ‘commission’\n             element, and (2) enumerated evidence of the\n             offense will be found at the place to be\n             searched — the so — called ‘nexus’ element.”\n\nWoodbury, 511 F.3d at 97 (quoting United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d\n\n82, 86 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n             Probable cause to issue a search warrant\n             exists when “given all the circumstances set\n             forth in the affidavit . . . there is a fair\n             probability that contraband or evidence of a\n             crime will be found in a particular place.”\n             Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983).\n             “In   determining  the  sufficiency   of  an\n\n                                        -7-\n\f             affidavit supporting a search warrant, we\n             consider   whether  the  ‘totality   of   the\n             circumstances’   stated  in   the   affidavit\n             demonstrates probable cause to search the\n             premises.” United States v. Beckett, 321 F.3d\n             26, 31 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nUnited States v. Reiner, 500 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2007) (internal\n\ncitations modified).      A judge’s determination of probable cause\n\nmust be accorded “great deference by reviewing courts.” Gates, 462\n\nU.S. at 236 (citing Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 419\n\n(1969)).\n\n             The task of the issuing [judge] is simply to\n             make   a  practical,   common-sense   decision\n             whether, given all the circumstances set forth\n             in the affidavit before [her], including the\n             “veracity” and “basis of knowledge” of persons\n             supplying hearsay information, there is a fair\n             probability that contraband or evidence of a\n             crime will be found in a particular place.\n             And the duty of a reviewing court is simply to\n             ensure that the [judge] had a “substantial\n             basis for . . . conclud[ing]” that probable\n             cause existed.\n\nId. at 238-39 (emphasis supplied) (quoting Jones v. United States,\n\n362 U.S. 257, 271 (1960)); see also United States v. Grubbs, 547\n\nU.S. 90, 95 (2006) (quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 238).         “Moreover,\n\ngiven the strong preference for warrants under our Fourth Amendment\n\njurisprudence, normally a reviewing court will defer to an issuing\n\n[judge’s] ‘probable cause’ determination in a doubtful or marginal\n\ncase.”     United States v. Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n     After    reviewing   the   search   warrant   application   and   the\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fsupporting    affidavit     submitted       by    Sgt.     O’Brien     to    the    state\n\ndistrict     judge,    which     included        several     other     informational\n\nattachments, we find that the judge “had a ‘substantial basis for\n\n. . . conclud[ing]’ that probable cause existed.”                     Id.\n\n     Appellant requests us to consider that “[w]hen there is a\n\n‘significant    chance      that    an     accuser’s       lone      and    unverified\n\nallegations may be colored by existing acrimony with the accused,\n\nprobable cause is not present, and it would be ‘unconstitutional’\n\nto act just on the accuser’s words.”             Appellant’s Br. at 17 (citing\n\nHebron v. Touhy, 18 F.3d 421 (7th Cir. 1994)).\n\n     We disagree with Appellant’s contention that the warrant\n\napplication    and     supporting      affidavit     submitted         to    the    state\n\ndistrict judge contained only Fitzpatrick’s lone and unverified\n\nallegations.          On   the   contrary,        Sgt.     O’Brien         corroborated\n\nFitzpatrick’s    complaint       by,     among    other    things,     (1)    visiting\n\nFitzpatrick’s    residence       and     checking    the     contaminated          well’s\n\nlocation,    which    revealed     the    close    proximity      of    the    well   to\n\nMcMullin’s property and the ready access he had to the well at any\n\ntime of the day; (2) taking as evidence the tape and granular\n\nsubstances removed from the well; (3) reviewing, from the samples\n\nobtained by Fitzpatrick, the test results performed by DES Health\n\nRisk Group, which showed that Diazinon was present in the well;4\n\n\n4\n   We note that Sgt. O’Brien collected two samples from the well\nand although he submitted the samples to the lab for analysis, the\nresults were not available at the time that he applied for the\n\n                                         -9-\n\f(4) researching what Diazinon is used for, the effects of being\n\nexposed to it and how long it takes to disappear in water; (5)\n\nchecking the Wakefield Police Department records for any reports\n\nfiled by Fitzpatrick and/or McMullin in order to corroborate\n\nFitzpatrick’s allegation that there had been past disputes between\n\nthem; (6) verifying that two civil suits had been filed against\n\nMcMullin, one by the Crew Road Association for road damages and the\n\nother by the Town of Wakefield, for which Fitzpatrick was a\n\npotential witness; and finally (7) verifying that McMullin had been\n\ncharged and indicted on two felony charges involving multiple\n\nallegations of vandalism near Crew Road, and that the case was\n\npending before Carroll County Superior Court wherein Fitzpatrick\n\nwas also a potential witness.5     Therefore, any suspicion that might\n\nhave existed about the reliability of Fitzpatrick’s statements was\n\nallayed   by      Sgt.     O’Brien’s      aforementioned    corroborative\n\ninvestigations.     See Hebron, 18 F.3d at 423.\n\n     Furthermore,     we    are   satisfied    with   the   corroborative\n\ninvestigations performed by Sgt. O’Brien, and find that his efforts\n\nclearly established that Fitzpatrick was a reliable witness worthy\n\n\n\nsearch warrant.\n5\n   Appellant alleges that Fitzpatrick was never a witness against\nhim as stated in the affidavit. What the affidavit asserts is that\nin the cases “pending” before the state court, Fitzpatrick is a\nwitness.   It does not state that Fitzpatrick testified against\nMcMullin.   Fitzpatrick need only be announced as a potential\nwitness in order for said fact to cause “motive.”\n\n                                   -10-\n\fof credibility.     We cannot readily cast aside evidence provided by\n\nvictims as “[t]his court has affirmed that police officers can\n\njustifiably rely upon the credible complaint by a victim to support\n\na finding of probable cause.”        Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep’t,\n\n377 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing B.C.R. Transp. Co., Inc.,\n\nv. Fontaine, 727 F.2d. 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1984)); see also Acosta v.\n\nAmes Dep’t Stores, Inc., 386 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2004) (“Victims’\n\ncomplaints are a prime source of investigatory information for\n\npolice officers.      In the absence of circumstances that would raise\n\na reasonably prudent officer’s antennae, there is no requirement\n\nthat the officer corroborate every aspect of every complaint with\n\nextrinsic information. The uncorroborated testimony of a victim or\n\nother percipient witness, standing alone, ordinarily can support a\n\nfinding of probable cause.”)\n\n      Therefore, we agree with the district court that “the issuing\n\n[judge] could have drawn reasonable inferences from the attested\n\nfacts sufficient to support a probable cause determination, and, in\n\nany   event,    sufficient   to   satisfy   this   court   that   she   had   a\n\nsubstantial basis upon which to conclude that probable cause\n\nexisted.”      United States v. McMullin, No. 05-142, 2006 WL 2036994,\n\n*3 (D.N.H. July 18, 2006) (denial of motion to suppress).               First,\n\nthe record shows it was apparent that Fitzpatrick’s well had been\n\nintentionally contaminated with Diazinon since said chemical is not\n\nnaturally occurring nor can it penetrate through the ground, by\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fnatural means, to the level of the well pump, faucets and shower\n\nhead, in the granular form it was found.               Furthermore, the plumber\n\nwho    was   called   to    investigate         the    low    water   pressure   at\n\nFitzpatrick’s home was the person who discovered the granular\n\nsubstance in Fitzpatrick’s well, which was subsequently examined by\n\na state agency, and tested positive for Diazinon.                       The record\n\nfurther shows that since the well cap had a breather cap with a\n\nhole of around 2-3 inches in diameter that could be unscrewed,\n\nsomeone could have easily contaminated Fitzpatrick’s well with\n\nDiazinon through the cap.\n\n       Second, we find that McMullin had a motive to contaminate\n\nFitzpatrick’s well.        The record shows that said motive could have\n\nreasonably    emanated      from    the      history     of    animosity    between\n\nFitzpatrick    and    McMullin,     as    well    as   Fitzpatrick’s       potential\n\nparticipation as a witness in the civil and criminal cases pending\n\nagainst McMullin.6      Third, the record shows that McMullin also had\n\nthe best opportunity to put Diazinon in Fitzpatrick’s well since\n\nSgt. O’Brien’s investigation revealed that the well was located\n\nnear   the   boundary      line    between      McMullin’s     and    Fitzpatrick’s\n\nproperty, and McMullin had ready access to the well from his own\n\n\n6\n   The fact that exact copies of the police reports were not\nprovided to the state district judge, but a summary of each\ninstead, is of no consequence. The purpose of the information was\nsimply to corroborate the fact that there was an irrefutable\nhistory of animosity between McMullin and Fitzpatrick, to the point\nof resembling New Hampshire’s version of the Hatfields v. the\nMcCoys.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fproperty at any time.          Moreover, the authorities found unused\n\nquantities of the pesticide in Appellant’s possession.\n\n      Therefore, “[i]t was not unreasonable for [the state district\n\njudge] to determine that a crime was committed, and to infer that\n\ndefendant committed it, and, therefore, that he would likely\n\npossess pesticides containing Diazinon identical to those found in\n\nthe well.”    McMullin, 2006 WL 2036994, at *5.             Hence, we find that\n\nthe   state   district   judge   had     “‘substantial      basis    for   .   .   .\n\nconclud[ing]’ that probable cause existed.”                 Gates, 462 U.S. at\n\n238-39 (quoting Jones, 362 U.S. at 271).\n\n      Consequently, the district court did not err in denying\n\nAppellant’s    motion    to   suppress    and   we   need    not    consider   the\n\ndistrict court’s alternate holding concerning the Leon good faith\n\nexception.\n\nC.    Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea\n\n      The federal district judge, in denying Appellant’s motion to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea, found that McMullin had “not shown that\n\na fair and just reason exist[ed] such as to permit the withdrawal\n\nof his pleas.”     United States v. McMullin, No. 05-142, 2007 WL\n\n1933577, *1 (D.N.H. July 3, 2007) (denial of motion to withdraw\n\nguilty plea).     McMullin’s main allegation is that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw the\n\nguilty plea because that plea was not voluntary, intelligent and\n\nknowing. McMullin contends that the evidence shows that he did not\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\funderstand the law at the time he changed his plea,7 that he was\n\npressured into making the plea by his prior attorney, that he had\n\na short period of time to make up his mind on whether to change his\n\nplea, and that at the time of sentencing he was not on his normal\n\nmedications and had not eaten for nearly a day.\n\n     “It is well established that a defendant does not have an\n\nabsolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.”        United States v.\n\nNegron-Narvaez, 403 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\nConsequently, “[a] defendant bears the burden of demonstrating a\n\n‘fair and just reason’ for seeking to withdraw his plea.”    United\n\nStates v. Moore, 362 F.3d 129, 134 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32(d)). “In determining the weight to be attached to a\n\nproffered reason, a court ordinarily should focus on whether any of\n\nRule 11’s core concerns have been implicated, that is, whether the\n\nplea, when entered, was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing.”\n\nNegron-Narvaez, 403 F.3d at 36 (citing United States v. McDonald,\n\n121 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1997)).      In authorizing or rejecting a\n\ndefendant to withdraw his guilty plea, the court must assess\n\nwhether the defendant’s plea was “free from coercion, . . . [and\n\nwhether he] underst[ood] the charges, and . . . consequences of the\n\n\n\n7\n McMullin specifically contends that when he changed his plea, he\n“did not understand the law because he did not appreciate the\nmeaning of the term ‘unlawful user’ within the context of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(g)(3).” Appellant’s Br. 29.\n\n                               -14-\n\fguilty plea.”    United States v. Pagan-Ortega, 372 F.3d 22, 28 (1st\n\nCir.   2004).    The   court   should      also   consider   the   following\n\nadditional factors: “the plausibility of the proffered reason, the\n\ntiming of the attempted retraction, the presence or absence of a\n\nprotestation of innocence, and whether the circumstances cast\n\nserious doubt on the bona fides of the original plea.”               United\n\nStates v. Torres-Rosa, 209 F.3d 4, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 371 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)); see also Negron-Narvaez, 403 F.3d at 36 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Doyle, 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n       After reviewing the record we find that the district court\n\njudge did not abuse his discretion in denying Appellant’s motion to\n\nwithdraw. As found by the district court, Appellant’s “contentions\n\nare unsupported, and implausible.”         McMullin, 2007 WL 1933577, at\n\n*2.     The   record   pellucidly   shows     that   McMullin’s    plea   was\n\nvoluntary, intelligent, and knowing.         The court clearly explained\n\nthe elements of the offenses to McMullin, and McMullin stated under\n\noath that he understood them.\n\n       Most critical, on the day of the plea hearing, after McMullin\n\nhad agreed to plead guilty to counts one, two, three and four,\n\nMcMullin changed his mind as to counts two and four which charged\n\nhim with being a drug user in possession of firearms (count two)\n\nand ammunition (count four) from on or about September 7 through\n\nSeptember 21, 2005.      McMullin stated that since he had been in\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fpretrial confinement since his arrest on November 19, 2004, and\n\ntherefore had not used marijuana or been in possession of firearms\n\nand/or ammunition, which were at his house, he did not qualify as\n\na “drug user” from on or about September 7 through September 21,\n\n2005.   Appellant, therefore clearly understood that under Section\n\n922(g)(3), his drug use must have been contemporaneous with his\n\npossession of firearms and ammunition.   Consequently, we find, as\n\ndid the federal district court, that since he understood the\n\nrequirements under Section 922 (g)(3) pertaining to counts two and\n\nfour, he undeniably understood the requirements under Section\n\n922(g)(3) pertaining to counts one and three.\n\n       Furthermore, Appellant’s principal reason for requesting to\n\nwithdraw his plea, that had he realized what being an “unlawful\n\nuser” was under Section 922(g)(3), he would not have pled guilty\n\nsince he was not regularly using marijuana, is unsupported by the\n\nrecord.   First, the police seized from McMullin’s house more than\n\ntwo pounds of marijuana, several firearms and ammunition.      See\n\nHarris v. United States, 390 U.S. 234, 236 (1968) (“It has long\n\nbeen settled that objects falling in the plain view of an officer\n\nwho has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject\n\nto seizure and may be introduced in evidence.”).    Second, during\n\nthe plea hearing the district court explained, among other matters,\n\nthat\n\n           the government would have to prove that\n           [McMullin  was] an  unlawful user of  a\n\n                                -16-\n\f          controlled substance.    In this case . . .\n          that’s marijuana . . . and that at the time of\n          [his] unlawful use of marijuana [he was] . . .\n          – with respect to count one, . . . in\n          possession of a firearm . . . [a]nd with\n          respect to count three, while using marijuana\n          unlawfully,   [he   was]  in   possession   of\n          ammunition.\n\nCrim. Case No. 05-142-01-SM, Docket No. 48, pg. 7.    Following said\n\nexplanation Appellant was specifically asked whether he understood\n\nwhat had just been explained by the judge, to which McMullin\n\nanswered “Yes.”   Id.\n\n     Third, after the government’s factual representation of what\n\nthe government would be prepared to prove if the case went to\n\ntrial, the Judge stated that although he knew it was “a lengthy\n\nproffer and probably a lot of it d[id not] have to do particularly\n\nwith the offense charged . . . [t]he basic question [was, whether\n\nMcMullin was] in fact using marijuana at a time when [he] possessed\n\nthe firearms listed in the indictment.”        Id. at 11.   McMullin\n\nanswered, under oath, that “[j]ust [as to] count one and three [on]\n\nNovember 19 . . . Yes.”   Id.   In abundance of caution, the district\n\njudge asked McMullin if there was “[n]o doubt in [his] mind about\n\nthat at all.”   Id. at 12.   To which McMullin answered “[n]o, that’s\n\ntrue.”   Id.    McMullin was further asked by the district judge\n\nwhether he had “reviewed each term of the written plea agreement”\n\nwith his lawyer, and he answered “Yes.”     Id. at 14-15.\n\n     Fourth, the record shows that Appellant’s prior trial attorney\n\nspent long hours discussing with McMullin what constituted a “drug\n\n                                 -17-\n\fuser,”    what      “using     marijuana”      meant    with   respect    to\n\n“contemporaneously possessing” a firearm and fully advised McMullin\n\nas to the nature of his available defenses.\n\n     Fifth,   the     record    shows   that   during   a   parallel   state\n\nprosecution for possession with intent to distribute marijuana,\n\nwhich arose out of the same search and arrest, McMullin testified\n\nthat he was in fact a drug user on or about November 19, 2004.\n\nMcMullin further testified that he used marijuana to alleviate his\n\nmultiple sclerosis symptoms and that he had bought such a large\n\namount because he would “rather [buy] it once than thirty two\n\ntimes.”   Consequently, we leave unscathed the district judge’s\n\nconclusion that\n\n           [i]t is not plausible that when [McMullin]\n           admitted under oath that he used marijuana and\n           possessed firearms and ammunition on or about\n           November 19, 2004, he did not understand that\n           he was in fact a “user” at that time — both\n           because [Jonathan] Saxe [, his prior attorney]\n           fully explained the nature of any potential\n           defenses in that regard, and because he\n           admitted to being a user at the plea hearing\n           and had already testified under oath in the\n           state prosecution that he was then a regular\n           user — insisting that the large amount of\n           marijuana seized from his house was not\n           indicative of distribution but was strictly\n           for his personal (medicinal) use, and that he\n           expected to continue using it indefinitely\n           into the future due to his multiple sclerosis.\n\nMcMullin, 2007 WL 1933577, at *4.\n\n     Therefore, Appellant was clearly aware of the elements of the\n\noffense and understood what an “unlawful user” entailed under\n\nSection 922(g)(3).\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f       As to Appellant’s allegation that he was pressured or coerced\n\ninto pleading guilty as to counts one and three by his prior\n\nattorney, and that he had a short period of time to make up his\n\nmind on whether to change his plea, we find that these arguments\n\nwere not properly brought before this court and were therefore\n\nwaived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (“[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\n\nby some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.”).\n\nAppellant merely states that he met with his attorney on June 6,\n\n2006, in regard to the plea agreement, but that his attorney was\n\nnot permitted to have a contact visit and therefore had to go over\n\nthe agreement through the glass in the attorney—client meeting\n\narea.    Nothing in this factual scenario indicates that Appellant’s\n\nprior attorney pressured or coerced him in any way into pleading\n\nguilty or that Appellant had a short period of time to makeup his\n\nmind on whether to change his plea.         On the contrary, the record\n\nsupports the district court’s finding that Appellant’s lawyer\n\n“testified credibly, . . . that he spent numerous hours discussing\n\nwith    [McMullin]   the   ‘drug   user’   element,   the   temporal   nexus\n\nrequirement, that the drug use must be more than a single occasion,\n\nor sporadic use remote in time relative to the firearms/ammunition\n\npossession and relevant potential defenses.”           McMullin, 2007 WL\n\n1933577, at *3.\n\n       Finally, in a footnote Appellant tries to hint to the court\n\nthat he may have been confused or disoriented during the sentencing\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fhearing since he was not on his normal medications and had not\n\neaten for nearly a day.        We find this allegation to be unsupported\n\nby the record. The transcript of McMullin’s sentencing proceeding,\n\nheld on June 27, 2007, shows that McMullin responded coherently,\n\nintelligently, and clearly to all the questions asked by the\n\nattorneys and the court.          McMullin was also alert, clear, and\n\nconcise during his allocation. What is more, during the sentencing\n\nhearing the district court stated, in regard to McMullin’s multiple\n\nsclerosis condition, that he looked a little better than the last\n\ntime he appeared before the court.\n\n     Consequently, for the reasons stated above we find that the\n\ndistrict   court   did   not    err   in    denying   Appellant’s   motion   to\n\nwithdraw since the record clearly shows that Appellant’s plea was\n\nvoluntary, intelligent, and knowing.\n\n                               III.   CONCLUSION\n\n     Therefore,    we    affirm       the    district   court’s     denial   of\n\nAppellant’s motion to suppress and motion to vacate his guilty\n\nplea.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f",

Appellant further alleges that both the state district judge<sup>[1]</sup> for the District Court of southern Carroll County, New Hampshire and the federal district judge, incorrectly applied the law by citing to a history of animus between McMullin and Fitzpatrick as the basis for probable cause when the facts stated in the affidavit were obtained from the victim, Fitzpatrick, an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> interested, unreliable witness. Moreover, Appellant contends that the \"good faith\" exception is inapplicable because the affidavit was lacking in probable cause and deficient as the Wakefield police omitted material facts from it.</p>\n<p>As to Appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea McMullin alleges that because the evidence shows that he did not comprehend the law at the time he entered his guilty plea, the district court abused its discretion in denying his subsequent motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court's denial of Appellant's motion to suppress and motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. BACKGROUND</i></h2>\n<p>On November 17, 2004, members of the Wakefield, New Hampshire Police Department (\"WPD\") executed a state search warrant, issued by a state district court, of McMullin's residence. The original search warrant, which was based upon a search warrant application and supporting affidavit submitted by Sergeant Mark O'Brien, was part of an investigation into the poisoning or attempted poisoning of McMullin's next door neighbor, Fitzpatrick. The incriminating evidence recovered during the search, which consisted of more that two pounds of marijuana (found in a trash bag and in smaller bags on different levels of the house), several firearms and ammunition, prompted the filing of the instant federal criminal indictment charging McMullin with being an unlawful user in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) (counts one and two), and an unlawful user in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) (counts three and four).</p>\n<p>On December 5, 2005, Appellant sought to suppress both the evidence seized and the self-incriminatory statements made to the police during the execution of the warrant. On May 3, 2006, the district court denied on the record Appellant's motion to suppress via an endorsed order indicating that an opinion would follow. Thereafter, Appellant entered into a conditional plea agreement, signed on June 6, 2006, for which a plea hearing was held on June 21, 2006. During the plea colloquy the district court clarified that McMullin had reserved the right to appeal the court's endorsed order explaining its earlier denial of his motion to suppress. Subsequently, on July 8, 2006, the court issued an opinion denying Appellant's motion to suppress, finding that there was a substantial basis from which the issuing state judge could reasonably conclude that a crime had been committed and that evidence of the crime would be found within Appellant's premises. In the alternative, the court found that the good faith exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule, set forth in <i>United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), applied to this case.</p>\n<p>On August 15, 2006, nearly two months after Appellant's change of plea hearing, wherein he was adjudicated guilty, but prior to sentencing, Appellant moved to withdraw his guilty plea as to counts one and three of the indictment charging him with being an unlawful user of drugs in possession of a firearm and ammunition. On January 29, 2007, Appellant filed a memorandum in support of his original motion. In said motion McMullin alleged for the first time that his guilty plea as to counts one and three had not been voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made. Appellant alleged that he was pressured into pleading guilty, that he had a short time to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> make up his mind,<sup>[2]</sup> and that he did not understand what being a user in possession of a firearm meant. On January 31, 2007, the district court held a hearing on McMullin's petition to withdraw his plea and on July 3, 2007, the district court denied his request and entered judgment sentencing McMullin to a prison term of twelve (12) months and one (1) day and three (3) years of supervised release on each count. The court found that Appellant had failed to show that a fair and just reason existed to authorize the withdrawal of his plea. Consequently, on July 5, 2007, McMullin timely filed a notice of appeal, contesting the district court's denial of his motion to suppress as well as his request to withdraw his guilty plea as to counts one and three of the indictment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. ANALYSIS</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>In this circuit a review of the denial of a motion to suppress is bifurcated: a district court's legal conclusion that a given set of facts constituted probable cause will be reviewed <i>de novo,</i> whereas factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <i>United States v. Vongkaysone,</i> 434 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir.2006). \"`A clear error exists only if, after considering all of the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.'\" <i>United States v. Woodbury,</i> 511 F.3d 93, 96 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Charles,</i> 213 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir.2000)). The applicability of the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception is reviewed <i>de novo. See id.</i> at 93 (citing <i>United States v. Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.2001)). However, \"`we will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion provided that any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 96-97 (quoting <i>Charles,</i> 213 F.3d at 18).</p>\n<p>As to the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we review for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Moore,</i> 362 F.3d 129, 134 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>In issuing the search warrant the state district judge found that the Appellant had a motive to contaminate Fitzpatrick's well considering that Fitzpatrick was to be a witness in a pending case against the Appellant. Furthermore, the state district judge found that there was sufficient evidence to believe that crimes probably had been committed and that evidence of those crimes would likely be found in Appellant's premises.<sup>[3]</sup> On the other hand Appellant contends that at the time the Wakefield police requested the search warrant, probable cause was absent. Appellant further contends that since the affidavit lacked good faith, included false statements and material omissions, and was facially invalid, the good faith exception is inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p>We disagree with Appellant's contentions and conclude that the district court did not err in denying Appellant's motion to suppress. We concur with the district court's ultimate determination that the state district judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed to believe that McMullin had contaminated Fitzpatrick's well with Diazinon and that a fair probability existed that the pesticide would still be at McMullin's property.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> 1. Probable Cause</h2>\n<blockquote>The issuance of a warrant must satisfy two requirements for constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment, \". . . [it] must demonstrate probable cause to believe that (1) a crime has been committed  the `commission' element, and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be searched  the so  called `nexus' element.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Woodbury,</i> 511 F.3d at 97 (quoting <i>United States v. Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<blockquote>Probable cause to issue a search warrant exists when \"given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit . . . there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\" <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). \"In determining the sufficiency of an affidavit supporting a search warrant, we consider whether the `totality of the circumstances' stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause to search the premises.\" <i>United States v. Beckett,</i> 321 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir.2003).</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Reiner,</i> 500 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir.2007) (internal citations modified). A judge's determination of probable cause must be accorded \"great deference by reviewing courts.\" <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (citing <i>Spinelli v. United States,</i> 393 U.S. 410, 419, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969)).</p>\n<blockquote>The task of the issuing [judge] is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before [her], including the \"veracity\" and \"basis of knowledge\" of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. <i>And the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the [judge] had a \"substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]\" that probable cause existed.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (emphasis supplied) (quoting <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 362 U.S. 257, 271, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Grubbs,</i> 547 U.S. 90, 95, 126 S.Ct. 1494, 164 L.Ed.2d 195 (2006) (quoting <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317). \"Moreover, given the strong preference for warrants under our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, normally a reviewing court will defer to an issuing [judge's] `probable cause' determination in a doubtful or marginal case.\" <i>United States v. Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>After reviewing the search warrant application and the supporting affidavit submitted by Sgt. O'Brien to the state district judge, which included several other informational attachments, we find that the judge \"had a `substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]' that probable cause existed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Appellant requests us to consider that \"[w]hen there is a `significant chance that an accuser's lone and unverified allegations may be colored by existing acrimony with the accused, probable cause is not present, and it would be `unconstitutional' to act just on the accuser's words.\" Appellant's Br. at 17 (citing <i>Hebron v. Touhy,</i> 18 F.3d 421 (7th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p>We disagree with Appellant's contention that the warrant application and supporting affidavit submitted to the state district judge contained only Fitzpatrick's lone and unverified allegations. On the contrary, Sgt. O'Brien corroborated Fitzpatrick's complaint by, among other things, (1) visiting Fitzpatrick's residence and checking the contaminated well's location, which revealed the close proximity of the well to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> McMullin's property and the ready access he had to the well at any time of the day; (2) taking as evidence the tape and granular substances removed from the well; (3) reviewing, from the samples obtained by Fitzpatrick, the test results performed by DES Health Risk Group, which showed that Diazinon was present in the well;<sup>[4]</sup> (4) researching what Diazinon is used for, the effects of being exposed to it and how long it takes to disappear in water; (5) checking the Wakefield Police Department records for any reports filed by Fitzpatrick and/or McMullin in order to corroborate Fitzpatrick's allegation that there had been past disputes between them; (6) verifying that two civil suits had been filed against McMullin, one by the Crew Road Association for road damages and the other by the Town of Wakefield, for which Fitzpatrick was a <i>potential</i> witness; and finally (7) verifying that McMullin had been charged and indicted on two felony charges involving multiple allegations of vandalism near Crew Road, and that the case was pending before Carroll County Superior Court wherein Fitzpatrick was also a <i>potential</i> witness.<sup>[5]</sup> Therefore, any suspicion that might have existed about the reliability of Fitzpatrick's statements was allayed by Sgt. O'Brien's aforementioned corroborative investigations. <i>See </i><i>Hebron,</i> 18 F.3d at 423.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we are satisfied with the corroborative investigations performed by Sgt. O'Brien, and find that his efforts clearly established that Fitzpatrick was a reliable witness worthy of credibility. We cannot readily cast aside evidence provided by victims as \"[t]his court has affirmed that police officers can justifiably rely upon the credible complaint by a victim to support a finding of probable cause.\" <i>Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep't,</i> 377 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>B.C.R. Transp. Co., Inc., v. Fontaine,</i> 727 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1984)); <i>see also </i><i>Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc.,</i> 386 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.2004) (\"Victims' complaints are a prime source of investigatory information for police officers. In the absence of circumstances that would raise a reasonably prudent officer's antennae, there is no requirement that the officer corroborate every aspect of every complaint with extrinsic information. The uncorroborated testimony of a victim or other percipient witness, standing alone, ordinarily can support a finding of probable cause.\")</p>\n<p>Therefore, we agree with the district court that \"the issuing [judge] could have drawn reasonable inferences from the attested facts sufficient to support a probable cause determination, and, in any event, sufficient to satisfy this court that she had a substantial basis upon which to conclude that probable cause existed.\" <i>United States v. McMullin,</i> No. 05-142, 2006 WL 2036994, *3 (D.N.H. July 18, 2006) (denial of motion to suppress). First, the record shows it was apparent that Fitzpatrick's well had been intentionally contaminated with Diazinon since said chemical is not naturally occurring nor can it penetrate through the ground, by natural means, to the level of the well pump, faucets and shower head, in the granular form it was found. Furthermore, the plumber who <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> was called to investigate the low water pressure at Fitzpatrick's home was the person who discovered the granular substance in Fitzpatrick's well, which was subsequently examined by a state agency, and tested positive for Diazinon. The record further shows that since the well cap had a breather cap with a hole of around 2-3 inches in diameter that could be unscrewed, someone could have easily contaminated Fitzpatrick's well with Diazinon through the cap.</p>\n<p>Second, we find that McMullin had a motive to contaminate Fitzpatrick's well. The record shows that said motive could have reasonably emanated from the history of animosity between Fitzpatrick and McMullin, as well as Fitzpatrick's potential participation as a witness in the civil and criminal cases pending against McMullin.<sup>[6]</sup> Third, the record shows that McMullin also had the best opportunity to put Diazinon in Fitzpatrick's well since Sgt. O'Brien's investigation revealed that the well was located near the boundary line between McMullin's and Fitzpatrick's property, and McMullin had ready access to the well from his own property at any time. Moreover, the authorities found unused quantities of the pesticide in Appellant's possession.</p>\n<p>Therefore, \"[i]t was not unreasonable for [the state district judge] to determine that a crime was committed, and to infer that defendant committed it, and, therefore, that he would likely possess pesticides containing Diazinon identical to those found in the well.\" <i>McMullin,</i> 2006 WL 2036994, at *5. Hence, we find that the state district judge had \"`substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]' that probable cause existed.\" <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (quoting <i>Jones,</i> 362 U.S. at 271, 80 S.Ct. 725).</p>\n<p>Consequently, the district court did not err in denying Appellant's motion to suppress and we need not consider the district court's alternate holding concerning the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea</h2>\n<p>The federal district judge, in denying Appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, found that McMullin had \"not shown that a fair and just reason exist[ed] such as to permit the withdrawal of his pleas.\" <i>United States v. McMullin,</i> No. 05-142, 2007 WL 1933577, *1 (D.N.H. July 3, 2007) (denial of motion to withdraw guilty plea). McMullin's main allegation is that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw the guilty plea because that plea was not voluntary, intelligent and knowing. McMullin contends that the evidence shows that he did not understand the law at the time he changed his plea,<sup>[7]</sup> that he was pressured into making the plea by his prior attorney, that he had a short period of time to make up his mind on whether to change his plea, and that at the time of sentencing he was not on his normal medications and had not eaten for nearly a day.</p>\n<p>\"It is well established that a defendant does not have an absolute right <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> to withdraw a guilty plea.\" <i>United States v. Negron-Narvaez,</i> 403 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> 34 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.1994)). Consequently, \"[a] defendant bears the burden of demonstrating a `fair and just reason' for seeking to withdraw his plea.\" <i>United States v. Moore,</i> 362 F.3d 129, 134 (1st Cir.2004) (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d)). \"In determining the weight to be attached to a proffered reason, a court ordinarily should focus on whether any of Rule 11's core concerns have been implicated, that is, whether the plea, when entered, was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing.\" <i>Negron-Narvaez,</i> 403 F.3d at 36 (citing <i>United States v. McDonald,</i> 121 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.1997)). In authorizing or rejecting a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea, the court must assess whether the defendant's plea was \"free from coercion,. . . [and whether he] underst[ood] the charges, and . . . consequences of the guilty plea.\" <i>United States v. Pagan-Ortega,</i> 372 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.2004). The court should also consider the following additional factors: \"the plausibility of the proffered reason, the timing of the attempted retraction, the presence or absence of a protestation of innocence, and whether the circumstances cast serious doubt on the bona fides of the original plea.\" <i>United States v. Torres-Rosa,</i> 209 F.3d 4, 8-9 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>United States v. Parrilla-Tirado,</i> 22 F.3d 368, 371 (1st Cir.1994)); <i>see also </i><i>Negron-Narvaez,</i> 403 F.3d at 36 (quoting <i>United States v. Doyle,</i> 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p>After reviewing the record we find that the district court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Appellant's motion to withdraw. As found by the district court, Appellant's \"contentions are unsupported, and implausible.\" <i>McMullin,</i> 2007 WL 1933577, at *2. The record pellucidly shows that McMullin's plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing. The court clearly explained the elements of the offenses to McMullin, and McMullin stated under oath that he understood them.</p>\n<p>Most critical, on the day of the plea hearing, after McMullin had agreed to plead guilty to counts one, two, three and four, McMullin changed his mind as to counts two and four which charged him with being a drug user in possession of firearms (count two) and ammunition (count four) from on or about September 7 through September 21, 2005. McMullin stated that since he had been in pretrial confinement since his arrest on November 19, 2004, and therefore had not used marijuana or been in possession of firearms and/or ammunition, which were at his house, he did not qualify as a \"drug user\" from on or about September 7 through September 21, 2005. Appellant, therefore clearly understood that under Section 922(g)(3), his drug use must have been contemporaneous with his possession of firearms and ammunition. Consequently, we find, as did the federal district court, that since he understood the requirements under Section 922(g)(3) pertaining to counts two and four, he undeniably understood the requirements under Section 922(g)(3) pertaining to counts one and three.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Appellant's principal reason for requesting to withdraw his plea, that had he realized what being an \"unlawful user\" was under Section 922(g)(3), he would not have pled guilty since he was not regularly using marijuana, is unsupported by the record. First, the police seized from McMullin's house more than two pounds of marijuana, several firearms and ammunition. <i>See </i><i>Harris v. United States,</i> 390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968) (\"It has long been settled that objects falling in the plain view <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.\"). Second, during the plea hearing the district court explained, among other matters, that</p>\n<blockquote>the government would have to prove that [McMullin was] an unlawful user of a controlled substance. In this case . . . that's marijuana . . . and that at the time of [his] unlawful use of marijuana [he was] . . . -with respect to count one,. . . in possession of a firearm . . . [a]nd with respect to count three, while using marijuana unlawfully, [he was] in possession of ammunition.</blockquote>\n<p>Crim. Case No. 05-142-01-SM, Docket No. 48, pg. 7. Following said explanation Appellant was specifically asked whether he understood what had just been explained by the judge, to which McMullin answered \"Yes.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Third, after the government's factual representation of what the government would be prepared to prove if the case went to trial, the Judge stated that although he knew it was \"a lengthy proffer and probably a lot of it d[id not] have to do particularly with the offense charged . . . [t]he basic question [was, whether McMullin was] in fact using marijuana at a time when [he] possessed the firearms listed in the indictment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 11. McMullin answered, under oath, that \"[j]ust [as to] count one and three [on] November 19 . . . Yes.\" <i>Id.</i> In abundance of caution, the district judge asked McMullin if there was \"[n]o doubt in [his] mind about that at all.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12. To which McMullin answered \"[n]o, that's true.\" <i>Id.</i> McMullin was further asked by the district judge whether he had \"reviewed each term of the written plea agreement\" with his lawyer, and he answered \"Yes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14-15.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the record shows that Appellant's prior trial attorney spent long hours discussing with McMullin what constituted a \"drug user,\" what \"using marijuana\" meant with respect to \"contemporaneously possessing\" a firearm and fully advised McMullin as to the nature of his available defenses.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the record shows that during a parallel state prosecution for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, which arose out of the same search and arrest, McMullin testified that he was in fact a drug user on or about November 19, 2004. McMullin further testified that he used marijuana to alleviate his multiple sclerosis symptoms and that he had bought such a large amount because he would \"rather [buy] it once than thirty two times.\" Consequently, we leave unscathed the district judge's conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote>[i]t is not plausible that when [McMullin] admitted under oath that he used marijuana and possessed firearms and ammunition on or about November 19, 2004, he did not understand that he was in fact a \"user\" at that time  both because [Jonathan] Saxe [, his prior attorney] fully explained the nature of any potential defenses in that regard, and because he admitted to being a user at the plea hearing and had already testified under oath in the state prosecution that he was then a regular user  insisting that the large amount of marijuana seized from his house was not indicative of distribution but was strictly for his personal (medicinal) use, and that he expected to continue using it indefinitely into the future due to his multiple sclerosis.</blockquote>\n<p><i>McMullin,</i> 2007 WL 1933577, at *4.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Appellant was clearly aware of the elements of the offense and understood what an \"unlawful user\" entailed under Section 922(g)(3).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> As to Appellant's allegation that he was pressured or coerced into pleading guilty as to counts one and three by his prior attorney, and that he had a short period of time to make up his mind on whether to change his plea, we find that these arguments were not properly brought before this court and were therefore waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Appellant merely states that he met with his attorney on June 6, 2006, in regard to the plea agreement, but that his attorney was not permitted to have a contact visit and therefore had to go over the agreement through the glass in the attorney client meeting area. Nothing in this factual scenario indicates that Appellant's prior attorney pressured or coerced him in any way into pleading guilty or that Appellant had a short period of time to makeup his mind on whether to change his plea. On the contrary, the record supports the district court's finding that Appellant's lawyer \"testified credibly, . . . that he spent numerous hours discussing with [McMullin] the `drug user' element, the temporal nexus requirement, that the drug use must be more than a single occasion, or sporadic use remote in time relative to the firearms/ammunition possession and relevant potential defenses.\" <i>McMullin,</i> 2007 WL 1933577, at *3.</p>\n<p>Finally, in a footnote Appellant tries to hint to the court that he may have been confused or disoriented during the sentencing hearing since he was not on his normal medications and had not eaten for nearly a day. We find this allegation to be unsupported by the record. The transcript of McMullin's sentencing proceeding, held on June 27, 2007, shows that McMullin responded coherently, intelligently, and clearly to all the questions asked by the attorneys and the court. McMullin was also alert, clear, and concise during his allocation. What is more, during the sentencing hearing the district court stated, in regard to McMullin's multiple sclerosis condition, that he looked a little better than the last time he appeared before the court.</p>\n<p>Consequently, for the reasons stated above we find that the district court did not err in denying Appellant's motion to withdraw since the record clearly shows that Appellant's plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>III.

Appellant further alleges that both the state district judge<sup>[1]</sup> for the District Court of southern Carroll County, New Hampshire and the federal district judge, incorrectly applied the law by citing to a history of animus between McMullin and Fitzpatrick as the basis for probable cause when the facts stated in the affidavit were obtained from the victim, Fitzpatrick, an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> interested, unreliable witness. Moreover, Appellant contends that the \"good faith\" exception is inapplicable because the affidavit was lacking in probable cause and deficient as the Wakefield police omitted material facts from it.</p>\n<p>As to Appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea McMullin alleges that because the evidence shows that he did not comprehend the law at the time he entered his guilty plea, the district court abused its discretion in denying his subsequent motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court's denial of Appellant's motion to suppress and motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. BACKGROUND</i></h2>\n<p>On November 17, 2004, members of the Wakefield, New Hampshire Police Department (\"WPD\") executed a state search warrant, issued by a state district court, of McMullin's residence. The original search warrant, which was based upon a search warrant application and supporting affidavit submitted by Sergeant Mark O'Brien, was part of an investigation into the poisoning or attempted poisoning of McMullin's next door neighbor, Fitzpatrick. The incriminating evidence recovered during the search, which consisted of more that two pounds of marijuana (found in a trash bag and in smaller bags on different levels of the house), several firearms and ammunition, prompted the filing of the instant federal criminal indictment charging McMullin with being an unlawful user in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) (counts one and two), and an unlawful user in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) (counts three and four).</p>\n<p>On December 5, 2005, Appellant sought to suppress both the evidence seized and the self-incriminatory statements made to the police during the execution of the warrant. On May 3, 2006, the district court denied on the record Appellant's motion to suppress via an endorsed order indicating that an opinion would follow. Thereafter, Appellant entered into a conditional plea agreement, signed on June 6, 2006, for which a plea hearing was held on June 21, 2006. During the plea colloquy the district court clarified that McMullin had reserved the right to appeal the court's endorsed order explaining its earlier denial of his motion to suppress. Subsequently, on July 8, 2006, the court issued an opinion denying Appellant's motion to suppress, finding that there was a substantial basis from which the issuing state judge could reasonably conclude that a crime had been committed and that evidence of the crime would be found within Appellant's premises. In the alternative, the court found that the good faith exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule, set forth in <i>United States v. Leon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (1984), applied to this case.</p>\n<p>On August 15, 2006, nearly two months after Appellant's change of plea hearing, wherein he was adjudicated guilty, but prior to sentencing, Appellant moved to withdraw his guilty plea as to counts one and three of the indictment charging him with being an unlawful user of drugs in possession of a firearm and ammunition. On January 29, 2007, Appellant filed a memorandum in support of his original motion. In said motion McMullin alleged for the first time that his guilty plea as to counts one and three had not been voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made. Appellant alleged that he was pressured into pleading guilty, that he had a short time to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> make up his mind,<sup>[2]</sup> and that he did not understand what being a user in possession of a firearm meant. On January 31, 2007, the district court held a hearing on McMullin's petition to withdraw his plea and on July 3, 2007, the district court denied his request and entered judgment sentencing McMullin to a prison term of twelve (12) months and one (1) day and three (3) years of supervised release on each count. The court found that Appellant had failed to show that a fair and just reason existed to authorize the withdrawal of his plea. Consequently, on July 5, 2007, McMullin timely filed a notice of appeal, contesting the district court's denial of his motion to suppress as well as his request to withdraw his guilty plea as to counts one and three of the indictment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. ANALYSIS</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>In this circuit a review of the denial of a motion to suppress is bifurcated: a district court's legal conclusion that a given set of facts constituted probable cause will be reviewed <i>de novo,</i> whereas factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <i>United States v. Vongkaysone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202015\"><a href=\"/opinion/202015/united-states-v-vongkaysone/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2006). \"`A clear error exists only if, after considering all of the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.'\" <i>United States v.

The applicability of the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception is reviewed <i>de novo. See id.</i> at 93 (citing <i>United States v.

However, \"`we will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion provided that any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 96-97 (quoting <i>Charles,</i> 213 F.3d at 18).</p>\n<p>As to the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we review for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>In issuing the search warrant the state district judge found that the Appellant had a motive to contaminate Fitzpatrick's well considering that Fitzpatrick was to be a witness in a pending case against the Appellant. Furthermore, the state district judge found that there was sufficient evidence to believe that crimes probably had been committed and that evidence of those crimes would likely be found in Appellant's premises.<sup>[3]</sup> On the other hand Appellant contends that at the time the Wakefield police requested the search warrant, probable cause was absent. Appellant further contends that since the affidavit lacked good faith, included false statements and material omissions, and was facially invalid, the good faith exception is inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p>We disagree with Appellant's contentions and conclude that the district court did not err in denying Appellant's motion to suppress. We concur with the district court's ultimate determination that the state district judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed to believe that McMullin had contaminated Fitzpatrick's well with Diazinon and that a fair probability existed that the pesticide would still be at McMullin's property.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> 1. Probable Cause</h2>\n<blockquote>The issuance of a warrant must satisfy two requirements for constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment, \". . .

On the contrary, Sgt. O'Brien corroborated Fitzpatrick's complaint by, among other things, (1) visiting Fitzpatrick's residence and checking the contaminated well's location, which revealed the close proximity of the well to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> McMullin's property and the ready access he had to the well at any time of the day; (2) taking as evidence the tape and granular substances removed from the well; (3) reviewing, from the samples obtained by Fitzpatrick, the test results performed by DES Health Risk Group, which showed that Diazinon was present in the well;<sup>[4]</sup> (4) researching what Diazinon is used for, the effects of being exposed to it and how long it takes to disappear in water; (5) checking the Wakefield Police Department records for any reports filed by Fitzpatrick and/or McMullin in order to corroborate Fitzpatrick's allegation that there had been past disputes between them; (6) verifying that two civil suits had been filed against McMullin, one by the Crew Road Association for road damages and the other by the Town of Wakefield, for which Fitzpatrick was a <i>potential</i> witness; and finally (7) verifying that McMullin had been charged and indicted on two felony charges involving multiple allegations of vandalism near Crew Road, and that the case was pending before Carroll County Superior Court wherein Fitzpatrick was also a <i>potential</i> witness.<sup>[5]</sup> Therefore, any suspicion that might have existed about the reliability of Fitzpatrick's statements was allayed by Sgt. O'Brien's aforementioned corroborative investigations. <i>See </i><i>Hebron,</i> 18 F.3d at 423.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we are satisfied with the corroborative investigations performed by Sgt.

First, the record shows it was apparent that Fitzpatrick's well had been intentionally contaminated with Diazinon since said chemical is not naturally occurring nor can it penetrate through the ground, by natural means, to the level of the well pump, faucets and shower head, in the granular form it was found. Furthermore, the plumber who <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> was called to investigate the low water pressure at Fitzpatrick's home was the person who discovered the granular substance in Fitzpatrick's well, which was subsequently examined by a state agency, and tested positive for Diazinon. The record further shows that since the well cap had a breather cap with a hole of around 2-3 inches in diameter that could be unscrewed, someone could have easily contaminated Fitzpatrick's well with Diazinon through the cap.</p>\n<p>Second, we find that McMullin had a motive to contaminate Fitzpatrick's well. The record shows that said motive could have reasonably emanated from the history of animosity between Fitzpatrick and McMullin, as well as Fitzpatrick's potential participation as a witness in the civil and criminal cases pending against McMullin.<sup>[6]</sup> Third, the record shows that McMullin also had the best opportunity to put Diazinon in Fitzpatrick's well since Sgt. O'Brien's investigation revealed that the well was located near the boundary line between McMullin's and Fitzpatrick's property, and McMullin had ready access to the well from his own property at any time. Moreover, the authorities found unused quantities of the pesticide in Appellant's possession.</p>\n<p>Therefore, \"[i]t was not unreasonable for [the state district judge] to determine that a crime was committed, and to infer that defendant committed it, and, therefore, that he would likely possess pesticides containing Diazinon identical to those found in the well.\" <i>McMullin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2036994</span></span>, at *5.

The record pellucidly shows that McMullin's plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing. The court clearly explained the elements of the offenses to McMullin, and McMullin stated under oath that he understood them.</p>\n<p>Most critical, on the day of the plea hearing, after McMullin had agreed to plead guilty to counts one, two, three and four, McMullin changed his mind as to counts two and four which charged him with being a drug user in possession of firearms (count two) and ammunition (count four) from on or about September 7 through September 21, 2005. McMullin stated that since he had been in pretrial confinement since his arrest on November 19, 2004, and therefore had not used marijuana or been in possession of firearms and/or ammunition, which were at his house, he did not qualify as a \"drug user\" from on or about September 7 through September 21, 2005. Appellant, therefore clearly understood that under Section 922(g)(3), his drug use must have been contemporaneous with his possession of firearms and ammunition. Consequently, we find, as did the federal district court, that since he understood the requirements under Section 922(g)(3) pertaining to counts two and four, he undeniably understood the requirements under Section 922(g)(3) pertaining to counts one and three.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Appellant's principal reason for requesting to withdraw his plea, that had he realized what being an \"unlawful user\" was under Section 922(g)(3), he would not have pled guilty since he was not regularly using marijuana, is unsupported by the record. First, the police seized from McMullin's house more than two pounds of marijuana, several firearms and ammunition. <i>See </i><i>Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107625\"><a href=\"/opinion/107625/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, 236, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107625\"><a href=\"/opinion/107625/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Second, during the plea hearing the district court explained, among other matters, that</p>\n<blockquote>the government would have to prove that [McMullin was] an unlawful user of a controlled substance. In this case . . . that's marijuana . . . and that at the time of [his] unlawful use of marijuana [he was] . . . -with respect to count one,. . . in possession of a firearm . . . [a]nd with respect to count three, while using marijuana unlawfully, [he was] in possession of ammunition.</blockquote>\n<p>Crim. Case No. 05-142-01-SM, Docket No. 48, pg. 7. Following said explanation Appellant was specifically asked whether he understood what had just been explained by the judge, to which McMullin answered \"Yes.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Third, after the government's factual representation of what the government would be prepared to prove if the case went to trial, the Judge stated that although he knew it was \"a lengthy proffer and probably a lot of it d[id not] have to do particularly with the offense charged . . . [t]he basic question [was, whether McMullin was] in fact using marijuana at a time when [he] possessed the firearms listed in the indictment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 11. McMullin answered, under oath, that \"[j]ust [as to] count one and three [on] November 19 . . . Yes.\" <i>Id.</i> In abundance of caution, the district judge asked McMullin if there was \"[n]o doubt in [his] mind about that at all.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12. To which McMullin answered \"[n]o, that's true.\" <i>Id.</i> McMullin was further asked by the district judge whether he had \"reviewed each term of the written plea agreement\" with his lawyer, and he answered \"Yes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14-15.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the record shows that Appellant's prior trial attorney spent long hours discussing with McMullin what constituted a \"drug user,\" what \"using marijuana\" meant with respect to \"contemporaneously possessing\" a firearm and fully advised McMullin as to the nature of his available defenses.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the record shows that during a parallel state prosecution for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, which arose out of the same search and arrest, McMullin testified that he was in fact a drug user on or about November 19, 2004. McMullin further testified that he used marijuana to alleviate his multiple sclerosis symptoms and that he had bought such a large amount because he would \"rather [buy] it once than thirty two times.\" Consequently, we leave unscathed the district judge's conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote>[i]t is not plausible that when [McMullin] admitted under oath that he used marijuana and possessed firearms and ammunition on or about November 19, 2004, he did not understand that he was in fact a \"user\" at that time  both because [Jonathan] Saxe [, his prior attorney] fully explained the nature of any potential defenses in that regard, and because he admitted to being a user at the plea hearing and had already testified under oath in the state prosecution that he was then a regular user  insisting that the large amount of marijuana seized from his house was not indicative of distribution but was strictly for his personal (medicinal) use, and that he expected to continue using it indefinitely into the future due to his multiple sclerosis.</blockquote>\n<p><i>McMullin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1933577</span></span>, at *4.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Appellant was clearly aware of the elements of the offense and understood what an \"unlawful user\" entailed under Section 922(g)(3).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> As to Appellant's allegation that he was pressured or coerced into pleading guilty as to counts one and three by his prior attorney, and that he had a short period of time to make up his mind on whether to change his plea, we find that these arguments were not properly brought before this court and were therefore waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Appellant merely states that he met with his attorney on June 6, 2006, in regard to the plea agreement, but that his attorney was not permitted to have a contact visit and therefore had to go over the agreement through the glass in the attorney client meeting area. Nothing in this factual scenario indicates that Appellant's prior attorney pressured or coerced him in any way into pleading guilty or that Appellant had a short period of time to makeup his mind on whether to change his plea. On the contrary, the record supports the district court's finding that Appellant's lawyer \"testified credibly, . . . that he spent numerous hours discussing with [McMullin] the `drug user' element, the temporal nexus requirement, that the drug use must be more than a single occasion, or sporadic use remote in time relative to the firearms/ammunition possession and relevant potential defenses.\" <i>McMullin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1933577</span></span>, at *3.</p>\n<p>Finally, in a footnote Appellant tries to hint to the court that he may have been confused or disoriented during the sentencing hearing since he was not on his normal medications and had not eaten for nearly a day. We find this allegation to be unsupported by the record. The transcript of McMullin's sentencing proceeding, held on June 27, 2007, shows that McMullin responded coherently, intelligently, and clearly to all the questions asked by the attorneys and the court. McMullin was also alert, clear, and concise during his allocation. What is more, during the sentencing hearing the district court stated, in regard to McMullin's multiple sclerosis condition, that he looked a little better than the last time he appeared before the court.</p>\n<p>Consequently, for the reasons stated above we find that the district court did not err in denying Appellant's motion to withdraw since the record clearly shows that Appellant's plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>III. CONCLUSION</i></h2>\n<p>Therefore, we affirm the district court's denial of Appellant's motion to suppress and motion to vacate his guilty plea.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The state district judge originally issued a search warrant related to a state attempted second degree assault and criminal mischief felony.</p>\n<p>[2]  Appellant signed his plea agreement on June 6, 2006. The plea hearing was held on June 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>[3]  It should be noted that during the execution of the warrant the police also located one opened bag of Diazinon in McMullin's shed.</p>\n<p>[4]  We note that Sgt. O'Brien collected two samples from the well and although he submitted the samples to the lab for analysis, the results were not available at the time that he applied for the search warrant.</p>\n<p>[5]  Appellant alleges that Fitzpatrick was never a witness against him as stated in the affidavit. What the affidavit asserts is that in the cases \"pending\" before the state court, Fitzpatrick is a witness. It does not state that Fitzpatrick testified against McMullin. Fitzpatrick need only be announced as a <i>potential</i> witness in order for said fact to cause \"motive.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  The fact that exact copies of the police reports were not provided to the state district judge, but a summary of each instead, is of no consequence. The purpose of the information was simply to corroborate the fact that there was an irrefutable history of animosity between McMullin and Fitzpatrick, to the point of resembling New Hampshire's version of the <i>Hatfields v. the McCoys.</i></p>\n<p>[7]  McMullin specifically contends that when he changed his plea, he \"did not understand the law because he did not appreciate the meaning of the term `unlawful user' within the context of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3).\" Appellant's Br. 29.</p>\n\n</div>",
