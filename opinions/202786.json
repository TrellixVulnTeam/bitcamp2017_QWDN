Local 7--a labor union--is a party\n\nto a multi-employer collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") with\n\nvarious steel-erection contractors and subcontractors, some of whom\n\nare members of three employer associations.1   Under the terms of an\n\nagreement effective in September 2004, signatory contractors must\n\ncontribute to the Iron Workers District Council of New England\n\nPension Fund, Health and Welfare Fund, Pension Supplemental Fund\n\nand Annuity Fund.\n\n          The    agreement   required     pay-as-you-go    employer\n\ncontributions (by means of prepaid stamps) and the bonding of new\n\nand delinquent employers to protect the funds against nonpayment.\n\nIn June 2005, the associations requested that Local 7 enforce the\n\npayment and bond provisions; the bonding requirements had been\n\nignored and, the associations said, their members were bidding for\n\njobs in a competitive market against other employers who were\n\ndelinquent in making fund payments.\n\n          In response, the trustees of the funds (there are union\n\nand management trustees in each fund) adopted procedures for\n\ndelinquency collection and auditing, but they declined to impose\n\nthe bonding requirements set forth in the CBA.     The associations\n\n\n\n     1\n      Local 7 is a local in the International Association of\nBridge, Structural, Ornamental, and Reinforcing Iron Workers Union.\nThe employer associations are the Associated General Contractors of\nMassachusetts, Inc., the Building Trades Employers' Association of\nBoston and Eastern Massachusetts, and the Northeast Erectors\nAssociation.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fthen sought arbitration against Local 7 as specified in the CBA,\n\nwhich contains a broadly phrased arbitration clause.\n\n            Following a hearing, the arbitrator found the dispute to\n\nbe arbitrable, ruled that the local had not been enforcing the\n\npayment or bonding requirements, and directed that the union do\n\nboth--with one qualification: that bonding not be required for all\n\nnew employers but only for employers, new or old, who had been\n\n\"habitually delinquent in their [fund] payment[s].\" The arbitrator\n\ndirected the parties to meet regularly with each other and the fund\n\ntrustees in order to design methods for the necessary audits.\n\n            Local 7 moved in the district court to vacate the award\n\nand the associations counterclaimed to enforce the arbitrator's\n\ndecision.   See 9 U.S.C. ยง 10 (2000); 29 U.S.C. ยง 185.   The district\n\ncourt sided with the associations.     Local 7 now seeks review in\n\nthis court, arguing that the grievance was not arbitrable under the\n\nCBA, that the arbitrator erred on the merits and that the decision\n\nviolates public policy on several different grounds.      We address\n\nthe issues, which are primarily legal, in this order.\n\n            Local 7 first says the dispute is not arbitrable under\n\nthe CBA.    The CBA contains the payment and bonding requirements\n\nalready described and also provides for arbitration under the CBA\n\nas to \"all questions involving the interpretation and application\n\nof any section of this Agreement.\"      On the face of the matter,\n\nLocal 7's failure to enforce payment and bonding requirements\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fprovided for in the CBA itself looks like a violation of the CBA\n\nfor which arbitration under the CBA is a proper remedy.\n\n            Local 7 counters that the agreements establishing the\n\ntrust funds provide for arbitration of disagreements among the\n\ntrustees and prohibit arbitration under the CBA of \"any matter\n\narising in connection with the administration of\" the funds.    The\n\ntrust agreements also provide for the trustees to make rules and\n\nregulations \"for the collection and administration of employer\n\ncontributions\" to the funds. Collection and bonding, says Local 7,\n\nare matters of administration under the trust agreements and not\n\nthe CBA.\n\n           Ordinarily, whether a dispute falls within an arbitration\n\nagreement is a matter of law for the court.   Howsam v. Dean Witter\n\nReynolds, 537 U.S. 79, 84 (2002).       The term \"administration,\"\n\npertinently used in the Taft-Hartley Act, has been read broadly by\n\nsome courts and narrowly by others.2   But the question before us is\n\nnot one of abstractly defining a single term but of making workable\n\nsense of the CBA which provides for funding the trusts, the closely\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 186(c)(5) (2000), requires\nthat such trust agreements contain a clause for arbitration of\nmatters pertaining to the administration of such funds. For cases\nconstruing \"administration,\" compare Mahoney v. Fisher, 277 F.2d 5,\n5 (2d Cir. 1960), and Gold v. Pennachio, 757 F. Supp. 13, 16\n(S.D.N.Y. 1991), with Jackson v. Smith, 927 F.2d 544, 548-49 (11th\nCir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 909 (1991), and Ader v. Hughes, 570\nF.2d 303, 307 (10th Cir. 1978). See generally Hawkins v. Bennett,\n704 F.2d 1157, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 1983).\n\n                                -4-\n\frelated trust agreements and the respective arbitration clauses\n\nwhich purport to be exclusive of one another.\n\n          The district court expressed doubt whether the trust\n\narbitration provision had any relevance where, as here, there is no\n\nreported disagreement among the trustees.           In all events, the\n\nobligations   that   the   associations    here   seek   to   enforce   for\n\ncollection and bonding are explicitly set forth in the CBA; the\n\narbitrator's decision is enforcing obligations against the union as\n\na party to the CBA; and the powers of the trustees to manage the\n\ntrust are not being curtailed or frustrated.\n\n          This brings us to Local 7's \"merits\" claim which is\n\neasily resolved.     Our review, although de novo as to the district\n\ncourt, is highly deferential as to the arbitrator.        Salem Hosp. v.\n\nMass. Nurses Ass'n, 449 F.3d 234, 237-38 (1st Cir. 2006).           \"[A]s\n\nlong as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the\n\ncontract,\" a court's view that the arbitrator has erred is not\n\nenough to overturn the arbitrator's decision.       United Paperworkers\n\nInt'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987).\n\n          The union argues that even if the dispute is arbitrable\n\nunder the CBA, the arbitrator erred in finding that the union was\n\nviolating the bonding requirement.        Although bonding requirements\n\nare explicitly set forth in the CBA, the union points to language\n\nin the CBA stating that \"[d]etails of said bond are set forth\" in\n\nthe incorporated trust agreements.        Because no such details have\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fbeen set forth, the union suggests that there are no requirements\n\nthat it needed to enforce.\n\n          But   this    case    concerns       a   disregard   of    the   bonding\n\nrequirement itself--which is plainly included in the CBA--and not\n\na dispute about details.        Nor, contrary to the union's claim, has\n\nthe arbitrator ordered the trustees to adopt specific details; if\n\nthe trustees do, these details may govern what needs to be included\n\nin the bond but, if they do not, the union and the associations\n\nwill presumably work out a means of complying.\n\n          The union also says that imposing the bonding requirement\n\non, and only on, delinquent employers does not carry out the CBA\n\nwhich required initial bonding, dropped the obligation for those\n\nwhose records proved good, and finally provided for reinstatement\n\nof bonding for those who became delinquent after canceling the\n\nbond.   Given the history of non-enforcement, the arbitrator's\n\nsimplified application was within his informed discretion.                      Cf.\n\nGen. Tel. Co. of Ohio v. Commc'ns Workers of Am., 648 F.2d 452, 457\n\n(6th Cir. 1981).\n\n          Lastly,      the     union    says       that   enforcement      of   the\n\narbitrator's    decision     would     violate     public   policy    in   several\n\nrespects. The first and second of the public policy arguments--and\n\npossibly the third--were not presented to the arbitrator and have\n\narguably been waived.        Although the union says that public policy\n\nissues are for the court and not the arbitrator, issues should\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fnormally be presented to an arbitrator even though a court may have\n\nthe last word.3           In any event, the public policy arguments have no\n\nsupport in the present record.\n\n                  First, the union says that the decision violates the\n\nantitrust laws because the associations are suppressing competition\n\nfrom new and smaller companies who will be burdened by the bonding\n\nrequirement.           Post-arbitration affidavits from union officials\n\nconjecture         that   this      was    the    purpose      of   the     associations   in\n\npursuing the grievance.                   In fact, the CBA imposes contribution\n\nrequirements on all employers who choose to sign, and the bonding\n\nrequirement, as implemented by the arbitrator, applies to all\n\nrepeat delinquents, whether they are new or established employers.\n\n                  Collective     bargaining        agreements         are    in   substantial\n\nmeasure shielded from antitrust attack, see Brown v. Pro Football,\n\nInc., 518 U.S. 231, 235-37 (1996), but with limited exceptions\n\nwhere the agreements are misused to suppress competition.                                  See\n\nUnited Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657 (1965).\n\nThis       case    provides    no    occasion          to   explore    the    subtleties   of\n\n\n       3\n      Some courts have found public policy claims not raised before\nan arbitrator to have been waived; one circuit disagrees. Compare\nDistrict 17, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Island Creek Coal Co.,\n179 F.3d 133, 140 (4th Cir. 1999), and Chem. Overseas Holdings,\nInc. v. Republica Oriental del Uru., 371 F. Supp. 2d 400, 401\n(S.D.N.Y. 2005), aff'd, No. 05-4068-CV, 2006 WL 1049081 (2d Cir.\nApr. 14, 2006), with Gulf Coast Indus. Workers Union v. Exxon Co.,\n991 F.2d 244, 248 n.5 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 965\n(1993). The matter may turn on the nature of the public policy and\nwhether it makes sense for the arbitrator to consider the objection\nin the first instance.\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fpertinent    doctrine.      Nothing    in    the   union's    post-arbitration\n\naffidavits, even assuming they are properly considered, comes close\n\nto demonstrating that enforcement of the CBA obligations will\n\nsignificantly impair competition in any relevant market.\n\n            The   union's   next    public    policy     claim   is    that   the\n\narbitrator's decision will compel it to file grievances against\n\ndelinquent employers even where the union concludes that this would\n\nnot serve the interests of its members.             The union's prerogative\n\nhas generally been invoked where the union finds no merit to a\n\nunion member's proposed grievance. E.g., Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of\n\nTeamsters, 426 F.3d 416, 418-19 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126\n\nS.   Ct.   1659   (2006).    This     case    is   not   of   that    character;\n\npresumptively, enforcement of contribution requirements serves the\n\nunion membership as a whole.\n\n            In any event, the arbitrator ordered that Local 7 enforce\n\nthe prepayment and bonding requirements of the contract and said\n\nnothing about method.         If the union thought that enforcement\n\nobligations might impair its prerogatives in grievance matters, it\n\nshould have explained this to the arbitrator so he could assess the\n\nmatter and, if necessary, tailor his remedies. If the argument had\n\nany merit--which is far from clear--this kind of public policy\n\nargument had to be developed before the arbitrator.\n\n            Finally, Local 7 says that the arbitrator's decision told\n\nthe union and associations to meet with the trustees and that this\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdirective improperly interferes with the trustees' independent\n\nfunctioning.     The   order   is   directed   at   the   parties   to   the\n\narbitration (the union and the associations), not the trustees, who\n\nare not required to do anything.      The order does not threaten the\n\ntrustees' independence.\n\n            We have considered several other arguments made by Local\n\n7, including one raised for the first time in the reply brief, but\n\nconsider that no further discussion is necessary.         The judgment is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

In June 2005, the associations requested that Local 7 enforce the payment and bond provisions; the bonding requirements had been ignored and, the associations said, their members were bidding for jobs in a competitive market against other employers who were delinquent in making fund payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the trustees of the funds (there are union and management trustees in each fund) adopted procedures for delinquency collection and auditing, but they declined to impose the bonding requirements set forth in the CBA. The associations then sought arbitration against Local 7 as specified in the CBA, which contains a broadly phrased arbitration clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, the arbitrator found the dispute to be arbitrable, ruled that the local had not been enforcing the payment or bonding requirements, and directed that the union do both &#8212; with one qualification: that bonding not be required for all new employers but only for employers, new or old, who had been \"habitually delinquent in their [fund] payments.\" The arbitrator directed the parties to meet regularly with each other and the fund trustees in order to design methods for the necessary audits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Local 7 moved in the district court to vacate the award and the associations counterclaimed to enforce the arbitrator's decision. <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10 (2000); 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185. The district court sided with the associations. Local 7 now seeks review in this court, arguing that the grievance was not arbitrable under the CBA, that the arbitrator erred on the merits and that the decision violates public policy on several different grounds. We address the issues, which are primarily legal, in this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Local 7 first says the dispute is not arbitrable under the CBA. The CBA contains the payment and bonding requirements already described and also provides for arbitration under the CBA as to \"all questions involving the interpretation and application of any section of this Agreement.\" On the face of the matter, Local 7's failure to enforce payment and bonding requirements provided for in the CBA itself looks like a violation of the CBA for which arbitration under the CBA is a proper remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Local 7 counters that the agreements establishing the trust funds provide for arbitration of deadlock[s] among the trustees and prohibit arbitration under the CBA of \"any matter arising in connection with the administration of\" the funds. The trust agreements also provide for the trustees to make rules and regulations \"for the collection and administration of employer contributions\" to the funds. Collection and bonding, says Local 7, are matters of administration under the trust agreements and not the CBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, whether a dispute falls within an arbitration agreement is a matter of law for the court. <i>Howsam v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span> (2002). The term \"administration,\" pertinently used in the Taft-Hartley Act, has been read broadly by some courts and narrowly by others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But the question before us is not one of abstractly defining a single term but of making workable sense of the CBA which provides for funding the trusts, the closely related trust agreements and the respective arbitration clauses which purport to be exclusive of one another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court expressed doubt whether the trust arbitration provision had any relevance where, as here, there is no reported deadlock among the trustees. In all events, the obligations that the associations here seek to enforce for collection and bonding are explicitly set forth in the CBA; the arbitrator's decision is enforcing obligations against the union as a party to the CBA; and the powers of the trustees to manage the trust are not being curtailed or frustrated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Local 7's \"merits\" claim which is easily resolved.

Although bonding requirements are explicitly set forth in the CBA, the union points to language in the CBA stating that \"[d]etails of said bond are set forth\" in the incorporated trust agreements. Because no such details have been set forth, the union suggests that there are no requirements that it needed to enforce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this case concerns a disregard of the bonding requirement itself &#8212; which is plainly included in the CBA &#8212; and not a dispute about details. Nor, contrary to the union's claim, has the arbitrator ordered the trustees to adopt specific details; if the trustees do, these details may govern what needs to be included in the bond but, if they do not, the union and the associations will presumably work out a means of complying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The union also says that imposing the bonding requirement on, and only on, habitually delinquent employers does not carry out the CBA which required initial bonding, dropped the obligation for those whose records proved good, and finally provided for reinstatement of bonding for those who became delinquent after canceling the bond. Given the history of nonenforcement, the arbitrator's simplified application was within his informed discretion. <i>Cf. Gen. Tel. Co. of Ohio v.
