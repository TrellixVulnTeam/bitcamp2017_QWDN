In    this   wrongful\n\ntermination case, plaintiff-appellant Frances Stonkus appeals from\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment to her former\n\nemployers, defendant-appellees City of Brockton School Department,\n\nBrockton High School Science Department Head Antonio M. Cabral and\n\nBrockton High     School   Housemaster     Richard   Zoino    (collectively,\n\n\"defendants\").      We affirm.\n\nI.         BACKGROUND\n\nA.         Factual background\n\n           The following facts are undisputed.1          Stonkus was hired\n\nas a biology teacher at Brockton High School beginning September,\n\n1994.    She was fifty-two years old at the date of hire.                 She\n\nreceived satisfactory performance evaluations for her first two\n\nyears of teaching, and was twice reappointed for successive year-\n\nlong terms.\n\n              On or about October 2, 1996, while teaching a biology\n\nclass, Stonkus and a male student engaged in a verbal exchange\n\nabout the male reproductive organ.            The student complained to\n\nZoino, who     conducted   an    investigation   into   the   matter.     The\n\ninvestigation included interviewing several students from the class\n\n\n\n     1\n      Except where otherwise noted, we draw the factual background\nfrom the defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in\nSupport of their Motion for Summary Judgment. As discussed in more\ndetail infra, these facts were properly deemed admitted in the\nabsence of opposition by Stonkus pursuant to the District of\nMassachusetts Local Rule 56.1.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fand holding a conference with the student’s parents.             Cabral and\n\nZoino also observed Stonkus's classroom performance and concluded\n\nthat certain areas \"needed improvement.\"\n\n            On or about February 5, 1997, Stonkus filed a grievance\n\nwith the assistance of the Brockton Education Association alleging\n\nthat Zoino's handling of the student's complaint violated the terms\n\nof an applicable collective bargaining agreement.          In May, 1997,\n\nwhile the grievance process was still ongoing, Stonkus received\n\nnotification that she would not be rehired for the following school\n\nyear.     In August, 1997, Stonkus entered into a \"Memorandum of\n\nAgreement\" with Brockton, in which it agreed to rehire Stonkus\n\nwithout   tenure    for   the   1997-98   school   year.   The    Agreement\n\ncontained an explicit waiver of any and all claims Stonkus could\n\nbring to challenge a decision the defendants might later make not\n\nto reappoint Stonkus for the 1998-99 school year.\n\n            Stonkus alleges in her complaint that following her\n\ninitial termination in May, 1997, Cabral hired two new female\n\nteachers, aged 21 and 30.         Upon Stonkus’s return to teaching in\n\nSeptember, 1997, the classroom regularly assigned to her for the\n\npast three years was given to one of the new hires.                 Stonkus\n\nalleges that she was given as her space the corner of a small\n\nproject room.      According to her, as a result she had to use three\n\ncarts to move her materials from room to room each day.\n\n            Stonkus's superiors found her teaching performance during\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe 1997-98 school year to be unsatisfactory, and she was not\n\nrehired for the following school year.               In her complaint, Stonkus\n\nalleges that she has not been able to secure other employment.                       In\n\nher subsequent job search, she claims, two school systems advised\n\nStonkus that she was their first choice for a position as a science\n\nteacher before      calling     Brockton       for   a   reference.         After   the\n\nconversations with Brockton, Stonkus was not hired for either\n\nposition.    Later, the positions were re-advertised.\n\nB.          Procedural history\n\n            On February 2, 2001, Stonkus filed a complaint in the\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court alleging violations of the state\n\nconstitution, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, and 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983; breach of contract, both express and implied; age and gender\n\ndiscrimination in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B; wrongful\n\ntermination; defamation by Cabral; and intentional interference\n\nwith contractual relationships by Zoino.                  The defendants removed\n\nthis action to the United States District Court.\n\n            On   July    18,    2001,    the    district        court   conducted     a\n\nscheduling conference and ordered the completion of all discovery\n\nby November 16, 2001, the filing of dispositive motions by April\n\n19, 2002, and the filing of responsive pleadings by May 20, 2002.\n\nIn November, 2001, near the end of the discovery period, the\n\nparties filed     a     Joint   Motion    to    Extend     the    Scheduling    Order\n\nDeadline,   which     the   court   allowed.             This    provided    for    the\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fcompletion of discovery by April 19, 2002, the filing of motions by\n\nJune 18, 2002, and the filing of responsive pleadings thirty days\n\nthereafter.\n\n          On June 18, 2002, the defendants filed a Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment on all of the claims set forth in Stonkus's\n\ncomplaint.     Stonkus failed to file an opposition.            On August 15,\n\n2001, the District Court allowed the Summary Judgment Motion with\n\nthe following order: “The Plaintiff has filed no opposition to this\n\nmotion.      Based   on   the   undisputed   facts   as     presented   in   the\n\ndefendants’ papers, the defendants are entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on all claims.               Judgment shall enter for the\n\ndefendants accordingly.”        On August 19, 2002, judgment entered in\n\nfavor of the defendants on all counts.\n\n             Stonkus filed a Motion for Relief from Judgment pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) and for Late Filing of Responsive\n\nPleading, which the defendants opposed.          The District Court denied\n\nthe motion, and Stonkus appealed.\n\nII.          DISCUSSION\n\nA.        Rule 60(b)(1) ruling\n\n          Stonkus     contends     that    the   district    court   erred   in\n\nrefusing to allow her to belatedly file her opposition to the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment. She maintains, on appeal,\n\nthat her failure to timely file was due to her counsel's confusion\n\nover the filing deadlines and \"frenetic activity to complete\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fdiscovery,\" and that these circumstances constituted \"excusable\n\nneglect\" warranting relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).2\n\n          Rule 60(b)(1) provides, in relevant part:\n\n          On motion and upon such terms as are just, the\n          court may relieve a party or a party's legal\n          representative from a final judgment, order,\n          or proceeding for the following reasons: (1)\n          mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable\n          neglect . . .. The motion shall be made within\n          a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2),\n          and (3) not more than one year after the\n          judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or\n          taken.\n\nMotions brought under Rule 60(b) are committed to the district\n\ncourt's sound discretion.   Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., 15 F.3d\n\n12, 14 (1st Cir. 1994). Accordingly, we review orders denying such\n\nmotions only for abuse of discretion.   Id.   Because Rule 60(b) is\n\na vehicle for \"extraordinary relief,\" motions invoking the rule\n\nshould be granted \"only under exceptional circumstances.\"     Id. at\n\n14-15 (quoting Lepore v. Vidockler, 792 F.2d 272, 274 (1st Cir.\n\n1986)).\n\n\n     2\n      In the Motion for Relief from Judgment, Stonkus did not\nspecifically identify excusable neglect as a basis for her failure\nto file an opposition; rather, she stated that \"Plaintiff's counsel\nbelieved that consent of the court would be necessary to allow for\nconsideration of [defendants' motion for summary judgment] filed\nbeyond the agreed-upon filing deadlines.\"         (This excuse is\nunavailing, as the record indicates that in fact the summary\njudgment motion was filed on the last day permitted by the amended\nscheduling order.)     Accordingly, the defendants contend that\nStonkus should be precluded from asserting on appeal that she\nfailed to file an opposition for any other reasons. Because we\nhold that in this case, Stonkus's excuses presented on appeal do\nnot compel reversing the district court, we do not address the\ndefendants' waiver argument.\n\n                               -6-\n\f               We   interpret   these   authorities       in   light   of   Pioneer\n\nInvestment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership,\n\n507 U.S. 380 (1993), in which the Supreme Court explored the\n\nmeaning of excusable neglect in the context of a parallel provision\n\nin the federal bankruptcy rules.3               Davila-Alvarez v. Escuela de\n\nMedicina Universidad Central Del Caribe, 257 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).       The Court held that \"the determination is at bottom an\n\nequitable       one,   taking   account    of    all     relevant   circumstances\n\nsurrounding the party's omission.\"                Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395.\n\nThese       circumstances   include     \"the    danger    of   prejudice    to   the\n\n[nonmoving party], the length of the delay and its potential impact\n\non judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including\n\nwhether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and\n\nwhether the movant acted in good faith.\"                 Id.\n\n               Even under the flexible standard prescribed by Pioneer,\n\nwe see no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision\n\nrefusing to allow Stonkus to belatedly oppose the defendants'\n\nmotion for summary judgment. The stated reasons for the neglect --\n\nconfusion over filing dates and busyness -- hold little water.                    It\n\nis uncontested that Stonkus's counsel received several written\n\ndocuments, both from the defendants' counsel and from the district\n\ncourt, concerning the extended scheduling deadlines; that counsel\n\n\n        3\n      Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006(b)(1) permits the enlargement of time\nfor certain actions \"where the failure to act was the result of\nexcusable neglect.\"\n\n                                        -7-\n\fengaged in telephone and in-person discussions concerning the\n\nextended deadlines; and that prior to filing the motion for summary\n\njudgment, defendants' counsel again advised Stonkus's counsel of\n\ntheir intent to file a summary judgment motion on June 18, 2002,\n\nand reminded Stonkus's counsel that he had thirty days to respond\n\nunder the extended scheduling order.\n\n            We have repeatedly held this type of counsel error to be\n\ninadequate to support a determination of excusable neglect within\n\nthe meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).                 Torre, 15 F.3d at 15\n\n(fact    that   appellant's   attorney       was   \"preoccupied\"   with   other\n\nmatters did not constitute excusable neglect), and cases cited.\n\n\"Most attorneys are busy most of the time and they must organize\n\ntheir work so as to be able to meet the time requirements of\n\nmatters they     are   handling   or    suffer     the   consequences.\"     Id.\n\n(quoting Pinero Schroeder v. FNMA, 574 F.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir.\n\n1978) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n            We question, too, the good faith behind these excuses:\n\nthere is little indication, for example, of the \"frenetic activity\n\nto complete discovery\" Stonkus's counsel cites.4 And Stonkus never\n\nproffered a proposed opposition to summary judgment in her filings\n\n\n\n     4\n      At no time in this litigation did Stonkus's counsel propound\ninterrogatories, requests for documents or requests for admissions.\nNor did he take any depositions of the defendant School Department\nemployees or representatives other than the individual defendants\nZoino and Cabral.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fto the district court.        As to prejudice, although there are no\n\nunusual circumstances in this case, the delay incurred by Stonkus's\n\nfailure to respond serves to hamper the defendants' interest in\n\ncertainty   and   resolution    and    to     further    diminish   witnesses'\n\nmemories concerning the events surrounding Stonkus's claims, now\n\nmore than six years old.         In sum, Stonkus's counsel's conduct\n\nsimply does not warrant relief from judgment under an excusable\n\nneglect theory.\n\nB.          Summary judgment\n\n            Although we affirm the district court's decision to bar\n\nStonkus's opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, it\n\ndoes not automatically follow that the defendants' motion was\n\nproperly granted.      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) of the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure provides:\n\n            [W]hen a motion for summary judgment is made\n            and supported as provided in this rule, an\n            adverse party may not rest upon the mere\n            allegations or denials of the adverse party's\n            pleading, but the adverse party's response, by\n            affidavits or as otherwise provided in this\n            rule, must set forth specific facts showing\n            that there is a genuine issue for trial. If\n            the adverse party does not so respond, summary\n            judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered\n            against the adverse party.\n\n(emphasis    added).     We    also    take    into     account   District   of\n\nMassachusetts Local Rule 56.1, which provides, \"[m]aterial facts of\n\nrecord set forth in the statement required to be served by the\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fmoving party will be deemed for purposes of the motion to be\n\nadmitted    by   the    opposing   parties     unless    controverted   by   the\n\nstatement required to be served by opposing parties.\"\n\n            Because Stonkus did not controvert the statement of\n\nundisputed material facts that the defendants filed with their\n\nsummary judgment motion, we deem those facts admitted and consider\n\nwhether summary judgment was appropriate.               We review the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in\n\nthe light    most      favorable   to   the    nonmovant   and   resolving   all\n\nreasonable inferences in that party's favor.                 Carroll v. Xerox\n\nCorp., 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002).               Under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c), summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\n            Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary\n\njudgment because in August, 1997, Stonkus signed a Memorandum of\n\nAgreement under which she waived all claims with respect to non-\n\nreappointment.      The Agreement states, in relevant part,\n\n            [I]f the decision is ultimately made not to\n            reappoint her for the 1998-99 school year, Ms.\n            Stonkus hereby waives any ability to challenge\n            such decision in any forum whatsoever,\n            including, but not limited to, G.L. Chapter\n            71, Section 42, via the grievance procedure in\n            the collective bargaining agreement, or via a\n\n                                        -10-\n\f          complaint to any court or administrative\n          agency.\n          In Rivera-Flores v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Caribbean, 112\n\nF.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1997), we noted that in the employment law\n\ncontext, courts have routinely upheld releases given in exchange\n\nfor additional     benefits.   \"Such    releases   provide   a   means   of\n\nvoluntary resolution of potential and actual legal disputes, and\n\nmete out a type of industrial justice.\"       Id.    Nearly all of the\n\nclaims set forth in Stonkus's complaint explicitly focus on the\n\ndefendants' failure to reappoint her to an additional term of\n\nemployment.5    Accordingly, we conclude that Stonkus's claims are\n\nbarred under the Agreement.\n\n          Stonkus offers only one argument in opposition: that the\n\nAgreement was not a \"knowing and voluntary\" waiver within the\n\nmeaning of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act amendments to\n\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. §\n\n626(f)(1).     The amendments provide, in relevant part:\n\n          1) an individual may not waive any right or\n          claim under this Act unless . . .\n\n\n     5\n      The only claims that do not directly center on reappointment\nare Stonkus's express breach of contract claim (which concerns the\ncollective bargaining agreement between the Brockton School\nCommittee and the Brockton Education Association) and her\ndefamation claim (which concerns Cabral's representations to\npotential employers following her termination).        We need not\ngrapple with whether these claims are implicitly barred by the\nAgreement, or, as defendants contend, fail on their merits, because\nStonkus does not raise the issue on appeal. Rather, as set forth\ninfra, Stonkus's only argument regarding the Agreement on appeal is\nthat it did not conform with ADEA requirements.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f             (B) the waiver specifically refers to rights\n             or claims arising under this chapter;\n\n                                   * * * *\n\n             (F)(i) the individual is given a period of at\n             least 21 days within which to consider the\n             agreement;\n                                * * * *\n\n             (G) the agreement provides that for a period\n             of at least 7 days following the execution of\n             such agreement, the individual may revoke the\n             agreement . . . .\n\nId.       Stonkus contends that the Agreement lacked the foregoing\n\nelements.\n\n             This argument gets Stonkus nowhere, however, in light of\n\nthe fact that she apparently did not bring an ADEA claim in this\n\ncase.6     Rather, her age discrimination claim is pursuant to Mass.\n\nGen. Laws. ch. 151B, which requires none of the pertinent elements\n\nof section 626(f)(1).       Nor is Stonkus's ADEA argument relevant to\n\nany   of    the   other   claims   she   sets   forth   in   her   complaint.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the defendants were entitled to judgment\n\n\n\n      6\n      The heading of the age discrimination claim in her complaint\nreads \"Age Discrimination, MGL 151B.\" Stonkus does mention the\nADEA elsewhere in her complaint, but appears to refer to the waiver\nrequirements set forth at 29 U.S.C. § 626(f)(1). Furthermore, she\ndoes not argue on appeal that she asserted an ADEA claim in her\ncomplaint.

Cabral and Brockton High School Housemaster Richard Zoino (collectively, \"defendants\"). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Stonkus was hired as a biology teacher at Brockton High School beginning September, 1994. She was fifty-two years old at the date of hire. She received satisfactory performance evaluations for her first two years of teaching, and was twice reappointed for successive year-long terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about October 2, 1996, while teaching a biology class, Stonkus and a male student engaged in a verbal exchange about the male reproductive organ. The student complained to Zoino, who conducted an investigation into the matter. The investigation included interviewing several students from the class and holding a conference with the student's parents. Cabral and Zoino also observed Stonkus's classroom performance and concluded that certain areas \"needed improvement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about February 5, 1997, Stonkus filed a grievance with the assistance of the Brockton Education Association alleging that Zoino's handling of the student's complaint violated the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement. In May, 1997, while the grievance process was still ongoing, Stonkus received notification that she would not be rehired for the following school year. In August, 1997, Stonkus entered into a \"Memorandum of Agreement\" with Brockton, in which it agreed to rehire Stonkus without tenure for the 1997-98 school year. The Agreement contained an explicit waiver of any and all claims Stonkus could bring to challenge a decision the defendants might later make not to reappoint Stonkus for the 1998-99 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus alleges in her complaint that following her initial termination in May, 1997, Cabral hired two new female teachers, aged 21 and 30. Upon Stonkus's return to teaching in September, 1997, the classroom regularly assigned to her for the past three years was given to one of the new hires. Stonkus alleges that she was given as her space the corner of a small project room. According to her, as a result she had to use three carts to move her materials from room to room each day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus's superiors found her teaching performance during the 1997-98 school year to be unsatisfactory, and she was not rehired for the following school year. In her complaint, Stonkus alleges that she has not been able to secure other employment. In her subsequent job search, she claims, two school systems advised Stonkus that she was their first choice for a position as a science teacher before calling Brockton for a reference. After the conversations with Brockton, Stonkus was not hired for either position. Later, the positions were re-advertised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 2, 2001, Stonkus filed a complaint in the Massachusetts Superior Court alleging violations of the state constitution, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983; breach of contract, both express and implied; age and gender discrimination in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B; wrongful termination; defamation by Cabral; and intentional interference with contractual relationships by Zoino. The defendants removed this action to the United States District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 18, 2001, the district court conducted a scheduling conference and ordered the completion of all discovery by November 16, 2001, the filing of dispositive motions by April 19, 2002, and the filing of responsive pleadings by May 20, 2002. In November, 2001, near the end of the discovery period, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Extend the Scheduling Order Deadline, which the court allowed. This provided for the completion of discovery by April 19, 2002, the filing of motions by June 18, 2002, and the filing of responsive pleadings thirty days thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 2002, the defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on all of the claims set forth in Stonkus's complaint. Stonkus failed to file an opposition. On August 15, 2002, the District Court allowed the Summary Judgment Motion with the following order: \"The Plaintiff has filed no opposition to this motion. Based on the undisputed facts as presented in the defendants' papers, the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims. Judgment shall enter for the defendants accordingly.\" On August 19, 2002, judgment entered in favor of the defendants on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus filed a Motion for Relief from Judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and for Late Filing of Responsive Pleading, which the defendants opposed. The District Court denied the motion, and Stonkus appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. <i>DISCUSSION</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 60(b)(1) ruling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus contends that the district court erred in refusing to allow her to belatedly file her opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment. She maintains, on appeal, that her failure to timely file was due to her counsel's confusion over the filing deadlines and \"frenetic activity to complete discovery,\" and that these circumstances constituted \"excusable neglect\" warranting relief under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 60(b)(1) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.... The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motions brought under Rule 60(b) are committed to the district court's sound discretion. <i>Torre v. Continental Ins. Co.,</i> 15 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1994). Accordingly, we review orders denying such motions only for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> Because Rule 60(b) is a vehicle for \"extraordinary relief,\" motions invoking the rule should be granted \"only under exceptional circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14-15 (quoting <i>Lepore v. Vidockler,</i> 792 F.2d 272, 274 (1st Cir. 1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret these authorities in light of <i>Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership,</i> 507 U.S. 380, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993), in which the Supreme Court explored the meaning of excusable neglect in the context of a parallel provision in the federal bankruptcy rules.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Davila-Alvarez v. Escuela de Medicina Universidad Central del Caribe,</i> 257 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.2001). The Court held that \"the determination is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party's omission.\" <i>Pioneer,</i> 507 U.S. at 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489. These circumstances include \"the danger of prejudice to the [nonmoving party], the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even under the flexible standard prescribed by <i>Pioneer,</i> we see no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision refusing to allow Stonkus to belatedly oppose the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The stated reasons for the neglect &#8212; confusion over filing dates and busyness &#8212; hold little water. It is uncontested that Stonkus's counsel received several written documents, both from the defendants' counsel and from the district court, concerning the extended scheduling deadlines; that counsel engaged in telephone and in-person discussions concerning the extended deadlines; and that prior to filing the motion for summary judgment, defendants' counsel again advised Stonkus's counsel of their intent to file a summary judgment motion on June 18, 2002, and reminded Stonkus's counsel that he had thirty days to respond under the extended scheduling order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have repeatedly held this type of counsel error to be inadequate to support a determination of excusable neglect within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). <i>de la Torre,</i> 15 F.3d at 15 (fact that appellant's attorney was \"preoccupied\" with other matters did not constitute excusable neglect), and cases cited. \"Most attorneys are busy most of the time and they must organize their work so as to be able to meet the time requirements of matters they are handling or suffer the consequences.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Pinero Schroeder v. FNMA,</i> 574 F.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We question, too, the good faith behind these excuses: there is little indication, for example, of the \"frenetic activity to complete discovery\" Stonkus's counsel cites.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> And Stonkus never proffered a proposed opposition to summary judgment in her filings to the district court. As to prejudice, although there are no unusual circumstances in this case, the delay incurred by Stonkus's failure to respond serves to hamper the defendants' interest in certainty and resolution and to further diminish witnesses' memories concerning the events surrounding Stonkus's claims, now more than six years old. In sum, Stonkus's counsel's conduct simply does not warrant relief from judgment under an excusable neglect theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Summary judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we affirm the district court's decision to bar Stonkus's opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, it does not automatically follow that the defendants' motion was properly granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, <i>if appropriate,</i> shall be entered against the adverse party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). We also take into account District of Massachusetts Local Rule 56.1, which provides, \"[m]aterial facts of record set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party will be deemed for purposes of the motion to be admitted by the opposing parties unless controverted by the statement required to be served by opposing parties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Stonkus did not controvert the statement of undisputed material facts that the defendants filed with their summary judgment motion, we deem those facts admitted and consider whether summary judgment was appropriate. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir.2002). Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment because in August, 1997, Stonkus signed a Memorandum of Agreement under which she waived all claims with respect to non-reappointment. The Agreement states, in relevant part,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f the decision is ultimately made not to reappoint her for the 1998-99 school year, Ms. Stonkus hereby waives any ability to challenge such decision in any forum whatsoever, including, but not limited to, G.L. Chapter 71, Section 42, via the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining agreement, or via a complaint to any court or administrative agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Rivera-Flores v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Caribbean,</i> 112 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1997), we noted that in the employment law context, courts have routinely upheld releases given in exchange for additional benefits. \"Such releases provide a means of voluntary resolution of potential and actual legal disputes, and mete out a type of industrial justice.\" <i>Id.</i> Nearly all of the claims set forth in Stonkus's complaint explicitly focus on the defendants' failure to reappoint her to an additional term of employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Accordingly, we conclude that Stonkus's claims are barred under the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus offers only one argument in opposition: that the Agreement was not a \"knowing and voluntary\" waiver within the meaning of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(f)(1). The amendments provide, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) an individual may not waive any right or claim under this Act unless ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims arising under this chapter;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>* * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(F)(i) the individual is given a period of at least 21 days within which to consider the agreement;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>* * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(G) the agreement provides that for a period of at least 7 days following the execution of such agreement, the individual may revoke the agreement....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Stonkus contends that the Agreement lacked the foregoing elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument gets Stonkus nowhere, however, in light of the fact that she apparently did not bring an ADEA claim in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Rather, her age discrimination claim is pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 151B, which requires none of the pertinent elements of section 626(f)(1). Nor is Stonkus's ADEA argument relevant to any of the other claims she sets forth in her complaint. Accordingly, we hold that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the Agreement barred Stonkus's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth <i>supra,</i> we <i>AFFIRM</i> the district court's award of summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Except where otherwise noted, we draw the factual background from the defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment. As discussed in more detail<i>infra,</i> these facts were properly deemed admitted in the absence of opposition by Stonkus pursuant to the District of Massachusetts Local Rule 56.1.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In the Motion for Relief from Judgment, Stonkus did not specifically identify excusable neglect as a basis for her failure to file an opposition; rather, she stated that \"Plaintiff's counsel believed that consent of the court would be necessary to allow for consideration of [defendants' motion for summary judgment] filed beyond the agreed-upon filing deadlines.\" (This excuse is unavailing, as the record indicates that in fact the summary judgment motion was filed on the last day permitted by the amended scheduling order.) Accordingly, the defendants contend that Stonkus should be precluded from asserting on appeal that she failed to file an opposition for any other reasons. Because we hold that in this case, Stonkus's excuses presented on appeal do not compel reversing the district court, we do not address the defendants' waiver argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9006(b)(1) permits the enlargement of time for certain actions \"where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At no time in this litigation did Stonkus's counsel propound interrogatories, requests for documents or requests for admissions. Nor did he take any depositions of the defendant School Department employees or representatives other than the individual defendants Zoino and Cabral</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The only claims that do not directly center on reappointment are Stonkus's express breach of contract claim (which concerns the collective bargaining agreement between the Brockton School Committee and the Brockton Education Association) and her defamation claim (which concerns Cabral's representations to potential employers following her termination). We need not grapple with whether these claims are implicitly barred by the Agreement, or, as defendants contend, fail on their merits, because Stonkus does not raise the issue on appeal. Rather, as set forth<i>infra,</i> Stonkus's only argument regarding the Agreement on appeal is that it did not conform with ADEA requirements.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The heading of the age discrimination claim in her complaint reads \"Age Discrimination, MGL 151B.\" Stonkus does mention the ADEA elsewhere in her complaint, but appears to refer to the waiver requirements set forth at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(f)(1). Furthermore, she does not argue on appeal that she asserted an ADEA claim in her complaint. In any event, taking the defendants' statement of material facts as true, we must conclude that Stonkus's termination was based on her job performance rather than discriminatory animus. Accordingly, her age discrimination claim fails on its merits as well</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In May, 1997, while the grievance process was still ongoing, Stonkus received notification that she would not be rehired for the following school year. In August, 1997, Stonkus entered into a \"Memorandum of Agreement\" with Brockton, in which it agreed to rehire Stonkus without tenure for the 1997-98 school year. The Agreement contained an explicit waiver of any and all claims Stonkus could bring to challenge a decision the defendants might later make not to reappoint Stonkus for the 1998-99 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus alleges in her complaint that following her initial termination in May, 1997, Cabral hired two new female teachers, aged 21 and 30. Upon Stonkus's return to teaching in September, 1997, the classroom regularly assigned to her for the past three years was given to one of the new hires. Stonkus alleges that she was given as her space the corner of a small project room. According to her, as a result she had to use three carts to move her materials from room to room each day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus's superiors found her teaching performance during the 1997-98 school year to be unsatisfactory, and she was not rehired for the following school year. In her complaint, Stonkus alleges that she has not been able to secure other employment. In her subsequent job search, she claims, two school systems advised Stonkus that she was their first choice for a position as a science teacher before calling Brockton for a reference. After the conversations with Brockton, Stonkus was not hired for either position. Later, the positions were re-advertised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 2, 2001, Stonkus filed a complaint in the Massachusetts Superior Court alleging violations of the state constitution, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983; breach of contract, both express and implied; age and gender discrimination in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B; wrongful termination; defamation by Cabral; and intentional interference with contractual relationships by Zoino. The defendants removed this action to the United States District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 18, 2001, the district court conducted a scheduling conference and ordered the completion of all discovery by November 16, 2001, the filing of dispositive motions by April 19, 2002, and the filing of responsive pleadings by May 20, 2002. In November, 2001, near the end of the discovery period, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Extend the Scheduling Order Deadline, which the court allowed. This provided for the completion of discovery by April 19, 2002, the filing of motions by June 18, 2002, and the filing of responsive pleadings thirty days thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 2002, the defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on all of the claims set forth in Stonkus's complaint. Stonkus failed to file an opposition. On August 15, 2002, the District Court allowed the Summary Judgment Motion with the following order: \"The Plaintiff has filed no opposition to this motion. Based on the undisputed facts as presented in the defendants' papers, the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims. Judgment shall enter for the defendants accordingly.\" On August 19, 2002, judgment entered in favor of the defendants on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus filed a Motion for Relief from Judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and for Late Filing of Responsive Pleading, which the defendants opposed. The District Court denied the motion, and Stonkus appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. <i>DISCUSSION</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 60(b)(1) ruling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stonkus contends that the district court erred in refusing to allow her to belatedly file her opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment. She maintains, on appeal, that her failure to timely file was due to her counsel's confusion over the filing deadlines and \"frenetic activity to complete discovery,\" and that these circumstances constituted \"excusable neglect\" warranting relief under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 60(b)(1) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect....

The stated reasons for the neglect &#8212; confusion over filing dates and busyness &#8212; hold little water. It is uncontested that Stonkus's counsel received several written documents, both from the defendants' counsel and from the district court, concerning the extended scheduling deadlines; that counsel engaged in telephone and in-person discussions concerning the extended deadlines; and that prior to filing the motion for summary judgment, defendants' counsel again advised Stonkus's counsel of their intent to file a summary judgment motion on June 18, 2002, and reminded Stonkus's counsel that he had thirty days to respond under the extended scheduling order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have repeatedly held this type of counsel error to be inadequate to support a determination of excusable neglect within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). <i>de la Torre,</i> 15 F.3d at 15 (fact that appellant's attorney was \"preoccupied\" with other matters did not constitute excusable neglect), and cases cited. \"Most attorneys are busy most of the time and they must organize their work so as to be able to meet the time requirements of matters they are handling or suffer the consequences.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Pinero Schroeder v. FNMA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355342\"><a href=\"/opinion/355342/vicente-pinero-schroeder-v-federal-national-mortgage-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We question, too, the good faith behind these excuses: there is little indication, for example, of the \"frenetic activity to complete discovery\" Stonkus's counsel cites.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> And Stonkus never proffered a proposed opposition to summary judgment in her filings to the district court. As to prejudice, although there are no unusual circumstances in this case, the delay incurred by Stonkus's failure to respond serves to hamper the defendants' interest in certainty and resolution and to further diminish witnesses' memories concerning the events surrounding Stonkus's claims, now more than six years old. In sum, Stonkus's counsel's conduct simply does not warrant relief from judgment under an excusable neglect theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Summary judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we affirm the district court's decision to bar Stonkus's opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, it does not automatically follow that the defendants' motion was properly granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, <i>if appropriate,</i> shall be entered against the adverse party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). We also take into account District of Massachusetts Local Rule 56.1, which provides, \"[m]aterial facts of record set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party will be deemed for purposes of the motion to be admitted by the opposing parties unless controverted by the statement required to be served by opposing parties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Stonkus did not controvert the statement of undisputed material facts that the defendants filed with their summary judgment motion, we deem those facts admitted and consider whether summary judgment was appropriate. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200014\"><a href=\"/opinion/200014/carroll-v-xerox/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 237 (1st Cir.2002). Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment because in August, 1997, Stonkus signed a Memorandum of Agreement under which she waived all claims with respect to non-reappointment. The Agreement states, in relevant part,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f the decision is ultimately made not to reappoint her for the 1998-99 school year, Ms. Stonkus hereby waives any ability to challenge such decision in any forum whatsoever, including, but not limited to, G.L.

Gen. Laws. ch. 151B, which requires none of the pertinent elements of section 626(f)(1). Nor is Stonkus's ADEA argument relevant to any of the other claims she sets forth in her complaint. Accordingly, we hold that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the Agreement barred Stonkus's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth <i>supra,</i> we <i>AFFIRM</i> the district court's award of summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Except where otherwise noted, we draw the factual background from the defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment.

Accordingly, the defendants contend that Stonkus should be precluded from asserting on appeal that she failed to file an opposition for any other reasons. Because we hold that in this case, Stonkus's excuses presented on appeal do not compel reversing the district court, we do not address the defendants' waiver argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Fed.

We need not grapple with whether these claims are implicitly barred by the Agreement, or, as defendants contend, fail on their merits, because Stonkus does not raise the issue on appeal. Rather, as set forth<i>infra,</i> Stonkus's only argument regarding the Agreement on appeal is that it did not conform with ADEA requirements.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The heading of the age discrimination claim in her complaint reads \"Age Discrimination, MGL 151B.\" Stonkus does mention the ADEA elsewhere in her complaint, but appears to refer to the waiver requirements set forth at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(f)(1). Furthermore, she does not argue on appeal that she asserted an ADEA claim in her complaint. In any event, taking the defendants' statement of material facts as true, we must conclude that Stonkus's termination was based on her job performance rather than discriminatory animus. Accordingly, her age discrimination claim fails on its merits as well</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
