Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            STAHL,   Circuit     Judge.    Defendant-appellant      Malden   O.\n\nBattle was charged with two counts of being a felon in possession\n\nof firearms and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1)\n\nand one count of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1).          Battle moved to suppress the\n\nevidence supporting the charges, which was seized pursuant to a\n\nwarrantless entry into the apartment of his ex-girlfriend and a\n\nsubsequent search occurring after a warrant was obtained.             After a\n\ntwo-day evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the motion.\n\nThereafter, Battle entered a guilty plea, reserving his right to\n\nappeal the denial of his motion to suppress.         He was then sentenced\n\nto a seventy-six month term of imprisonment followed by three\n\nyears' supervised release.         Battle instituted the instant appeal\n\nbased on his reserved challenge and the sentence imposed by the\n\ndistrict court.      We affirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we\n\nrecount the facts \"'as the trial court found them, consistent with\n\nrecord support.'\" United States v. Andrade, 551 F.3d 103, 106 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)).\n\n            On August 21, 2004, Odemira Rosa visited the Dorchester,\n\nMassachusetts apartment of his sometime girlfriend, Helena Fonseca.\n\nRosa   is   the   father   of   Fonseca's   son,   and   although    he   lived\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\felsewhere, he paid the rent for Fonseca's apartment, had his own\n\nkey, enjoyed unlimited access to the unit, and spent significant\n\ntime there.     In the summer of 2004, Rosa and Fonseca were on a\n\nbreak in their relationship, and Fonseca and Battle briefly became\n\ninvolved   romantically.       Battle     would    occasionally   stay   with\n\nFonseca, which was the case on August 21, when Rosa visited the\n\napartment and discovered Battle and Fonseca together inside.              Upon\n\nRosa's entry, Battle confronted Rosa with a gun, and Rosa quickly\n\nleft the apartment.\n\n           This armed encounter precipitated the end of the one-\n\nmonth relationship between Battle and Fonseca, and Fonseca told\n\nBattle to leave her house and not come back.              Battle, however,\n\ncontinued to call Fonseca, which frightened her, and so Fonseca and\n\nher children temporarily moved in with Rosa.\n\n           On September 1, 2004, Rosa visited Fonseca's apartment to\n\nensure that Battle had vacated the premises. Although Rosa did not\n\nfind   Battle   at   the   apartment,   he   did   discover   various    items\n\nbelonging to Battle, including a gun in a black bag in the closet.\n\n           The following morning, on September 2, 2004, Rosa went to\n\nthe Dorchester police station and told Police Officer John Teixeira\n\nand Sergeant Detective Paul Donovan about the August 21 incident\n\nand the discovery of the gun in the closet.          Rosa explained to the\n\nofficers that although the apartment was in Fonseca's name, Rosa\n\npaid the rent and had a key and unlimited access to it.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           The   police   accepted    Rosa's   invitation   to   visit   the\n\napartment, and at approximately 10:30 a.m., Rosa brought Donovan,\n\nTeixeira, and six other officers to Fonseca's building.            He used\n\nhis key to usher them inside and waited one floor below Fonseca's\n\nunit while the police knocked on the apartment door. Battle opened\n\nthe door and stepped out into the hallway, claiming that he had his\n\ngirlfriend's permission to be present.         Some officers entered the\n\napartment and conducted a \"protective sweep,\" but they found\n\nnothing.     Battle called Fonseca, and when he told her that the\n\npolice were in her apartment she asked, \"What are you doing at my\n\nhouse?   I don't want you at my house . . . . I didn't tell you you\n\ncould go to my house.\"     The officers instructed Fonseca to return\n\nhome.\n\n           The officers and Battle then entered the apartment.           One\n\nofficer read Battle his Miranda rights while Battle sat on the\n\nliving room couch. Battle identified himself and told the officers\n\nthat he was in the process of moving out.           After he called his\n\nattorney, he stated that he did not want to answer any more\n\nquestions.    The officers ceased questioning Battle, but they asked\n\nhim to leave the apartment so that they could \"freeze\" it while\n\nthey obtained a search warrant.\n\n           As Battle stood up from the couch to leave, an officer\n\nnoticed and retrieved a gun located on the floor beneath the couch.\n\nWhen Fonseca arrived back at the apartment, she identified the gun\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fas belonging to Battle, having seen him with the weapon on prior\n\noccasions.       The police then arrested Battle and brought him to the\n\nstation.\n\n               Later that day, the officers obtained a search warrant\n\nusing an affidavit that referenced the gun found underneath the\n\ncouch.        After    searching    the    apartment    and     Battle's    car,    the\n\nofficers       discovered   another       gun,     ballistics    vests,     boxes    of\n\nammunition, a bag containing three small bags of cocaine, $2982 in\n\nU.S.       currency,   various     clothes,      Battle's    personal    papers     and\n\nphotographs, and receipts in both Battle's and Fonseca's names.\n\n               Battle moved to suppress all of the items seized from the\n\napartment and car, and the district court denied the motion.                         It\n\nheld that Battle did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy\n\nin Fonseca's apartment and therefore lacked standing1 to invoke the\n\nFourth Amendment's protections.             It also held that even if Battle\n\ncould      assert   his   claim,    the    claim    failed    because     the   police\n\nobtained       valid    third-party       consent    from    Rosa   to     enter    the\n\napartment, and the discovery of the gun, which led to the discovery\n\n\n       1\n      \"'It is well-settled that a defendant who fails to\ndemonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area\nsearched or the item seized will not have 'standing' to claim that\nan illegal search or seizure occurred.'\" United States v. Rheault,\n561 F.3d 55, 58 n.8 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v.\nVilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2008)).              We\nacknowledge, however, that this threshold inquiry is \"more properly\nplaced within the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than\nwithin that of standing.\" Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 140\n(1978); Rheault, 561 F.3d at 58 n.8; see also United States v.\nRodriguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                           -5-\n\fof the other items seized, was justified by the \"plain view\"\n\ndoctrine.\n\n            Battle pled guilty to the indictment and was sentenced to\n\nseventy-six    months'    imprisonment    followed    by     three   years'\n\nsupervised release.      The district court calculated the sentence\n\nbased on a total offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history\n\ncategory of V, which under the United States Sentencing Guidelines\n\n(\"Guidelines\" or \"U.S.S.G.\") provided for a seventy to eighty-seven\n\nmonth prison term.\n\n                              II. Analysis\n\nA.   Motion to Suppress\n\n            In reviewing a motion to suppress, we review legal\n\ndeterminations   de   novo   and   findings   of   fact   and   credibility\n\ndeterminations for clear error.      United States v. Dubose, 579 F.3d\n\n117, 120 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing Andrade, 551 F.3d at 109).             We\n\nwill uphold the denial of a motion to suppress as long as any\n\nreasonable view of the evidence supports it.              United States v.\n\nGonzalez, 609 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n            Battle contends that he had a legitimate expectation of\n\nprivacy in Fonseca's apartment enabling him to assert his Fourth\n\nAmendment challenge, and that his rights were violated as a result\n\nof the warrantless entry that led to the seizure of evidence.           He\n\nclaims that his expectation of privacy was reasonable because of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fhis prior relationship with Fonseca.2   As to the warrantless entry,\n\nhe argues that Rosa did not have actual or implied authority to\n\nconsent to the police entry, that any implied consent was trumped\n\nby Battle's actual refusal to consent, and that the gun found\n\nunderneath the couch was not in plain view.   He claims, therefore,\n\nthat the seizure of the gun was unlawful and that the subsequent\n\nitems found were inadmissible.\n\n          We dispose of Battle's Fourth Amendment challenge because\n\nwe find he lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy to assert it.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be\n\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\"       U.S.\n\nConst. amend. IV.   To prevail on a claim that a search or seizure\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must show as a threshold\n\nmatter that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place\n\nor item searched.   Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 95 (1990).    The\n\ninquiry involves a two-part test: first, whether the defendant had\n\n\n     2\n      In his appellate brief, Battle also asserted that he has\nstanding to challenge the evidence seized pursuant to Article 14 of\nthe Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the Commonwealth's analog\nto the Fourth Amendment.      Massachusetts has interpreted this\nprovision to provide a defendant with automatic standing to contest\nthe legality of a search and seizure when a defendant is charged\nwith a crime in which possession of the seized evidence at the time\nof the search is an essential element of guilt. Commonwealth v.\nFrazier, 571 N.E.2d 1356, 1360-61 (Mass. 1991).       Although the\nMassachusetts state constitution grants automatic standing, the\nSupreme Court abandoned the principle for Fourth Amendment\npurposes. United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83 (1980). Battle\nwithdrew his automatic standing claim at oral argument.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fan actual, subjective, expectation of privacy; and second, whether\n\nthat expectation \"is one that society is prepared to recognize as\n\nobjectively reasonable.\" United States v. Rheault, 561 F.3d 55, 59\n\n(1st Cir. 2009) (citing Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740-41\n\n(1979)).\n\n           A defendant may have a legally sufficient interest in a\n\nplace other than his own home, such as in the home of a host who\n\nwelcomes the defendant as an overnight guest.   Olson, 495 U.S. at\n\n98-100.    A defendant lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in\n\na place, however, when he does not have permission to be present.\n\nSee United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(finding no legitimate expectation of privacy because defendant\n\nleft items in a trailer after the trailer's owner told defendant to\n\nleave); United States v. Rahme, 813 F.2d 31, 34 (2d Cir. 1987)\n\n(finding no legitimate expectation of privacy in hotel room after\n\nhotel guest failed to pay room bill), cited with approval in\n\nMcCarthy, 77 F.3d at 535; see also United States v. Lnu, 544 F.3d\n\n361, 366 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding no legitimate expectation of\n\nprivacy in storage locker because defendant failed to pay rent and\n\nfacility operator had removed lock and imposed a lien on contents);\n\nUnited States v. Melucci, 888 F.2d 200, 202 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(finding no legitimate expectation of privacy in storage locker\n\nbecause defendant failed to pay rent and facility operator removed\n\nlock); cf. Olson, 495 U.S. at 99 (commenting that an overnight\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fguest may have a legitimate expectation of privacy because \"[t]he\n\nhouseguest is there with the permission of his host, who is willing\n\nto share his house and his privacy with his guest\").\n\n          Here, although Battle may have exhibited a subjective\n\nexpectation of privacy in Fonseca's apartment, that expectation was\n\nobjectively unreasonable because Battle did not have permission to\n\nbe present.   The district court found that on August 21, 2004,\n\nafter the armed encounter with Rosa, Fonseca told Battle to leave\n\nher apartment and not come back.   On September 2, 2004, when Battle\n\ncalled Fonseca and told her that the police were in her apartment,\n\nshe asked Battle what he was doing at her house since he did not\n\nhave permission to be there.    On the day of the search, Battle was\n\nno longer a welcomed guest in Fonseca's apartment, but instead was\n\na trespasser who stayed beyond his permitted visit.        As such, he no\n\nlonger had a legally sufficient interest in the apartment to mount\n\na Fourth Amendment challenge.\n\n          Battle   does   not   contest   that   Fonseca    revoked   his\n\npermission to be present, but he urges that \"a lover sent packing\n\nis entitled to a somewhat longer checkout time.\"       He claims that\n\nbecause he still had personal items in the unit and was in the\n\nprocess of moving out, Fonseca's revocation twelve days prior to\n\nthe search was not immediately effective.        We do not understand\n\nthis to be a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is\n\nprepared to recognize.    The facts demonstrate that Battle had been\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fat   most   an   occasional     overnight       guest    during    his    one-month\n\nrelationship with Fonseca, Fonseca clearly told Battle to vacate\n\nher home, and Fonseca feared Battle's return to the point where she\n\ntemporarily      moved   out    of   her    apartment.      Such    circumstances\n\ndemonstrate that any subjective expectation of privacy that Battle\n\nbelieved he had was objectively unreasonable.                    Cf. Rheault, 561\n\nF.3d   at   61   (affirming     denial     of   motion    to     suppress   because\n\ndefendant's subjective expectation was unreasonable).\n\n            Battle    also     highlights       that    during    his    month-long\n\nrelationship with Fonseca he had a key and at times stayed at her\n\napartment, he kept personal items at her place, and he contributed\n\nto her subsidized rent.        Such facts were not found by the district\n\ncourt and are unsupported by the record, which demonstrates that\n\nBattle was lent a key once, never moved into the apartment, was to\n\ntake his belongings with him each time he left, and was repaid the\n\n$100 borrowed for rent. Further, to the extent that Battle enjoyed\n\ncertain privileges while he dated Fonseca, those privileges were\n\nrevoked on August 21, 2004, twelve days prior to the search, when\n\nFonseca ordered Battle out of her home.                   Without a legitimate\n\nexpectation of privacy in the apartment, Battle's Fourth Amendment\n\nclaim fails.\n\nB.   Sentencing\n\n            Battle argues next that his sentence of seventy-six\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fmonths' imprisonment is unreasonable.3 The pre-sentence report, to\n\nwhich neither side objected, calculated Battle's Guidelines range\n\nto be seventy to eighty-seven months based on a total offense level\n\nof twenty-one and a criminal history category of V.       Criminal\n\nhistory category V embraces defendants with ten to twelve criminal\n\nhistory points, and Battle scored an eleven.   Battle's points were\n\nbased on prior convictions for: (1) possession of marijuana (one\n\npoint), (2) possession of crack cocaine (two points), (3) domestic\n\nassault and battery (two points), and (4) felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm (three points).   The pre-sentence report added two points\n\nbecause the instant offenses were committed while Battle was on\n\nsupervised release for the prior firearm offense, and one more\n\npoint because the offenses were committed less than two years after\n\nBattle's release from imprisonment. See U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.1(d), (e).\n\n          On appeal, Battle argues that the district court should\n\nhave departed downward from the Guidelines range pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.3(b)(1), which allows for a downward departure if a\n\ndefendant's criminal history category significantly over-represents\n\n\n\n     3\n      At Battle's sentencing, the district court sentenced Battle\nboth on his instant offenses and for the derivative offense of\nviolating the terms of his supervised release; he had been\nsubsequently charged with the supervised release violation. Battle\nstipulated that he violated the terms of his supervised release by\ncommitting the instant offenses and agreed to an aggregate sentence\nfor both matters. The district court sentenced Battle to seventy-\nsix months' imprisonment for each of the instant offenses, to run\nconcurrently, and time served on the supervised release violation.\nThe supervised release violation is not at issue on appeal.\n\n                               -11-\n\fthe seriousness of his criminal history.4         He states that the one\n\npoint assigned to his marijuana offense was in error, and that the\n\ndistrict court should have found excessive the two points for his\n\ncocaine conviction because it occurred over twelve years earlier.\n\nThe subtraction of these three criminal history points would\n\nposition Battle in criminal history category IV, providing a range\n\nof fifty-seven to seventy-one months.            Battle also attacks the\n\nsubstantive    reasonableness    of    his   sentence,   arguing   that   the\n\nsentence failed to adequately account for his troubled personal\n\ncircumstances and his overstated criminal history, and that had the\n\none point for the marijuana offense been omitted, the district\n\ncourt would have been more sympathetic to his claim for leniency.\n\n            This court reviews the reasonableness of a sentence\n\n\"under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\" Gall v. United\n\nStates, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007).          We determine first whether the\n\ndistrict court made any procedural errors, \"'such as failing to\n\ncalculate     (or   improperly   calculating)     the    Guidelines   range,\n\ntreating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly\n\nerroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen\n\n\n\n     4\n      United States Sentencing Guideline ยง 4A1.3(b)(1) reads: \"If\nreliable information indicates that the defendant's criminal\nhistory category substantially over-represents the seriousness of\nthe defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the\ndefendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure may be\nwarranted.\"\n\n                                      -12-\n\fsentence - including an explanation for any deviation from the\n\nGuidelines range.'\"       United States v. Politano, 522 F.3d 69, 72\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (internal marks omitted) (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at\n\n51).       Next we evaluate the substantive reasonableness of the\n\nsentence     imposed.     Id.    We   consider   the   totality   of   the\n\ncircumstances and give due deference to the district court.            See\n\nGall, 552 U.S. at 51; United States v. Wallace, 573 F.3d 82, 97\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).        Although we evaluate the reasonableness of a\n\nsentence even when it falls within the Guidelines, \"a defendant who\n\nattempts to brand a within-the-range sentence as unreasonable must\n\ncarry a heavy burden.\"      United States v. Pelletier, 469 F.3d 194,\n\n204 (1st Cir. 2006).      A sentence will stand so long as there is \"a\n\nplausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.\"           United\n\nStates v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87, 96 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             Here, the sentence is both procedurally and substantively\n\nsound.      First, Battle's argument concerning the criminal history\n\npoint for the marijuana offense is a dead end.           The government\n\nposits that the court should review this claim for plain error\n\nbecause it was not presented to the district court.5          No matter\n\n\n       5\n      At the district court level, Battle admitted to the\ncorrectness of the pre-sentence report and argued only that he\nshould be granted a downward departure and placed in criminal\nhistory category IV on equitable grounds. On appeal, Battle makes\na different argument, asserting that the point inclusion for the\nmarijuana    offense    was    a     calculation    error    under\nU.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.2(c)(2), which states that sentences for specified\nprior offenses \"and offenses similar to them . . . are never\ncounted\" for purposes of criminal history.     Listed noncountable\n\n                                  -13-\n\fwhat level of review we accord this claim, however, it fails.\n\nBattle scored eleven criminal history points, and the subtraction\n\nof the one point would not have altered his criminal history\n\ncategory, which applies to defendants with ten to twelve criminal\n\nhistory points.   Accordingly, Battle's Guidelines range would be\n\nunchanged, and any potential error was harmless. See United States\n\nv. Gerhard, 615 F.3d 7, 34 (1st Cir. 2010) (bypassing merits of\n\nsentencing calculation claim because any error would not impact the\n\nGuidelines range); United States v. Caldwell, 358 F.3d 138, 143\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (rejecting defendant's claim that he was improperly\n\nscored an extra criminal history point because \"any error in the\n\ndistrict court's calculation . . . was harmless\"); see also United\n\nStates v. Matos, 611 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir. 2010) (applying plain\n\nerror review to claim that district court erred in calculating\n\ncriminal history points because defendant argued to the district\n\ncourt only that the criminal history category generally overstated\n\nthe seriousness of his past); United States v. Rivera, 448 F.3d 82,\n\n86 n.1 (1st Cir. 2006) (applying plain error review to unpreserved\n\ncalculation error claim and finding error harmless because any\n\nerror would not affect the sentencing range).\n\n          As to Battle's broader challenge that the district court\n\n\nprior offenses include local ordinance violations and public\nintoxication.   U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.2(c)(2).    Battle argues that his\nmarijuana offense is similar to these two noncountable offenses\nbecause Massachusetts has since decriminalized possession of small\namounts of marijuana.\n\n                               -14-\n\fshould have granted a downward departure in view of the marijuana\n\nand   cocaine   offenses,    we     reject   it.          A    district     court's\n\ndiscretionary   decision     not    to   depart    from       the   Guidelines   is\n\nreviewed for reasonableness.        United States v. Anonymous, 629 F.3d\n\n68, 73-75 (1st Cir. 2010).6          Here, the district court met the\n\nstandard.    It considered Battle's arguments but explained that a\n\ndeparture was unwarranted because of Battle's criminal history, the\n\nseriousness of his offenses, and the timing of their occurrence,\n\nhaving been committed shortly after Battle was released from\n\ncustody.    We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n            Lastly, the seventy-six-month sentence is substantively\n\nreasonable. Although Battle argues that the district court did not\n\nadequately   account   for    his    troubled     childhood         or   overstated\n\ncriminal history, the record belies his claim.                The district court\n\nspecifically acknowledged Battle's personal circumstances.                       It\n\nnoted his difficult past, applauded his current support system, and\n\n\n      6\n      Citing United States v. Melรฉndez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 50 (1st\nCir. 2005), the government argues that a district court's\ndiscretionary refusal to depart is unreviewable unless the district\ncourt based its decision on an error of law or a determination that\nit lacked authority to depart. We recently clarified, however,\nthat our decision in Melรฉndez-Torres did not give full effect to\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), which obligates\nfederal appellate courts to review sentences for reasonableness.\nAnonymous, 629 F.3d at 73-75. In United States v. Anonymous, we\nheld that virtually \"all sentences imposed under the advisory\nguidelines . . . are open to reasonableness review, including those\nthat entail either a discretionary refusal to depart or a departure\nwhose extent is contested.\" Id. at 74. We therefore review for\nreasonableness the district court's decision not to depart from the\nGuidelines.\n\n                                     -15-\n\frecognized his promise to learn from his mistakes.                It found the\n\nsentence a way \"to push the reset button and start again,\" which it\n\nbelieved Battle would be able to do.              The district court stated\n\nthat since Battle had already served sixty-three months and would\n\nbe credited several additional months for good behavior, a shorter\n\nsentence would not provide him with the time he needed to prepare\n\nfor release.      With this in mind, it explained that Battle would\n\nserve the first six months of his supervised release at a re-entry\n\ncenter that would help him gain employment, find a place to live,\n\nand receive any necessary treatment.\n\n           As to Battle's urge for leniency due to his allegedly\n\noverstated criminal history, the court considered this possibility\n\nand rejected it.         It specifically commented that Battle may have\n\nscored one point too high due to the marijuana offense, but\n\nremarked that \"really the criminal history is for all inten[ts]\n\nand purposes the same if I took that out.\"             It also explained that\n\nthe points assigned to Battle's prior gun offense, including the\n\npoints added because Battle had recently been in custody and was on\n\nsupervised      release    for   that   crime   when   the   instant   offenses\n\noccurred, were not excessive in view of Battle's history with the\n\ncriminal justice system and the similarity of the prior offense to\n\nthe   current    ones.      Overall,    the    court   clearly   articulated   a\n\nplausible explanation for its within-the-Guidelines sentence and\n\nprovided a defensible result.\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of Battle's motion to suppress and its sentencing decision.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f",

Maddox, by Appointment of the Court, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Kelly Begg Lawrence, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Carmen M. Ortiz, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SOUTER, Associate Justice,<sup>[*]</sup> and STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Malden O. Battle was charged with two counts of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1) and one count of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1). Battle moved to suppress the evidence supporting the charges, which was seized pursuant to a warrantless entry into the apartment of his ex-girlfriend and a subsequent search occurring after a warrant was obtained. After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the motion. Thereafter, Battle entered a guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. He was then sentenced to a seventy-six month term of imprisonment followed by three years' supervised release. Battle instituted the instant appeal based on his reserved challenge and the sentence imposed by the district court. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we recount the facts \"`as the trial court found them, consistent with record support.'\" <i>United States v. Andrade,</i> 551 F.3d 103, 106 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Lee,</i> 317 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2004, Odemira Rosa visited the Dorchester, Massachusetts apartment of his sometime girlfriend, Helena Fonseca. Rosa is the father of Fonseca's son, and although he lived elsewhere, he paid the rent for Fonseca's apartment, had his own key, enjoyed unlimited access to the unit, and spent significant time there. In the summer of 2004, Rosa and Fonseca were on a break in their relationship, and Fonseca and Battle briefly became involved romantically. Battle would occasionally stay with Fonseca, which was the case on August 21, when Rosa visited the apartment and discovered Battle and Fonseca together inside. Upon Rosa's entry, Battle confronted Rosa with a gun, and Rosa quickly left the apartment.</p>\n<p>This armed encounter precipitated the end of the one-month relationship between Battle and Fonseca, and Fonseca told Battle to leave her house and not come back. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> Battle, however, continued to call Fonseca, which frightened her, and so Fonseca and her children temporarily moved in with Rosa.</p>\n<p>On September 1, 2004, Rosa visited Fonseca's apartment to ensure that Battle had vacated the premises. Although Rosa did not find Battle at the apartment, he did discover various items belonging to Battle, including a gun in a black bag in the closet.</p>\n<p>The following morning, on September 2, 2004, Rosa went to the Dorchester police station and told Police Officer John Teixeira and Sergeant Detective Paul Donovan about the August 21 incident and the discovery of the gun in the closet. Rosa explained to the officers that although the apartment was in Fonseca's name, Rosa paid the rent and had a key and unlimited access to it.</p>\n<p>The police accepted Rosa's invitation to visit the apartment, and at approximately 10:30 a.m., Rosa brought Donovan, Teixeira, and six other officers to Fonseca's building. He used his key to usher them inside and waited one floor below Fonseca's unit while the police knocked on the apartment door. Battle opened the door and stepped out into the hallway, claiming that he had his girlfriend's permission to be present. Some officers entered the apartment and conducted a \"protective sweep,\" but they found nothing. Battle called Fonseca, and when he told her that the police were in her apartment she asked, \"What are you doing at my house? I don't want you at my house.... I didn't tell you you could go to my house.\" The officers instructed Fonseca to return home.</p>\n<p>The officers and Battle then entered the apartment. One officer read Battle his <i>Miranda</i> rights while Battle sat on the living room couch. Battle identified himself and told the officers that he was in the process of moving out. After he called his attorney, he stated that he did not want to answer any more questions. The officers ceased questioning Battle, but they asked him to leave the apartment so that they could \"freeze\" it while they obtained a search warrant.</p>\n<p>As Battle stood up from the couch to leave, an officer noticed and retrieved a gun located on the floor beneath the couch. When Fonseca arrived back at the apartment, she identified the gun as belonging to Battle, having seen him with the weapon on prior occasions. The police then arrested Battle and brought him to the station.</p>\n<p>Later that day, the officers obtained a search warrant using an affidavit that referenced the gun found underneath the couch. After searching the apartment and Battle's car, the officers discovered another gun, ballistics vests, boxes of ammunition, a bag containing three small bags of cocaine, $2982 in U.S. currency, various clothes, Battle's personal papers and photographs, and receipts in both Battle's and Fonseca's names.</p>\n<p>Battle moved to suppress all of the items seized from the apartment and car, and the district court denied the motion. It held that Battle did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in Fonseca's apartment and therefore lacked standing<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> to invoke the Fourth Amendment's protections. It also held that even if Battle could assert his claim, the claim failed because the police obtained valid third-party consent from Rosa to enter the apartment, and the discovery of the gun, which led to the discovery of the other items seized, was justified by the \"plain view\" doctrine.</p>\n<p>Battle pled guilty to the indictment and was sentenced to seventy-six months' imprisonment followed by three years' supervised release. The district court calculated the sentence based on a total offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history category of V, which under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\" or \"U.S.S.G.\") provided for a seventy to eighty-seven month prison term.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>In reviewing a motion to suppress, we review legal determinations de novo and findings of fact and credibility determinations for clear error. <i>United States v. Dubose,</i> 579 F.3d 117, 120 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>Andrade,</i> 551 F.3d at 109). We will uphold the denial of a motion to suppress as long as any reasonable view of the evidence supports it. <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> 609 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>Battle contends that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in Fonseca's apartment enabling him to assert his Fourth Amendment challenge, and that his rights were violated as a result of the warrantless entry that led to the seizure of evidence. He claims that his expectation of privacy was reasonable because of his prior relationship with Fonseca.<sup>[2]</sup> As to the warrantless entry, he argues that Rosa did not have actual or implied authority to consent to the police entry, that any implied consent was trumped by Battle's actual refusal to consent, and that the gun found underneath the couch was not in plain view. He claims, therefore, that the seizure of the gun was unlawful and that the subsequent items found were inadmissible.</p>\n<p>We dispose of Battle's Fourth Amendment challenge because we find he lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy to assert it. The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. To prevail on a claim that a search or seizure violated the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must show as a threshold matter that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place or item searched. <i>Minnesota v. Olson,</i> 495 U.S. 91, 95, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990). The inquiry involves a two-part test: first, whether the defendant had an actual, subjective, expectation of privacy; and second, whether that expectation \"is one that society is prepared to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> recognize as objectively reasonable.\" <i>United States v. Rheault,</i> 561 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>Smith v. Maryland,</i> 442 U.S. 735, 740-41, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979)).</p>\n<p>A defendant may have a legally sufficient interest in a place other than his own home, such as in the home of a host who welcomes the defendant as an overnight guest. <i>Olson,</i> 495 U.S. at 98-100, 110 S.Ct. 1684. A defendant lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in a place, however, when he does not have permission to be present. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir.1996) (finding no legitimate expectation of privacy because defendant left items in a trailer after the trailer's owner told defendant to leave); <i>United States v. Rahme,</i> 813 F.2d 31, 34 (2d Cir.1987) (finding no legitimate expectation of privacy in hotel room after hotel guest failed to pay room bill), <i>cited with approval in </i><i>McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d at 535; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Lnu,</i> 544 F.3d 361, 366 (1st Cir.2008) (finding no legitimate expectation of privacy in storage locker because defendant failed to pay rent and facility operator had removed lock and imposed a lien on contents); <i>United States v. Melucci,</i> 888 F.2d 200, 202 (1st Cir.1989) (finding no legitimate expectation of privacy in storage locker because defendant failed to pay rent and facility operator removed lock); <i>cf. </i><i>Olson,</i> 495 U.S. at 99, 110 S.Ct. 1684 (commenting that an overnight guest may have a legitimate expectation of privacy because \"[t]he houseguest is there with the permission of his host, who is willing to share his house and his privacy with his guest\").</p>\n<p>Here, although Battle may have exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy in Fonseca's apartment, that expectation was objectively unreasonable because Battle did not have permission to be present. The district court found that on August 21, 2004, after the armed encounter with Rosa, Fonseca told Battle to leave her apartment and not come back. On September 2, 2004, when Battle called Fonseca and told her that the police were in her apartment, she asked Battle what he was doing at her house since he did not have permission to be there. On the day of the search, Battle was no longer a welcomed guest in Fonseca's apartment, but instead was a trespasser who stayed beyond his permitted visit. As such, he no longer had a legally sufficient interest in the apartment to mount a Fourth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>Battle does not contest that Fonseca revoked his permission to be present, but he urges that \"a lover sent packing is entitled to a somewhat longer checkout time.\" He claims that because he still had personal items in the unit and was in the process of moving out, Fonseca's revocation twelve days prior to the search was not immediately effective. We do not understand this to be a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize. The facts demonstrate that Battle had been at most an occasional overnight guest during his one-month relationship with Fonseca, Fonseca clearly told Battle to vacate her home, and Fonseca feared Battle's return to the point where she temporarily moved out of her apartment. Such circumstances demonstrate that any subjective expectation of privacy that Battle believed he had was objectively unreasonable. <i>Cf. </i><i>Rheault,</i> 561 F.3d at 61 (affirming denial of motion to suppress because defendant's subjective expectation was unreasonable).</p>\n<p>Battle also highlights that during his month-long relationship with Fonseca he had a key and at times stayed at her apartment, he kept personal items at her place, and he contributed to her subsidized rent. Such facts were not found by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> district court and are unsupported by the record, which demonstrates that Battle was lent a key once, never moved into the apartment, was to take his belongings with him each time he left, and was repaid the $100 borrowed for rent. Further, to the extent that Battle enjoyed certain privileges while he dated Fonseca, those privileges were revoked on August 21, 2004, twelve days prior to the search, when Fonseca ordered Battle out of her home. Without a legitimate expectation of privacy in the apartment, Battle's Fourth Amendment claim fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Battle argues next that his sentence of seventy-six months' imprisonment is unreasonable.<sup>[3]</sup> The pre-sentence report, to which neither side objected, calculated Battle's Guidelines range to be seventy to eighty-seven months based on a total offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history category of V. Criminal history category V embraces defendants with ten to twelve criminal history points, and Battle scored an eleven. Battle's points were based on prior convictions for: (1) possession of marijuana (one point), (2) possession of crack cocaine (two points), (3) domestic assault and battery (two points), and (4) felon in possession of a firearm (three points). The pre-sentence report added two points because the instant offenses were committed while Battle was on supervised release for the prior firearm offense, and one more point because the offenses were committed less than two years after Battle's release from imprisonment. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.1(d), (e).</p>\n<p>On appeal, Battle argues that the district court should have departed downward from the Guidelines range pursuant to U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.3(b)(1), which allows for a downward departure if a defendant's criminal history category significantly over-represents the seriousness of his criminal history.<sup>[4]</sup> He states that the one point assigned to his marijuana offense was in error, and that the district court should have found excessive the two points for his cocaine conviction because it occurred over twelve years earlier. The subtraction of these three criminal history points would position Battle in criminal history category IV, providing a range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months. Battle also attacks the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the sentence failed to adequately account for his troubled personal circumstances and his overstated criminal history, and that had the one point for the marijuana offense been omitted, the district court would have been more sympathetic to his claim for leniency.</p>\n<p>This court reviews the reasonableness of a sentence \"under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> first whether the district court made any procedural errors, \"`such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentenceยincluding an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.'\" <i>United States v. Politano,</i> 522 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir.2008) (internal marks omitted) (quoting <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Next we evaluate the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <i>Id.</i> We consider the totality of the circumstances and give due deference to the district court. <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <i>United States v. Wallace,</i> 573 F.3d 82, 97 (1st Cir.2009). Although we evaluate the reasonableness of a sentence even when it falls within the Guidelines, \"a defendant who attempts to brand a within-the-range sentence as unreasonable must carry a heavy burden.\" <i>United States v. Pelletier,</i> 469 F.3d 194, 204 (1st Cir.2006). A sentence will stand so long as there is \"a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 96 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Here, the sentence is both procedurally and substantively sound. First, Battle's argument concerning the criminal history point for the marijuana offense is a dead end. The government posits that the court should review this claim for plain error because it was not presented to the district court.<sup>[5]</sup> No matter what level of review we accord this claim, however, it fails. Battle scored eleven criminal history points, and the subtraction of the one point would not have altered his criminal history category, which applies to defendants with ten to twelve criminal history points. Accordingly, Battle's Guidelines range would be unchanged, and any potential error was harmless. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gerhard,</i> 615 F.3d 7, 34 (1st Cir.2010) (bypassing merits of sentencing calculation claim because any error would not impact the Guidelines range); <i>United States v. Caldwell,</i> 358 F.3d 138, 143 (1st Cir.2004) (rejecting defendant's claim that he was improperly scored an extra criminal history point because \"any error in the district court's calculation ... was harmless\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Matos,</i> 611 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir.2010) (applying plain error review to claim that district court erred in calculating criminal history points because defendant argued to the district court only that the criminal history category generally overstated the seriousness of his past); <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 448 F.3d 82, 86 n. 1 (1st Cir.2006) (applying plain error review to unpreserved calculation error claim and finding error harmless because any error would not affect the sentencing range).</p>\n<p>As to Battle's broader challenge that the district court should have granted a downward departure in view of the marijuana and cocaine offenses, we reject it. A district court's discretionary decision not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> to depart from the Guidelines is reviewed for reasonableness. <i>United States v. Anonymous,</i> 629 F.3d 68, 73-75 (1st Cir. 2010).<sup>[6]</sup> Here, the district court met the standard. It considered Battle's arguments but explained that a departure was unwarranted because of Battle's criminal history, the seriousness of his offenses, and the timing of their occurrence, having been committed shortly after Battle was released from custody. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the seventy-six-month sentence is substantively reasonable. Although Battle argues that the district court did not adequately account for his troubled childhood or overstated criminal history, the record belies his claim. The district court specifically acknowledged Battle's personal circumstances. It noted his difficult past, applauded his current support system, and recognized his promise to learn from his mistakes. It found the sentence a way \"to push the reset button and start again,\" which it believed Battle would be able to do. The district court stated that since Battle had already served sixty-three months and would be credited several additional months for good behavior, a shorter sentence would not provide him with the time he needed to prepare for release. With this in mind, it explained that Battle would serve the first six months of his supervised release at a re-entry center that would help him gain employment, find a place to live, and receive any necessary treatment.</p>\n<p>As to Battle's urge for leniency due to his allegedly overstated criminal history, the court considered this possibility and rejected it. It specifically commented that Battle may have scored one point too high due to the marijuana offense, but remarked that \"really the criminal history is for all inten[ts] and purposes the same if I took that out.\" It also explained that the points assigned to Battle's prior gun offense, including the points added because Battle had recently been in custody and was on supervised release for that crime when the instant offenses occurred, were not excessive in view of Battle's history with the criminal justice system and the similarity of the prior offense to the current ones. Overall, the court clearly articulated a plausible explanation for its within-the-Guidelines sentence and provided a defensible result.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's denial of Battle's motion to suppress and its sentencing decision.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"`It is well-settled that a defendant who fails to demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched or the item seized will not have `standing' to claim that an illegal search or seizure occurred.'\" <i>United States v. Rheault,</i> 561 F.3d 55, 58 n. 8 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2008)). We acknowledge, however, that this threshold inquiry is \"more properly placed within the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than within that of standing.\" <i>Rakas v. Illinois,</i> 439 U.S. 128, 140, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978); <i>Rheault,</i> 561 F.3d at 58 n. 8; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Lozada,</i> 558 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[2]  In his appellate brief, Battle also asserted that he has standing to challenge the evidence seized pursuant to Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the Commonwealth's analog to the Fourth Amendment. Massachusetts has interpreted this provision to provide a defendant with automatic standing to contest the legality of a search and seizure when a defendant is charged with a crime in which possession of the seized evidence at the time of the search is an essential element of guilt. <i>Commonwealth v. Frazier,</i> 410 Mass. 235, 571 N.E.2d 1356, 1360-61 (1991). Although the Massachusetts state constitution grants automatic standing, the Supreme Court abandoned the principle for Fourth Amendment purposes. <i>United States v. Salvucci,</i> 448 U.S. 83, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980). Battle withdrew his automatic standing claim at oral argument.</p>\n<p>[3]  At Battle's sentencing, the district court sentenced Battle both on his instant offenses and for the derivative offense of violating the terms of his supervised release; he had been subsequently charged with the supervised release violation. Battle stipulated that he violated the terms of his supervised release by committing the instant offenses and agreed to an aggregate sentence for both matters. The district court sentenced Battle to seventy-six months' imprisonment for each of the instant offenses, to run concurrently, and time served on the supervised release violation. The supervised release violation is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p>[4]  United States Sentencing Guideline ยง 4A1.3(b)(1) reads: \"If reliable information indicates that the defendant's criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure may be warranted.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  At the district court level, Battle admitted to the correctness of the pre-sentence report and argued only that he should be granted a downward departure and placed in criminal history category IV on equitable grounds. On appeal, Battle makes a different argument, asserting that the point inclusion for the marijuana offense was a calculation error under U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.2(c)(2), which states that sentences for specified prior offenses \"and offenses similar to them ... are never counted\" for purposes of criminal history. Listed noncountable prior offenses include local ordinance violations and public intoxication. U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.2(c)(2). Battle argues that his marijuana offense is similar to these two noncountable offenses because Massachusetts has since decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p>\n<p>[6]  Citing <i>United States v. Melรฉndez-Torres,</i> 420 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir.2005), the government argues that a district court's discretionary refusal to depart is unreviewable unless the district court based its decision on an error of law or a determination that it lacked authority to depart. We recently clarified, however, that our decision in <i>Melรฉndez-Torres</i> did not give full effect to <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which obligates federal appellate courts to review sentences for reasonableness. <i>Anonymous,</i> 629 F.3d at 73-75. In <i>United States v. Anonymous</i><i>,</i> we held that virtually \"all sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines ... are open to reasonableness review, including those that entail either a discretionary refusal to depart or a departure whose extent is contested.\" <i>Id.</i> at 74. We therefore review for reasonableness the district court's decision not to depart from the Guidelines.</p>\n\n</div>",

Rosa is the father of Fonseca's son, and although he lived elsewhere, he paid the rent for Fonseca's apartment, had his own key, enjoyed unlimited access to the unit, and spent significant time there. In the summer of 2004, Rosa and Fonseca were on a break in their relationship, and Fonseca and Battle briefly became involved romantically. Battle would occasionally stay with Fonseca, which was the case on August 21, when Rosa visited the apartment and discovered Battle and Fonseca together inside. Upon Rosa's entry, Battle confronted Rosa with a gun, and Rosa quickly left the apartment.</p>\n<p>This armed encounter precipitated the end of the one-month relationship between Battle and Fonseca, and Fonseca told Battle to leave her house and not come back. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> Battle, however, continued to call Fonseca, which frightened her, and so Fonseca and her children temporarily moved in with Rosa.</p>\n<p>On September 1, 2004, Rosa visited Fonseca's apartment to ensure that Battle had vacated the premises. Although Rosa did not find Battle at the apartment, he did discover various items belonging to Battle, including a gun in a black bag in the closet.</p>\n<p>The following morning, on September 2, 2004, Rosa went to the Dorchester police station and told Police Officer John Teixeira and Sergeant Detective Paul Donovan about the August 21 incident and the discovery of the gun in the closet. Rosa explained to the officers that although the apartment was in Fonseca's name, Rosa paid the rent and had a key and unlimited access to it.</p>\n<p>The police accepted Rosa's invitation to visit the apartment, and at approximately 10:30 a.m., Rosa brought Donovan, Teixeira, and six other officers to Fonseca's building. He used his key to usher them inside and waited one floor below Fonseca's unit while the police knocked on the apartment door. Battle opened the door and stepped out into the hallway, claiming that he had his girlfriend's permission to be present. Some officers entered the apartment and conducted a \"protective sweep,\" but they found nothing. Battle called Fonseca, and when he told her that the police were in her apartment she asked, \"What are you doing at my house? I don't want you at my house.... I didn't tell you you could go to my house.\" The officers instructed Fonseca to return home.</p>\n<p>The officers and Battle then entered the apartment. One officer read Battle his <i>Miranda</i> rights while Battle sat on the living room couch. Battle identified himself and told the officers that he was in the process of moving out. After he called his attorney, he stated that he did not want to answer any more questions. The officers ceased questioning Battle, but they asked him to leave the apartment so that they could \"freeze\" it while they obtained a search warrant.</p>\n<p>As Battle stood up from the couch to leave, an officer noticed and retrieved a gun located on the floor beneath the couch. When Fonseca arrived back at the apartment, she identified the gun as belonging to Battle, having seen him with the weapon on prior occasions. The police then arrested Battle and brought him to the station.</p>\n<p>Later that day, the officers obtained a search warrant using an affidavit that referenced the gun found underneath the couch. After searching the apartment and Battle's car, the officers discovered another gun, ballistics vests, boxes of ammunition, a bag containing three small bags of cocaine, $2982 in U.S. currency, various clothes, Battle's personal papers and photographs, and receipts in both Battle's and Fonseca's names.</p>\n<p>Battle moved to suppress all of the items seized from the apartment and car, and the district court denied the motion. It held that Battle did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in Fonseca's apartment and therefore lacked standing<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> to invoke the Fourth Amendment's protections. It also held that even if Battle could assert his claim, the claim failed because the police obtained valid third-party consent from Rosa to enter the apartment, and the discovery of the gun, which led to the discovery of the other items seized, was justified by the \"plain view\" doctrine.</p>\n<p>Battle pled guilty to the indictment and was sentenced to seventy-six months' imprisonment followed by three years' supervised release. The district court calculated the sentence based on a total offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history category of V, which under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\" or \"U.S.S.G.\") provided for a seventy to eighty-seven month prison term.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>In reviewing a motion to suppress, we review legal determinations de novo and findings of fact and credibility determinations for clear error. <i>United States v. Dubose,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203983\"><a href=\"/opinion/203983/united-states-v-dubose/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 120 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>Andrade,</i> 551 F.3d at 109). We will uphold the denial of a motion to suppress as long as any reasonable view of the evidence supports it. <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149263\"><a href=\"/opinion/149263/united-states-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>Battle contends that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in Fonseca's apartment enabling him to assert his Fourth Amendment challenge, and that his rights were violated as a result of the warrantless entry that led to the seizure of evidence. He claims that his expectation of privacy was reasonable because of his prior relationship with Fonseca.<sup>[2]</sup> As to the warrantless entry, he argues that Rosa did not have actual or implied authority to consent to the police entry, that any implied consent was trumped by Battle's actual refusal to consent, and that the gun found underneath the couch was not in plain view. He claims, therefore, that the seizure of the gun was unlawful and that the subsequent items found were inadmissible.</p>\n<p>We dispose of Battle's Fourth Amendment challenge because we find he lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy to assert it. The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. To prevail on a claim that a search or seizure violated the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must show as a threshold matter that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place or item searched. <i>Minnesota v. Olson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112416\"><a href=\"/opinion/112416/minnesota-v-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112416\"><a href=\"/opinion/112416/minnesota-v-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The inquiry involves a two-part test: first, whether the defendant had an actual, subjective, expectation of privacy; and second, whether that expectation \"is one that society is prepared to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> recognize as objectively reasonable.\" <i>United States v.

A defendant lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in a place, however, when he does not have permission to be present. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1684</span></a></span> (commenting that an overnight guest may have a legitimate expectation of privacy because \"[t]he houseguest is there with the permission of his host, who is willing to share his house and his privacy with his guest\").</p>\n<p>Here, although Battle may have exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy in Fonseca's apartment, that expectation was objectively unreasonable because Battle did not have permission to be present. The district court found that on August 21, 2004, after the armed encounter with Rosa, Fonseca told Battle to leave her apartment and not come back. On September 2, 2004, when Battle called Fonseca and told her that the police were in her apartment, she asked Battle what he was doing at her house since he did not have permission to be there. On the day of the search, Battle was no longer a welcomed guest in Fonseca's apartment, but instead was a trespasser who stayed beyond his permitted visit. As such, he no longer had a legally sufficient interest in the apartment to mount a Fourth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>Battle does not contest that Fonseca revoked his permission to be present, but he urges that \"a lover sent packing is entitled to a somewhat longer checkout time.\" He claims that because he still had personal items in the unit and was in the process of moving out, Fonseca's revocation twelve days prior to the search was not immediately effective. We do not understand this to be a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize. The facts demonstrate that Battle had been at most an occasional overnight guest during his one-month relationship with Fonseca, Fonseca clearly told Battle to vacate her home, and Fonseca feared Battle's return to the point where she temporarily moved out of her apartment. Such circumstances demonstrate that any subjective expectation of privacy that Battle believed he had was objectively unreasonable. <i>Cf. </i><i>Rheault,</i> 561 F.3d at 61 (affirming denial of motion to suppress because defendant's subjective expectation was unreasonable).</p>\n<p>Battle also highlights that during his month-long relationship with Fonseca he had a key and at times stayed at her apartment, he kept personal items at her place, and he contributed to her subsidized rent. Such facts were not found by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> district court and are unsupported by the record, which demonstrates that Battle was lent a key once, never moved into the apartment, was to take his belongings with him each time he left, and was repaid the $100 borrowed for rent. Further, to the extent that Battle enjoyed certain privileges while he dated Fonseca, those privileges were revoked on August 21, 2004, twelve days prior to the search, when Fonseca ordered Battle out of her home. Without a legitimate expectation of privacy in the apartment, Battle's Fourth Amendment claim fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Battle argues next that his sentence of seventy-six months' imprisonment is unreasonable.<sup>[3]</sup> The pre-sentence report, to which neither side objected, calculated Battle's Guidelines range to be seventy to eighty-seven months based on a total offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history category of V. Criminal history category V embraces defendants with ten to twelve criminal history points, and Battle scored an eleven. Battle's points were based on prior convictions for: (1) possession of marijuana (one point), (2) possession of crack cocaine (two points), (3) domestic assault and battery (two points), and (4) felon in possession of a firearm (three points). The pre-sentence report added two points because the instant offenses were committed while Battle was on supervised release for the prior firearm offense, and one more point because the offenses were committed less than two years after Battle's release from imprisonment. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.1(d), (e).</p>\n<p>On appeal, Battle argues that the district court should have departed downward from the Guidelines range pursuant to U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.3(b)(1), which allows for a downward departure if a defendant's criminal history category significantly over-represents the seriousness of his criminal history.<sup>[4]</sup> He states that the one point assigned to his marijuana offense was in error, and that the district court should have found excessive the two points for his cocaine conviction because it occurred over twelve years earlier. The subtraction of these three criminal history points would position Battle in criminal history category IV, providing a range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months. Battle also attacks the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the sentence failed to adequately account for his troubled personal circumstances and his overstated criminal history, and that had the one point for the marijuana offense been omitted, the district court would have been more sympathetic to his claim for leniency.</p>\n<p>This court reviews the reasonableness of a sentence \"under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007). We determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> first whether the district court made any procedural errors, \"`such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentenceยincluding an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.'\" <i>United States v. Politano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203223\"><a href=\"/opinion/203223/united-states-v-politano/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2008) (internal marks omitted) (quoting <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>). Next we evaluate the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <i>Id.</i> We consider the totality of the circumstances and give due deference to the district court. <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although we evaluate the reasonableness of a sentence even when it falls within the Guidelines, \"a defendant who attempts to brand a within-the-range sentence as unreasonable must carry a heavy burden.\" <i>United States v. Pelletier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796023\"><a href=\"/opinion/796023/united-states-v-joseph-pellether/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 204 (1st Cir.2006).

First, Battle's argument concerning the criminal history point for the marijuana offense is a dead end. The government posits that the court should review this claim for plain error because it was not presented to the district court.<sup>[5]</sup> No matter what level of review we accord this claim, however, it fails. Battle scored eleven criminal history points, and the subtraction of the one point would not have altered his criminal history category, which applies to defendants with ten to twelve criminal history points. Accordingly, Battle's Guidelines range would be unchanged, and any potential error was harmless. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gerhard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151938\"><a href=\"/opinion/151938/united-states-v-gerhard/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2010) (bypassing merits of sentencing calculation claim because any error would not impact the Guidelines range); <i>United States v.

A district court's discretionary decision not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> to depart from the Guidelines is reviewed for reasonableness. <i>United States v. Anonymous,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"181603\"><a href=\"/opinion/181603/united-states-v-anonymous/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 73-75 (1st Cir. 2010).<sup>[6]</sup> Here, the district court met the standard. It considered Battle's arguments but explained that a departure was unwarranted because of Battle's criminal history, the seriousness of his offenses, and the timing of their occurrence, having been committed shortly after Battle was released from custody. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the seventy-six-month sentence is substantively reasonable. Although Battle argues that the district court did not adequately account for his troubled childhood or overstated criminal history, the record belies his claim. The district court specifically acknowledged Battle's personal circumstances. It noted his difficult past, applauded his current support system, and recognized his promise to learn from his mistakes. It found the sentence a way \"to push the reset button and start again,\" which it believed Battle would be able to do. The district court stated that since Battle had already served sixty-three months and would be credited several additional months for good behavior, a shorter sentence would not provide him with the time he needed to prepare for release. With this in mind, it explained that Battle would serve the first six months of his supervised release at a re-entry center that would help him gain employment, find a place to live, and receive any necessary treatment.</p>\n<p>As to Battle's urge for leniency due to his allegedly overstated criminal history, the court considered this possibility and rejected it. It specifically commented that Battle may have scored one point too high due to the marijuana offense, but remarked that \"really the criminal history is for all inten[ts] and purposes the same if I took that out.\" It also explained that the points assigned to Battle's prior gun offense, including the points added because Battle had recently been in custody and was on supervised release for that crime when the instant offenses occurred, were not excessive in view of Battle's history with the criminal justice system and the similarity of the prior offense to the current ones. Overall, the court clearly articulated a plausible explanation for its within-the-Guidelines sentence and provided a defensible result.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's denial of Battle's motion to suppress and its sentencing decision.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"`It is well-settled that a defendant who fails to demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched or the item seized will not have `standing' to claim that an illegal search or seizure occurred.'\" <i>United States v. Rheault,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203746\"><a href=\"/opinion/203746/united-states-v-rheault/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 58 n. 8 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v.

We acknowledge, however, that this threshold inquiry is \"more properly placed within the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than within that of standing.\" <i>Rakas v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></span>, 140, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rodriguez-Lozada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203687\"><a href=\"/opinion/203687/united-states-v-rodriguez-lozada/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[2]  In his appellate brief, Battle also asserted that he has standing to challenge the evidence seized pursuant to Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the Commonwealth's analog to the Fourth Amendment. Massachusetts has interpreted this provision to provide a defendant with automatic standing to contest the legality of a search and seizure when a defendant is charged with a crime in which possession of the seized evidence at the time of the search is an essential element of guilt. <i>Commonwealth v. Frazier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2125887\"><a href=\"/opinion/2125887/commonwealth-v-frazier/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2125887\"><a href=\"/opinion/2125887/commonwealth-v-frazier/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1356</span></a></span>, 1360-61 (1991). Although the Massachusetts state constitution grants automatic standing, the Supreme Court abandoned the principle for Fourth Amendment purposes. <i>United States v. Salvucci,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110325\"><a href=\"/opinion/110325/united-states-v-salvucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110325\"><a href=\"/opinion/110325/united-states-v-salvucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2547</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110325\"><a href=\"/opinion/110325/united-states-v-salvucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span> (1980). Battle withdrew his automatic standing claim at oral argument.</p>\n<p>[3]  At Battle's sentencing, the district court sentenced Battle both on his instant offenses and for the derivative offense of violating the terms of his supervised release; he had been subsequently charged with the supervised release violation. Battle stipulated that he violated the terms of his supervised release by committing the instant offenses and agreed to an aggregate sentence for both matters. The district court sentenced Battle to seventy-six months' imprisonment for each of the instant offenses, to run concurrently, and time served on the supervised release violation. The supervised release violation is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p>[4]  United States Sentencing Guideline ยง 4A1.3(b)(1) reads: \"If reliable information indicates that the defendant's criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure may be warranted.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  At the district court level, Battle admitted to the correctness of the pre-sentence report and argued only that he should be granted a downward departure and placed in criminal history category IV on equitable grounds. On appeal, Battle makes a different argument, asserting that the point inclusion for the marijuana offense was a calculation error under U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.2(c)(2), which states that sentences for specified prior offenses \"and offenses similar to them ... are never counted\" for purposes of criminal history. Listed noncountable prior offenses include local ordinance violations and public intoxication. U.S.S.G. ยง 4A1.2(c)(2). Battle argues that his marijuana offense is similar to these two noncountable offenses because Massachusetts has since decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p>\n<p>[6]  Citing <i>United States v. Melรฉndez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201783\"><a href=\"/opinion/201783/united-states-v-melendez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.2005), the government argues that a district court's discretionary refusal to depart is unreviewable unless the district court based its decision on an error of law or a determination that it lacked authority to depart. We recently clarified, however, that our decision in <i>Melรฉndez-Torres</i> did not give full effect to <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), which obligates federal appellate courts to review sentences for reasonableness. <i>Anonymous,</i> 629 F.3d at 73-75. In <i>United States v. Anonymous</i><i>,</i> we held that virtually \"all sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines ... are open to reasonableness review, including those that entail either a discretionary refusal to depart or a departure whose extent is contested.\" <i>Id.</i> at 74. We therefore review for reasonableness the district court's decision not to depart from the Guidelines.</p>\n\n</div>",
