MacColl, with whom Thompson, Bull, Furey, Bass &\nMacColl, LLC, P.A., was on brief, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 15, 2005\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.        Louis H. Burdi pleaded guilty to\n\nmail fraud, see 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and now appeals his sentence.          We\n\naffirm.\n\n           In July 1999, Burdi, then living in California, contacted\n\nManford Zorn, a Maine resident, to negotiate the purchase of a\n\nwatch that Zorn had listed on an auction web site.            Burdi offered\n\n$14,000 for the watch and Zorn accepted the offer.            Burdi mailed\n\nZorn what he knew to be a counterfeit cashier's check in the amount\n\nof $14,000, and Zorn shipped the watch to Burdi's California\n\naddress.   As it turns out, this transaction was just one of several\n\nsimilar fraudulent transactions involving online auctions conducted\n\nby Burdi and an associate in the summer of 1999.\n\n           Local authorities soon discovered the fraudulent scheme,\n\nand a California state indictment charged Burdi with several\n\nfraudulent transactions, not including the transaction with Zorn.1\n\nBurdi pleaded guilty to one of nine counts and the rest were\n\ndismissed.    Following his release on parole after serving some of\n\nhis   four-year    California   prison    sentence,   Burdi    was   charged\n\nfederally in Maine in the present case with one count of mail fraud\n\nfor the fraudulent purchase of Zorn's watch.\n\n           Upon pleading guilty, Burdi was released on bail pending\n\nsentencing.       His bail was revoked shortly thereafter when he\n\n\n      1\n      According to Burdi, California authorities failed to uncover\nthe Zorn transaction because Burdi had used a different courier for\nthat particular transaction.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fviolated the conditions of his release by forging several checks\n\nbelonging to his parents and moved out of his mother's Chicago home\n\nwithout reporting the move to his release supervisor.\n\n           At sentencing, the district court determined that the\n\nbase offense level of six should be increased by three levels\n\nbecause   the   intended   loss   exceeded   $10,000,   see   U.S.S.G.   §\n\n2F1.1(b)(1)(D),2 but denied a two-level reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.         Burdi's long and well-\n\ndocumented criminal history, mostly involving thefts and fraudulent\n\ntransactions similar to the one in the present case, resulted in a\n\nCriminal History Category of VI and a sentencing range of 21 to 27\n\nmonths.   Due to the extensive nature of Burdi's criminal history,\n\nthe court sua sponte considered an upward departure, but ultimately\n\ndecided against it.    The court also denied Burdi's request for a\n\ndownward departure, advanced under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 on the ground\n\nthat he had already been substantially punished for the offense\n\nconduct by serving time for the California conviction.         The court\n\nsentenced Burdi to 27 months' imprisonment followed by three years\n\nof supervised release, and ordered him to pay restitution to Zorn\n\nin the amount of $14,000.     See 18 U.S.C. § 3663A.\n\n           Burdi raises four issues on appeal: (1) whether his case\n\nshould be remanded for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court's\n\n\n     2\n      The court used the 1999 edition of the United States\nSentencing Guidelines Manual. Section 2F1.1 has since been deleted\nand consolidated with § 2B1.1.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fdecision in United States v. Booker, --- U.S. ---, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005);   (2)    whether   the   district     court's   refusal   to    grant   a\n\ndownward departure     was clearly erroneous; (3) whether the court\n\nerred by failing to grant a downward adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility; and (4) whether there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the court's award of restitution.\n\n           Burdi's first two arguments are largely premised on his\n\ncontention that he has already been substantially punished for the\n\ncrime at issue.      He contends that when he pleaded guilty in the\n\nCalifornia proceeding, he essentially accepted responsibility for,\n\nand was punished for, the same course of conduct (i.e., the scheme\n\ninvolving the use of counterfeit checks to purchase items listed on\n\nauction web sites) for which he is now incarcerated.              Although he\n\nadmits that the California indictment did not charge the fraudulent\n\nZorn transaction, Burdi argues that it is highly unlikely that he\n\nwould have received a longer sentence in California had that\n\ntransaction been charged.        More likely, he argues, he still would\n\nhave   pleaded    guilty   to    the   same   single    count   and    the   Zorn\n\ntransaction would have been dismissed at sentencing along with the\n\neight other counts that were dismissed.                Burdi argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred, not only in its refusal to mitigate his\n\nsentence based on his California time served, but also in its use\n\nof the California conviction to enhance his criminal history under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.1.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           In his invocation of Booker, Burdi asserts that, due to\n\nthe interrelationship of this case with the California proceeding,\n\nas well as his efforts to cooperate with the government and to seek\n\ntreatment and rehabilitation for his mental health problems, there\n\nis   a   reasonable   probability    that,   under    the   now   advisory\n\nguidelines, the district court would sentence him more leniently.\n\nSee United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Because Burdi did not preserve his Booker challenge below,\n\nwe review for plain error.    See id.3    Under this standard, we will\n\ngrant a remand only if we find (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and\n\nthat not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but\n\nalso (4) seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.       Id. at 77.\n\n           Burdi's argument falters on the third prong of the test.\n\nTo establish that the error affected his substantial rights, Burdi\n\nmust show a reasonable probability that the district court would\n\nimpose a more favorable sentence on remand.          Id. at 75.   Although\n\nwe are not “overly demanding as to proof of [such a] probability,”\n\nUnited States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005), we\n\nfind nothing in the record to indicate that the court would\n\nsentence more leniently under advisory guidelines.          If anything,\n\n\n     3\n      Although it appears that the sentencing court was at least\naware of Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), see infra note\n4, it does not appear that Burdi objected on that ground. In any\nevent, Burdi's reply brief concedes that the Antonakopoulos\nstandard applies.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fgiven the comments of the court at sentencing, Burdi might well\n\nreceive a longer sentence.4             Also telling is the court's exercise\n\nof discretion to sentence Burdi at the top of the applicable\n\nGuideline range.         See United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 505\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (that the court sentenced defendant in the middle\n\nof    the    guideline    range,       rather   than   at   the    bottom,    “speaks\n\nvolumes”); United States v. Brennick, 405 F.3d 96, 101-02 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (no reasonable probability for a more lenient sentence where\n\nthe court sentenced at the high end of the range and indicated that\n\nit would have sentenced higher if it had the authority to do so).\n\n               Burdi alternatively argues that, even in a pre-Booker\n\nregime, the district court committed clear error in refusing to\n\ngrant a downward departure to account for the time Burdi already\n\nserved in California for the same course of conduct. Although this\n\ncourt possesses jurisdiction to review “a refusal to depart where\n\nthe   refusal     rests   upon     a    legal   mistake,    such    as   a   mistaken\n\n\n\n       4\n           In announcing its sentence, the court stated:\n\n       I'm going to impose a sentence . . . at the high end of\n       the guideline range of 27 months for the reasons that\n       there needs to be protection against the kind of conduct\n       that you've been engaging in. Your lawyer has really\n       been very effective in keeping me to the guideline range\n       because, as I indicated, I seriously entertained an\n       upward departure beyond that range.\n\n     Moreover, one factor that influenced the court to not depart\nupward was “the uncertain legal environment that we are all in with\nthe Blakely decision.” As that uncertainty has now been resolved,\nthe court could feel free to impose an upward departure.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fassumption that a particular ground is generically impermissible as\n\na   basis      for   departure,”       we    lack       jurisdiction     to    review   “a\n\ndiscretionary decision not to depart on the facts of the particular\n\ncase.”      United States v. Rodriguez, 327 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n               Here, the district court's decision not to depart was\n\ndiscretionary,        and    entailed       no    mistake      of   law.       The   court\n\nacknowledged Burdi's argument concerning the interrelationship\n\nbetween the present crime and the criminal conduct punished in the\n\nCalifornia proceeding, but nevertheless determined that “even if I\n\nwere to set aside [the California] conviction, the criminal history\n\npoints here are still abundantly large enough to encompass the\n\nsentence that's being imposed . . . .”                           Moreover, the court\n\nconcluded that “the need to protect society and the deterrence\n\ngoals    are    sufficiently        strong       here    to   justify    the    guideline\n\nsentencing range and to counsel against any downward departure.”\n\nGiven    the    facts   of    the    case    and     Burdi's     “dramatic”      criminal\n\nhistory,       the   court    viewed    Burdi       as   a    threat    to    society   and\n\nsentenced him accordingly.              We are not empowered to review the\n\ncourt's discretionary refusal to depart.\n\n               Burdi's third contention is that the court's denial of a\n\ntwo-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was\n\nclearly erroneous.           See United States v. McLaughlin, 378 F.3d 35,\n\n37 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that the “inquiry into whether a\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fdefendant has accepted responsibility is typically a fact-dominated\n\nenterprise,   and   we   ordinarily   review   the   sentencing   court's\n\ndetermination of such an issue for clear error”). Burdi emphasizes\n\nthe fact that he has been cooperative since being caught:             he\n\npleaded guilty in both the California proceeding and in the present\n\ncase, he met with the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office\n\nto describe the events surrounding the offenses in these cases, he\n\nidentified his associate in the fraudulent scheme and offered to\n\ntestify against him, and in his allocution he was contrite and\n\nacknowledged that he has deep psychological problems that require\n\nmedication and counseling. Burdi claims that the violations of his\n\nconditions of release resulted from a psychological condition over\n\nwhich he had no control at the time, but for which he is now\n\nseeking help.\n\n            Burdi bore the burden of establishing his entitlement to\n\nan adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. §\n\n3E1.1(a).   See McLaughlin, 378 F.3d at 39.     In determining whether\n\na defendant qualifies for such a reduction, the sentencing court\n\nmay consider whether the defendant has voluntarily terminated or\n\nwithdrawn from criminal activity.        See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmmt.\n\nn.1(b).   Moreover,\n\n            [i]t follows that when a defendant commits new\n            offenses after having been charged and those\n            offenses reflect adversely on the sincerity of\n            the   defendant's   avowed   contrition,   the\n            sentencing court may treat the commission of\n            those offenses as an indication that the\n\n                                  -8-\n\f             defendant has not accepted responsibility for\n             the original crime . . . .            In such\n             circumstances, a sentencing court lawfully may\n             'decline to award a reduction for acceptance\n             of responsibility on that ground alone.'\n\nMcLaughlin, 378 F.3d at 38 (emphasis added) (quoting United States\n\nv. Carrington, 96 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n             Although Burdi may have taken some positive steps toward\n\naccepting his responsibility for his crime, the district court\n\nquite reasonably concluded that Burdi's post-plea criminal conduct\n\nmade an adjustment unwarranted.              There was no clear error here.\n\n             Burdi's       final   argument     is    that   the   district    court\n\nerroneously ordered restitution because the $14,000 loss amount was\n\nnot   supported       by    reliable    evidence.        Burdi     argues   that   a\n\nrestitution award must be based on the amount of loss actually\n\ncaused by the offense conduct.               He contends that his offer to pay\n\n$14,000 for the watch does not establish its market value because\n\nhe never actually intended to pay anything for it.                   Moreover, he\n\ncontends that in this case both parties were bargaining in bad\n\nfaith.    According to Burdi, the government never contradicted his\n\nconsistent assertion that Zorn actually double-crossed him by\n\nsending     him   a   watch    that    was    worth    substantially    less   than\n\n$14,000.5\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      Burdi told the presentence investigator that the watch was\nonly worth $300.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f          “We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and\n\ntheir subsidiary findings of fact for clear error.”         United States\n\nv. Cheal, 389 F.3d 35, 48 (1st Cir. 2004).               To the extent an\n\nappellant's challenge concerns an alleged error of law, our review\n\nis de novo.   Id.\n\n          The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), which made\n\nrestitution mandatory for the victims of certain crimes, including\n\nmail fraud, provides that, if return of the lost property itself is\n\nimpossible, impracticable, or inadequate, the defendant must pay\n\n“an amount equal to . . . the greater of . . . the value of the\n\nproperty on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or . . .\n\nthe value of the property on the date of sentencing.”         18 U.S.C. §\n\n3663A(b)(1)(B).     In calculating the restitution amount, absolute\n\nprecision is not required.        See United States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d\n\n579, 587 (1st Cir. 1997) (requiring only a “modicum of reliable\n\nevidence” in fixing the amount of restitution due).6\n\n          The watch being unavailable at the time of sentencing,\n\nthe district court's obligation was to attempt to come to a\n\n“reasonable determination of appropriate restitution by resolving\n\nuncertainties   with   a   view    towards   achieving   fairness   to   the\n\n\n     6\n      Although Vaknin dealt with a different statute, the Victim\nand Witness Protection Act (VWPA), 18 U.S.C. § 3663, the language\nin the VWPA concerning the calculation of the restitution amount is\nidentical to that in the MVRA. Therefore, it is “appropriate for\nus to turn to Vaknin for guidance.” United States v. Cutter, 313\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002) (consulting Vaknin in interpreting the\ncausation element of the MVRA).\n\n                                    -10-\n\fvictim.”     Id. (quotation omitted).           The government provided some\n\nevidence of the value of the watch by establishing, through Burdi's\n\nown    admission,   that     he   had   offered    to   pay   $14,000   for   it.\n\nOrdinarily, the agreed upon sales price would be probative in\n\nestablishing actual value, and Burdi does not suggest that $14,000\n\nwould have been an unreasonable price had the watch he received\n\nbeen authentic.     See United States v. Kayne, 90 F.3d 7, 11-12 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).      Despite Burdi's bad faith bargaining, the district\n\ncourt could have permissibly inferred that Burdi, in attempting to\n\nportray the legitimacy of his offer, proposed an amount within a\n\nreasonable range of the actual value of a genuine watch of the kind\n\nbargained for.\n\n            The government's evidence of the watch's value was enough\n\nat least to require Burdi to counter it with probative evidence of\n\nhis own.     Cf. United States v. Voigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1092-93 (3d\n\nCir. 1996) (in a non-mandatory restitution case, where one factor\n\nin ordering restitution is the defendant's ability to pay, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in shifting the burden\n\nto    the   defendant   to   disprove     his    ability   to   pay   after   the\n\nprosecution established the amount of the loss).                  Burdi's only\n\nevidence in rebuttal was his own self-serving testimony that the\n\nwatch he actually received was worth substantially less than\n\n$14,000.     Given Burdi's extensive history of fraud and deception,\n\nthe court was entitled to accord his testimony little or no weight.\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fIn short, the court's order of restitution was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons we affirm the sentence and the\n\norder of restitution.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

Burdi's long and well-documented criminal history, mostly involving thefts and fraudulent transactions similar to the one in the present case, resulted in a Criminal History Category of VI and a sentencing range of 21 to 27 months. Due to the extensive nature of Burdi's criminal history, the court sua sponte considered an upward departure, but ultimately decided against it. The court also denied Burdi's request for a downward departure, advanced under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 on the ground that he had already been substantially punished for the offense conduct by serving time for the California conviction. The court sentenced Burdi to 27 months' imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay restitution to Zorn in the amount of $14,000. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi raises four issues on appeal: (1) whether his case should be remanded for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (2) whether the district court's refusal to grant a downward departure was clearly erroneous; (3) whether the court erred by failing to grant a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility; and (4) whether there was insufficient evidence to support the court's award of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi's first two arguments are largely premised on his contention that he has already been substantially punished for the crime at issue. He contends that when he pleaded guilty in the California proceeding, he essentially accepted responsibility for, and was punished for, the same course of conduct (i.e., the scheme involving the use of counterfeit checks to purchase items listed on auction web sites) for which he is now incarcerated. Although he admits that the California indictment did not charge the fraudulent Zorn transaction, Burdi argues that it is highly unlikely that he would have received a longer sentence in California had that transaction been charged. More likely, he argues, he still would have pleaded guilty to the same single count and the Zorn transaction would have been dismissed at sentencing along with the eight other counts that were dismissed. Burdi argues that the district court erred, not only in its refusal to mitigate his sentence based on his California time served, but also in its use of the California conviction to enhance his criminal history under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his invocation of <i>Booker,</i> Burdi asserts that, due to the interrelationship of this case with the California proceeding, as well as his efforts to cooperate with the government and to seek treatment and rehabilitation for his mental health problems, there is a reasonable probability that, under the now advisory guidelines, the district court would sentence him more leniently. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005). Because Burdi did not preserve his <i>Booker</i> challenge below, we review for plain error. <i>See id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Under this standard, we will grant a remand only if we find (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and that not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi's argument falters on the third prong of the test. To establish that the error affected his substantial rights, Burdi must show a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence on remand. <i>Id.</i> at 75. Although we are not \"overly demanding as to proof of [such a] probability,\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005), we find nothing in the record to indicate that the court would sentence more leniently under advisory guidelines. If anything, given the comments of the court at sentencing, Burdi might well receive a <i>longer</i> sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Also telling is the court's exercise of discretion to sentence Burdi at the top of the applicable Guideline range. <i>See United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir.2005) (that the court sentenced defendant in the middle of the guideline range, rather than at the bottom, \"speaks volumes\"); <i>United States v. Brennick,</i> 405 F.3d 96, 101-02 (1st Cir.2005) (no reasonable probability for a more lenient sentence where the court sentenced at the high end of the range and indicated that it would have sentenced higher if it had the authority to do so).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi alternatively argues that, even in a pre-<i>Booker</i> regime, the district court committed clear error in refusing to grant a downward departure to account for the time Burdi already served in California for the same course of conduct. Although this court possesses jurisdiction to review \"a refusal to depart where the refusal rests upon a <i>legal</i> mistake, such as a mistaken assumption that a particular ground is generically impermissible as a basis for departure,\" we lack jurisdiction to review \"a discretionary decision not to depart on the facts of the particular case.\" <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 327 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court's decision not to depart was discretionary, and entailed no mistake of law. The court acknowledged Burdi's argument concerning the interrelationship between the present crime and the criminal conduct punished in the California proceeding, but nevertheless determined that \"even if I were to set aside [the California] conviction, the criminal history points here are still abundantly large enough to encompass the sentence that's being imposed....\" Moreover, the court concluded that \"the need to protect society and the deterrence goals are sufficiently strong here to justify the guideline sentencing range and to counsel against any downward departure.\" Given the facts of the case and Burdi's \"dramatic\" criminal history, the court viewed Burdi as a threat to society and sentenced him accordingly. We are not empowered to review the court's discretionary refusal to depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi's third contention is that the court's denial of a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v. McLaughlin,</i> 378 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that the \"inquiry into whether a defendant has accepted responsibility is typically a fact-dominated enterprise, and we ordinarily review the sentencing court's determination of such an issue for clear error\"). Burdi emphasizes the fact that he has been cooperative since being caught: he pleaded guilty in both the California proceeding and in the present case, he met with the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office to describe the events surrounding the offenses in these cases, he identified his associate in the fraudulent scheme and offered to testify against him, and in his allocution he was contrite and acknowledged that he has deep psychological problems that require medication and counseling. Burdi claims that the violations of his conditions of release resulted from a psychological condition over which he had no control at the time, but for which he is now seeking help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi bore the burden of establishing his entitlement to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a). <i>See McLaughlin,</i> 378 F.3d at 39. In determining whether a defendant qualifies for such a reduction, the sentencing court may consider whether the defendant has voluntarily terminated or withdrawn from criminal activity. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 cmmt. n. 1(b). Moreover,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]t follows that when a defendant commits new offenses after having been charged and those offenses reflect adversely on the sincerity of the defendant's avowed contrition, the sentencing court may treat the commission of those offenses as an indication that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for the original crime.... In such circumstances, a sentencing court lawfully may `decline to award a reduction for acceptance of responsibility <i>on that ground alone.'</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>McLaughlin,</i> 378 F.3d at 38 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>United States v. Carrington,</i> 96 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Burdi may have taken some positive steps toward accepting his responsibility for his crime, the district court quite reasonably concluded that Burdi's post-plea criminal conduct made an adjustment unwarranted. There was no clear error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi's final argument is that the district court erroneously ordered restitution because the $14,000 loss amount was not supported by reliable evidence. Burdi argues that a restitution award must be based on the amount of loss actually caused by the offense conduct. He contends that his offer to pay $14,000 for the watch does not establish its market value because he never actually intended to pay <i>anything</i> for it. Moreover, he contends that in this case both parties were bargaining in bad faith. According to Burdi, the government never contradicted his consistent assertion that Zorn actually double-crossed him by sending him a watch that was worth substantially less than $14,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and their subsidiary findings of fact for clear error.\" <i>United States v. Cheal,</i> 389 F.3d 35, 48 (1st Cir.2004). To the extent an appellant's challenge concerns an alleged error of law, our review is de novo. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), which made restitution mandatory for the victims of certain crimes, including mail fraud, provides that, if return of the lost property itself is impossible, impracticable, or inadequate, the defendant must pay \"an amount equal to ... the greater of ... the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or ... the value of the property on the date of sentencing.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(b)(1)(B). In calculating the restitution amount, absolute precision is not required. <i>See United States v. Vaknin,</i> 112 F.3d 579, 587 (1st Cir.1997) (requiring only a \"modicum of reliable evidence\" in fixing the amount of restitution due).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The watch being unavailable at the time of sentencing, the district court's obligation was to attempt to come to a \"reasonable determination of appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties with a view towards achieving fairness to the victim.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation omitted). The government provided some evidence of the value of the watch by establishing, through Burdi's own admission, that he had offered to pay $14,000 for it. Ordinarily, the agreed upon sales price would be probative in establishing actual value, and Burdi does not suggest that $14,000 would have been an unreasonable price had the watch he received been authentic. <i>See United States v. Kayne,</i> 90 F.3d 7, 11-12 (1st Cir.1996). Despite Burdi's bad faith bargaining, the district court could have permissibly inferred that Burdi, in attempting to portray the legitimacy of his offer, proposed an amount within a reasonable range of the actual value of a genuine watch of the kind bargained for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence of the watch's value was enough at least to require Burdi to counter it with probative evidence of his own. <i>Cf. United States v. Voigt,</i> 89 F.3d 1050, 1092-93 (3d Cir.1996) (in a non-mandatory restitution case, where one factor in ordering restitution is the defendant's ability to pay, the district court did not abuse its discretion in shifting the burden to the defendant to disprove his ability to pay after the prosecution established the amount of the loss). Burdi's only evidence in rebuttal was his own self-serving testimony that the watch he actually received was worth substantially less than $14,000. Given Burdi's extensive history of fraud and deception, the court was entitled to accord his testimony little or no weight. In short, the court's order of restitution was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons we <i>affirm</i> the sentence and the order of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to Burdi, California authorities failed to uncover the Zorn transaction because Burdi had used a different courier for that particular transaction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court used the 1999 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual.

Brennick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201556\"><a href=\"/opinion/201556/united-states-v-brennick/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 101-02 (1st Cir.2005) (no reasonable probability for a more lenient sentence where the court sentenced at the high end of the range and indicated that it would have sentenced higher if it had the authority to do so).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi alternatively argues that, even in a pre-<i>Booker</i> regime, the district court committed clear error in refusing to grant a downward departure to account for the time Burdi already served in California for the same course of conduct. Although this court possesses jurisdiction to review \"a refusal to depart where the refusal rests upon a <i>legal</i> mistake, such as a mistaken assumption that a particular ground is generically impermissible as a basis for departure,\" we lack jurisdiction to review \"a discretionary decision not to depart on the facts of the particular case.\" <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200449\"><a href=\"/opinion/200449/united-states-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court's decision not to depart was discretionary, and entailed no mistake of law. The court acknowledged Burdi's argument concerning the interrelationship between the present crime and the criminal conduct punished in the California proceeding, but nevertheless determined that \"even if I were to set aside [the California] conviction, the criminal history points here are still abundantly large enough to encompass the sentence that's being imposed....\" Moreover, the court concluded that \"the need to protect society and the deterrence goals are sufficiently strong here to justify the guideline sentencing range and to counsel against any downward departure.\" Given the facts of the case and Burdi's \"dramatic\" criminal history, the court viewed Burdi as a threat to society and sentenced him accordingly. We are not empowered to review the court's discretionary refusal to depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi's third contention is that the court's denial of a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v. McLaughlin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201176\"><a href=\"/opinion/201176/united-states-v-mclaughlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that the \"inquiry into whether a defendant has accepted responsibility is typically a fact-dominated enterprise, and we ordinarily review the sentencing court's determination of such an issue for clear error\"). Burdi emphasizes the fact that he has been cooperative since being caught: he pleaded guilty in both the California proceeding and in the present case, he met with the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office to describe the events surrounding the offenses in these cases, he identified his associate in the fraudulent scheme and offered to testify against him, and in his allocution he was contrite and acknowledged that he has deep psychological problems that require medication and counseling. Burdi claims that the violations of his conditions of release resulted from a psychological condition over which he had no control at the time, but for which he is now seeking help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi bore the burden of establishing his entitlement to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a). <i>See McLaughlin,</i> 378 F.3d at 39. In determining whether a defendant qualifies for such a reduction, the sentencing court may consider whether the defendant has voluntarily terminated or withdrawn from criminal activity. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 cmmt. n. 1(b). Moreover,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]t follows that when a defendant commits new offenses after having been charged and those offenses reflect adversely on the sincerity of the defendant's avowed contrition, the sentencing court may treat the commission of those offenses as an indication that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for the original crime.... In such circumstances, a sentencing court lawfully may `decline to award a reduction for acceptance of responsibility <i>on that ground alone.'</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>McLaughlin,</i> 378 F.3d at 38 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>United States v. Carrington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196983\"><a href=\"/opinion/196983/united-states-v-carrington/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Burdi may have taken some positive steps toward accepting his responsibility for his crime, the district court quite reasonably concluded that Burdi's post-plea criminal conduct made an adjustment unwarranted. There was no clear error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burdi's final argument is that the district court erroneously ordered restitution because the $14,000 loss amount was not supported by reliable evidence. Burdi argues that a restitution award must be based on the amount of loss actually caused by the offense conduct. He contends that his offer to pay $14,000 for the watch does not establish its market value because he never actually intended to pay <i>anything</i> for it. Moreover, he contends that in this case both parties were bargaining in bad faith. According to Burdi, the government never contradicted his consistent assertion that Zorn actually double-crossed him by sending him a watch that was worth substantially less than $14,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and their subsidiary findings of fact for clear error.\" <i>United States v.

To the extent an appellant's challenge concerns an alleged error of law, our review is de novo. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), which made restitution mandatory for the victims of certain crimes, including mail fraud, provides that, if return of the lost property itself is impossible, impracticable, or inadequate, the defendant must pay \"an amount equal to ... the greater of ... the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or ... the value of the property on the date of sentencing.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(b)(1)(B). In calculating the restitution amount, absolute precision is not required. <i>See United States v. Vaknin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197346\"><a href=\"/opinion/197346/united-states-v-vaknin/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 587 (1st Cir.1997) (requiring only a \"modicum of reliable evidence\" in fixing the amount of restitution due).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The watch being unavailable at the time of sentencing, the district court's obligation was to attempt to come to a \"reasonable determination of appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties with a view towards achieving fairness to the victim.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation omitted). The government provided some evidence of the value of the watch by establishing, through Burdi's own admission, that he had offered to pay $14,000 for it. Ordinarily, the agreed upon sales price would be probative in establishing actual value, and Burdi does not suggest that $14,000 would have been an unreasonable price had the watch he received been authentic. <i>See United States v. Kayne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196888\"><a href=\"/opinion/196888/united-states-v-kayne/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11-12 (1st Cir.1996). Despite Burdi's bad faith bargaining, the district court could have permissibly inferred that Burdi, in attempting to portray the legitimacy of his offer, proposed an amount within a reasonable range of the actual value of a genuine watch of the kind bargained for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence of the watch's value was enough at least to require Burdi to counter it with probative evidence of his own. <i>Cf. United States v. Voigt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722380\"><a href=\"/opinion/722380/united-states-v-john-voigt/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span>, 1092-93 (3d Cir.1996) (in a non-mandatory restitution case, where one factor in ordering restitution is the defendant's ability to pay, the district court did not abuse its discretion in shifting the burden to the defendant to disprove his ability to pay after the prosecution established the amount of the loss). Burdi's only evidence in rebuttal was his own self-serving testimony that the watch he actually received was worth substantially less than $14,000. Given Burdi's extensive history of fraud and deception, the court was entitled to accord his testimony little or no weight. In short, the court's order of restitution was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons we <i>affirm</i> the sentence and the order of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to Burdi, California authorities failed to uncover the Zorn transaction because Burdi had used a different courier for that particular transaction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court used the 1999 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual.
