William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Stahl and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Seth H. Salinger for appellant.\n     Thomas W. Evans, with whom Zelle McDonough & Cohen LLP, was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 24, 2010\n\f          HOWARD, Circuit Judge.          This case comes to us following\n\nthe entry of default judgment against the defendant-appellant, Big\n\nImpressions, LLC.     On appeal, Big Impressions challenges, inter\n\nalia, the district court's denial of its motion to set aside an\n\nentry of default.     For the reasons that follow, we vacate the\n\ndecision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          The seeds of this dispute were sown in 2005.            That year,\n\nBig Impressions, a printing company incorporated in Arkansas,\n\npurchased an Indigo printing press (\"Indigo Press\") from the\n\nplaintiff-appellee, Indigo America, Inc. (\"Indigo\"). In connection\n\nwith this purchase, Big Impressions entered into two contracts with\n\nIndigo.   One of these contracts, titled the \"Purchase and Sale\n\nAgreement,\"    required    Big   Impressions   to   trade   in   two   of   its\n\ncommercial presses as part of the purchase price.\n\n          In June 2007, Indigo filed a breach of contract action\n\nagainst Big Impressions in federal district court in Massachusetts.\n\nIndigo claimed that Big Impressions violated the contracts at issue\n\nby, among other things, not making two of its commercial presses\n\navailable for pick up.           In due course, process was served in\n\nArkansas on Scott Wallace, the manager and sole member of Big\n\nImpressions.\n\n          Wallace,    in    August    2007,    filed   an   answer     to   the\n\ncomplaint, purportedly on behalf of the corporation.             This filing,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fhowever, contravened the long-standing rule barring persons who are\n\nnot licensed to practice law from representing corporations in\n\njudicial proceedings.   In re Las Colinas Dev. Corp., 585 F.2d 7, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 1978).   Although Wallace did not purport to be a member\n\nof the bar, the court nevertheless accepted and docketed the\n\nanswer, and the case proceeded unhindered.\n\n          Over the course of the next eight months, Big Impressions\n\nand Indigo engaged in settlement negotiations under the aegis of\n\nthe district court's settlement program.       Ultimately, however,\n\nthese negotiations failed to bear fruit and, in May 2008, Indigo\n\nrequested that the court default Big Impressions. The basis of its\n\nrequest was simple:     a licensed attorney had yet to appear on\n\nbehalf of Big Impressions.     On that basis, the clerk of court\n\nentered default against Big Impressions.\n\n          Cross-motions ensued.    Indigo filed a motion for default\n\njudgment, and Big Impressions, after securing local counsel, filed\n\na motion to set aside the entry of default.      In support of its\n\nmotion, Big Impressions provided a memorandum of law, a restated\n\nanswer, and an affidavit from Wallace.     Through these materials,\n\nBig Impressions asserted various defenses to Indigo's breach of\n\ncontract claims.\n\n          Unswayed by Big Impressions' showing, the district court\n\ndenied its motion and granted Indigo's request for a default\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fjudgment. The district court did not issue a memorandum of opinion\n\nexplaining its rulings.     Big Impressions appealed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Big Impressions challenges both the court's denial of its\n\nmotion to set aside the entry of default and the entry of a default\n\njudgment.    Different standards exist for setting aside an entry of\n\ndefault   and   for   setting   aside   a   default   judgment.      Venegas-\n\nHernandez v. Sonolux Records, 370 F.3d 183, 187 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nWe need address only the standard for entry of default to decide\n\nthis case.      See Coon v. Grenier, 867 F.2d 73, 75 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (\"We deal only with the failure to set aside the entry of\n\ndefault, for it constituted the error in this case.               Plaintiff's\n\nremonstrances anent the ensuing default judgment, and the manner in\n\nwhich it was wrought, need not be addressed.\").\n\n            Rule 55(c) provides that a court may set aside an entry\n\nof default for \"good cause.\"       Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c).         There is no\n\nmechanical formula for determining whether good cause exists and\n\ncourts may consider a host of relevant factors.          See KPS & Assocs.\n\nv. Designs by FMC, Inc., 318 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2003).            The three\n\ntypically considered are (1) whether the default was willful; (2)\n\nwhether setting it aside would prejudice the adversary; and (3)\n\nwhether a meritorious defense is presented. Id.; Coon, 867 F.2d at\n\n77 (noting that these three factors \"comprise the indicia employed\n\nby most courts\").     But that is not an exclusive list and courts may\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fconsider other relevant factors, including \"'(4) the nature of the\n\ndefendant's explanation for the default; (5) the good faith of the\n\nparties; (6) the amount of money involved; (7) the timing of the\n\nmotion [to set aside the entry of default].'\"    KPS & Assocs., 318\n\nF.3d at 12 (quoting McKinnon v. Kwong Wah Restaurant, 83 F.3d 498,\n\n503 (1st Cir. 1996)). Ultimately, the burden of demonstrating good\n\ncause lies with the party seeking to set aside the default.     Id.\n\n          Our review of a district court's good cause ruling is\n\ndeferential.   We review the court's factual findings, if there are\n\nany, for clear error, Venegas-Hernandez, 370 F.3d at 187, and its\n\nbalancing of the relevant factors for an abuse of discretion.    See\n\nConetta v. Nat'l Hair Care Ctrs., Inc., 236 F.3d 67, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); Coon, 867 F.2d at 78.   Here, however, we are presented with\n\nlittle to review.    The district court did not explain its decision\n\nor, from all that appears, make any factual findings.   Without the\n\nbenefit of the court's views, we proceed to examine the relevant\n\nfactors ourselves.     See Coon, 867 F.2d at 76-78 (analyzing the\n\nfactors where there was a paucity of findings to review).\n\n          There seems to be no dispute that two of the factors cut\n\nin favor of Big Impressions.       When the clerk entered default\n\nagainst it, Big Impressions promptly filed a motion to set aside\n\nthe default.   And Big Impressions argues, without objection from\n\nIndigo, that the amount of money at stake -- approximately $173,000\n\n-- is a significant sum given its economic situation.       A third\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffactor, the good faith of the parties, appears to be in equipoise,\n\nas neither party alleges that the other acted in bad faith.\n\nTurning to the other four factors often used, they are the subject\n\nof controversy here, and we examine them in turn.\n\n          Big Impressions claims that its default was not willful.\n\nIt asserts that its principal, Wallace, believed that he had acted\n\nappropriately when he filed an answer on behalf of Big Impressions.\n\nAccording to Big Impressions, Wallace was simply unaware of the\n\nrule barring a person who is not licensed to practice law from\n\nrepresenting a corporation in court.   This claim finds support in\n\nthe record. Wallace attested to his ignorance of the relevant rule\n\nin an affidavit.\n\n          For its part, Indigo argues that Wallace's claim of\n\nignorance lacks credibility. Citing to Wallace's affidavit, Indigo\n\ncontends that Wallace \"admit[ted] that he received extensive legal\n\nadvice about this matter from his Arkansas counsel.\" The affidavit\n\ndoes not support Indigo's argument, however.        It addresses an\n\nentirely unrelated matter -- meetings Wallace and his attorney had\n\nwith Indigo representatives in 2005 concerning the purchase of the\n\nIndigo Press.\n\n          Turning to the prejudice factor, we conclude that it too\n\ncuts in favor of Big Impressions.    Simply put, we fail to see how\n\nIndigo will be prejudiced if the default is set aside.   To be sure,\n\nIndigo claims that it will be prejudiced, noting that setting aside\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fthe default would further postpone a judgment in its favor.        But,\n\nas we have noted in the past, \"in the context of a Rule 55(c)\n\nmotion, delay in and of itself does not constitute prejudice.\" KPS\n\n& Assocs., 318 F.3d at 15; see also FDIC v. Francisco Inv. Corp.,\n\n873 F.2d 474, 479 (1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that \"[t]he issue is\n\nnot mere delay, but rather its accompanying dangers:            loss of\n\nevidence, increased difficulties of discovery, or an enhanced\n\nopportunity for fraud or collusion.\").\n\n           At the risk of lingering too long on this point, we note\n\nfurther   that   Indigo's   delay-based   prejudice   argument    falls\n\nparticularly flat here because it easily could have prevented the\n\ndelay.    Indigo could have moved to strike the answer or for a\n\ndefault judgment twenty days after Wallace was served with process,\n\nas the answer he filed, though docketed, was impermissible.         See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12 (providing that a defendant must serve an answer\n\nwithin 20 days after being served with the summons or complaint).\n\nInstead, Indigo waited over eight months before requesting that the\n\ncourt default Big Impressions, even engaging Big Impressions in\n\nsettlement negotiations during this time span.        Although no bad\n\nfaith is suggested in Indigo's delay in seeking an entry of default\n\nhere, finding prejudice under these circumstances could have the\n\nunfortunate   consequence   of   incentivizing   parties   to    ambush\n\nopponents on the basis of self-induced prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          The next factor to be considered -- the existence (or\n\nlack thereof) of a meritorious defense -- has obvious significance\n\nin the analysis.   Where no meritorious defense exists, it makes\n\nlittle sense to set aside the entry of default, as doing so would\n\nmerely delay the inevitable.    Here, Big Impressions argues that\n\nIndigo's victory in the breach of contract action is by no means\n\nforeordained and says that it asserted several meritorious defenses\n\nbelow, including the defenses of \"prior breach of contract\" and\n\n\"failure of consideration.\"     It also contends that Wallace's\n\naffidavit, submitted in support of its motion to set aside the\n\ndefault, sets forth allegations that could support other defenses\n\nincluding \"fraud in the inducement.\"\n\n          Establishing the existence of a meritorious defense is\n\nnot a particularly arduous task.   \"[A] party's averments need only\n\nplausibly suggest the existence of facts which, if proven at trial,\n\nwould constitute a cognizable defense.\"    Coon, 867 F.2d at 77; see\n\nalso Conetta, 236 F.3d at 75 (noting, in discussing the meritorious\n\ndefense requirement, that the defendant had an \"arguable defense on\n\nsome aspects of the claims against it\").\n\n          Here, Big Impressions has met its burden.   In support of\n\nits \"prior breach\" and \"failure of consideration\" claims, Big\n\nImpressions submitted an affidavit in which Wallace attested that\n\nthe Indigo Press did not perform as warranted.      Although Indigo\n\ncharacterizes Wallace's testimony as lacking \"evidentiary support,\"\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fit is sufficient given that the litigation is in a pre-discovery\n\nstage.1   Moreover, Big Impressions' fraud in the inducement2 claim\n\nappears to be at least colorable. Wallace attested that throughout\n\nthe negotiation process, Indigo employees (1) represented to him\n\nthat he was only required to trade in one of his company's two\n\npresses in connection with his purchase of the Indigo Press and (2)\n\npresented him with drafts of the Purchase and Sale Agreement that\n\nreflected these representations. According to Wallace, Indigo then\n\npresented him with a Purchase and Sale Agreement that required him\n\nto trade in both presses and hurried him into signing it.    While\n\nIndigo asserts that the parol evidence rule bars consideration of\n\nWallace's various dealings with Indigo, it is well-established in\n\nMassachusetts that \"'[t]he parol evidence rule does not apply when\n\n\n     1\n       Indigo also says that Wallace's claim that the Indigo Press\ndid not perform as warranted is \"belated\" because he failed to make\nthis specific claim in the answer that he filed. Wallace's answer,\nhowever, denied the allegations of breach set forth in Indigo's\ncomplaint. No more was needed at the pleading stage. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 8(b)(1)(B)(providing that a party must \"admit or deny the\nallegations asserted against it by an opposing party\"); see also 5\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 1268 (3d. ed. 1998) (noting, in discussing\n\"argumentative denials,\" that \"practitioners would be wise to limit\nthemselves to simple denials, rather than adding additional facts\nby responding indirectly rather than directly\").\n     2\n        To establish fraud in the inducement at trial, Big\nImpressions would need to prove \"the elements of common law deceit\nwhich include 'misrepresentation of a material fact, made to induce\naction, and reasonable reliance on the false statement to the\ndetriment of the person relying.'\" Commerce Bank & Trust Co. v.\nHayeck, 709 N.E.2d 1122, 1127 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999) (quoting Hogan\nv. Riemer, 619 N.E.2d 984, 988 (Mass. App. Ct. 1993) (internal\ncitation omitted))).\n\n                                -9-\n\fthe complaining party alleges fraud in the inducement.'\"           Id.\n\n(quoting McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Norton Co., 563 N.E.2d 188,\n\n193 n.5 (Mass. 1990)).\n\n          The final factor to be considered is the nature of the\n\ndefendant's explanation for the default.      We again note that for\n\nseveral months neither Indigo nor the district court gave any\n\nindication that something was amiss; the answer had been docketed\n\nand the case was steered to the settlement program.      Nevertheless,\n\nWallace set the default in motion when he failed to apprise himself\n\nof the rule at issue.    His explanation is plausible but not strong.\n\nSee United States v. $23,000 in U.S. Currency, 356 F.3d 157, 164\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (recognizing, in the default judgment context, that\n\n\"ignorance of the rules . . . do[es] not usually constitute\n\nexcusable neglect\") (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover,\n\nwe also note that Arkansas, the state where Wallace's company is\n\nincorporated,   permits    only   licensed   attorneys   to   represent\n\ncorporations in court.     McAdams v. Pulaski County Circuit Court,\n\n956 S.W.2d 869, 870 (Ark. 1997).\n\n          Having considered the relevant factors, we are left with\n\nthe question of whether the district court abused its discretion in\n\nrefusing to set aside the default.       Because district courts are\n\nbetter positioned to evaluate many of the relevant factors, we are\n\nordinarily reluctant to disturb their good cause rulings on appeal.\n\nPayne v. Brake, 439 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir. 2006) (\"The disposition\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fof motions made under Rule[]55(c) . . . is a matter which lies\n\nlargely within the discretion of the trial judge and his action is\n\nnot lightly to be disturbed by an appellate court.\") (citation\n\nomitted); see also KPS & Assocs., 318 F.3d at 12-13.          Here,\n\nhowever, there is little reason to defer to the district court's\n\nruling.   The district court did not explain why it denied Big\n\nImpressions' motion to set aside the default, making it difficult\n\nto tell what motivated the court's decision. Although this lack of\n\nan explanation may have been inconsequential had the court's ruling\n\nbeen amply supported by the record, that simply is not the case\n\nhere.   Under circumstances such as these, and given our preference\n\nfor resolving disputes on the merits, Conetta, 236 F.3d at 75, we\n\nconclude that this case should proceed further.\n\n                          III.   Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons provided above, the case is remanded with\n\ndirections to vacate the default judgment, remove the default, and\n\npermit the action to proceed in the normal course.\n\n\n\nVacated and remanded.   No costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f",

We review the court's factual findings, if there are\n\nany, for clear error, Venegas-Hernandez, 370 F.3d at 187, and its\n\nbalancing of the relevant factors for an abuse of discretion.

Here, however, we are presented with\n\nlittle to review.    The district court did not explain its decision\n\nor, from all that appears, make any factual findings.   Without the\n\nbenefit of the court's views, we proceed to examine the relevant\n\nfactors ourselves.     See Coon, 867 F.2d at 76-78 (analyzing the\n\nfactors where there was a paucity of findings to review).\n\n          There seems to be no dispute that two of the factors cut\n\nin favor of Big Impressions.       When the clerk entered default\n\nagainst it, Big Impressions promptly filed a motion to set aside\n\nthe default.   And Big Impressions argues, without objection from\n\nIndigo, that the amount of money at stake -- approximately $173,000\n\n-- is a significant sum given its economic situation.       A third\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffactor, the good faith of the parties, appears to be in equipoise,\n\nas neither party alleges that the other acted in bad faith.\n\nTurning to the other four factors often used, they are the subject\n\nof controversy here, and we examine them in turn.\n\n          Big Impressions claims that its default was not willful.\n\nIt asserts that its principal, Wallace, believed that he had acted\n\nappropriately when he filed an answer on behalf of Big Impressions.\n\nAccording to Big Impressions, Wallace was simply unaware of the\n\nrule barring a person who is not licensed to practice law from\n\nrepresenting a corporation in court.   This claim finds support in\n\nthe record. Wallace attested to his ignorance of the relevant rule\n\nin an affidavit.\n\n          For its part, Indigo argues that Wallace's claim of\n\nignorance lacks credibility. Citing to Wallace's affidavit, Indigo\n\ncontends that Wallace \"admit[ted] that he received extensive legal\n\nadvice about this matter from his Arkansas counsel.\" The affidavit\n\ndoes not support Indigo's argument, however.        It addresses an\n\nentirely unrelated matter -- meetings Wallace and his attorney had\n\nwith Indigo representatives in 2005 concerning the purchase of the\n\nIndigo Press.\n\n          Turning to the prejudice factor, we conclude that it too\n\ncuts in favor of Big Impressions.    Simply put, we fail to see how\n\nIndigo will be prejudiced if the default is set aside.   To be sure,\n\nIndigo claims that it will be prejudiced, noting that setting aside\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fthe default would further postpone a judgment in its favor.        But,\n\nas we have noted in the past, \"in the context of a Rule 55(c)\n\nmotion, delay in and of itself does not constitute prejudice.\" KPS\n\n& Assocs., 318 F.3d at 15; see also FDIC v.

Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522151\"><a href=\"/opinion/522151/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-etc-v-francisco-investment/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 479 (1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that \"[t]he issue is\n\nnot mere delay, but rather its accompanying dangers:            loss of\n\nevidence, increased difficulties of discovery, or an enhanced\n\nopportunity for fraud or collusion.\").\n\n           At the risk of lingering too long on this point, we note\n\nfurther   that   Indigo's   delay-based   prejudice   argument    falls\n\nparticularly flat here because it easily could have prevented the\n\ndelay.    Indigo could have moved to strike the answer or for a\n\ndefault judgment twenty days after Wallace was served with process,\n\nas the answer he filed, though docketed, was impermissible.         See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12 (providing that a defendant must serve an answer\n\nwithin 20 days after being served with the summons or complaint).\n\nInstead, Indigo waited over eight months before requesting that the\n\ncourt default Big Impressions, even engaging Big Impressions in\n\nsettlement negotiations during this time span.        Although no bad\n\nfaith is suggested in Indigo's delay in seeking an entry of default\n\nhere, finding prejudice under these circumstances could have the\n\nunfortunate   consequence   of   incentivizing   parties   to    ambush\n\nopponents on the basis of self-induced prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          The next factor to be considered -- the existence (or\n\nlack thereof) of a meritorious defense -- has obvious significance\n\nin the analysis.   Where no meritorious defense exists, it makes\n\nlittle sense to set aside the entry of default, as doing so would\n\nmerely delay the inevitable.    Here, Big Impressions argues that\n\nIndigo's victory in the breach of contract action is by no means\n\nforeordained and says that it asserted several meritorious defenses\n\nbelow, including the defenses of \"prior breach of contract\" and\n\n\"failure of consideration.\"     It also contends that Wallace's\n\naffidavit, submitted in support of its motion to set aside the\n\ndefault, sets forth allegations that could support other defenses\n\nincluding \"fraud in the inducement.\"\n\n          Establishing the existence of a meritorious defense is\n\nnot a particularly arduous task.   \"[A] party's averments need only\n\nplausibly suggest the existence of facts which, if proven at trial,\n\nwould constitute a cognizable defense.\"    Coon, 867 F.2d at 77; see\n\nalso Conetta, 236 F.3d at 75 (noting, in discussing the meritorious\n\ndefense requirement, that the defendant had an \"arguable defense on\n\nsome aspects of the claims against it\").\n\n          Here, Big Impressions has met its burden.   In support of\n\nits \"prior breach\" and \"failure of consideration\" claims, Big\n\nImpressions submitted an affidavit in which Wallace attested that\n\nthe Indigo Press did not perform as warranted.      Although Indigo\n\ncharacterizes Wallace's testimony as lacking \"evidentiary support,\"\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fit is sufficient given that the litigation is in a pre-discovery\n\nstage.1   Moreover, Big Impressions' fraud in the inducement2 claim\n\nappears to be at least colorable. Wallace attested that throughout\n\nthe negotiation process, Indigo employees (1) represented to him\n\nthat he was only required to trade in one of his company's two\n\npresses in connection with his purchase of the Indigo Press and (2)\n\npresented him with drafts of the Purchase and Sale Agreement that\n\nreflected these representations. According to Wallace, Indigo then\n\npresented him with a Purchase and Sale Agreement that required him\n\nto trade in both presses and hurried him into signing it.    While\n\nIndigo asserts that the parol evidence rule bars consideration of\n\nWallace's various dealings with Indigo, it is well-established in\n\nMassachusetts that \"'[t]he parol evidence rule does not apply when\n\n\n     1\n       Indigo also says that Wallace's claim that the Indigo Press\ndid not perform as warranted is \"belated\" because he failed to make\nthis specific claim in the answer that he filed. Wallace's answer,\nhowever, denied the allegations of breach set forth in Indigo's\ncomplaint. No more was needed at the pleading stage. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 8(b)(1)(B)(providing that a party must \"admit or deny the\nallegations asserted against it by an opposing party\"); see also 5\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H.

We again note that for\n\nseveral months neither Indigo nor the district court gave any\n\nindication that something was amiss; the answer had been docketed\n\nand the case was steered to the settlement program.      Nevertheless,\n\nWallace set the default in motion when he failed to apprise himself\n\nof the rule at issue.

Because district courts are\n\nbetter positioned to evaluate many of the relevant factors, we are\n\nordinarily reluctant to disturb their good cause rulings on appeal.\n\nPayne v.

Here,\n\nhowever, there is little reason to defer to the district court's\n\nruling.   The district court did not explain why it denied Big\n\nImpressions' motion to set aside the default, making it difficult\n\nto tell what motivated the court's decision. Although this lack of\n\nan explanation may have been inconsequential had the court's ruling\n\nbeen amply supported by the record, that simply is not the case\n\nhere.
