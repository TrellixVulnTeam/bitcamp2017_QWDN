Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n             Torruella, Leval,* and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F.

After        pleading      guilty   to\n\nconspiring to possess with intent to distribute significant amounts\n\nof cocaine, crack, and marijuana, Omar Santiago Miranda (Santiago)\n\nmoved    to    withdraw     his   plea.        He   argued       that    his    plea    was\n\ninvoluntary due to his excessive consumption of prescription drugs,\n\nlack    of    sleep,    familial   coercion,        and     a    history    of    bipolar\n\ndisorder.       The district court denied the motion and sentenced\n\nSantiago to 380 months in prison.\n\n              On    appeal,   Santiago     challenges           the   district    court's\n\ndenial of his motion, as well as its decision not to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing before disposing of the motion. The government\n\ncontends that Santiago's appeal is barred by a provision in the\n\nplea agreement waiving his right to appeal.                       In the alternative,\n\nthe government argues that the motion to withdraw was properly\n\ndenied.       We bypass the appellate waiver issue and affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n                                          I.\n\n              The following facts are taken from the unchallenged\n\nportions of the plea agreement, the change-of-plea colloquy, the\n\npresentence investigation report, and the sentencing hearing. See\n\nUnited States v. Isom, 580 F.3d 43, 45 n.2 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nA.   Indictment and Pre-Trial Background\n\n              On September 29, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a\n\nnine-count         second   superseding        indictment         against      twenty-two\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fdefendants.    Santiago was named in two counts: Count Five charged\n\nhim with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five\n\nkilograms or more of cocaine, fifty grams or more of crack, and one\n\nhundred kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1), and Count Seven charged him with knowingly using,\n\ncarrying,   and possessing     a   firearm   in   furtherance   of   a   drug\n\ntrafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) and (2).\n\nB.    Change-of-Plea Hearing\n\n            The trial was scheduled to begin March 6, 2007. Santiago\n\nappeared on that date but, instead of proceeding to trial, informed\n\nthe court that he wished to plead guilty.         The court proceeded with\n\na change-of-plea hearing and received Santiago's plea agreement, in\n\nwhich he pled guilty to Count Five only.              The government and\n\nSantiago agreed that, because he assumed responsibility as an aider\n\nand abettor to a 2004 murder that constituted one of the overt acts\n\nin furtherance of the drug conspiracy, his base offense level was\n\n43.    See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 2D1.1(d)(1), 2A1.1\n\n(2006).   They also agreed that a clear demonstration of acceptance\n\nof responsibility for the conspiracy offense would merit a three-\n\nlevel reduction. Based on the resulting total offense level of 40,\n\nthe parties agreed that they would recommend a 324-month sentence\n\nif Santiago's criminal history category (CHC) was II, and a 360-\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fmonth sentence if his CHC was any higher.1              In addition to listing\n\na number of rights Santiago relinquished by accepting the plea\n\ndeal, the plea agreement stated that he \"hereby agrees that if this\n\nHonorable Court accepts this Plea Agreement and sentences him\n\naccording      to   its   terms   and     conditions,   defendant     waives   and\n\nsurrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this\n\ncase.\"\n\n               At the hearing, the court first considered Santiago's\n\ncompetence to plead, discussing with him his age, his educational\n\nlevel, and his mental state.            Because Santiago's appeal focuses on\n\nthat       mental   state,   we   quote    from   a   portion   of   the   hearing\n\ntranscript at length:\n\n            THE COURT: How do you feel this afternoon?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   I feel fine.\n            THE COURT: Have you taken any drugs, pills, or\n       medicines within the last 24 hours?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   No.\n            THE COURT: Do you realize you're in a courtroom?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   That is correct.\n            THE COURT: You're here to change your plea of not\n       guilty to one of guilty as to Count Five of the\n       indictment.\n            THE DEFENDANT:   That is correct.\n            THE COURT: And do you know what you have been\n       charged with in Count Five?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   That is correct.\n            THE COURT: There is no need for me to read to you\n       charges at this time?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   No.\n            THE COURT: Have you had enough time to consult with\n       your attorney before this afternoon?\n\n\n       1\n       The recommended sentences fell at the bottom of the ranges\nsuggested by the Sentencing Guidelines.       Those ranges were,\nrespectively, 324 to 405 months and 360 months to life.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f            THE DEFENDANT:   That is correct.\n            THE COURT: Are you satisfied with her services up\n      to now?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   Very satisfied.\n            THE COURT: At this time I find the defendant\n      competent to plea.\n            I'm going to continue asking you questions. If you\n      do not understand my questions, you may ask me to repeat\n      them to you. If you have any doubts as to the answers\n      you are to give to my questions, then you may consult\n      with your attorney who is standing next to you. Do you\n      understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   I understand.\n            THE COURT: The reason I'm explaining this to you is\n      because I'm going to place you under oath, and if any of\n      your answers to my questions are untruthful, then you may\n      be subjecting yourself to further charges of perjury or\n      providing false information while under oath which carry\n      additional penalties. Do you understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   I understand.\n      . . .\n      [Santiago was sworn.]\n\nThe court proceeded to inform Santiago of the various rights he\n\nwould surrender by pleading guilty, and Santiago confirmed that he\n\nunderstood and that he still wished to plead guilty.\n\n            With    respect   to   coercion,    the   court   asked   whether\n\n\"anybody threatened you in any way to induce you to plead guilty,\"\n\nand Santiago said, \"No one.\"         The court asked again, \"Is anybody\n\nforcing you in any way to get you to plead guilty?,\" to which\n\nSantiago responded, \"No one.\"            Finally, the court asked whether\n\nanyone had \"made any promises or offered you any things of value to\n\nget you to plead guilty,\" and Santiago again answered, \"No one.\"\n\n            The court then reviewed Santiago's plea agreement in\n\ndetail, explaining to Santiago that the agreement was not binding\n\non   the   court,   that   there   was   no final     stipulation   regarding\n\n                                     -5-\n\fSantiago's CHC, and that Santiago's signature meant that he agreed\n\nthat the facts in it were true and accurate.                   Santiago indicated\n\nhis   understanding     of   each   of    these      points.      The    court   also\n\nexplained the waiver of appeal clause:\n\n           THE COURT: Paragraph 18 refers to the fact that you\n      agree that if this Court accepts the Plea Agreement and\n      sentences you according to its terms and conditions, that\n      you will be in a position to waive and surrender your\n      right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\n      Is that correct?\n           THE DEFENDANT:    Correct.\n           THE COURT: But by the same token, do you understand\n      that if I do not accept the Plea Agreement and I do not\n      sentence you according to the terms and conditions of the\n      Plea Agreement, that then you would not waive and\n      surrender your right to appeal the judgment and sentence\n      in this case. Do you understand?\n           THE DEFENDANT:    I understand.\n\nAfter accepting Santiago's plea, the court scheduled a sentencing\n\nhearing for June 7, 2007.\n\nC.    Presentence Report and Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea\n\n            Following    the   change      of   plea,    the    probation    office\n\nprepared its first draft of Santiago's presentence investigation\n\nreport (PSR).     In addition to describing Count Five and the\n\nunderlying   offense     conduct,    the       PSR   calculated    the    guideline\n\nsentencing range, listed Santiago's prior criminal convictions, and\n\nestablished that his CHC was III.                 The probation officer also\n\ndescribed Santiago's family and community ties, as well as his\n\nphysical condition and drug use.           The officer reported that he had\n\n\"not identified any information that would warrant a departure from\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthe guidelines or a variance in sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a).\"\n\n            Copies of the initial PSR were delivered to Santiago's\n\nattorney on May 3, 2007.      On May 11, 2007, she sent a letter\n\nobjecting to the report's conclusion that no departure or variance\n\nwas warranted.   On May 18, she added an objection that Santiago had\n\nnot admitted responsibility for his involvement in the charged\n\noffense.2   The probation officer included the objections and his\n\nresponses in an addendum, and corrected the PSR to reflect that\n\nSantiago had not accepted responsibility for the crime.   The final\n\nPSR was completed May 23 and filed with the court May 31.\n\n            On May 22, 2007, Santiago filed a motion to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea, arguing that it was involuntary and unknowing due to\n\nhis drug abuse, his bipolar disorder, and coercion by family\n\nmembers to plead guilty.3    Accompanying the motion was Santiago's\n\nstatement under penalty of perjury that, on March 6, his aunt and\n\nher husband were present in court and asked him to accept the plea\n\n\n\n     2\n       Ordinarily, a defendant who pleads guilty seeks a sentence\nreduction for having accepted responsibility for his crime. See\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 3E1.1. Santiago's objection to\nthe PSR's inclusion of such a reduction was thus unusual, and\nforeshadowed his motion, filed six days later, to withdraw his\nplea.\n     3\n       In his motion, Santiago also argued that he had entered his\nplea without knowledge of \"the nature of the crime and . . . the\nconsequences [of pleading guilty].\"     The court rejected these\narguments in its order denying the motion.      Santiago does not\nchallenge that aspect of the order or revive the arguments here.\n\n                                 -7-\n\foffer to avoid the risk of a life sentence.               He also reported that\n\nhe had called his mother that day, who asked that he accept the\n\ndeal.       According to Santiago, he felt \"forced[,] coerced and\n\npressured by the wish of my family that I plead guilty.\"                       The\n\nstatement also said that Santiago had been abusing prescription\n\nmedications at the corrections facility for days leading up to and\n\nincluding March 6, and that he had not slept for several days\n\nbefore March 6.           Santiago reported being confused, anxious, and\n\ndepressed at the change-of-plea hearing, and contended that all of\n\nthese conditions rendered his plea involuntary and unknowing.\n\nFinally, he swore that he was never part of the charged conspiracy.\n\nNot surprisingly, the government opposed Santiago's motion.\n\n             On December 6, 2007, the government asked the court to\n\norder   a    psychiatric       evaluation     of   Santiago   to   determine   his\n\ncompetency to enter a plea of guilty and/or to stand trial.               See 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 4241.          Santiago objected to being moved to a facility in\n\nNorth Carolina for the examination, and requested that he be\n\nallowed to        have    a   separate examination      performed by     his   own\n\nexperts.     The district court ordered that Santiago be taken to a\n\nfacility     in    Florida     or   another    suitable    institution   for   an\n\nevaluation of his competency to stand trial, meaning \"whether he is\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fable to understand the proceedings against him, to consult with his\n\ncounsel and aid in his defense.\"4\n\n          In an opinion and order filed April 15, 2008, the court\n\ndenied Santiago's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.5   The court\n\nexplained that Santiago's description of his mental condition at\n\nthe change-of-plea hearing was belied both by his behavior at that\n\nhearing and by the fact that he signed the plea agreement, which\n\nstated that his plea was free and voluntary.   The court also noted\n\nthat Santiago, detained since October 7, 2005, had never before\n\nalleged having bipolar disorder. Moreover, in his sworn statement,\n\nSantiago said he was incompetent to enter a plea on March 6 but\n\nwould have been competent to stand trial that day.       The court\n\npointed out the logical inconsistency in this assertion: \"Selective\n\n\n     4\n       The court first issued the order for a competency evaluation\non March 18, 2008. It renewed its instructions in an amended order\non April 11, 2008.\n     5\n       It is not clear why the district court issued its order\nbefore receiving the results of the competency evaluation it had\nordered. Santiago considers this to be an abuse of discretion.\nHowever, he also argues that the evaluation was of little or no\nvalue because it addressed only his mental status at the time of\nevaluation, not on the day he pled guilty.       In any event, the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion\nwithout the benefit of the competency evaluation. After the court\nordered the examination, Santiago requested that it be stayed,\narguing that the court's order did not address the issues raised by\nthe defense. Santiago thought that the order sought an evaluation\nof his sanity, and he contended that it was not sanity, but \"mental\ndisease or defect\" that was the basis of his motion to withdraw his\nplea.    In effect, Santiago argued that the results of the\nevaluation would be irrelevant to his motion to withdraw. That\nargument alone explains why the district court did not have to wait\nfor the competency reports.\n\n                               -9-\n\fcompetency is a kite that does not fly in our courtroom.\"          See\n\nUnited States v. Morrisette, 429 F.3d 318, 322 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"Competence to enter a guilty plea is determined by the same\n\ncriteria as those governing competence to stand trial: whether the\n\ndefendant is able to understand the proceedings and assist his\n\ncounsel with a reasonable degree of rationality.\").\n\nD.   Sentencing\n\n           On July 31, 2009, Santiago appeared for his sentencing\n\nhearing.     He moved again to withdraw his plea, but the court did\n\nnot entertain the motion, stating that the issue was \"already\n\nresolved.\"     In response to an inquiry from the court, Santiago's\n\nattorney represented that she had attempted to get her client's\n\npsychological records from a Dr. Rafael Padro Castro, but none had\n\nbeen   forthcoming.     Because   those   records   were   unavailable,\n\nSantiago's expert had not been able to complete an independent\n\nevaluation.     Before imposing a sentence, the court reviewed the\n\nmental evaluation performed by the Bureau of Prisons personnel,\n\nwhich the court had received in October 2008, and the final PSR\n\nwhich, due to Santiago's refusal to accept responsibility, gave a\n\ntotal offense level of 43.     Santiago spoke at length on his own\n\nbehalf, reiterating his innocence and saying that he had not had\n\nenough time to consider the plea agreement before signing it.\n\nAlthough noting that, based on the newly increased total offense\n\nlevel of 43 and a CHC of III, the Sentencing Guidelines recommended\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\flife in prison, the court imposed a sentence of 380 months.\n\nJudgment was entered accordingly on August 17, 2009, and Santiago\n\nfiled a notice of appeal the following day.\n\n           On appeal, Santiago contends that the district court\n\nerred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea based\n\nsolely on his statements at the change-of-plea hearing.            According\n\nto Santiago, his statement under penalty of perjury laid out\n\nsufficient grounds for allowing him to withdraw the plea and, at\n\nthe least, necessitated an evidentiary hearing.            The government\n\ncounters that Santiago may not pursue this appeal because he waived\n\nhis right to do so in his plea agreement and, in the alternative,\n\nthat his     assertions   about   the   voluntariness   of his     plea are\n\nunfounded.\n\n           We address the merits of Santiago's appeal because his\n\nclaim of involuntariness, if successful, would invalidate both the\n\nplea itself and the waiver of his right to appeal.                See United\n\nStates v. Lara-Joglar, 400 F. App'x 565, 566 (1st Cir. 2010) (per\n\ncuriam) (unpublished).\n\n                                    II.\n\n           Under   Federal   Rule    of    Criminal   Procedure    11,   \"[a]\n\ndefendant may withdraw a plea of guilty . . . after the court\n\naccepts the plea, but before it imposes sentence if . . . the\n\ndefendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the\n\nwithdrawal.\" Fed.

A number of factors bear on whether such a reason\n\nexists, the most important of which is \"whether the plea was\n\nvoluntary, intelligent, knowing and in compliance with Rule 11.\"\n\nIsom, 580 F.3d at 52. Other relevant factors include \"the strength\n\nof the reasons offered in support of the motion [to withdraw];\n\nwhether there is a serious claim of actual innocence; the timing of\n\nthe motion; and any prejudice to the government if the withdrawal\n\nis allowed.\"    Id.\n\n           In considering a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, the\n\ndistrict court must hold an evidentiary hearing if the defendant\n\n\"alleges facts which, if taken as true, would entitle him to\n\nrelief.\"   United States v.

Here, we find no abuse of discretion and no clear\n\nerror.\n\nA.   Voluntariness\n\n            Santiago argues that he should have been allowed to\n\nwithdraw his plea because it was involuntary due to his Xanax use,\n\nlack   of   sleep,   and   familial    pressure.      Pared     down    to    these\n\nsuggested impairments, Santiago's appeal resembles that of Hector\n\nRivera-Martinez,     one   of   the    defendants     in     United    States   v.\n\nPellerito, 878 F.2d 1535 (1st Cir. 1989).             Like Santiago, Rivera-\n\nMartinez sought to withdraw his plea because it was tendered while\n\nhe was \"in an agitated emotional state brought on by telephone\n\nconversations with his hospitalized mother (who was also under\n\nindictment)\" and because, \"while in prison awaiting trial he had\n\nbeen taking an extensive regimen of prescription drugs[,] . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f[which] were for the most part sedatives and anti-anxiety agents.\"6\n\nId. at 1541-42.\n\n          With respect to the first point, we explained that\n\nRivera-Martinez \"misperceive[d] the focus of the plea-retraction\n\ninquiry: while evidence of this stripe is probative of an accused's\n\nmotivation for pleading guilty, it does not necessarily show\n\ncoercion, duress, or involuntariness.\"    Id. at 1541 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).   \"The relevant question for plea withdrawal is not\n\nwhether the accused was sensitive to external conditions -- many\n\ndefendants are -- but instead whether the decision to plead was\n\nvoluntary, i.e., a product of free will.\"     Id.   With respect to\n\nRivera-Martinez's second argument, we stated that \"[t]he mere fact\n\nthat Rivera-Martinez took potentially mood-altering medication is\n\nnot sufficient to vitiate his plea.    There must be some evidence\n\nthat the medication affected his rationality.\"       Id. at 1542.\n\nFinding no support for either rationale, we affirmed the denial of\n\nRivera-Martinez's motion to withdraw his plea.\n\n          The circumstances are substantially similar here.     The\n\ndistrict court found that Santiago's claim of involuntariness due\n\nto family coercion, Xanax use, and lack of sleep was contradicted\n\nboth by his statements at the change-of-plea hearing and the terms\n\nof the plea agreement he had signed. Specifically, at the hearing,\n\n\n     6\n        Rivera-Martinez also argued that his trial counsel's\nineffectiveness rendered his plea involuntary and unknowing. We\nfound those allegations to be baseless. 878 F.2d at 1542-43.\n\n                               -14-\n\fthe court asked Santiago whether anyone threatened him, coerced\n\nhim, made any promises to him, or offered him anything of value to\n\npersuade him to plead guilty. Santiago thrice answered, \"No one.\"\n\nSimilarly,    the    plea    agreement    included   a   provision      in   which\n\nSantiago \"acknowledge[d] no threats ha[d] been made against [him]\n\nand [he was] pleading guilty freely and voluntarily because [he] is\n\nguilty.\"     In an abundance of caution, the court asked Santiago\n\nabout that provision and confirmed with him that the plea was free\n\nand voluntary.        The court's rejection of Santiago's claims of\n\nprescription drug use followed the same analysis, focusing on\n\nSantiago's statements at the change-of-plea hearing that he felt\n\n\"fine,\" and had not taken any drugs, pills, or medicines in the\n\npast twenty-four hours.\n\n            Santiago argues that the district court erred in relying\n\nsolely upon the statements at the change-of-plea hearing and in the\n\nplea agreement because he was \"abdicating his will\" to that of his\n\naunt and her husband, who were present in the courtroom, and\n\nbecause he could not be expected to admit to drug use that violated\n\nprison rules.       There is some force to Santiago's arguments.              \"For\n\nobvious reasons, . . . the defendant's own assurances in open court\n\n[regarding emotional or mental impairment] at the time of the plea\n\nmay   be   given    less    weight   if   later   evidence   to   the   contrary\n\nemerges.\" United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594, 598 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).        Similarly, we recognize that \"in cases in which a\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fguilty plea has been improperly induced, most defendants would be\n\nexpected to deny any impropriety during the Rule 11 hearing.\"\n\nUnited States v. McCarthy, 433 F.2d 591, 593 (1st Cir. 1970).\n\n                 On the other hand, a court is entitled to give weight to\n\nthe defendant's statements at his change-of-plea colloquy absent a\n\n\"good reason for disregarding them.\"                  United States v. Torres-\n\nRosario, 447 F.3d 61, 67 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Pulido, 566 F.3d\n\nat 58-59.          Moreover, a defendant's \"declarations in open court\n\ncarry a strong presumption of verity.\"            Blackledge v. Allison, 431\n\nU.S. 63, 74 (1977); see also United States v. Alegría, 192 F.3d\n\n179,       186   (1st   Cir.   1999)   (\"[C]ourts      cannot   operate    on   the\n\nassumption that parties feel free to lie with impunity in response\n\nto     a    judge's     interrogation.\").        We    \"typically   disregard[]\n\nrepresentations at a plea colloquy 'only when the allegations [of\n\nimpairment] were highly specific and usually accompanied by some\n\nindependent corroboration.'\"            Pulido, 566 F.3d at 59 (alteration\n\nadded) (emphasis omitted) (quoting United States v. Butt, 731 F.2d\n\n75, 80 n.5 (1st Cir. 1984)).            Without independent corroboration,\n\n\"we    not       only   view   his   plea   colloquy    as   'evidential,'      but\n\nsufficiently 'conclusive' to contradict his claims.\"                Id. at 60.\n\n                 Santiago's    allegations     were    unspecific   and     lacked\n\nindependent corroboration. The sworn statement was not specific in\n\nthat it did not say what drug Santiago was abusing, or in what\n\namounts, and did not even mention bipolar disorder.                       In fact,\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fSantiago's motion stated only that he had a \"history\" of drug\n\nabuse, and, \"If [he] was at the time of the [change of plea] under\n\nthe use of prescribed narcotics and undergoing an episode of\n\nsignificant depression due to his mental and emotional condition[,]\n\nhis ability to make a voluntary and knowing determination at the\n\ntime he plead[ed] guilty was severely impaired\" (emphasis added).\n\nOn their face, the motion and accompanying statement said no more\n\nthan that Santiago had used some medication that is available by\n\nprescription on March 6, 2007, and that there is a possibility that\n\nsuch use impaired his ability to plead guilty voluntarily and\n\nknowingly.\n\n            There was also no independent corroboration, such as\n\nmedical records, prison disciplinary records, or affidavits from\n\nothers who witnessed any manifestations of an altered mental state.\n\nSee Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d at 598-99 (explaining that, without\n\ncorroborative    testimony   of   former   attorney   or   psychiatrist,\n\ndefendant did \"no more on the issue of capacity than raise limited\n\ndoubts\").    On May 11, 2007, Santiago asked the court for an order\n\ncompelling his doctor to produce his medical records.         The court\n\nissued the requested order on May 14, and yet Santiago failed to\n\nproduce medical or other records documenting his Xanax use or any\n\nof the other sources of mental impairment alleged in his sworn\n\nstatement.   Moreover, according to Santiago, his own aunt kept at\n\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fleast some of his medical records, yet none were produced.7\n\nSimilarly, he did not submit an affidavit from any family member\n\ncorroborating that they had even spoken to Santiago at the change-\n\nof-plea hearing, much less that they had urged him to accept the\n\nplea deal.\n\n           Santiago's sworn statement was contradicted by the plea\n\nagreement and change-of-plea colloquy, and the district court was\n\nentitled to believe the latter, given no independent corroboration\n\nof the former.         See Pulido, 566 F.3d at 59-60.            Without an\n\n\"adequate tender\" explaining what Santiago \"expected to prove at\n\nany evidentiary hearing, who would be called, what areas would be\n\ncovered,   and   why    such   a   hearing    might    be   expected   to   be\n\nproductive,\" a hearing was unwarranted.         United States v. Browne,\n\n318 F.3d 261, 265 (1st Cir. 2003); see also Ramos, 810 F.2d at 314\n\n(holding district court was not required to hold evidentiary\n\nhearing where defendant made \"eleventh-hour claim . . . that[] his\n\nemotionally-depressed     state    affected   the     voluntariness    of   his\n\nplea,\" and court could rely on its own contrary impressions of\n\ndefendant, where \"record presents no reason to doubt [defendant]'s\n\n\n\n     7\n       The PSR states that Santiago's aunt was a psychiatrist and\nkept all his medical records. The probation officer obtained this\ninformation not only by interviewing Santiago, but also by visiting\nthe aunt at her home and confirming Santiago's personal, medical,\nand legal background with her. Santiago's trial counsel did not\nobject to that portion of the PSR.     At oral argument, however,\nSantiago's appellate counsel contended that the aunt was not a\npsychiatrist and did not have all of his records.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fcompetence to plead\").    In short, because Santiago's motion and\n\nsworn statement were so lacking in detail and corroboration, the\n\ndistrict court was justified in relying on the change-of-plea\n\ncolloquy and signed plea agreement to deny Santiago's motion, and\n\nin doing so without an evidentiary hearing.\n\nB.   Other Factors\n\n           Although the inadequacies of Santiago's motion and sworn\n\nstatement already discussed are sufficient to dispose of this\n\nappeal, we also note that his claim that he was not a member of the\n\ncharged conspiracy \"flies in the face of several admissions to the\n\ncontrary.\"   Isom, 580 F.3d at 53.     Not only did Santiago sign the\n\nplea agreement, in which he acknowledged that he was guilty of the\n\nconspiracy charged in Count Five of the indictment and admitted the\n\ntruth of the \"Stipulation of Facts\" section, he also acknowledged\n\nseveral times under oath at the change-of-plea hearing that he was,\n\nin fact, guilty.\n\n           Furthermore, the timing of Santiago's motion to withdraw\n\nhis guilty plea is suspect.   See United States v. Torres-Rosa, 209\n\nF.3d 4, 9 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"'The timing of a motion to withdraw a\n\nguilty plea often serves as a gauge for measuring the legitimacy of\n\na proffered reason.'\" (quoting United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,\n\n34 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 1994))). Santiago represents that he told\n\nhis attorney to file a motion to withdraw the plea on April 19,\n\n2007. Even crediting that assertion as true, the motion was not\n\n\n                                -19-\n\ffiled until May 22 -- well after Santiago's attorney received an\n\nunfavorable PSR on May 3.     Not only had the probation officer\n\nidentified no factors that would warrant a departure from the\n\nsentencing guidelines or a variant sentence, the PSR also concluded\n\nthat Santiago's CHC was III, not II.    At the time he signed the\n\nplea agreement, Santiago was not certain whether his CHC was II or\n\nIII, so he could have hoped for a sentence as low as 324 months.\n\nBecause the PSR calculated a CHC of III and incorporated Santiago's\n\nfailure to accept responsibility, his guideline sentence became\n\nlife in prison.   Consequently, the benefit of pleading guilty and\n\nthe risk of proceeding to trial dissipated substantially.\n\n          These circumstances suggest that it was a recalculation\n\nof risks and benefits -- not involuntariness -- that produced\n\nSantiago's change of heart.   See United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d\n\n591, 595 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that defendant's motion to\n\nwithdraw filed nearly seven months after proffered reason became\n\nknown and only four days after discovery that sentence would be\n\nlonger than expected \"smacks of post-hoc rationalization\").    The\n\nprospect of a longer sentence than anticipated is not a \"fair and\n\njust\" reason to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea.   Torres-Rosa,\n\n209 F.3d at 9.8\n\n\n     8\n       The government concedes that it would not be prejudiced by\na withdrawal of Santiago's plea. Santiago receives no benefit from\nthis concession, however. The prejudice-to-the-government query is\none undertaken \"[i]f the combined weight of the[] [other] factors\ntilts in the defendant's favor.\" United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d\n\n                               -20-\n\f          In sum, Santiago's uncorroborated sworn statement was\n\ncontradicted by the record, and thus the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw and doing so\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n591, 594 (1st Cir. 1992).   As we explain above, the scales tip in\nthe opposite direction.\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

He   argued       that    his    plea    was\n\ninvoluntary due to his excessive consumption of prescription drugs,\n\nlack    of    sleep,    familial   coercion,        and     a    history    of    bipolar\n\ndisorder.

Indictment and Pre-Trial Background\n\n              On September 29, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a\n\nnine-count         second   superseding        indictment         against      twenty-two\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fdefendants.    Santiago was named in two counts: Count Five charged\n\nhim with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five\n\nkilograms or more of cocaine, fifty grams or more of crack, and one\n\nhundred kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1), and Count Seven charged him with knowingly using,\n\ncarrying,   and possessing     a   firearm   in   furtherance   of   a   drug\n\ntrafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) and (2).\n\nB.    Change-of-Plea Hearing\n\n            The trial was scheduled to begin March 6, 2007. Santiago\n\nappeared on that date but, instead of proceeding to trial, informed\n\nthe court that he wished to plead guilty.         The court proceeded with\n\na change-of-plea hearing and received Santiago's plea agreement, in\n\nwhich he pled guilty to Count Five only.              The government and\n\nSantiago agreed that, because he assumed responsibility as an aider\n\nand abettor to a 2004 murder that constituted one of the overt acts\n\nin furtherance of the drug conspiracy, his base offense level was\n\n43.    See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 2D1.1(d)(1), 2A1.1\n\n(2006).   They also agreed that a clear demonstration of acceptance\n\nof responsibility for the conspiracy offense would merit a three-\n\nlevel reduction. Based on the resulting total offense level of 40,\n\nthe parties agreed that they would recommend a 324-month sentence\n\nif Santiago's criminal history category (CHC) was II, and a 360-\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fmonth sentence if his CHC was any higher.1              In addition to listing\n\na number of rights Santiago relinquished by accepting the plea\n\ndeal, the plea agreement stated that he \"hereby agrees that if this\n\nHonorable Court accepts this Plea Agreement and sentences him\n\naccording      to   its   terms   and     conditions,   defendant     waives   and\n\nsurrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this\n\ncase.\"\n\n               At the hearing, the court first considered Santiago's\n\ncompetence to plead, discussing with him his age, his educational\n\nlevel, and his mental state.            Because Santiago's appeal focuses on\n\nthat       mental   state,   we   quote    from   a   portion   of   the   hearing\n\ntranscript at length:\n\n            THE COURT: How do you feel this afternoon?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   I feel fine.\n            THE COURT: Have you taken any drugs, pills, or\n       medicines within the last 24 hours?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   No.\n            THE COURT: Do you realize you're in a courtroom?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   That is correct.\n            THE COURT: You're here to change your plea of not\n       guilty to one of guilty as to Count Five of the\n       indictment.\n            THE DEFENDANT:   That is correct.\n            THE COURT: And do you know what you have been\n       charged with in Count Five?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   That is correct.\n            THE COURT: There is no need for me to read to you\n       charges at this time?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   No.\n            THE COURT: Have you had enough time to consult with\n       your attorney before this afternoon?\n\n\n       1\n       The recommended sentences fell at the bottom of the ranges\nsuggested by the Sentencing Guidelines.       Those ranges were,\nrespectively, 324 to 405 months and 360 months to life.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f            THE DEFENDANT:   That is correct.\n            THE COURT: Are you satisfied with her services up\n      to now?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   Very satisfied.\n            THE COURT: At this time I find the defendant\n      competent to plea.\n            I'm going to continue asking you questions. If you\n      do not understand my questions, you may ask me to repeat\n      them to you. If you have any doubts as to the answers\n      you are to give to my questions, then you may consult\n      with your attorney who is standing next to you. Do you\n      understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   I understand.\n            THE COURT: The reason I'm explaining this to you is\n      because I'm going to place you under oath, and if any of\n      your answers to my questions are untruthful, then you may\n      be subjecting yourself to further charges of perjury or\n      providing false information while under oath which carry\n      additional penalties. Do you understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT:   I understand.\n      . . .\n      [Santiago was sworn.]\n\nThe court proceeded to inform Santiago of the various rights he\n\nwould surrender by pleading guilty, and Santiago confirmed that he\n\nunderstood and that he still wished to plead guilty.\n\n            With    respect   to   coercion,    the   court   asked   whether\n\n\"anybody threatened you in any way to induce you to plead guilty,\"\n\nand Santiago said, \"No one.\"         The court asked again, \"Is anybody\n\nforcing you in any way to get you to plead guilty?,\" to which\n\nSantiago responded, \"No one.\"            Finally, the court asked whether\n\nanyone had \"made any promises or offered you any things of value to\n\nget you to plead guilty,\" and Santiago again answered, \"No one.\"\n\n            The court then reviewed Santiago's plea agreement in\n\ndetail, explaining to Santiago that the agreement was not binding\n\non   the   court,   that   there   was   no final     stipulation   regarding\n\n                                     -5-\n\fSantiago's CHC, and that Santiago's signature meant that he agreed\n\nthat the facts in it were true and accurate.                   Santiago indicated\n\nhis   understanding     of   each   of    these      points.      The    court   also\n\nexplained the waiver of appeal clause:\n\n           THE COURT: Paragraph 18 refers to the fact that you\n      agree that if this Court accepts the Plea Agreement and\n      sentences you according to its terms and conditions, that\n      you will be in a position to waive and surrender your\n      right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\n      Is that correct?\n           THE DEFENDANT:    Correct.\n           THE COURT: But by the same token, do you understand\n      that if I do not accept the Plea Agreement and I do not\n      sentence you according to the terms and conditions of the\n      Plea Agreement, that then you would not waive and\n      surrender your right to appeal the judgment and sentence\n      in this case. Do you understand?\n           THE DEFENDANT:    I understand.\n\nAfter accepting Santiago's plea, the court scheduled a sentencing\n\nhearing for June 7, 2007.\n\nC.    Presentence Report and Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea\n\n            Following    the   change      of   plea,    the    probation    office\n\nprepared its first draft of Santiago's presentence investigation\n\nreport (PSR).     In addition to describing Count Five and the\n\nunderlying   offense     conduct,    the       PSR   calculated    the    guideline\n\nsentencing range, listed Santiago's prior criminal convictions, and\n\nestablished that his CHC was III.                 The probation officer also\n\ndescribed Santiago's family and community ties, as well as his\n\nphysical condition and drug use.           The officer reported that he had\n\n\"not identified any information that would warrant a departure from\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthe guidelines or a variance in sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a).\"\n\n            Copies of the initial PSR were delivered to Santiago's\n\nattorney on May 3, 2007.      On May 11, 2007, she sent a letter\n\nobjecting to the report's conclusion that no departure or variance\n\nwas warranted.   On May 18, she added an objection that Santiago had\n\nnot admitted responsibility for his involvement in the charged\n\noffense.2   The probation officer included the objections and his\n\nresponses in an addendum, and corrected the PSR to reflect that\n\nSantiago had not accepted responsibility for the crime.   The final\n\nPSR was completed May 23 and filed with the court May 31.\n\n            On May 22, 2007, Santiago filed a motion to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea, arguing that it was involuntary and unknowing due to\n\nhis drug abuse, his bipolar disorder, and coercion by family\n\nmembers to plead guilty.3    Accompanying the motion was Santiago's\n\nstatement under penalty of perjury that, on March 6, his aunt and\n\nher husband were present in court and asked him to accept the plea\n\n\n\n     2\n       Ordinarily, a defendant who pleads guilty seeks a sentence\nreduction for having accepted responsibility for his crime. See\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 3E1.1. Santiago's objection to\nthe PSR's inclusion of such a reduction was thus unusual, and\nforeshadowed his motion, filed six days later, to withdraw his\nplea.\n     3\n       In his motion, Santiago also argued that he had entered his\nplea without knowledge of \"the nature of the crime and . . . the\nconsequences [of pleading guilty].\"     The court rejected these\narguments in its order denying the motion.      Santiago does not\nchallenge that aspect of the order or revive the arguments here.\n\n                                 -7-\n\foffer to avoid the risk of a life sentence.               He also reported that\n\nhe had called his mother that day, who asked that he accept the\n\ndeal.       According to Santiago, he felt \"forced[,] coerced and\n\npressured by the wish of my family that I plead guilty.\"                       The\n\nstatement also said that Santiago had been abusing prescription\n\nmedications at the corrections facility for days leading up to and\n\nincluding March 6, and that he had not slept for several days\n\nbefore March 6.           Santiago reported being confused, anxious, and\n\ndepressed at the change-of-plea hearing, and contended that all of\n\nthese conditions rendered his plea involuntary and unknowing.\n\nFinally, he swore that he was never part of the charged conspiracy.\n\nNot surprisingly, the government opposed Santiago's motion.\n\n             On December 6, 2007, the government asked the court to\n\norder   a    psychiatric       evaluation     of   Santiago   to   determine   his\n\ncompetency to enter a plea of guilty and/or to stand trial.               See 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 4241.          Santiago objected to being moved to a facility in\n\nNorth Carolina for the examination, and requested that he be\n\nallowed to        have    a   separate examination      performed by     his   own\n\nexperts.     The district court ordered that Santiago be taken to a\n\nfacility     in    Florida     or   another    suitable    institution   for   an\n\nevaluation of his competency to stand trial, meaning \"whether he is\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fable to understand the proceedings against him, to consult with his\n\ncounsel and aid in his defense.\"4\n\n          In an opinion and order filed April 15, 2008, the court\n\ndenied Santiago's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.5   The court\n\nexplained that Santiago's description of his mental condition at\n\nthe change-of-plea hearing was belied both by his behavior at that\n\nhearing and by the fact that he signed the plea agreement, which\n\nstated that his plea was free and voluntary.   The court also noted\n\nthat Santiago, detained since October 7, 2005, had never before\n\nalleged having bipolar disorder. Moreover, in his sworn statement,\n\nSantiago said he was incompetent to enter a plea on March 6 but\n\nwould have been competent to stand trial that day.       The court\n\npointed out the logical inconsistency in this assertion: \"Selective\n\n\n     4\n       The court first issued the order for a competency evaluation\non March 18, 2008. It renewed its instructions in an amended order\non April 11, 2008.\n     5\n       It is not clear why the district court issued its order\nbefore receiving the results of the competency evaluation it had\nordered. Santiago considers this to be an abuse of discretion.\nHowever, he also argues that the evaluation was of little or no\nvalue because it addressed only his mental status at the time of\nevaluation, not on the day he pled guilty.       In any event, the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion\nwithout the benefit of the competency evaluation. After the court\nordered the examination, Santiago requested that it be stayed,\narguing that the court's order did not address the issues raised by\nthe defense. Santiago thought that the order sought an evaluation\nof his sanity, and he contended that it was not sanity, but \"mental\ndisease or defect\" that was the basis of his motion to withdraw his\nplea.    In effect, Santiago argued that the results of the\nevaluation would be irrelevant to his motion to withdraw. That\nargument alone explains why the district court did not have to wait\nfor the competency reports.\n\n                               -9-\n\fcompetency is a kite that does not fly in our courtroom.\"          See\n\nUnited States v.

Sentencing\n\n           On July 31, 2009, Santiago appeared for his sentencing\n\nhearing.     He moved again to withdraw his plea, but the court did\n\nnot entertain the motion, stating that the issue was \"already\n\nresolved.\"     In response to an inquiry from the court, Santiago's\n\nattorney represented that she had attempted to get her client's\n\npsychological records from a Dr. Rafael Padro Castro, but none had\n\nbeen   forthcoming.     Because   those   records   were   unavailable,\n\nSantiago's expert had not been able to complete an independent\n\nevaluation.     Before imposing a sentence, the court reviewed the\n\nmental evaluation performed by the Bureau of Prisons personnel,\n\nwhich the court had received in October 2008, and the final PSR\n\nwhich, due to Santiago's refusal to accept responsibility, gave a\n\ntotal offense level of 43.     Santiago spoke at length on his own\n\nbehalf, reiterating his innocence and saying that he had not had\n\nenough time to consider the plea agreement before signing it.\n\nAlthough noting that, based on the newly increased total offense\n\nlevel of 43 and a CHC of III, the Sentencing Guidelines recommended\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\flife in prison, the court imposed a sentence of 380 months.\n\nJudgment was entered accordingly on August 17, 2009, and Santiago\n\nfiled a notice of appeal the following day.\n\n           On appeal, Santiago contends that the district court\n\nerred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea based\n\nsolely on his statements at the change-of-plea hearing.            According\n\nto Santiago, his statement under penalty of perjury laid out\n\nsufficient grounds for allowing him to withdraw the plea and, at\n\nthe least, necessitated an evidentiary hearing.            The government\n\ncounters that Santiago may not pursue this appeal because he waived\n\nhis right to do so in his plea agreement and, in the alternative,\n\nthat his     assertions   about   the   voluntariness   of his     plea are\n\nunfounded.\n\n           We address the merits of Santiago's appeal because his\n\nclaim of involuntariness, if successful, would invalidate both the\n\nplea itself and the waiver of his right to appeal.

Voluntariness\n\n            Santiago argues that he should have been allowed to\n\nwithdraw his plea because it was involuntary due to his Xanax use,\n\nlack   of   sleep,   and   familial    pressure.      Pared     down    to    these\n\nsuggested impairments, Santiago's appeal resembles that of Hector\n\nRivera-Martinez,     one   of   the    defendants     in     United    States   v.\n\nPellerito, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526038\"><a href=\"/opinion/526038/united-states-v-giuseppe-pellerito-aka-joseph-el-italiano-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1989).             Like Santiago, Rivera-\n\nMartinez sought to withdraw his plea because it was tendered while\n\nhe was \"in an agitated emotional state brought on by telephone\n\nconversations with his hospitalized mother (who was also under\n\nindictment)\" and because, \"while in prison awaiting trial he had\n\nbeen taking an extensive regimen of prescription drugs[,] . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f[which] were for the most part sedatives and anti-anxiety agents.\"6\n\nId. at 1541-42.\n\n          With respect to the first point, we explained that\n\nRivera-Martinez \"misperceive[d] the focus of the plea-retraction\n\ninquiry: while evidence of this stripe is probative of an accused's\n\nmotivation for pleading guilty, it does not necessarily show\n\ncoercion, duress, or involuntariness.\"    Id. at 1541 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).   \"The relevant question for plea withdrawal is not\n\nwhether the accused was sensitive to external conditions -- many\n\ndefendants are -- but instead whether the decision to plead was\n\nvoluntary, i.e., a product of free will.\"     Id.   With respect to\n\nRivera-Martinez's second argument, we stated that \"[t]he mere fact\n\nthat Rivera-Martinez took potentially mood-altering medication is\n\nnot sufficient to vitiate his plea.    There must be some evidence\n\nthat the medication affected his rationality.\"       Id. at 1542.\n\nFinding no support for either rationale, we affirmed the denial of\n\nRivera-Martinez's motion to withdraw his plea.\n\n          The circumstances are substantially similar here.     The\n\ndistrict court found that Santiago's claim of involuntariness due\n\nto family coercion, Xanax use, and lack of sleep was contradicted\n\nboth by his statements at the change-of-plea hearing and the terms\n\nof the plea agreement he had signed. Specifically, at the hearing,\n\n\n     6\n        Rivera-Martinez also argued that his trial counsel's\nineffectiveness rendered his plea involuntary and unknowing. We\nfound those allegations to be baseless. 878 F.2d at 1542-43.\n\n                               -14-\n\fthe court asked Santiago whether anyone threatened him, coerced\n\nhim, made any promises to him, or offered him anything of value to\n\npersuade him to plead guilty. Santiago thrice answered, \"No one.\"\n\nSimilarly,    the    plea    agreement    included   a   provision      in   which\n\nSantiago \"acknowledge[d] no threats ha[d] been made against [him]\n\nand [he was] pleading guilty freely and voluntarily because [he] is\n\nguilty.\"     In an abundance of caution, the court asked Santiago\n\nabout that provision and confirmed with him that the plea was free\n\nand voluntary.        The court's rejection of Santiago's claims of\n\nprescription drug use followed the same analysis, focusing on\n\nSantiago's statements at the change-of-plea hearing that he felt\n\n\"fine,\" and had not taken any drugs, pills, or medicines in the\n\npast twenty-four hours.\n\n            Santiago argues that the district court erred in relying\n\nsolely upon the statements at the change-of-plea hearing and in the\n\nplea agreement because he was \"abdicating his will\" to that of his\n\naunt and her husband, who were present in the courtroom, and\n\nbecause he could not be expected to admit to drug use that violated\n\nprison rules.       There is some force to Santiago's arguments.              \"For\n\nobvious reasons, . . . the defendant's own assurances in open court\n\n[regarding emotional or mental impairment] at the time of the plea\n\nmay   be   given    less    weight   if   later   evidence   to   the   contrary\n\nemerges.\" United States v.

The sworn statement was not specific in\n\nthat it did not say what drug Santiago was abusing, or in what\n\namounts, and did not even mention bipolar disorder.                       In fact,\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fSantiago's motion stated only that he had a \"history\" of drug\n\nabuse, and, \"If [he] was at the time of the [change of plea] under\n\nthe use of prescribed narcotics and undergoing an episode of\n\nsignificant depression due to his mental and emotional condition[,]\n\nhis ability to make a voluntary and knowing determination at the\n\ntime he plead[ed] guilty was severely impaired\" (emphasis added).\n\nOn their face, the motion and accompanying statement said no more\n\nthan that Santiago had used some medication that is available by\n\nprescription on March 6, 2007, and that there is a possibility that\n\nsuch use impaired his ability to plead guilty voluntarily and\n\nknowingly.\n\n            There was also no independent corroboration, such as\n\nmedical records, prison disciplinary records, or affidavits from\n\nothers who witnessed any manifestations of an altered mental state.\n\nSee Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d at 598-99 (explaining that, without\n\ncorroborative    testimony   of   former   attorney   or   psychiatrist,\n\ndefendant did \"no more on the issue of capacity than raise limited\n\ndoubts\").    On May 11, 2007, Santiago asked the court for an order\n\ncompelling his doctor to produce his medical records.         The court\n\nissued the requested order on May 14, and yet Santiago failed to\n\nproduce medical or other records documenting his Xanax use or any\n\nof the other sources of mental impairment alleged in his sworn\n\nstatement.   Moreover, according to Santiago, his own aunt kept at\n\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fleast some of his medical records, yet none were produced.7\n\nSimilarly, he did not submit an affidavit from any family member\n\ncorroborating that they had even spoken to Santiago at the change-\n\nof-plea hearing, much less that they had urged him to accept the\n\nplea deal.\n\n           Santiago's sworn statement was contradicted by the plea\n\nagreement and change-of-plea colloquy, and the district court was\n\nentitled to believe the latter, given no independent corroboration\n\nof the former.         See Pulido, 566 F.3d at 59-60.            Without an\n\n\"adequate tender\" explaining what Santiago \"expected to prove at\n\nany evidentiary hearing, who would be called, what areas would be\n\ncovered,   and   why    such   a   hearing    might    be   expected   to   be\n\nproductive,\" a hearing was unwarranted.

Browne,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200311\"><a href=\"/opinion/200311/united-states-v-browne/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 265 (1st Cir. 2003); see also Ramos, 810 F.2d at 314\n\n(holding district court was not required to hold evidentiary\n\nhearing where defendant made \"eleventh-hour claim . . . that[] his\n\nemotionally-depressed     state    affected   the     voluntariness    of   his\n\nplea,\" and court could rely on its own contrary impressions of\n\ndefendant, where \"record presents no reason to doubt [defendant]'s\n\n\n\n     7\n       The PSR states that Santiago's aunt was a psychiatrist and\nkept all his medical records. The probation officer obtained this\ninformation not only by interviewing Santiago, but also by visiting\nthe aunt at her home and confirming Santiago's personal, medical,\nand legal background with her. Santiago's trial counsel did not\nobject to that portion of the PSR.     At oral argument, however,\nSantiago's appellate counsel contended that the aunt was not a\npsychiatrist and did not have all of his records.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fcompetence to plead\").    In short, because Santiago's motion and\n\nsworn statement were so lacking in detail and corroboration, the\n\ndistrict court was justified in relying on the change-of-plea\n\ncolloquy and signed plea agreement to deny Santiago's motion, and\n\nin doing so without an evidentiary hearing.\n\nB.   Other Factors\n\n           Although the inadequacies of Santiago's motion and sworn\n\nstatement already discussed are sufficient to dispose of this\n\nappeal, we also note that his claim that he was not a member of the\n\ncharged conspiracy \"flies in the face of several admissions to the\n\ncontrary.\"   Isom, 580 F.3d at 53.     Not only did Santiago sign the\n\nplea agreement, in which he acknowledged that he was guilty of the\n\nconspiracy charged in Count Five of the indictment and admitted the\n\ntruth of the \"Stipulation of Facts\" section, he also acknowledged\n\nseveral times under oath at the change-of-plea hearing that he was,\n\nin fact, guilty.\n\n           Furthermore, the timing of Santiago's motion to withdraw\n\nhis guilty plea is suspect.   See United States v. Torres-Rosa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768303\"><a href=\"/opinion/768303/united-states-v-cesar-orlando-torres-rosa-aka-lando-aka-orlan/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"'The timing of a motion to withdraw a\n\nguilty plea often serves as a gauge for measuring the legitimacy of\n\na proffered reason.'\" (quoting United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195584\"><a href=\"/opinion/195584/united-states-v-gonzalez-vazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 1994))). Santiago represents that he told\n\nhis attorney to file a motion to withdraw the plea on April 19,\n\n2007. Even crediting that assertion as true, the motion was not\n\n\n                                -19-\n\ffiled until May 22 -- well after Santiago's attorney received an\n\nunfavorable PSR on May 3.     Not only had the probation officer\n\nidentified no factors that would warrant a departure from the\n\nsentencing guidelines or a variant sentence, the PSR also concluded\n\nthat Santiago's CHC was III, not II.    At the time he signed the\n\nplea agreement, Santiago was not certain whether his CHC was II or\n\nIII, so he could have hoped for a sentence as low as 324 months.\n\nBecause the PSR calculated a CHC of III and incorporated Santiago's\n\nfailure to accept responsibility, his guideline sentence became\n\nlife in prison.   Consequently, the benefit of pleading guilty and\n\nthe risk of proceeding to trial dissipated substantially.\n\n          These circumstances suggest that it was a recalculation\n\nof risks and benefits -- not involuntariness -- that produced\n\nSantiago's change of heart.   See United States v. Doyle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 595 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that defendant's motion to\n\nwithdraw filed nearly seven months after proffered reason became\n\nknown and only four days after discovery that sentence would be\n\nlonger than expected \"smacks of post-hoc rationalization\").    The\n\nprospect of a longer sentence than anticipated is not a \"fair and\n\njust\" reason to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea.   Torres-Rosa,\n\n209 F.3d at 9.8\n\n\n     8\n       The government concedes that it would not be prejudiced by\na withdrawal of Santiago's plea. Santiago receives no benefit from\nthis concession, however. The prejudice-to-the-government query is\none undertaken \"[i]f the combined weight of the[] [other] factors\ntilts in the defendant's favor.\" United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d\n\n                               -20-\n\f          In sum, Santiago's uncorroborated sworn statement was\n\ncontradicted by the record, and thus the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw and doing so\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n591, 594 (1st Cir. 1992).   As we explain above, the scales tip in\nthe opposite direction.\n\n                               -21-\n\f</pre>",
