Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     'Omar 'Abdullah on brief pro se.\n     Natalie S. Monroe and Thomas F. Reilly, Office of the Attorney\nGeneral, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                                July 15, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam. Appellant, 'Omar 'Abdullah, appeals from the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of his complaint alleging claims under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1985 and refusal to exercise pendant\n\njurisdiction over his state law claims.            We have reviewed the\n\nparties’ briefs and the record on appeal, and we affirm for the\n\nreasons stated by Judge Gertner in her October 25, 2002 Memorandum\n\nand Order.\n\n             Regarding his due process claim, Appellant contests that\n\nthe Parratt-Hudson doctrine is the appropriate analysis to apply to\n\nhis alleged deprivation of a liberty interest.             Appellant is\n\nmisguided.     The Parratt-Hudson line of cases frames the analysis\n\nfor a violation of procedural due process, regardless of which\n\ninterest petitioner claims to have been deprived. See Zinermon v.\n\nBurch, 494 U.S. 113, 131-32 (1990); Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer\n\nProductions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 535-36 (1995).\n\n             Appellant further argues that Parratt and Hudson are\n\ninapposite to his claim because Appellees’ conduct was not “random\n\nand unauthorized.” Appellant contends that Appellees Kennett’s and\n\nKenneally’s transfer of his petition to the Single Justice Session\n\nclerk’s   office    is   in   contravention   to   Rule   31(d)   of   the\n\nMassachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.        By his reasoning, Rule\n\n31(d) designates conduct for clerks, and therefore, Appellees’\n\nconduct cannot be “random and unauthorized.” Appellant inverts the\n\nrationale of the Parratt-Hudson line of cases.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f           Where a non-discretionary procedure for protecting a\n\nliberty interest exists, a state employee’s violation of that\n\nmandated procedure is “random and unauthorized.” See Brown, 68 F.3\n\nat 536-37; Lowe v. Scott, 959 F.2d 323, 344 (1st Cir.1992).                 It is\n\nnot the procedures under Rule 31(d) that Appellant charges are the\n\nsource of his deprivation.             Rather, Appellant complains that\n\nAppellees’ alleged failure to follow these procedures caused a\n\ndeprivation of his liberty interest in access to the court.                 It is\n\nexactly   this   kind   of   alleged    conduct,   the    failure      of   state\n\nemployees to follow mandated procedures, which the state cannot\n\nadequately predict or prevent, that the Parratt-Hudson doctrine\n\naddresses.    See Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 131-32; Brown, 68 F.3 at 536-\n\n37; Lowe, 959 F.2d at 344.          Looking to the adequacy of a post-\n\ndeprivation remedy was, therefore, the appropriate analysis, and\n\nAppellant’s due process claim was properly dismissed.\n\n             Next Appellant argues that a clerical error on the docket\n\nsheet, designating the nature of his case as a habeas petition\n\nunder M.G.L. c. 248 § 35, which specifically excludes individuals\n\nconfined under a criminal conviction, caused the single justice to\n\ndismiss   his    petition,    and   thus,    denied      him   court    access.\n\nAppellant's state filing unambiguously states that he is bringing\n\nsuit pursuant to M.G.L. c. 248 § 1.         Justice Ireland, before whom\n\nthe state petition was brought, would have reviewed this filing to\n\nmake a determination; that the docket sheet contained a clerical\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\ferror is of no consequence.          Furthermore, a habeas petition is not\n\nthe appropriate vehicle with which to challenge indictment, trial,\n\nconviction or sentencing in Massachusetts.                See In re Soura, 436\n\nMass. 1003 (2002); Valliere v. Superintendent of Mass. Correctional\n\nInst., 429 Mass. 1024 (1999); Petition of Stewart, 411 Mass. 566\n\n(1992).      Dismissal of a habeas petition does not preclude a\n\npetitioner from pursuing the proper vehicle, a motion under Mass.\n\nR. Crim. P. 30.     Appellant could have sought this form of relief.\n\n           Appellant pleads a race-based animus in support of his\n\nSection 1985(2) claim for the first time on appeal, and we decline\n\nto   entertain     the   issue      at    this    late   date.   See   Teamsters,\n\nChauffeurs,    Warehousemen         and   Helpers    Union     Local   No.    59   v.\n\nSuperline Trans. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           Appellant also brought suit for conspiracy under Section\n\n1983, which the district court did not address.                        We dismiss\n\nAppellant’s claim here.             “In order to make out an actionable\n\nconspiracy under section 1983, a plaintiff has to prove not only a\n\nconspiratorial agreement but also an actual abridgment of some\n\nfederally-secured right.”           Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46, 53\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).         Appellant has failed to state a claim for\n\nviolation of the First or the Fourteenth Amendment and therefore,\n\nlikewise has no cause of action for conspiracy under Section 1983.\n\n           Lastly,       it   was    well       within   the   district      court’s\n\ndiscretion    to   decline     to    exercise      pendant     jurisdiction    over\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fAppellant’s state law claims after it had dismissed Appellant's\n\nfederal claims. Lares Group II v. Tobin, 221 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n          Affirmed with the direction that dismissal of the pendant\n\nstate claims is without prejudice.   Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
