Pro se  inmate Henry  Torres appeals\n                               \n\nfrom  a district  court judgment  that  denied his  motion to\n\nvacate, set  aside, or correct  his sentence under  28 U.S.C.\n\n 2255.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     The relevant facts are not in dispute.  On May 23, 1989,\n\nTorres and six  codefendants were indicted  on two counts  of\n\npossession with intent to distribute  more than 100 grams  of\n\nheroin in  violation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B),\n\nand  conspiracy  to distribute  and  possess  with intent  to\n\ndistribute  the said heroin  in violation of  21 U.S.C.  846.\n\nOn October 4, 1989, Torres pled guilty to the possession with\n\nintent to distribute charge pursuant to a plea agreement with\n\nthe government.   That offense was punishable  by a mandatory\n\nminimum  of five years' imprisonment and  at least four years\n\nof supervised release if the crime did not result in death or\n\nserious  bodily   injury  and  the  offender   had  no  prior\n\nconvictions for  violations of  841(a) or  for other felonies\n\nrelating to narcotic  drugs.   However, if  the offender  had\n\nsuch a  prior conviction,  the offense was  punishable by  an\n\nenhanced mandatory minimum of  ten years' imprisonment and at\n\nleast  eight  years of  supervised release,  assuming neither\n\ndeath nor  serious bodily injury resulted  from the offense.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  21 U.S.C.  841(b)(1)(B) provides,  in relevant part, that\na  person convicted of an offense involving 100 grams or more\nof a substance containing heroin:\n\n                             -2-\n\nThe record indicates that, in return  for Torres' guilty plea\n\non  count one, the government agreed to dismiss count two and\n\nto recommend that Torres receive ten years' imprisonment.2  \n\n     On December 7, 1989, the district court sentenced Torres\n\nto the enhanced mandatory  minimum of ten years' imprisonment\n\nand  eight years of supervised release.   The enhancement was\n\nbased  on Torres'  prior  Rhode Island  state conviction  for\n\npossession of  cocaine.  The conspiracy  charge was dismissed\n\non  the government's  motion.   Although Torres  appealed his\n\nsentence, that appeal was  subsequently dismissed for lack of\n\nprosecution.\n\n     On December 24,  1992, Torres filed the  28 U.S.C.  2255\n\nmotion  that is  the subject  of this  appeal.   That motion,\n\n                    \n\n     ... shall  be sentenced  to a term  of imprisonment\n     which may not  be less  than 5 years  and not  more\n     than  40 years  ... If  any  person commits  such a\n     violation after one or  more prior convictions  for\n     an offense punishable under this paragraph or for a\n     felony under any other provision of this subchapter\n     or  subchapter II of this chapter or other law of a\n     State,  the United  States,  or  a foreign  country\n     relating to narcotic  drugs ... have  become final,\n     such  person  shall  be  sentenced  to  a  term  of\n     imprisonment which  may not  be less than  10 years\n     and  not  more  than  life  imprisonment   ...  Any\n     sentence  imposed under this subparagraph shall, in\n     the absence  of such a prior  conviction, include a\n     term of supervised release of  at least 4 years  in\n     addition to such term of imprisonment and shall, if\n     there was  such a prior conviction,  include a term\n     of  supervised  release  of  at least  8  years  in\n     addition to such term of imprisonment.  \n\n2.  The government  further agreed to  make no recommendation\nas to an appropriate fine or supervised release term.\n\n                             -3-\n\nwhich  was  supported  by  a   memorandum,  attacked  Torres'\n\nsentence  on three grounds.  First, Torres alleged that state\n\nconvictions could not support a sentence enhancement under 21\n\nU.S.C.  841(b).   In support of this  assertion, Torres cited\n\nUnited States v. Johnson, 506 F.2d 305 (7th Cir. 1974), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  420 U.S.  1005 (1975),  a case  which held  that the\n      \n\ndouble penalty  provisions of  21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(A) could\n\nonly be applied if a prior conviction had been obtained under\n\nfederal law.   See 506 F.2d at 307.   In connection with this\n                  \n\nfirst point, Torres also  contended that his prior conviction\n\nfor  simple possession  of cocaine  was  the equivalent  of a\n\nviolation  of 21  U.S.C.   844, which  describes the  federal\n\npenalties  for  simple possession  of  controlled substances.\n\nTorres asserted that no federal  law allowed violations of 21\n\nU.S.C.  844 to  be used as  a basis for  invoking the  double\n\npenalties  prescribed in 21  U.S.C.  841,  therefore, Torres'\n\nprior conviction, treated as a  violation of 21 U.S.C.   844,\n\ncould not support his enhanced sentence.  \n\n     Torres' second ground for   2255 relief alleged that the\n\ngovernment failed to file  an information notifying Torres of\n\nits intent to seek to enhance his sentence based on his prior\n\nconviction,  as required  by 21  U.S.C.  851(a)(1).3   Third,\n\n                    \n\n3.   28 U.S.C.  851(a)(1) provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n     No person who stands  convicted of an offense under\n     this  part   shall   be  sentenced   to   increased\n     punishment  by   reason  of   one  or   more  prior\n\n                             -4-\n\nTorres argued that the  probation officer engaged in improper\n\ndouble  counting in computing  Torres' criminal history under\n\nthe  United  States  Sentencing  Guidelines  (U.S.S.G.,  Nov.\n\n1989).   Torres  specifically  complained  that  points  were\n\nimproperly added  under  4A1.1(c) and  4A1.1(d).  Marshalling\n\nthese  claims, Torres asked the district  court to reduce his\n\nenhanced sentence  to seventy  months' imprisonment  and four\n\nyears of supervised release.\n\n     The government  filed an objection to  Torres' 28 U.S.C.\n\n 2255  motion and a supporting memorandum which is not in the\n\nrecord before us.   On February 19, 1993, the  district court\n\nissued an order denying relief.  The court specifically found\n\nthat  the government  had filed and  served the  requisite 21\n                               \n\nU.S.C.   851(a)(1) information, that  21 U.S.C.  841(b)(1)(B)\n\nexpressly  authorizes sentence  enhancements  based on  prior\n\nstate   convictions,  and  that   Torres'  objection  to  the\n\ncalculation of  his criminal history  category was  meritless\n\nsince U.S.S.G.  5G1.1(b) required that Torres be sentenced to\n\nthe mandatory statutory minimum prison and supervised release\n\n                    \n\n     convictions, unless  before trial, or  before entry\n     of  a plea  of guilty,  the United  States attorney\n     files an  information with the court  (and serves a\n     copy of  such information on the  person or counsel\n     for  the person)  stating  in writing  the previous\n     convictions to be relied upon....\n\n                             -5-\n\nterms,    thus   rendering   his   criminal   history   score\n\nirrelevant.4     Judgment  entered   for  the  government  on\n\nFebruary 22, 1993.  \n\n     The record indicates  that Torres filed  a reply to  the\n\ngovernment's objection  to his   2255 motion which  set forth\n\nadditional  arguments   in  favor  of  Torres'   request  for\n\nresentencing.   Specifically,   Torres   alleged   that   the\n\n\"Information\" which the government purportedly filed under 21\n\nU.S.C.   851  in  fact had  been  filed  in  response to  the\n\ndefendants'  discovery  requests,  had  no  nexus  with  that\n\ninformation  required  by 21  U.S.C.   851,  and was  fatally\n\ndefective under United  States v. Wirsing, 662  F. Supp. 199,\n                                         \n\n200  (D.  Nev. 1987),  because it  did  not mention  that the\n\ngovernment intended  to seek an enhanced  sentence.5  Torres'\n\ncertificate of service indicates that he mailed this reply on\n\n                    \n\n4.  U.S.S.G   5G1.1(b) provides that, \"[w]here  a statutorily\nrequired minimum sentence is greater than the  maximum of the\napplicable  guideline range, the statutorily required minimum\nsentence shall be the guideline sentence.\"\n\n 5.  Torres  also  alleged that  he had  received ineffective\nassistance  of counsel  since  his attorney  had allowed  his\ndirect appeal of  his sentence  to be dismissed  for lack  of\nprosecution and failed to  file an Anders brief.   This claim\n                                         \nwas not properly before  the district court since it  was not\nraised  in  Torres'  2255  motion.   Thus,  we are  unable to\neffectively review this claim.  See Barrett v. United States,\n                                                            \n965 F.2d 1184, 1188  (1st Cir. 1992)(holding plaintiff failed\nto  raise Jencks  Act claim  in a  timely manner  below where\nclaim was first asserted in plaintiff's reply to government's\nresponse  to plaintiff's  amended  2255  motion).   Moreover,\nTorres'  filings with this court do not seek appellate review\nof this issue.  Thus, we do not address it.  \n\n                             -6-\n\nFebruary 17, 1993, two days before  the district court issued\n\nits  order denying relief  and four days  before judgment for\n\nthe government  was entered.   It  appears that  the district\n\ncourt  did  not consider  this  reply before  it  entered its\n\ndecision, for the  docket sheet indicates that  the reply was\n\nnot docketed  until March 2,  1993, after  judgment had  been\n\nentered and the  case had been closed.   In any event, Torres\n\nfiled a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                             II.\n\n     We have allowed Torres  to proceed on the  memorandum he\n\nfiled in  the district  court in  lieu of  filing a  brief on\n\nappeal.6  Having reviewed  the record thoroughly, we conclude\n\nthat the district court's  analysis was correct.  It  is true\n\nthat when  21 U.S.C.  841(b)  was originally enacted,  it did\n\nnot   subject   defendants  with   prior  state   court  drug\n\nconvictions   to  enhanced  penalties  as  repeat  offenders.\n\nRather, this statute initially allowed  sentence enhancements\n\nonly for  prior federal  felony-drug violations.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited States v. Gates, 807 F.2d 1075, 1082 (D.C. Cir. 1986),\n                      \n\n                    \n\n6.  Torres  has also  filed  a reply  brief which  emphasizes\nthat,  in  his view,  Congress did  not  intend the  crime of\nsimple   possession  of   cocaine   to  trigger   a  sentence\nenhancement.   This argument is based  on Torres' assumptions\nthat violations of 21 U.S.C.  844 cannot result in a sentence\nenhancement and that, had Torres' prior possession of cocaine\noffense  been  prosecuted under  21  U.S.C.   844, his  prior\nconviction could not have  triggered the enhanced sentence he\nnow endures.\n\n                             -7-\n\ncert. denied, 481 U.S. 1006 (1987); United States v. Johnson,\n                                                            \n\nsupra.   However,  21  U.S.C.   841(b)  was  amended  by  the\n     \n\nComprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984.  See Pub. L. 98-473,\n                                             \n\nTit. II,   502, 98 Stat. 1976, 2068.   See also United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Rivera,   996  F.2d   993,  1000-01   &amp;  n.4   (9th  Cir.\n          \n\n1993)(dissenting  opinion  discussing legislative  history of\n\n 841).  At the  time of  Torres' offense,  as now,  21 U.S.C.\n\n 841(b)(1)(B) explicitly authorized enhanced penalties on the\n\nbasis  of  prior state  felony  convictions.   Possession  of\n\ncocaine  is  a felony  under Rhode  Island  law.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nAmaral v.  INS, 977 F.2d 33,  36 n.3 (1st Cir.  1992).  Thus,\n              \n\nTorres'  contention that  he could  not be  subjected to  the\n\nenhanced penalties in  21 U.S.C.  841(b)  based on his  prior\n\nstate conviction is plainly meritless.  The fact that Torres'\n\nprior  offense may only have amounted  to a misdemeanor under\n\n21  U.S.C.  844 is irrelevant  given the plain  wording of 21\n\nU.S.C.  841(b)(1)(B).7     \n\n                    \n\n7.  Torres  errs in  asserting that  violations of  21 U.S.C.\n 844 may never support a sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C.\n 841.    To  be   sure,  \"absent  prior  convictions,  simple\npossession is not  a felony  under federal law.\"   Amaral  v.\n                                                         \nINS,  977 F.2d at 36.  Thus, under circumstances where simple\n   \npossession  is only a  misdemeanor, a violation  of 21 U.S.C.\n 844  cannot be used to invoke the recidivist penalties of 21\nU.S.C.   841, which  require  that prior  convictions be  for\nfelonies.   \"However, one  prior conviction turns  possession\ninto a felony since  the maximum penalty increases to  over a\nyear.\"  Id.    Thus,  prior convictions for violations  of 21\n           \nU.S.C.  844  which constitute felonies  may support  sentence\nenhancements under 21 U.S.C.  841.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     The record also  contradicts Torres' assertion that  the\n\nprosecutor  failed to  file  the information  required by  21\n\nU.S.C.  851(a)(1).  The information was filed on September 6,\n\n1989  and served  by mail  on Torres'  counsel on  that date.\n\nMoreover,  we think  that the  information  was substantively\n\nadequate.   The  information  clearly specified the  date and\n\nplace  of  Torres'  prior  conviction,  that  the  conviction\n\ninvolved a  felony (possession  of cocaine) and  the sentence\n\nthat Torres  received.8 Torres' reliance on  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nWirsing, supra, is  misplaced, for the  851 information which\n              \n\nwas held defective in that case wholly failed to identify the\n\ndefendant's  prior  conviction.    We  also  think  that  the\n\ninformation's  reference to  21 U.S.C.   851 was  adequate to\n\nplace Torres, who was represented  by counsel, on notice that\n\nthe government intended to  seek a sentence enhancement based\n\non Torres' prior  conviction.  Cf. United States v. Belanger,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n8.  The Information provided, in relevant part, that:\n\n     The  said defendant,  on or  about the 13th  day of\n     September, 1988, in the  state of Rhode Island, was\n     duly convicted of possession of  cocaine, a felony,\n     in violation of Rhode  Island General Laws, and was\n     sentenced  on said  date to  a  three year  term of\n     imprisonment,  sentence suspended, and a three year\n     term of probation.   All in violation  of Title 21,\n     United States Code, Section 851. \n\n                             -9-\n\n970 F.2d 416, 419 (7th Cir.  1992)(noting that \"[s]ection 851\n\ndoes  not  specify  the   particular  form  which  notice  of\n\nenhancement must take...\").\n\n     Finally, we note that  the Presentence Report shows that\n\nTorres  received   only  one  criminal  history  point  under\n\n 4A1.1(c), thus  there was no  double counting.   And,  since\n\nTorres was subject to the enhanced mandatory minimum ten-year\n\nprison  term, his criminal  history score did  not affect his\n\nsentence.\n\n     Accordingly,  the  judgment  of  the  district  court is\n\naffirmed.                          \n        \n\n                             -10-\n",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are not in dispute.  On May 23, 1989, Torres and six codefendants were indicted on two counts of possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), and conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute the said heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846.  On October 4, 1989, Torres pled guilty to the possession with intent to distribute charge pursuant to a plea agreement with the government.  That offense was punishable by a mandatory minimum of five years' imprisonment and at least four years of supervised release if the crime did not result in death or serious bodily injury and the offender had no prior convictions for violations of Sec. 841(a) or for other felonies relating to narcotic drugs.  However, if the offender had such a prior conviction, the offense was punishable by an enhanced mandatory minimum of ten years' imprisonment and at least eight years of supervised release, assuming neither death nor serious bodily injury resulted from the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that, in return for Torres' guilty plea on count one, the government agreed to dismiss count two and to recommend that Torres receive ten years' imprisonment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, 1989, the district court sentenced Torres to the enhanced mandatory minimum of ten years' imprisonment and eight years of supervised release.  The enhancement was based on Torres' prior Rhode Island state conviction for possession of cocaine.  The conspiracy charge was dismissed on the government's motion.  Although Torres appealed his sentence, that appeal was subsequently dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 24, 1992, Torres filed the 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 motion that is the subject of this appeal.  That motion, which was supported by a memorandum, attacked Torres' sentence on three grounds.  First, Torres alleged that state convictions could not support a sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b).  In support of this assertion, Torres cited  United States v. Johnson, 506 F.2d 305 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 1005 (1975), a case which held that the double penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(A) could only be applied if a prior conviction had been obtained under federal law.  See 506 F.2d at 307.  In connection with this first point, Torres also contended that his prior conviction for simple possession of cocaine was the equivalent of a violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844, which describes the federal penalties for simple possession of controlled substances.  Torres asserted that no federal law allowed violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 to be used as a basis for invoking the double penalties prescribed in 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, therefore, Torres' prior conviction, treated as a violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844, could not support his enhanced sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres' second ground for Sec. 2255 relief alleged that the government failed to file an information notifying Torres of its intent to seek to enhance his sentence based on his prior conviction, as required by 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Third,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres argued that the probation officer engaged in improper double counting in computing Torres' criminal history under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G., Nov. 1989).  Torres specifically complained that points were improperly added under Sec. 4A1.1(c) and Sec. 4A1.1(d).  Marshalling these claims, Torres asked the district court to reduce his enhanced sentence to seventy months' imprisonment and four years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed an objection to Torres' 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 motion and a supporting memorandum which is not in the record before us.  On February 19, 1993, the district court issued an order denying relief.  The court specifically found that the government had filed and served the requisite 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851(a)(1) information, that 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B) expressly authorizes sentence enhancements based on prior state convictions, and that Torres' objection to the calculation of his criminal history category was meritless since U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.1(b) required that Torres be sentenced to the mandatory statutory minimum prison and supervised release terms, thus rendering his criminal history score irrelevant.<sup>4</sup>  Judgment entered for the government on February 22, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that Torres filed a reply to the government's objection to his Sec. 2255 motion which set forth additional arguments in favor of Torres' request for resentencing.  Specifically, Torres alleged that the \"Information\" which the government purportedly filed under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851 in fact had been filed in response to the defendants' discovery requests, had no nexus with that information required by 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851, and was fatally defective under  United States v. Wirsing, 662 F. Supp. 199, 200 (D. Nev. 1987), because it did not mention that the government intended to seek an enhanced sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Torres' certificate of service indicates that he mailed this reply on</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">February 17, 1993, two days before the district court issued its order denying relief and four days before judgment for the government was entered.  It appears that the district court did not consider this reply before it entered its decision, for the docket sheet indicates that the reply was not docketed until March 2, 1993, after judgment had been entered and the case had been closed.  In any event, Torres filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have allowed Torres to proceed on the memorandum he filed in the district court in lieu of filing a brief on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Having reviewed the record thoroughly, we conclude that the district court's analysis was correct.  It is true that when 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) was originally enacted, it did not subject defendants with prior state court drug convictions to enhanced penalties as repeat offenders.  Rather, this statute initially allowed sentence enhancements only for prior federal felony-drug violations.   See, e.g., United States v. Gates, 807 F.2d 1075, 1082 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1006 (1987);  United States v. Johnson, supra.  However, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) was amended by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984.  See Pub. L. 98-473, Tit.  II, Sec. 502, 98 Stat. 1976, 2068.   See also United States v. Rivera, 996 F.2d 993, 1000-01 &amp; n.4 (9th Cir. 1993)(dissenting opinion discussing legislative history of Sec. 841).  At the time of Torres' offense, as now, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B) explicitly authorized enhanced penalties on the basis of prior state felony convictions.  Possession of cocaine is a felony under Rhode Island law.   See, e.g., Amaral v. INS, 977 F.2d 33, 36 n.3 (1st Cir. 1992).  Thus, Torres' contention that he could not be subjected to the enhanced penalties in 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) based on his prior state conviction is plainly meritless.  The fact that Torres' prior offense may only have amounted to a misdemeanor under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 is irrelevant given the plain wording of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also contradicts Torres' assertion that the prosecutor failed to file the information required by 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851(a)(1).  The information was filed on September 6, 1989 and served by mail on Torres' counsel on that date.  Moreover, we think that the information was substantively adequate.  The information clearly specified the date and place of Torres' prior conviction, that the conviction involved a felony (possession of cocaine) and the sentence that Torres received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Torres' reliance on United States v. Wirsing, supra, is misplaced, for the Sec. 851 information which was held defective in that case wholly failed to identify the defendant's prior conviction.  We also think that the information's reference to 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851 was adequate to place Torres, who was represented by counsel, on notice that the government intended to seek a sentence enhancement based on Torres' prior conviction.  Cf. United States v. Belanger,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">970 F.2d 416, 419 (7th Cir. 1992)(noting that \"[s]ection 851 does not specify the particular form which notice of enhancement must take ...\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that the Presentence Report shows that Torres received only one criminal history point under Sec. 4A1.1(c), thus there was no double counting.  And, since Torres was subject to the enhanced mandatory minimum ten-year prison term, his criminal history score did not affect his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C.

This claim was not properly before the district court since it was not raised in Torres' Sec. 2255 motion.  Thus, we are unable to effectively review this claim.   See Barrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184, 1188 (1st Cir. 1992)(holding plaintiff failed to raise Jencks Act claim in a timely manner below where claim was first asserted in plaintiff's reply to government's response to plaintiff's amended Sec. 2255 motion).  Moreover, Torres' filings with this court do not seek appellate review of this issue.  Thus, we do not address it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Torres has also filed a reply brief which emphasizes that, in his view, Congress did not intend the crime of simple possession of cocaine to trigger a sentence enhancement.  This argument is based on Torres' assumptions that violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 cannot result in a sentence enhancement and that, had Torres' prior possession of cocaine offense been prosecuted under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844, his prior conviction could not have triggered the enhanced sentence he now endures</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Torres errs in asserting that violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 may never support a sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841.  To be sure, \"absent prior convictions, simple possession is not a felony under federal law.\"   Amaral v. INS, 977 F.2d at 36.  Thus, under circumstances where simple possession is only a misdemeanor, a violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 cannot be used to invoke the recidivist penalties of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, which require that prior convictions be for felonies.  \"However, one prior conviction turns possession into a felony since the maximum penalty increases to over a year.\"  Id. Thus, prior convictions for violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 which constitute felonies may support sentence enhancements under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The Information provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n        <p>The said defendant, on or about the 13th day of September, 1988, in the state of Rhode Island, was duly convicted of possession of cocaine, a felony, in violation of Rhode Island General Laws, and was sentenced on said date to a three year term of imprisonment, sentence suspended, and a three year term of probation.

Johnson, supra.  However, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) was amended by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984.  See Pub. L. 98-473, Tit.  II, Sec. 502, 98 Stat. 1976, 2068.   See also United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609811\"><a href=\"/opinion/609811/united-states-v-silvestre-m-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 1000-01 &amp; n.4 (9th Cir. 1993)(dissenting opinion discussing legislative history of Sec. 841).  At the time of Torres' offense, as now, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B) explicitly authorized enhanced penalties on the basis of prior state felony convictions.  Possession of cocaine is a felony under Rhode Island law.   See, e.g., Amaral v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592216\"><a href=\"/opinion/592216/antonio-amaral-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 36 n.3 (1st Cir. 1992).  Thus, Torres' contention that he could not be subjected to the enhanced penalties in 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) based on his prior state conviction is plainly meritless.  The fact that Torres' prior offense may only have amounted to a misdemeanor under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 is irrelevant given the plain wording of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also contradicts Torres' assertion that the prosecutor failed to file the information required by 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851(a)(1).  The information was filed on September 6, 1989 and served by mail on Torres' counsel on that date.  Moreover, we think that the information was substantively adequate.  The information clearly specified the date and place of Torres' prior conviction, that the conviction involved a felony (possession of cocaine) and the sentence that Torres received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Torres' reliance on United States v. Wirsing, supra, is misplaced, for the Sec. 851 information which was held defective in that case wholly failed to identify the defendant's prior conviction.  We also think that the information's reference to 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851 was adequate to place Torres, who was represented by counsel, on notice that the government intended to seek a sentence enhancement based on Torres' prior conviction.  Cf. United States v. Belanger,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587335\"><a href=\"/opinion/587335/united-states-v-david-m-belanger/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span>, 419 (7th Cir. 1992)(noting that \"[s]ection 851 does not specify the particular form which notice of enhancement must take ...\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that the Presentence Report shows that Torres received only one criminal history point under Sec. 4A1.1(c), thus there was no double counting.  And, since Torres was subject to the enhanced mandatory minimum ten-year prison term, his criminal history score did not affect his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C.

This claim was not properly before the district court since it was not raised in Torres' Sec. 2255 motion.  Thus, we are unable to effectively review this claim.   See Barrett v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584145\"><a href=\"/opinion/584145/james-barrett-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1188 (1st Cir. 1992)(holding plaintiff failed to raise Jencks Act claim in a timely manner below where claim was first asserted in plaintiff's reply to government's response to plaintiff's amended Sec. 2255 motion).  Moreover, Torres' filings with this court do not seek appellate review of this issue.  Thus, we do not address it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Torres has also filed a reply brief which emphasizes that, in his view, Congress did not intend the crime of simple possession of cocaine to trigger a sentence enhancement.  This argument is based on Torres' assumptions that violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 cannot result in a sentence enhancement and that, had Torres' prior possession of cocaine offense been prosecuted under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844, his prior conviction could not have triggered the enhanced sentence he now endures</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Torres errs in asserting that violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 may never support a sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841.  To be sure, \"absent prior convictions, simple possession is not a felony under federal law.\"   Amaral v. INS, 977 F.2d at 36.  Thus, under circumstances where simple possession is only a misdemeanor, a violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 cannot be used to invoke the recidivist penalties of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, which require that prior convictions be for felonies.  \"However, one prior conviction turns possession into a felony since the maximum penalty increases to over a year.\"  Id. Thus, prior convictions for violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844 which constitute felonies may support sentence enhancements under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The Information provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n        <p>The said defendant, on or about the 13th day of September, 1988, in the state of Rhode Island, was duly convicted of possession of cocaine, a felony, in violation of Rhode Island General Laws, and was sentenced on said date to a three year term of imprisonment, sentence suspended, and a three year term of probation.
