Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael O.

Upon returning from vacation\n\nin Jamaica, Dudley Thompson was terminated by The Coca-Cola Company\n\n(\"Coca-Cola\") for failure to follow office procedure including not\n\nfinding someone to cover his shifts while he was away.            Thompson\n\nalleges that he suffered discrimination based on his race and\n\nnational    origin   in   addition   to    retaliation   for   engaging   in\n\nprotected conduct. The district court granted summary judgment for\n\nCoca-Cola.     Thompson appeals.      After careful consideration, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I. Background\n\n            We recite the facts from the record in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmovant, Thompson. See Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't\n\nof Veteran Affairs, 514 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            Thompson, an African-American of Jamaican origin, started\n\nworking for Coca-Cola in 2000 as one of four production supervisors\n\nin the quality assurance department at Coca-Cola's Northampton\n\nplant.1    Gerald Goodsell, who Thompson alleges made discriminatory\n\ncomments, oversaw the production supervisors and served as an\n\ninterim production manager from August 2003 until December 2003,\n\nwhen Dennis Williams transferred from another plant to take over\n\nduties as production manager at the Northampton plant.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Marin Duval, Diego García, and Sean Rutherford, who are white,\nLatino, and African-American, respectively, were the other three\nproduction supervisors at the time Thompson was terminated.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            Throughout most of Thompson's tenure at Coca-Cola, he\n\nperformed well.    On a few occasions, however, he was reprimanded\n\nfor being late to work.      Production managers also gave Thompson\n\nfrequent informal \"coaching sessions\" aimed at helping him improve\n\nhis performance.\n\n            According to Thompson, in late 2002 or early 2003,\n\nGoodsell expressed irritation at an African-American disc jockey's\n\nselection of reggae music at the annual Christmas party.         Thompson\n\nalleges that Goodsell said, \"I hate Jamaican music and Jamaicans.\"\n\nThompson asserts he did not report the comment because he feared\n\nretaliation and termination. Thompson also alleges that on another\n\noccasion, in or about August or September 2003, Goodsell said to\n\nhim, \"I'll deal with you, you fucking Jamaican.\"         Thompson claims\n\nthat Goodsell told him more than once that he was going to \"deal\n\nwith him\" and that Goodsell made other threatening and harassing\n\ncomments.    Thompson does not provide any specifics, nor does he\n\nallege   that   any   of   these     other   comments   were   racial   or\n\ndiscriminatory in nature.\n\n            In April 2002, Donna Harris, a white female quality\n\nassurance supervisor who was not in Thompson's chain of command,\n\nsaid to Ronald McKeithen (Thompson's co-worker who is also of\n\nJamaican origin), \"I'm not one of [Thompson's] Jamaican bimbos.\"\n\nThompson and McKeithen reported the incident to John Newton, the\n\nquality assurance manager.         Newton informed Celine Lasonde, the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fhuman resources manager, and Lasonde instructed Newton to sit down\n\nwith Harris and discuss her inappropriate comments.           Harris was\n\ninstructed to apologize to McKeithen (which she did), and she was\n\nalso required to undergo sensitivity training.           Thompson claims\n\nthat after this incident and Harris's reprimand, she retaliated\n\nagainst him by using her position to negatively impact his work.2\n\n           On August 29, 2003, in response to coverage problems\n\ncaused by shift-swapping, the plant manager, James Lane, sent an\n\ne-mail to all of the production supervisors outlining procedures\n\nfor vacation time.     Supervisors were instructed that they should\n\n\"(1)   obtain   coverage   from   another   production   supervisor;   (2)\n\nrequest personal vacation time from the direct manager in writing;\n\n(3) notify the other production supervisors; and (4) enter the\n\nrequested vacation time into a computerized spreadsheet.\"         Though\n\nit was protocol to give advance notice, Coca-Cola acknowledges that\n\nthere was no advance-notice requirement and no formal policy\n\nimplemented with respect to vacation time.\n\n           In the fall of 2003, Thompson realized that he needed\n\ndental surgery, and he decided to have the surgery performed in\n\nJamaica because the procedure would cost less.           By December, he\n\nneeded urgent dental attention, and he claims that he informed the\n\n\n2\n   Thompson and Harris seem to have had a contentious relationship\nfor some time. In 2002, Thompson complained to management that\nHarris had taken unapproved leave. In fact, she had requested and\nreceived approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29\nU.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fmanagement that he needed to travel to Jamaica to have dental work\n\ndone immediately. Thompson asserts that he spoke to Héctor Lepage,\n\nhis \"leader\",3 about the dental surgery in early December 2003 and\n\nthen told one of the other supervisors, Duval, about his proposed\n\ntime off.   Thompson claims that Duval agreed to cover his shifts.\n\nThompson also claims that he told Duval that he might need extra\n\ntime off, but he could not be sure until he was in Jamaica and had\n\nan opportunity to see his dentist.           Thompson says that Duval\n\napproved and asked him to send him an e-mail confirming the\n\ndetails. Thompson sent Duval the confirmatory e-mail at 10:27 p.m.\n\non December 18, 2003.   Duval did not read the e-mail from Thompson\n\nuntil the next time he reported to work, which was on December 21,\n\n2003.   Duval claims he did not know the exact dates Thompson would\n\nbe away, including the possibility of the extra week off, until he\n\nread the e-mail.\n\n            Thompson asserts that after he arranged coverage with\n\nDuval, he spoke to Dennis Williams, who gave him approval, so long\n\nas Goodsell was informed as well.       Thompson called Goodsell at his\n\nhome on December 19, 2003, at around 7 p.m., the evening before his\n\nearly-morning flight to Jamaica.        Goodsell did not tell Thompson\n\nthat he could not take time off; Goodsell's only concern was\n\ncoverage for Thompson's shifts.     Thompson entered his time off on\n\n\n\n3\n   Though Thompson refers to Lepage as his \"leader,\" the record\nreflects that Lepage was actually Thompson's subordinate.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthe spreadsheet through the end of December.          He did not request\n\ntime off in writing.      As a result of Thompson's leave, Goodsell had\n\nto fill in as production supervisor at some point, and Duval had to\n\nwork over forty consecutive days.\n\n            Once he was in Jamaica, Thompson realized that he would\n\nnot be back until January 9, 2004, because his surgery would take\n\nlonger than he initially expected.         Thompson called Coca-Cola to\n\ninform management that he would need extra time; he left a message\n\non Goodsell's voice-mail. Goodsell did not respond to Thompson's\n\nmessage.    Thompson assumed that his extension had been approved by\n\nGoodsell.    Goodsell, however, reported to Lasonde and Lane that\n\nThompson    failed   to   comply   with   vacation   protocol.   Lasonde\n\ninterviewed Rutherford, García, Duval, and Goodsell to discuss\n\nThompson's leave.      After Thompson returned from Jamaica, he was\n\ngiven an opportunity to discuss the situation in a meeting with\n\nGoodsell, Lane, Lasonde, and Williams.\n\n            At the meeting, Thompson contested Coca-Cola's version of\n\nthe events surrounding his vacation.       He did not make any claims at\n\nthe time that Goodsell had been racially biased against him.\n\nShortly after that meeting, Lasonde, Williams, and Lane sent a\n\n\"Separation Proposal\" to the Coca-Cola Separation Review Committee\n\nin Atlanta, Georgia.      The Separation Review Committee agreed with\n\nthe Separation Proposal and terminated Thompson.         Thompson claims\n\nthat it is clear that Goodsell was an integral part of his\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\ftermination and that he was retaliated against because of his race\n\nand   national   origin.    According   to   Coca-Cola,   Thompson   was\n\nterminated solely for taking unauthorized vacation time without\n\ngiving prior proper notice.\n\n           Thompson filed a claim with the Massachusetts Commission\n\nAgainst Discrimination on April 30, 2004, arguing that he had been\n\ndiscriminated against, harassed, and retaliated against based upon\n\nhis race, ethnicity, color, national origin, and ancestry under\n\nchapter 151B of the General Laws of Massachusetts.            Thompson\n\nwithdrew his complaint with the Commission on August 20, 2004, and\n\nfiled suit in Hampshire County Superior Court on May 23, 2005.\n\nCoca-Cola removed the case to federal court on July 19, 2005.\n\nCoca-Cola then filed a motion for summary judgment on August 31,\n\n2006.    The district court granted the motion on July 16, 2007.\n\nThompson appealed.\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\n           A.    Standard of Review\n\n           Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   When considering arguments for summary judgment, \"we must\n\ndisregard improbable or overly attenuated inferences, unsupported\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fconclusions, and rank speculation.\"      Abbott v. Bragdon, 107 F.3d\n\n934, 938 (1st Cir. 1997), vacated on other grounds, 524 U.S. 624\n\n(1998).     To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the evidence\n\noffered by the adverse party cannot be \"merely colorable\" or\n\nspeculative.    Pegano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986))\n\n(internal    quotation   marks   omitted).   The   evidence   \"must   be\n\nsignificantly probative of specific facts.\"        Pérez v. Volvo Car\n\nCorp., 247 F.3d 303, 317 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S.\n\nat 249).    \"A dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is\n\nsuch that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of\n\nthe non-moving party.\" Sánchez v. Alvarado, 101 F.3d 223, 227 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).           \"A\n\nfact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome\n\nof the litigation.\"      Maymí v. P.R. Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).    We review a district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo.     See Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367,\n\n1372 (1st Cir. 1995).     We will reverse only if, \"after reviewing\n\nthe facts and making all inferences in favor of the non-moving\n\nparty [here, Thompson], the evidence on record is sufficiently\n\nopen-ended to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in\n\nfavor of either side.\"     Maymí, 515 F.3d at 25 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f            B.    Analysis\n\n            First, Thompson argues that he has provided sufficient\n\nevidence that he was terminated based on his race and national\n\norigin.     Even if Goodsell was not officially responsible for the\n\ndecision to terminate, Thompson argues that Goodsell had enormous\n\ninfluence    in   the   process.      Thompson    argues     that   the   causal\n\nconnection between the decision to terminate him and Goodsell's\n\ndiscriminatory comments is not broken since the Separation Review\n\nCommittee acted on biased information without conducting its own\n\nindependent investigation.         See Cariglia v. Hertz Equipment Rental\n\nCorp., 363 F.3d 77, 84-85 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Second, Thompson asserts that he was exposed to a hostile\n\nwork environment through Goodsell's comments, Harris's comments,\n\nand    Goodsell's    failure   to     follow    Coca-Cola's     policies    and\n\nprocedures.       He contends that the district court erred when it\n\ncharacterized Goodsell's alleged comments as stray, and, therefore,\n\ninsufficient to prove claims of a hostile work environment or\n\ndiscriminatory termination.         Thompson maintains that he suffered\n\nretaliation because he engaged in protected conduct and was given\n\npoor   performance      evaluations    upon    which   his   termination    was\n\nostensibly based.\n\n            We do not find support for Thompson's arguments and\n\nreject them in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f                   1.    Race and National Origin Discrimination\n\n           To make out a prima facie case of discrimination under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(1),4 Thompson must prove that he \"is\n\na member of a protected class, [that he] suffered harm as a result\n\nof [Coca-Cola's] adverse employment action, and [that Coca-Cola]\n\nharbored discriminatory animus, which was the determinative cause\n\nof the adverse action.\"        Weber v. Cmty. Teamwork, Inc., 752 N.E.2d\n\n700, 711 (Mass. 2001); Lewis v. City of Boston, 321 F.3d 207, 213-\n\n14 (1st Cir. 2003) (construing Massachusetts law).           Thompson bears\n\nthe burden of proving discrimination. See Blare v. Husky Injection\n\nMolding Sys. Boston, Inc., 646 N.E.2d 111, 117 (Mass. 1995).\n\n           Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis, we\n\nemploy a familiar three-stage framework in evaluating claims for\n\ndiscrimination.     See    Wheelock    Coll.   v.   Mass.   Comm'n    Against\n\nDiscrimination, 355 N.E.2d 309, 314 (Mass. 1976).           Thompson bears\n\nthe   initial   burden    of    establishing   a    prima   facie    case   of\n\ndiscrimination.    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792,\n\n\n4\n    The statute reads in relevant part:\n\n      It shall be an unlawful practice: 1. For an employer, by\n      himself or his agent, because of the race, color,\n      religious    creed,   national   origin,   sex,    sexual\n      orientation, which shall not include persons whose sexual\n      orientation involves minor children as the sex object,\n      genetic information, or ancestry of any individual to\n      refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from\n      employment such individual or to discriminate against\n      such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions\n      or privileges of employment, unless based upon a bona\n      fide occupational qualification.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f802 (1973).     The burden then shifts to Coca-Cola \"to present a\n\nlegitimate,    non-discriminatory       reason,       sufficient     to   raise   a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether it discriminated\n\nagainst [Thompson], for the employment decision.\"                    Quiñones v.\n\nBuick,   436   F.3d   284,    289    (1st    Cir.     2006).      \"[Coca-Cola's]\n\nobligation is one of production as opposed to persuasion, as the\n\nburden of persuasion remains with [Thompson].\"                 Lewis, 321 F.3d at\n\n214.     If    Coca-Cola     meets   its     burden    and     provides   a   non-\n\ndiscriminatory     justification      for     Thompson's       termination,    the\n\n\"presumption of discrimination disappears,\" and the burden shifts\n\nback to Thompson, who must demonstrate that Coca-Cola's decision\n\nwas merely a pretext \"to hide such discrimination.\"                 Id.\n\n            We must first determine whether Thompson makes out a\n\nprima facie claim for race discrimination.              It is undisputed that\n\nThompson is a member of a protected class because he is an African-\n\nAmerican.      His termination was an adverse employment action.\n\nTaking the facts in the light most favorable to Thompson, he makes\n\na claim that he was terminated for discriminatory reasons because\n\nhe is of Jamaican origin and Goodsell made numerous discriminatory\n\ncomments about Jamaicans and threatened to \"deal with him.\" He has\n\nmet his burden for the first prong of the test.                   The burden now\n\nshifts to Coca-Cola to present a non-discriminatory reason for\n\nterminating him.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f          The     record   reflects      that    Coca-Cola's       decision    to\n\nterminate Thompson was based on Thompson's failure to follow office\n\nprocedure with regard to vacation leave.             Thompson did not put his\n\nvacation request in writing, and he did not secure the appropriate\n\ncoverage for the days that he would be away.               The record reflects\n\nthat Duval told Lasonde that Thompson had not secured coverage for\n\nhis shifts in advance.         Duval maintains that he did not have\n\nconfirmation of the dates Thompson was going to be away until\n\nDecember 23, 2003; he received an e-mail the night before Thompson\n\ndeparted for Jamaica. Thompson acknowledges that his first contact\n\nwith his direct supervisor, Goodsell, about his leave was only\n\nhours before he departed for Jamaica.           He admits that he failed to\n\nfollow any of the required steps of the protocol for his one-week\n\nextension of the vacation because he merely relied on a unilateral\n\nvoice-mail to Goodsell.       He also did not enter the vacation period\n\ninto the company's computerized vacation spreadsheet.               These facts\n\nare supported by evidence, including Thompson's own admissions.\n\nFurthermore, Thompson acknowledged that violation of procedures\n\nwould constitute a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his\n\ntermination.      Coca-Cola    thus    met    its    burden   of   producing     a\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Thompson.\n\n          Since     Coca-Cola      has       shown     a    legitimate,       non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for terminating Thompson, the burden shifts\n\nback to Thompson.     Thompson \"can no longer rest on the initial\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\finference of discrimination but, rather, must show that [Coca-\n\nCola's] articulated reason is pretextual.\" Bennett v. Saint-Gobian\n\nCorp.,   507 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir. 2007).    \"To meet this burden,\n\n[Thompson] must prove not only that the reason articulated by the\n\nemployer was a sham, but also that its true reason was plaintiff's\n\nrace or national origin.\"    Rodríguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc., 181 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Under settled discrimination law, to demonstrate that\n\nits stated reasons for terminating Thompson were not pretextual,\n\nCoca-Cola's explanation need not be perfect.   See Mesnick v. Gen.\n\nElec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Courts may not sit\n\nas super personnel departments, assessing the merits -- or even\n\nrationality     --   of   employers'   nondiscriminatory   business\n\ndecisions.\").    Coca-Cola's reasons for terminating Thompson must\n\nsimply be legitimate and not a cover-up for discrimination.    See\n\nLoeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1012 n.6 (1st Cir. 1979)\n\n(\"While an employer's judgment or course of action may seem poor or\n\nerroneous to outsiders, the relevant question is simply whether the\n\ngiven reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination. . . . [The]\n\nfocus is to be on the employer's motivation, . . . not on its\n\nbusiness judgment.\"); T&S Serv. Assoc., Inc. v. Crenson, 666 F.2d\n\n722, 727 (1st Cir. 1981).   If there is no proof of discriminatory\n\nanimus on the part of a decisionmaker, a plaintiff must show more\n\nthan that the decisionmaker's perception was incorrect; he must\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fshow that the \"decisionmaker did not believe in the accuracy\" of\n\nthe information that he was given.          Bennett, 507 F.3d at 31.      Put\n\nanother way, \"[t]he question is not whether [Thompson's] or his\n\nfellow   employees'   version   is    the   true   one,   but   whether   [the\n\ndecisionmakers] believed what [they] had been told by those [who\n\nwere] interviewed\" by management.           Ronda-Pérez v. Banco Bilbao\n\nVizcaya Argentaria, 404 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Coca-Cola posits that the only real issue for the court\n\nto decide is whether the Separation Review Committee acted with\n\ndiscriminatory animus.    We agree.\n\n           Thompson makes no allegation that the Separation Review\n\nCommittee had any bias of its own against Thompson.              \"Actionable\n\ndiscrimination cannot exist in a vacuum. Rather the discriminatory\n\nintent of which a plaintiff complains must be traceable to the\n\nperson or persons who made the decision to fire him.\"           Bennett, 507\n\nF.3d at 31.   Thompson cannot meet this burden.           His allegations of\n\nstray remarks made by Harris and Goodsell are insufficient to prove\n\nthat the Separation Review Committee was somehow biased against\n\nhim.\n\n           Harris was a non-decisionmaker, and a comment such as\n\nhers \"cannot support an inference of pretext because it was one\n\nstray remark, and was made by a non-decision maker.\"              Velázquez-\n\nFernández v. NCE Foods, Inc., 476 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(citing González v. El Día, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fHarris had no role in Thompson's termination, and her comment is\n\nimmaterial.      First, the comment was not made to Thompson.        Second,\n\nmanagement at the plant responded immediately, reprimanded her, and\n\nrequired   her    to   apologize.   Third,   Harris   did   not    supervise\n\nThompson and was not in a position to affect his work.         See Douglas\n\nv. J.C. Penney Co., 474 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"[plaintiff]\n\nidentifies at most one possibly racially-tinged comment by a\n\nco-worker who was not [plaintiff's] supervisor and as such is\n\nirrelevant\").      Remarks by non-decisionmakers are not probative of\n\ncontext.   See Medina-Muñoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d\n\n5, 10 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"the biases of one who neither makes nor\n\ninfluences the challenged personnel decision are not probative in\n\nan employment discrimination case\").\n\n           Goodsell's     alleged   comments,   two   of   three   of   which\n\npreceded Thompson's termination by over a year and none of which\n\ninvolved the termination process, can be characterized as nothing\n\nother than stray.       This circuit has held that \"'stray workplace\n\nremarks' . . . normally are insufficient, standing alone, to\n\nestablish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.\"\n\nEl Día, Inc., 304 F.3d at 69; see also Straughn v. Delta Air Lines,\n\nInc., 250 F.3d 23, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).            Goodsell's input was\n\nminimal and consistent with Thompson's own account of the events.\n\n\"Despite a retaliatory or discriminatory motive on the part of a\n\nsupervisor who recommends that some adverse action be taken against\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fan employee, a third person's independent decision to take adverse\n\naction    breaks      the   causal   connection      between       the   supervisor's\n\nretaliatory or discriminatory animus and the adverse action.\" Mole\n\nv. Univ. of Mass., 814 N.E.2d 329, 343 (Mass. 2004).                       The record\n\nreflects that Goodsell's input was limited and that the Separation\n\nReview Committee made its own independent decision to terminate\n\nThompson based on the facts of the situation.                            In Mole, the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said that \"[w]hen assessing\n\nthe independence of the ultimate decision maker, courts place\n\nconsiderable emphasis on the decision makers giving the employee\n\nthe opportunity to address the allegations in question.\"                       Id. at\n\n344. Coca-Cola gave Thompson such an opportunity, and he failed to\n\nadequately      explain     his   actions    or     even    give    a    substantially\n\ndifferent account of events.             Instead, he acknowledged that he did\n\nnot follow proper procedures.\n\n            Contrary to arguments made by Thompson, Cariglia is\n\ninapposite.        Among other reasons, in Cariglia, the defendant's\n\ndecision to terminate the plaintiff was based upon a report drafted\n\nby a discriminatory supervisor, and the defendant did not conduct\n\nany further investigation or ask the employee for his version of\n\nevents.   Cariglia, 363 F.3d at 81-82.              In examining those facts we\n\nnoted    that    \"the    critical    legal       issue    [is]   whether    corporate\n\nliability       can     attach    when    neutral        decisionmakers      rely   on\n\ninformation that is manipulated by another employee who harbors\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fillegitimate animus.\"       Id. at 86.    We remanded the case to the\n\ndistrict court to address whether information was withheld from the\n\nneutral decisionmakers, but we noted that our decision may have\n\nbeen different if Cariglia had been given a meaningful opportunity\n\nto address the reasons for his termination.       See id. at 87 n.4.\n\n            Thompson     argues   that    there   was    no    meaningful\n\ninvestigation into what happened, and that the Separation Review\n\nCommittee based its decision on a biased account by Goodsell.         The\n\nrecord demonstrates that this is patently false.        Lasonde convened\n\na meeting with everyone involved while Thompson was still in\n\nJamaica to gather information about what transpired.          She also met\n\nwith Thompson, Goodsell, Lane, and Williams immediately after\n\nThompson returned from his trip and gave him an opportunity to\n\nexplain himself.       He did not contradict Goodsell's version of\n\nevents, except to say that he had coverage, that he was not really\n\nrequired to submit his request in writing (even though he admitted\n\nto receiving a previous e-mail from management outlining that leave\n\nrequests must be submitted in writing), and that he asked Duval to\n\ncover his shifts.      But \"the mere existence of some alleged factual\n\ndispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly\n\nsupported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that\n\nthere be no genuine issue of material fact.\"      Anderson, 477 U.S. at\n\n247-48.   Thompson did not make any allegations against Goodsell at\n\nthe time.    Thompson presents no evidence that Goodsell made the\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fdecision to terminate him, nor can he point to any information in\n\nLasonde's    Separation      Proposal    Memorandum     provided    by    Goodsell\n\nwithout corroboration by Thompson himself or other employees. This\n\nis not a situation where Goodsell \"conceal[ed] relevant information\n\nfrom the decisionmak[ers] . . . or [fed] false information to\n\n[them], [and was] able to influence the decision.\"                 Cariglia, 363\n\nF.3d at 87 (quoting        Wallace v. SMC Pneumatics, 103 F.3d 1394, 1400\n\n(7th Cir. 1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Lasonde's       recommendation     to    the     Separation       Review\n\nCommittee was based on record evidence, an investigation of the\n\nsituation,    and     reflected   her    belief     that    Thompson    should    be\n\nterminated for taking unauthorized vacation.                   Thompson has not\n\nshown that his termination was in any way a result of racial or\n\nnational origin discrimination.           His claims fail.\n\n                      2.   Harassment and Retaliation\n\n            In looking at a claim for hostile work environment, we\n\nassess whether a plaintiff \"was subjected to severe or pervasive\n\nharassment     that    materially    altered      the      conditions    of   [his]\n\nemployment.\"    Noviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 92 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (citing Faragher v. City of Boca Ratón, 524 U.S. 775, 786\n\n(1998)).    To sustain a claim of hostile work environment, Thompson\n\nmust demonstrate that \"the harassment was sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive so as to alter the conditions of [his] employment and\n\ncreate an abusive work environment\" and that the \"[racially]\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fobjectionable    conduct   was    both     objectively   and   subjectively\n\noffensive, such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or\n\nabusive and [that Thompson] in fact did perceive it to be so.\"\n\nDouglas, 474 F.3d at 15 (citation omitted).\n\n           Thompson argues that he was exposed to a hostile work\n\nenvironment through Goodsell's comments, Harris's comments, and\n\nGoodsell's failure to follow Coca-Cola's policies and procedures.\n\nThompson contends that Coca-Cola failed to \"exercise[] reasonable\n\ncare to prevent and correct [the harassment] promptly,\" and failed\n\nto show that Thompson \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any\n\npreventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or\n\nto avoid harm otherwise.\"        Noviello, 398 F.3d at 94-95 (quoting\n\nBurlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 765 (1998)).            We\n\ndo not agree.\n\n           Under Massachusetts law, a hostile work environment is\n\none that is \"'pervaded by harassment or abuse, with the resulting\n\nintimidation, humiliation, and stigmatization, [and that] poses a\n\nformidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in\n\nthe workplace.'\"      Cuddyer v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 750\n\nN.E.2d   928,   937   (Mass.   2001)   (quoting   College-Town,    Div.   of\n\nInterco, Inc. v. Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination, 508 N.E.2d\n\n587, 591 (Mass. 1987)).          The environment must be sufficiently\n\nhostile or abusive in light of all of the circumstances, including\n\nthe \"frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fit is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;     and   whether    it   unreasonably     interferes     with    an\n\nemployee's   work    performance.\"      Faragher,     524   U.S.   at     787-88\n\n(quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993)).\n\n           Thompson    points   to   only    three   instances     that    could\n\npossibly constitute harassment that could create a hostile work\n\nenvironment in the span of four years, and they were spread out\n\nover that time. Harris's comment cannot be considered pervasive on\n\nits face because she made the comment only on one occasion.\n\nMoreover, Coca-Cola disciplined her and required her to take part\n\nin sensitivity training. The comment was not directed at Thompson,\n\nand by his own admission, he did not find it severely derogatory\n\ntowards him.    Harris was not in Thompson's department and she had\n\nno management responsibility towards him.            See Fontánez-Núñez v.\n\nJanssen Ortho LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Taking as true that Goodsell made derogatory comments to\n\nThompson, the first alleged comment was made once during a social\n\nevent, not in connection with any work situation or any other\n\nobjectionable statements or conduct.         More is needed to constitute\n\na hostile work environment. See Kosereis v. Rhode Island, 331 F.3d\n\n207, 216 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"A hostile work environment generally is\n\nnot created by a 'mere offensive utterance,' nor does it arise from\n\n'simple   teasing,    offhand    comments,    and    isolated    incidents.'\"\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f(internal citations omitted)). Goodsell's alleged comments did not\n\nrise to the level of severely hostile or abusive actions.\n\n          The second alleged comment by Goodsell occurred months\n\nafter the first alleged comment and months before Thompson's\n\nvacation and subsequent termination in 2004.             Even so, under Speen\n\nv. Crown Clothing Corp., 102 F.3d 625 (1st Cir. 1996), \"ambiguous\n\nremarks, tending to suggest animus . . . are insufficient, standing\n\nalone, to prove an employer's discriminatory intent.\"               Id. at 636\n\n(quoting Blare, 646 N.E.2d at 118 n.9).            Thompson never reported\n\nany of the alleged comments that Goodsell made to anybody.                    As\n\nnoted by the district court, Coca-Cola has \"a comprehensive anti-\n\ndiscrimination   and   workplace      dispute    resolution      system,   which\n\nprovides employees with several avenues for reporting incidents.\n\nThese avenues include a toll-free phone number to report issues of\n\nconcern, as well as the opportunity for a confidential consultation\n\nwith an ombudsman.\"     Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co., 497 F. Supp. 2d.\n\n80, 84 (D. Mass. 2007).        Thompson concedes that he never made or\n\nattempted to report any alleged incidents until after he was\n\nterminated.   See Fontánez-Núñez, 447 F.3d at 57 (\"[T]he undisputed\n\nfacts   establish      that     [defendant]       had     well     established\n\nantiharassment   and    antidiscrimination        policies      that   included\n\nprocedures for employees to follow in airing grievances and that\n\n[plaintiff]   failed   to     take   advantage   of     these   procedures.\").\n\nThompson's co-workers, who are of various races, acknowledge that\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fGoodsell yelled at them at times, but they categorically deny that\n\nhe ever made racially charged or racially insensitive statements.\n\nThere   is   no   evidence     that   Coca-Cola   engaged     in   any    type   of\n\nharassment of Thompson.\n\n             Thompson asserts that he suffered retaliation because he\n\nengaged in protected conduct, and he was given poor performance\n\nevaluations upon which his termination was ostensibly based.                     To\n\nestablish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show\n\nthat (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered an\n\nadverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between\n\nthe protected activity and the adverse job action.                 See Noviello,\n\n398 F.3d at 88.      For a retaliation claim to \"'survive a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the plaintiff must point to evidence in the\n\nrecord that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the\n\nemployment action was retaliatory.'\"          Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial\n\nP.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 57 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting King\n\nv. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 968 (1st Cir. 1997)).\n\n             In Mole, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held\n\nthat in a retaliation claim the inference of causation arises only\n\n\"where adverse employment actions follow close on the heels of\n\nprotected activity.\"         Mole, 814 N.E.2d at 341.          If there is an\n\ninference of causation, it has a limited lifespan, and \"as the\n\nelapsed time between these two event becomes greater, the inference\n\nweakens   and     eventually    collapses.\"       Id.   The    only      protected\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\factivity that Thompson could be considered to have engaged in was\n\ncomplaining about Harris's comments, which occurred in the Spring\n\nof 2002.   Thompson did not make any other complaints, confidential\n\nor otherwise, until after he was terminated.                On the other hand,\n\nonce Harris's comment was brought to Coca-Cola's attention, Lasonde\n\ntook immediate, corrective action.            As stated above, Harris had no\n\nconnection to, and no role in, Thompson's termination two years\n\nlater.     Any   allegation     that    Harris's        comments   affected   his\n\nperformance      evaluations     is      unsupported        by     the     record.\n\nAdditionally,     four   of    the    six     written    corrective      memoranda\n\naddressing Thompson's poor performance were written before Harris's\n\ncomment.   The two memos that were written after Harris's comment\n\nwere written by a supervisor against whom Thompson makes no claim,\n\nand the memos were written to assist Thompson in improving his\n\nperformance. The memos in no way support his claim of retaliation.\n\nAssuming the evaluations could be considered adverse employment\n\nactions, Thompson has failed to demonstrate any causal link between\n\nthose evaluations and his complaint against Harris.\n\n                               III. Conclusion\n\n           For these reasons, we affirm the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f",

Thompson alleges that he suffered discrimination based on his race and national origin in addition to retaliation for engaging in protected conduct. The district court granted summary judgment for Coca-Cola. Thompson appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We recite the facts from the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Thompson. <i>See </i><i>Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> 514 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> Thompson, an African-American of Jamaican origin, started working for Coca-Cola in 2000 as one of four production supervisors in the quality assurance department at Coca-Cola's Northampton plant.<sup>[1]</sup> Gerald Goodsell, who Thompson alleges made discriminatory comments, oversaw the production supervisors and served as an interim production manager from August 2003 until December 2003, when Dennis Williams transferred from another plant to take over duties as production manager at the Northampton plant.</p>\n<p>Throughout most of Thompson's tenure at Coca-Cola, he performed well. On a few occasions, however, he was reprimanded for being late to work. Production managers also gave Thompson frequent informal \"coaching sessions\" aimed at helping him improve his performance.</p>\n<p>According to Thompson, in late 2002 or early 2003, Goodsell expressed irritation at an African-American disc jockey's selection of reggae music at the annual Christmas party. Thompson alleges that Goodsell said, \"I hate Jamaican music and Jamaicans.\" Thompson asserts he did not report the comment because he feared retaliation and termination. Thompson also alleges that on another occasion, in or about August or September 2003, Goodsell said to him, \"I'll deal with you, you fucking Jamaican.\" Thompson claims that Goodsell told him more than once that he was going to \"deal with him\" and that Goodsell made other threatening and harassing comments. Thompson does not provide any specifics, nor does he allege that any of these other comments were racial or discriminatory in nature.</p>\n<p>In April 2002, Donna Harris, a white female quality assurance supervisor who was not in Thompson's chain of command, said to Ronald McKeithen (Thompson's coworker who is also of Jamaican origin), \"I'm not one of [Thompson's] Jamaican bimbos.\" Thompson and McKeithen reported the incident to John Newton, the quality assurance manager. Newton informed Celine Lasonde, the human resources manager, and Lasonde instructed Newton to sit down with Harris and discuss her inappropriate comments. Harris was instructed to apologize to McKeithen (which she did), and she was also required to undergo sensitivity training. Thompson claims that after this incident and Harris's reprimand, she retaliated against him by using her position to negatively impact his work.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On August 29, 2003, in response to coverage problems caused by shift-swapping, the plant manager, James Lane, sent an e-mail to all of the production supervisors outlining procedures for vacation time. Supervisors were instructed that they should \"(1) obtain coverage from another production supervisor; (2) request personal vacation time from the direct manager in writing; (3) notify the other production supervisors; and (4) enter the requested vacation time into a computerized spreadsheet.\" Though it was protocol to give advance notice, Coca-Cola acknowledges that there was no advance-notice requirement and no formal policy implemented with respect to vacation time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> In the fall of 2003, Thompson realized that he needed dental surgery, and he decided to have the surgery performed in Jamaica because the procedure would cost less. By December, he needed urgent dental attention, and he claims that he informed the management that he needed to travel to Jamaica to have dental work done immediately. Thompson asserts that he spoke to Héctor Lepage, his \"leader\",<sup>[3]</sup> about the dental surgery in early December 2003 and then told one of the other supervisors, Duval, about his proposed time off. Thompson claims that Duval agreed to cover his shifts. Thompson also claims that he told Duval that he might need extra time off, but he could not be sure until he was in Jamaica and had an opportunity to see his dentist. Thompson says that Duval approved and asked him to send him an e-mail confirming the details. Thompson sent Duval the confirmatory e-mail at 10:27 p.m. on December 18, 2003. Duval did not read the e-mail from Thompson until the next time he reported to work, which was on December 21, 2003. Duval claims he did not know the exact dates Thompson would be away, including the possibility of the extra week off, until he read the e-mail.</p>\n<p>Thompson asserts that after he arranged coverage with Duval, he spoke to Dennis Williams, who gave him approval, so long as Goodsell was informed as well. Thompson called Goodsell at his home on December 19, 2003, at around 7 p.m., the evening before his early-morning flight to Jamaica. Goodsell did not tell Thompson that he could not take time off; Goodsell's only concern was coverage for Thompson's shifts. Thompson entered his time off on the spreadsheet through the end of December. He did not request time off in writing. As a result of Thompson's leave, Goodsell had to fill in as production supervisor at some point, and Duval had to work over forty consecutive days.</p>\n<p>Once he was in Jamaica, Thompson realized that he would not be back until January 9, 2004, because his surgery would take longer than he initially expected. Thompson called Coca-Cola to inform management that he would need extra time; he left a message on Goodsell's voice-mail. Goodsell did not respond to Thompson's message. Thompson assumed that his extension had been approved by Goodsell. Goodsell, however, reported to Lasonde and Lane that Thompson failed to comply with vacation protocol. Lasonde interviewed Rutherford, García, Duval, and Goodsell to discuss Thompson's leave. After Thompson returned from Jamaica, he was given an opportunity to discuss the situation in a meeting with Goodsell, Lane, Lasonde, and Williams.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Thompson contested Coca-Cola's version of the events surrounding his vacation. He did not make any claims at the time that Goodsell had been racially biased against him. Shortly after that meeting, Lasonde, Williams, and Lane sent a \"Separation Proposal\" to the Coca-Cola Separation Review Committee in Atlanta, Georgia. The Separation Review Committee agreed with the Separation Proposal and terminated Thompson. Thompson claims that it is clear that Goodsell was an integral part of his termination and that he was retaliated against because of his race and national origin. According to Coca-Cola, Thompson was terminated solely for taking unauthorized vacation time without giving prior proper notice.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> Thompson filed a claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination on April 30, 2004, arguing that he had been discriminated against, harassed, and retaliated against based upon his race, ethnicity, color, national origin, and ancestry under chapter 151B of the General Laws of Massachusetts. Thompson withdrew his complaint with the Commission on August 20, 2004, and filed suit in Hampshire County Superior Court on May 23, 2005. Coca-Cola removed the case to federal court on July 19, 2005. Coca-Cola then filed a motion for summary judgment on August 31, 2006. The district court granted the motion on July 16, 2007. Thompson appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p>Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>Cox v. Hainey,</i> 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2004). When considering arguments for summary judgment, \"we must disregard improbable or overly attenuated inferences, unsupported conclusions, and rank speculation.\" <i>Abbott v. Bragdon,</i> 107 F.3d 934, 938 (1st Cir.1997), <i>vacated </i><i>on other grounds,</i> 524 U.S. 624, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141 L.Ed.2d 540 (1998). To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the evidence offered by the adverse party cannot be \"merely colorable\" or speculative. <i>Pagano v. Frank,</i> 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The evidence \"must be significantly probative of specific facts.\" <i>Pérez v. Volvo Car Corp.,</i> 247 F.3d 303, 317 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Anderson,</i> 477 U.S. at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505). \"A dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the non-moving party.\" <i>Sánchez v. Alvarado,</i> 101 F.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir.1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \"A fact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome of the litigation.\" <i>Maymí v. P.R. Ports Auth.,</i> 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.2008). We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. See </i><i>Hegarty v. Somerset County,</i> 53 F.3d 1367, 1372 (1st Cir.1995). We will reverse only if, \"after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the non-moving party [here, Thompson], the evidence on record is sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.\" <i>Maymí,</i> 515 F.3d at 25 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>B. Analysis</p>\n<p>First, Thompson argues that he has provided sufficient evidence that he was terminated based on his race and national origin. Even if Goodsell was not officially responsible for the decision to terminate, Thompson argues that Goodsell had enormous influence in the process. Thompson argues that the causal connection between the decision to terminate him and Goodsell's discriminatory comments is not broken since the Separation Review Committee acted on biased information without conducting its own independent investigation. <i>See </i><i>Cariglia v. Hertz Equipment Rental Corp.,</i> 363 F.3d 77, 84-85 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p>Second, Thompson asserts that he was exposed to a hostile work environment through Goodsell's comments, Harris's comments, and Goodsell's failure to follow Coca-Cola's policies and procedures. He <span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> contends that the district court erred when it characterized Goodsell's alleged comments as stray, and, therefore, insufficient to prove claims of a hostile work environment or discriminatory termination. Thompson maintains that he suffered retaliation because he engaged in protected conduct and was given poor performance evaluations upon which his termination was ostensibly based.</p>\n<p>We do not find support for Thompson's arguments and reject them in turn.</p>\n<p>1. Race and National Origin Discrimination</p>\n<p>To make out a prima, facie case of discrimination under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(1),<sup>[4]</sup> Thompson must prove that he \"is a member of a protected class, [that he] suffered harm as a result of [Coca-Cola's] adverse employment action, and [that Coca-Cola] harbored discriminatory animus, which was the determinative cause of the adverse action.\" <i>Weber v. Cmty. Teamwork, Inc.,</i> 434 Mass. 761, 752 N.E.2d 700, 711 (2001); <i>Lewis v. City of Boston,</i> 321 F.3d 207, 213-14 (1st Cir.2003) (construing Massachusetts law). Thompson bears the burden of proving discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Blare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc.,</i> 419 Mass. 437, 646 N.E.2d 111, 117 (1995).</p>\n<p>Under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting analysis, we employ a familiar three-stage framework in evaluating claims for discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Wheelock Coll. v. Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination,</i> 371 Mass. 130, 355 N.E.2d 309, 314 (1976). Thompson bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). The burden then shifts to Coca-Cola \"to present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it discriminated against [Thompson], for the employment decision.\" <i>Quiñones v. Houser Buick,</i> 436 F.3d 284, 289 (1st Cir.2006). \"[Coca-Cola's] obligation is one of production as opposed to persuasion, as the burden of persuasion remains with [Thompson].\" <i>Lewis,</i> 321 F.3d at 214. If Coca-Cola meets its burden and provides a non-discriminatory justification for Thompson's termination, the \"presumption of discrimination disappears,\" and the burden shifts back to Thompson, who must demonstrate that Coca-Cola's decision was merely a pretext \"to hide such discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We must first determine whether Thompson makes out a prima facie claim for race discrimination. It is undisputed that Thompson is a member of a protected class because he is an African-American. His termination was an adverse employment action. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Thompson, he makes a claim that he was terminated for discriminatory reasons because he is of Jamaican origin and Goodsell made numerous discriminatory comments about Jamaicans and threatened to \"deal with him.\" He has met his burden for the first prong of the test. The burden now shifts to Coca-Cola <span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> to present a non-discriminatory reason for terminating him.</p>\n<p>The record reflects that Coca-Cola's decision to terminate Thompson was based on Thompson's failure to follow office procedure with regard to vacation leave. Thompson did not put his vacation request in writing, and he did not secure the appropriate coverage for the days that he would be away. The record reflects that Duval told Lasonde that Thompson had not secured coverage for his shifts in advance. Duval maintains that he did not have confirmation of the dates Thompson was going to be away until December 23, 2003; he received an e-mail the night before Thompson departed for Jamaica. Thompson acknowledges that his first contact with his direct supervisor, Goodsell, about his leave was only hours before he departed for Jamaica. He admits that he failed to follow any of the required steps' of the protocol for his one-week extension of the vacation because he merely relied on a unilateral voice-mail to Goodsell. He also did not enter the vacation period into the company's computerized vacation spreadsheet. These facts are supported by evidence, including Thompson's own admissions. Furthermore, Thompson acknowledged that violation of procedures would constitute a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination. Coca-Cola thus met its burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Thompson.</p>\n<p>Since Coca-Cola has shown a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Thompson, the burden shifts back to Thompson. Thompson \"can no longer rest on the initial inference of discrimination but, rather, must show that [Coca-Cola's] articulated reason is pretextual.\" <i>Bennett v. Saint-Gobain Corp.,</i> 507 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir.2007). \"To meet this burden, [Thompson] must prove not only that the reason articulated by the employer was a sham, but also that its true reason was plaintiffs race or national origin.\" <i>Rodríguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 181 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Under settled discrimination law, to demonstrate that its stated reasons for terminating Thompson were not pretextual, Coca-Cola's explanation need not be perfect. <i>See </i><i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits  or even rationality  of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\"). Coca-Cola's reasons for terminating Thompson must simply be legitimate and not a cover-up for discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Loeb v. Textron, Inc.,</i> 600 F.2d 1003, 1012 n. 6 (1st Cir.1979) (\"While an employer's judgment or course of action may seem poor or erroneous to outsiders, the relevant question is simply whether the given reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination. . . . [The] focus is to be on the employer's motivation, . . . not on its business judgment.\"); <i>T &amp; S Serv. Assoc., Inc. v. Crenson,</i> 666 F.2d 722, 727 (1st Cir.1981). If there is no proof of discriminatory animus on the part of a decisionmaker, a plaintiff must show more than that the decisionmaker's perception was incorrect; he must show that the \"decisionmaker did not believe in the accuracy\" of the information that he was given. <i>Bennett,</i> 507 F.3d at 31. Put another way, \"[t]he question is not whether [Thompson's] or his fellow employees' version is the true one, but whether [the decisionmakers] believed what [they] had been told by those [who were]' interviewed\" by management. <i>Ronda Pérez v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Puerto Rico,</i> 404 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Coca-Cola posits that the only real issue for the court to decide is whether the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> Separation Review Committee acted with discriminatory animus. We agree.</p>\n<p>Thompson makes allegation that the Separation Review Committee had any bias of its own against Thompson. \"Actionable discrimination cannot exist in a vacuum. Rather the discriminatory intent of which a plaintiff complains must be traceable to the person or persons who made the decision to fire him.\" <i>Bennett,</i> 507 F.3d at 31. Thompson cannot meet this burden. His allegations of stray remarks made by Harris and Goodsell are insufficient to prove that the Separation Review Committee was somehow biased against him.</p>\n<p>Harris was a non-decisionmaker, and a comment such as hers \"cannot support an inference of pretext because it was one stray remark, and was made by a nondecision maker.\" <i>Velázquez-Fernández v. NCE Foods, Inc.,</i> 476 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing <i>González v. El Día, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir.2002)). Harris had no role in Thompson's termination, and her comment is immaterial. First, the comment was not made to Thompson. Second, management at the plant responded immediately, reprimanded her, and required her to apologize. Third, Harris did not supervise Thompson and was not in a position to affect his work. <i>See </i><i>Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> 474 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[plaintiff] identifies at most one possibly racially-tinged comment by a co-worker who was not [plaintiffs] supervisor and as such is irrelevant\"). Remarks by non-decisionmakers are not probative of context. <i>See </i><i>Medina-Muñoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 10 (1st Cir.1990) (\"the biases of one who neither makes nor influences the challenged personnel decision are not probative in an employment discrimination case\").</p>\n<p>Goodsell's alleged comments, two of three of which preceded Thompson's termination by over a year and none of which involved the termination process, can be characterized as nothing other than stray. This circuit has held that \"`stray workplace remarks' . . . normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.\" <i>El Día, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d at 69; <i>see also </i><i>Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 250 F.3d 23, 36 (1st Cir.2001). Goodsell's input was minimal and consistent with Thompson's own account of the events. \"Despite a retaliatory or discriminatory motive on the part of a supervisor who recommends that some adverse action be taken against an employee, a third person's independent decision to take adverse action breaks the causal connection between the supervisor's retaliatory or discriminatory animus and the adverse action.\" <i>Mole v. Univ. of Mass.,</i> 442 Mass. 582, 814 N.E.2d 329, 343 (2004). The record reflects that Goodsell's input was limited and that the Separation Review Committee made its own independent decision to terminate Thompson based on the facts of the situation. In <i>Mole,</i> the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said that \"[w]hen assessing the independence of the ultimate decision maker, courts place considerable emphasis on the decision makers giving the employee the opportunity to address the allegations in question.\" <i>Id.</i> at 344. Coca-Cola gave Thompson such an opportunity, and he failed to adequately explain his actions or even give a substantially different account of events. Instead, he acknowledged that he did not follow proper procedures.</p>\n<p>Contrary to arguments made by Thompson, <i>Cariglia</i> is inapposite. Among other reasons, in <i>Cariglia,</i> the defendant's decision to terminate the plaintiff was based upon a report drafted by a discriminatory supervisor, and the defendant did not conduct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> any further investigation or ask the employee for his version of events. <i>Cariglia,</i> 363 F.3d at 81-82. In examining those facts we noted that \"the critical legal issue [is] whether corporate liability can attach when neutral decisionmakers rely on information that is manipulated by another, employee who harbors illegitimate animus.\" <i>Id.</i> at 86. We remanded the case to the district court to address whether information was withheld from the neutral decisionmakers, but we noted that our decision may have been different if <i>Cariglia</i> had been given a meaningful opportunity to address the reasons for his termination. <i>See id.</i> at 87 n. 4.</p>\n<p>Thompson argues that there was no meaningful investigation into what happened, and that the Separation Review Committee based its decision on a biased account by Goodsell. The record demonstrates that this is patently false. Lasonde convened a meeting with everyone involved while Thompson was still in Jamaica to gather information about what transpired. She also met with Thompson, Goodsell, Lane, and Williams immediately after Thompson returned from his trip and gave him an opportunity to explain himself. He did not contradict Goodsell's version of events, except to say that he had coverage, that he was not really required to submit his request in writing (even though he admitted to receiving a previous e-mail from management outlining that leave requests must be submitted in writing), and that he asked Duval to cover his shifts. But \"the mere existence of <i>some</i> alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no <i>genuine</i> issue of <i>material</i> fact.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 477 U.S. at 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Thompson did not make any allegations against Goodsell at the time. Thompson presents no evidence that Goodsell made the decision to terminate him, nor can he point to any information in Lasonde's Separation Proposal Memorandum provided by Goodsell without corroboration by Thompson himself or other employees. This is not a situation where Goodsell \"conceal[ed] relevant information from the decisionmak[ers] . . . or [fed] false information to [them], [and was] able to influence the decision.\" <i>Cariglia,</i> 363 F.3d at 87 (quoting <i>Wallace v. SMC Pneumatics,</i> 103 F.3d 1394, 1400 (7th Cir.1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Lasonde's recommendation to the Separation Review Committee was based on record evidence, an investigation of the situation, and reflected her belief that Thompson should be terminated for taking unauthorized vacation. Thompson has not shown that his termination was in any way a result of racial or national origin discrimination. His claims fail.</p>\n<p>2. Harassment and Retaliation</p>\n<p>In looking at a claim for hostile work environment, we assess whether a plaintiff \"was subjected to severe or pervasive harassment that materially altered the conditions of [his] employment.\" <i>Noviello v. City of Boston,</i> 398 F.3d 76, 92 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Ratón,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 786, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998)). To sustain a claim of hostile work environment, Thompson must demonstrate that \"the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of [his] employment and create an abusive work environment\" and that the \"[racially] objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and [that Thompson] in fact did perceive it to be so.\" <i>Douglas,</i> 474 F.3d at 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> Thompson argues that he was exposed to a hostile work environment through Goodsell's comments, Harris's comments, and Goodsell's failure to follow Coca-Cola's policies and procedures. Thompson contends that Coca-Cola failed to \"exercise[] reasonable care to prevent and correct [the harassment] promptly,\" and failed to show that Thompson \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" <i>Noviello,</i> 398 F.3d at 94-95 (quoting <i>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998)). We do not agree.</p>\n<p>Under Massachusetts law, a hostile work environment is one that is \"`pervaded by harassment or abuse, with the resulting intimidation, humiliation, and stigmatization, [and that] poses a formidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in the workplace.'\" <i>Cuddyer v. Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co.,</i> 434 Mass. 521, 750 N.E.2d 928, 937 (2001) (quoting <i>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. v. Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination,</i> 400 Mass. 156, 508 N.E.2d 587, 591 (1987)). The environment must be sufficiently hostile or abusive in light of all of the circumstances, including the \"frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 787-88, 118 S.Ct. 2275 (quoting <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993)).</p>\n<p>Thompson points to only three instances that could possibly constitute harassment that could create a hostile work environment in the span of four years, and they were spread out over that time. Harris's comment cannot be considered pervasive on its face because she made the comment only on one occasion. Moreover, Coca-Cola disciplined her and required her to take part in sensitivity training. The comment was not directed at Thompson, and by his own admission, he did not find it severely derogatory towards him. Harris was not in Thompson's department and she had no management responsibility towards him. <i>See </i><i>Fontánez-Núñez v. Janssen Ortho LLC,</i> 447 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Taking as true that Goodsell made derogatory comments to Thompson, the first alleged comment was made once during a social event, not in connection with any work situation or any other objectionable statements or conduct. More is needed to constitute a hostile work environment. <i>See </i><i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> 331 F.3d 207, 216 (1st Cir.2003) (\"A hostile work environment generally is not created by a `mere offensive utterance,' nor does it arise from `simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents.'\" (internal citations omitted)). Goodsell's alleged comments did not rise to the level of severely hostile or abusive actions.</p>\n<p>The second alleged comment by Goodsell occurred months after the first alleged comment and months before Thompson's vacation and subsequent termination in 2004. Even so, under <i>Speen v. Crown Clothing Corp.,</i> 102 F.3d 625 (1st Cir.1996), \"ambiguous remarks, tending to suggest animus . . . are insufficient, standing alone, to prove an employer's discriminatory intent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 636 (quoting <i>Blare,</i> 646 N.E.2d at 118 n. 9). Thompson never reported any of the alleged comments that Goodsell made to anybody. As noted by the district court, Coca-Cola has \"a comprehensive anti-discrimination and workplace dispute resolution system, which provides <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> employees with several avenues for reporting incidents. These avenues include a toll-free phone number to report issues of concern, as well as the opportunity for a confidential consultation with an ombudsman.\" <i>Thompson v. Coca Cola Co.,</i> 497 F.Supp.2d. 80, 84 (D.Mass.2007). Thompson concedes that he never made or attempted to report any alleged incidents until after he was terminated. <i>See </i><i>Fontánez-Núñez,</i> 447 F.3d at 57 (\"[T]he undisputed facts establish that [defendant] had well established antiharassment and antidiscrimination policies that included procedures for employees to follow in airing grievances and that [plaintiff] failed to take advantage of these procedures.\"). Thompson's co-workers, who are of various races, acknowledge that Goodsell yelled at them at times, but they categorically deny that he ever made racially charged or racially insensitive statements. There is no evidence that Coca-Cola engaged in any type of harassment of Thompson.</p>\n<p>Thompson asserts that he suffered retaliation because he engaged in protected conduct, and he was given poor performance evaluations upon which his termination was ostensibly based. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show that (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse job action. <i>See </i><i>Noviello,</i> 398 F.3d at 88. For a retaliation claim to \"`survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must point to evidence in the record that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the employment action was retaliatory.'\" <i>Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 57 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>King v. Town of Hanover,</i> 116 F.3d 965, 968 (1st Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p>In <i>Mole,</i> the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that in a retaliation claim the inference of causation arises only \"where adverse employment actions follow close on the heels of protected activity.\" <i>Mole,</i> 814 N.E.2d at 341. If there is an inference of causation, it has a limited lifespan, and \"as the elapsed time between these two event becomes greater, the inference weakens and eventually collapses.\" <i>Id.</i> The only protected activity that Thompson could be considered to have engaged in was complaining about Harris's comments, which occurred in the Spring of 2002. Thompson did not make any other complaints, confidential or otherwise, until after he was terminated. On the other hand, once Harris's comment was brought to Coca-Cola's attention, Lasonde took immediate, corrective action. As stated above, Harris had no connection to, and no role in, Thompson's termination two years later. Any allegation that Harris's comments affected his performance evaluations is unsupported by the record. Additionally, four of the six written corrective memoranda addressing Thompson's poor performance were written before Harris's comment. The two memos that were written after Harris's comment were written by a supervisor against whom Thompson makes no claim, and the memos were written to assist Thompson in improving his performance. The memos in no way support his claim of retaliation. Assuming the evaluations could be considered adverse employment actions, Thompson has failed to demonstrate any causal link between those evaluations and' his complaint against Harris.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed,</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Marin Duval, Diego Garcia, and Sean Rutherford, who are white, Latino, and African-American, respectively, were the other three production supervisors at the time Thompson was terminated.</p>\n<p>[2]  Thompson and Harris seem to have had a contentious relationship for some time.

U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203122\"><a href=\"/opinion/203122/franceschi-v-us-dept-of-veterans-affairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> Thompson, an African-American of Jamaican origin, started working for Coca-Cola in 2000 as one of four production supervisors in the quality assurance department at Coca-Cola's Northampton plant.<sup>[1]</sup> Gerald Goodsell, who Thompson alleges made discriminatory comments, oversaw the production supervisors and served as an interim production manager from August 2003 until December 2003, when Dennis Williams transferred from another plant to take over duties as production manager at the Northampton plant.</p>\n<p>Throughout most of Thompson's tenure at Coca-Cola, he performed well. On a few occasions, however, he was reprimanded for being late to work. Production managers also gave Thompson frequent informal \"coaching sessions\" aimed at helping him improve his performance.</p>\n<p>According to Thompson, in late 2002 or early 2003, Goodsell expressed irritation at an African-American disc jockey's selection of reggae music at the annual Christmas party. Thompson alleges that Goodsell said, \"I hate Jamaican music and Jamaicans.\" Thompson asserts he did not report the comment because he feared retaliation and termination. Thompson also alleges that on another occasion, in or about August or September 2003, Goodsell said to him, \"I'll deal with you, you fucking Jamaican.\" Thompson claims that Goodsell told him more than once that he was going to \"deal with him\" and that Goodsell made other threatening and harassing comments. Thompson does not provide any specifics, nor does he allege that any of these other comments were racial or discriminatory in nature.</p>\n<p>In April 2002, Donna Harris, a white female quality assurance supervisor who was not in Thompson's chain of command, said to Ronald McKeithen (Thompson's coworker who is also of Jamaican origin), \"I'm not one of [Thompson's] Jamaican bimbos.\" Thompson and McKeithen reported the incident to John Newton, the quality assurance manager. Newton informed Celine Lasonde, the human resources manager, and Lasonde instructed Newton to sit down with Harris and discuss her inappropriate comments. Harris was instructed to apologize to McKeithen (which she did), and she was also required to undergo sensitivity training. Thompson claims that after this incident and Harris's reprimand, she retaliated against him by using her position to negatively impact his work.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On August 29, 2003, in response to coverage problems caused by shift-swapping, the plant manager, James Lane, sent an e-mail to all of the production supervisors outlining procedures for vacation time. Supervisors were instructed that they should \"(1) obtain coverage from another production supervisor; (2) request personal vacation time from the direct manager in writing; (3) notify the other production supervisors; and (4) enter the requested vacation time into a computerized spreadsheet.\" Though it was protocol to give advance notice, Coca-Cola acknowledges that there was no advance-notice requirement and no formal policy implemented with respect to vacation time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> In the fall of 2003, Thompson realized that he needed dental surgery, and he decided to have the surgery performed in Jamaica because the procedure would cost less. By December, he needed urgent dental attention, and he claims that he informed the management that he needed to travel to Jamaica to have dental work done immediately. Thompson asserts that he spoke to Héctor Lepage, his \"leader\",<sup>[3]</sup> about the dental surgery in early December 2003 and then told one of the other supervisors, Duval, about his proposed time off. Thompson claims that Duval agreed to cover his shifts. Thompson also claims that he told Duval that he might need extra time off, but he could not be sure until he was in Jamaica and had an opportunity to see his dentist. Thompson says that Duval approved and asked him to send him an e-mail confirming the details. Thompson sent Duval the confirmatory e-mail at 10:27 p.m. on December 18, 2003. Duval did not read the e-mail from Thompson until the next time he reported to work, which was on December 21, 2003. Duval claims he did not know the exact dates Thompson would be away, including the possibility of the extra week off, until he read the e-mail.</p>\n<p>Thompson asserts that after he arranged coverage with Duval, he spoke to Dennis Williams, who gave him approval, so long as Goodsell was informed as well. Thompson called Goodsell at his home on December 19, 2003, at around 7 p.m., the evening before his early-morning flight to Jamaica. Goodsell did not tell Thompson that he could not take time off; Goodsell's only concern was coverage for Thompson's shifts. Thompson entered his time off on the spreadsheet through the end of December. He did not request time off in writing. As a result of Thompson's leave, Goodsell had to fill in as production supervisor at some point, and Duval had to work over forty consecutive days.</p>\n<p>Once he was in Jamaica, Thompson realized that he would not be back until January 9, 2004, because his surgery would take longer than he initially expected. Thompson called Coca-Cola to inform management that he would need extra time; he left a message on Goodsell's voice-mail. Goodsell did not respond to Thompson's message. Thompson assumed that his extension had been approved by Goodsell. Goodsell, however, reported to Lasonde and Lane that Thompson failed to comply with vacation protocol. Lasonde interviewed Rutherford, García, Duval, and Goodsell to discuss Thompson's leave. After Thompson returned from Jamaica, he was given an opportunity to discuss the situation in a meeting with Goodsell, Lane, Lasonde, and Williams.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Thompson contested Coca-Cola's version of the events surrounding his vacation. He did not make any claims at the time that Goodsell had been racially biased against him. Shortly after that meeting, Lasonde, Williams, and Lane sent a \"Separation Proposal\" to the Coca-Cola Separation Review Committee in Atlanta, Georgia. The Separation Review Committee agreed with the Separation Proposal and terminated Thompson. Thompson claims that it is clear that Goodsell was an integral part of his termination and that he was retaliated against because of his race and national origin. According to Coca-Cola, Thompson was terminated solely for taking unauthorized vacation time without giving prior proper notice.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> Thompson filed a claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination on April 30, 2004, arguing that he had been discriminated against, harassed, and retaliated against based upon his race, ethnicity, color, national origin, and ancestry under chapter 151B of the General Laws of Massachusetts. Thompson withdrew his complaint with the Commission on August 20, 2004, and filed suit in Hampshire County Superior Court on May 23, 2005. Coca-Cola removed the case to federal court on July 19, 2005. Coca-Cola then filed a motion for summary judgment on August 31, 2006. The district court granted the motion on July 16, 2007. Thompson appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A.

Analysis</p>\n<p>First, Thompson argues that he has provided sufficient evidence that he was terminated based on his race and national origin. Even if Goodsell was not officially responsible for the decision to terminate, Thompson argues that Goodsell had enormous influence in the process. Thompson argues that the causal connection between the decision to terminate him and Goodsell's discriminatory comments is not broken since the Separation Review Committee acted on biased information without conducting its own independent investigation. <i>See </i><i>Cariglia v. Hertz Equipment Rental Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200954\"><a href=\"/opinion/200954/cariglia-v-hertz-equipment/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 84-85 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p>Second, Thompson asserts that he was exposed to a hostile work environment through Goodsell's comments, Harris's comments, and Goodsell's failure to follow Coca-Cola's policies and procedures. He <span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> contends that the district court erred when it characterized Goodsell's alleged comments as stray, and, therefore, insufficient to prove claims of a hostile work environment or discriminatory termination. Thompson maintains that he suffered retaliation because he engaged in protected conduct and was given poor performance evaluations upon which his termination was ostensibly based.</p>\n<p>We do not find support for Thompson's arguments and reject them in turn.</p>\n<p>1. Race and National Origin Discrimination</p>\n<p>To make out a prima, facie case of discrimination under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(1),<sup>[4]</sup> Thompson must prove that he \"is a member of a protected class, [that he] suffered harm as a result of [Coca-Cola's] adverse employment action, and [that Coca-Cola] harbored discriminatory animus, which was the determinative cause of the adverse action.\" <i>Weber v. Cmty. Teamwork, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></span>, 711 (2001); <i>Lewis v.

Thompson bears the burden of proving discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Blare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span>, 117 (1995).</p>\n<p>Under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting analysis, we employ a familiar three-stage framework in evaluating claims for discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Wheelock Coll. v. Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2078690\"><a href=\"/opinion/2078690/wheelock-college-v-mass-comm-against-discrimination/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2078690\"><a href=\"/opinion/2078690/wheelock-college-v-mass-comm-against-discrimination/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, 314 (1976). Thompson bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973). The burden then shifts to Coca-Cola \"to present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it discriminated against [Thompson], for the employment decision.\" <i>Quiñones v. Houser Buick,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></span>, 289 (1st Cir.2006). \"[Coca-Cola's] obligation is one of production as opposed to persuasion, as the burden of persuasion remains with [Thompson].\" <i>Lewis,</i> 321 F.3d at 214. If Coca-Cola meets its burden and provides a non-discriminatory justification for Thompson's termination, the \"presumption of discrimination disappears,\" and the burden shifts back to Thompson, who must demonstrate that Coca-Cola's decision was merely a pretext \"to hide such discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We must first determine whether Thompson makes out a prima facie claim for race discrimination. It is undisputed that Thompson is a member of a protected class because he is an African-American. His termination was an adverse employment action. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Thompson, he makes a claim that he was terminated for discriminatory reasons because he is of Jamaican origin and Goodsell made numerous discriminatory comments about Jamaicans and threatened to \"deal with him.\" He has met his burden for the first prong of the test. The burden now shifts to Coca-Cola <span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> to present a non-discriminatory reason for terminating him.</p>\n<p>The record reflects that Coca-Cola's decision to terminate Thompson was based on Thompson's failure to follow office procedure with regard to vacation leave. Thompson did not put his vacation request in writing, and he did not secure the appropriate coverage for the days that he would be away. The record reflects that Duval told Lasonde that Thompson had not secured coverage for his shifts in advance. Duval maintains that he did not have confirmation of the dates Thompson was going to be away until December 23, 2003; he received an e-mail the night before Thompson departed for Jamaica. Thompson acknowledges that his first contact with his direct supervisor, Goodsell, about his leave was only hours before he departed for Jamaica. He admits that he failed to follow any of the required steps' of the protocol for his one-week extension of the vacation because he merely relied on a unilateral voice-mail to Goodsell. He also did not enter the vacation period into the company's computerized vacation spreadsheet. These facts are supported by evidence, including Thompson's own admissions. Furthermore, Thompson acknowledged that violation of procedures would constitute a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination. Coca-Cola thus met its burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Thompson.</p>\n<p>Since Coca-Cola has shown a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Thompson, the burden shifts back to Thompson. Thompson \"can no longer rest on the initial inference of discrimination but, rather, must show that [Coca-Cola's] articulated reason is pretextual.\" <i>Bennett v. Saint-Gobain Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435201\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435201/bennett-v-saint-gobain-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2007). \"To meet this burden, [Thompson] must prove not only that the reason articulated by the employer was a sham, but also that its true reason was plaintiffs race or national origin.\" <i>Rodríguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198515\"><a href=\"/opinion/198515/rodriguez-cuervos-v-wal-mart/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Under settled discrimination law, to demonstrate that its stated reasons for terminating Thompson were not pretextual, Coca-Cola's explanation need not be perfect. <i>See </i><i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 825 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits  or even rationality  of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\"). Coca-Cola's reasons for terminating Thompson must simply be legitimate and not a cover-up for discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Loeb v. Textron, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367165\"><a href=\"/opinion/367165/20-fair-emplpraccas-29-20-empl-prac-dec-p-30028-frank-l-loeb-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, 1012 n. 6 (1st Cir.1979) (\"While an employer's judgment or course of action may seem poor or erroneous to outsiders, the relevant question is simply whether the given reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination. . . . [The] focus is to be on the employer's motivation, . . . not on its business judgment.\"); <i>T &amp; S Serv. Assoc., Inc. v. Crenson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398018\"><a href=\"/opinion/398018/t-s-service-associates-inc-v-john-crenson-t-s-service-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 727 (1st Cir.1981). If there is no proof of discriminatory animus on the part of a decisionmaker, a plaintiff must show more than that the decisionmaker's perception was incorrect; he must show that the \"decisionmaker did not believe in the accuracy\" of the information that he was given. <i>Bennett,</i> 507 F.3d at 31. Put another way, \"[t]he question is not whether [Thompson's] or his fellow employees' version is the true one, but whether [the decisionmakers] believed what [they] had been told by those [who were]' interviewed\" by management. <i>Ronda Pérez v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201534\"><a href=\"/opinion/201534/ronda-perez-v-banco-bilbao/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Coca-Cola posits that the only real issue for the court to decide is whether the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> Separation Review Committee acted with discriminatory animus. We agree.</p>\n<p>Thompson makes allegation that the Separation Review Committee had any bias of its own against Thompson. \"Actionable discrimination cannot exist in a vacuum. Rather the discriminatory intent of which a plaintiff complains must be traceable to the person or persons who made the decision to fire him.\" <i>Bennett,</i> 507 F.3d at 31. Thompson cannot meet this burden. His allegations of stray remarks made by Harris and Goodsell are insufficient to prove that the Separation Review Committee was somehow biased against him.</p>\n<p>Harris was a non-decisionmaker, and a comment such as hers \"cannot support an inference of pretext because it was one stray remark, and was made by a nondecision maker.\" <i>Velázquez-Fernández v. NCE Foods, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202607\"><a href=\"/opinion/202607/velazquez-fernandez-v-nce-food-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing <i>González v.

Harris had no role in Thompson's termination, and her comment is immaterial. First, the comment was not made to Thompson. Second, management at the plant responded immediately, reprimanded her, and required her to apologize. Third, Harris did not supervise Thompson and was not in a position to affect his work. <i>See </i><i>Douglas v. J.C.

This circuit has held that \"`stray workplace remarks' . . . normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.\" <i>El Día, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d at 69; <i>see also </i><i>Straughn v.

Goodsell's input was minimal and consistent with Thompson's own account of the events. \"Despite a retaliatory or discriminatory motive on the part of a supervisor who recommends that some adverse action be taken against an employee, a third person's independent decision to take adverse action breaks the causal connection between the supervisor's retaliatory or discriminatory animus and the adverse action.\" <i>Mole v.

The record reflects that Goodsell's input was limited and that the Separation Review Committee made its own independent decision to terminate Thompson based on the facts of the situation. In <i>Mole,</i> the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said that \"[w]hen assessing the independence of the ultimate decision maker, courts place considerable emphasis on the decision makers giving the employee the opportunity to address the allegations in question.\" <i>Id.</i> at 344. Coca-Cola gave Thompson such an opportunity, and he failed to adequately explain his actions or even give a substantially different account of events. Instead, he acknowledged that he did not follow proper procedures.</p>\n<p>Contrary to arguments made by Thompson, <i>Cariglia</i> is inapposite. Among other reasons, in <i>Cariglia,</i> the defendant's decision to terminate the plaintiff was based upon a report drafted by a discriminatory supervisor, and the defendant did not conduct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> any further investigation or ask the employee for his version of events. <i>Cariglia,</i> 363 F.3d at 81-82. In examining those facts we noted that \"the critical legal issue [is] whether corporate liability can attach when neutral decisionmakers rely on information that is manipulated by another, employee who harbors illegitimate animus.\" <i>Id.</i> at 86. We remanded the case to the district court to address whether information was withheld from the neutral decisionmakers, but we noted that our decision may have been different if <i>Cariglia</i> had been given a meaningful opportunity to address the reasons for his termination. <i>See id.</i> at 87 n. 4.</p>\n<p>Thompson argues that there was no meaningful investigation into what happened, and that the Separation Review Committee based its decision on a biased account by Goodsell. The record demonstrates that this is patently false. Lasonde convened a meeting with everyone involved while Thompson was still in Jamaica to gather information about what transpired. She also met with Thompson, Goodsell, Lane, and Williams immediately after Thompson returned from his trip and gave him an opportunity to explain himself. He did not contradict Goodsell's version of events, except to say that he had coverage, that he was not really required to submit his request in writing (even though he admitted to receiving a previous e-mail from management outlining that leave requests must be submitted in writing), and that he asked Duval to cover his shifts. But \"the mere existence of <i>some</i> alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no <i>genuine</i> issue of <i>material</i> fact.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 477 U.S. at 247-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/jack-anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc-and-willis-a-carto/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2505</span></a></span>. Thompson did not make any allegations against Goodsell at the time. Thompson presents no evidence that Goodsell made the decision to terminate him, nor can he point to any information in Lasonde's Separation Proposal Memorandum provided by Goodsell without corroboration by Thompson himself or other employees. This is not a situation where Goodsell \"conceal[ed] relevant information from the decisionmak[ers] . . . or [fed] false information to [them], [and was] able to influence the decision.\" <i>Cariglia,</i> 363 F.3d at 87 (quoting <i>Wallace v.

Thompson has not shown that his termination was in any way a result of racial or national origin discrimination. His claims fail.</p>\n<p>2. Harassment and Retaliation</p>\n<p>In looking at a claim for hostile work environment, we assess whether a plaintiff \"was subjected to severe or pervasive harassment that materially altered the conditions of [his] employment.\" <i>Noviello v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span> (1998)). To sustain a claim of hostile work environment, Thompson must demonstrate that \"the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of [his] employment and create an abusive work environment\" and that the \"[racially] objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and [that Thompson] in fact did perceive it to be so.\" <i>Douglas,</i> 474 F.3d at 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> Thompson argues that he was exposed to a hostile work environment through Goodsell's comments, Harris's comments, and Goodsell's failure to follow Coca-Cola's policies and procedures. Thompson contends that Coca-Cola failed to \"exercise[] reasonable care to prevent and correct [the harassment] promptly,\" and failed to show that Thompson \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" <i>Noviello,</i> 398 F.3d at 94-95 (quoting <i>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 765, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span> (1993)).</p>\n<p>Thompson points to only three instances that could possibly constitute harassment that could create a hostile work environment in the span of four years, and they were spread out over that time. Harris's comment cannot be considered pervasive on its face because she made the comment only on one occasion. Moreover, Coca-Cola disciplined her and required her to take part in sensitivity training. The comment was not directed at Thompson, and by his own admission, he did not find it severely derogatory towards him. Harris was not in Thompson's department and she had no management responsibility towards him. <i>See </i><i>Fontánez-Núñez v. Janssen Ortho LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202200\"><a href=\"/opinion/202200/fontanez-nunez-v-janssen-ortho-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Taking as true that Goodsell made derogatory comments to Thompson, the first alleged comment was made once during a social event, not in connection with any work situation or any other objectionable statements or conduct. More is needed to constitute a hostile work environment. <i>See </i><i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200505\"><a href=\"/opinion/200505/kosereis-v-department-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 216 (1st Cir.2003) (\"A hostile work environment generally is not created by a `mere offensive utterance,' nor does it arise from `simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents.'\" (internal citations omitted)). Goodsell's alleged comments did not rise to the level of severely hostile or abusive actions.</p>\n<p>The second alleged comment by Goodsell occurred months after the first alleged comment and months before Thompson's vacation and subsequent termination in 2004. Even so, under <i>Speen v. Crown Clothing Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"731221\"><a href=\"/opinion/731221/73-fair-emplpraccas-bna-347-70-empl-prac-dec-p-44606-20-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), \"ambiguous remarks, tending to suggest animus . . . are insufficient, standing alone, to prove an employer's discriminatory intent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 636 (quoting <i>Blare,</i> 646 N.E.2d at 118 n. 9). Thompson never reported any of the alleged comments that Goodsell made to anybody. As noted by the district court, Coca-Cola has \"a comprehensive anti-discrimination and workplace dispute resolution system, which provides <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> employees with several avenues for reporting incidents. These avenues include a toll-free phone number to report issues of concern, as well as the opportunity for a confidential consultation with an ombudsman.\" <i>Thompson v. Coca Cola Co.,</i> 497 F.Supp.2d. 80, 84 (D.Mass.2007). Thompson concedes that he never made or attempted to report any alleged incidents until after he was terminated. <i>See </i><i>Fontánez-Núñez,</i> 447 F.3d at 57 (\"[T]he undisputed facts establish that [defendant] had well established antiharassment and antidiscrimination policies that included procedures for employees to follow in airing grievances and that [plaintiff] failed to take advantage of these procedures.\"). Thompson's co-workers, who are of various races, acknowledge that Goodsell yelled at them at times, but they categorically deny that he ever made racially charged or racially insensitive statements. There is no evidence that Coca-Cola engaged in any type of harassment of Thompson.</p>\n<p>Thompson asserts that he suffered retaliation because he engaged in protected conduct, and he was given poor performance evaluations upon which his termination was ostensibly based. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show that (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse job action. <i>See </i><i>Noviello,</i> 398 F.3d at 88. For a retaliation claim to \"`survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must point to evidence in the record that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the employment action was retaliatory.'\" <i>Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198991\"><a href=\"/opinion/198991/santiago-ramos-v-centennial-pr-wire/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>King v. Town of Hanover,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742622\"><a href=\"/opinion/742622/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1266-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44807-bruce-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 968 (1st Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p>In <i>Mole,</i> the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that in a retaliation claim the inference of causation arises only \"where adverse employment actions follow close on the heels of protected activity.\" <i>Mole,</i> 814 N.E.2d at 341. If there is an inference of causation, it has a limited lifespan, and \"as the elapsed time between these two event becomes greater, the inference weakens and eventually collapses.\" <i>Id.</i> The only protected activity that Thompson could be considered to have engaged in was complaining about Harris's comments, which occurred in the Spring of 2002. Thompson did not make any other complaints, confidential or otherwise, until after he was terminated. On the other hand, once Harris's comment was brought to Coca-Cola's attention, Lasonde took immediate, corrective action. As stated above, Harris had no connection to, and no role in, Thompson's termination two years later. Any allegation that Harris's comments affected his performance evaluations is unsupported by the record. Additionally, four of the six written corrective memoranda addressing Thompson's poor performance were written before Harris's comment. The two memos that were written after Harris's comment were written by a supervisor against whom Thompson makes no claim, and the memos were written to assist Thompson in improving his performance. The memos in no way support his claim of retaliation. Assuming the evaluations could be considered adverse employment actions, Thompson has failed to demonstrate any causal link between those evaluations and' his complaint against Harris.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed,</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Marin Duval, Diego Garcia, and Sean Rutherford, who are white, Latino, and African-American, respectively, were the other three production supervisors at the time Thompson was terminated.</p>\n<p>[2]  Thompson and Harris seem to have had a contentious relationship for some time. In 2002, Thompson complained to management that Harris had taken unapproved leave. In fact, she had requested and received approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>[3]  Though Thompson refers to Lepage as his \"leader,\" the record reflects that Lepage was actually Thompson's subordinate.</p>\n<p>[4]  The statute reads in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>It shall be an unlawful practice: 1. For an employer, by himself or his agent, because of the race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, which shall not include persons whose sexual orientation involves minor children as the sex object, genetic information, or ancestry of any individual to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.</p>\n\n</div>",
