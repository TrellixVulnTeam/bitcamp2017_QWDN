Michael A. Ponsor,         U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jean C. LaRocque and Shea and LaRocque, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Todd E. Newhouse, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael K.\nLoucks, Acting United States Attorney, on motion for summary\ndisposition.\n\n\n\n                         September 22, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam. In this direct appeal from his sentence, the\n\ndefendant argues that the district court plainly erred in finding\n\nhim to be an armed career criminal and abused its discretion in\n\ngiving excessive weight to deterrence in sentencing him to 262\n\nmonths' imprisonment, the low end of the applicable guideline\n\nsentencing       range.     The     government      has    moved    for   summary\n\ndisposition.      As further explained below, we grant the motion and\n\nsummarily affirm the sentence because any error in determining the\n\ndefendant's armed career criminal status was harmless since the\n\nsame guideline range resulted from the defendant's career offender\n\nstatus, which he does not challenge, and because the defendant's\n\nsentence was not substantively unreasonable under the applicable\n\nstandards of appellate review.\n\n            With respect to his armed career criminal designation,\n\nthe defendant objects to the use of his prior convictions for\n\nassault    and    battery   and   larceny    from   a     person   as   predicates\n\nbecause,    he    argues,   those    convictions     were    not   for    \"violent\n\nfelon[ies]\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e).                     He also\n\nargues that another conviction was erroneously used as a predicate\n\n\"prior\" conviction because that conviction occurred after part of\n\nthe instant offense conduct.             As the defendant acknowledges,\n\nbecause he did not object to his armed career criminal designation\n\nbelow, his challenges to that designation are reviewable only for\n\n                                       -2-\n\fplain error.   United States v. Peralta, 457 F.3d 169, 171 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (per curiam).\n\n            We need not determine whether those purported errors\n\nsatisfy the first two prongs of that demanding standard--i.e.,\n\nwhether an error occurred, United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n733-34 (1993), and, if so, whether it was sufficiently \"clear\" or\n\n\"obvious,\" id. at 734--because, as the government argues, any\n\nerrors in categorizing the defendant as an armed career criminal\n\ndid not affect the defendant's substantial rights, Olano, 507 U.S.\n\nat 734.     That is so because, as in United States v. Rivera, 448\n\nF.3d 82 (1st Cir. 2006), \"his sentence was independently justified\n\nunder the career [offender] guideline, . . . , which yields the\n\nsame sentencing range [as] the armed career criminal guideline, and\n\nwhich [the defendant] does not challenge.\"               Id. at 86 n.1.\n\n            Nor was his sentence substantively unreasonable.                      The\n\ndefendant's only argument in that regard is that the court gave\n\nexcessive    weight    to    the     need   for    general    deterrence.        That\n\ncontention lacks factual or legal support.               Although the court did\n\nemphasize that factor, it also expressly considered the \"extremely\n\nserious\"    nature    of    the    offense,   particularly         the    defendant's\n\npossession of two high-caliber handguns with \"hundreds of rounds of\n\nammunition[],\" which \"will blow a hole in you as big as your fist,\"\n\nand   his   criminal       record,    which       contained   \"a    lot    of   prior\n\nconvictions.\" The court also considered, but either discredited or\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdiscounted, the defendant's family ties and responsibilities; his\n\nemployment history; his asserted benign motives for committing the\n\ninstant drug offenses; and his potential to be a successful member\n\nof society.    Under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\n\nthat applies to a district court's procedurally sound sentencing\n\ndecisions,1 United States v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87, 92, 96 (1st Cir.\n\n2008), it is not for this appellate court to second-guess the\n\nweight given to particular factors.     Rather, absent a procedural\n\nerror or an abuse of discretion, neither of which is present here,\n\nsuch balancing is for the sentencing court,        United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 525 F.3d 85, 110 (1st Cir. 2008), particularly where, as\n\nhere, the ultimate sentence falls at the bottom of the applicable\n\nguideline range, United States v. Smith, 531 F.3d 109, 111 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).\n\n            Accordingly,   the   government's   motion   for   summary\n\ndisposition is granted and the defendant's sentence is summarily\n\naffirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The defendant does not challenge the sentence on procedural\ngrounds.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
