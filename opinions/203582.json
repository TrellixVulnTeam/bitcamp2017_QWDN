George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph M. Wrobleski, Jr. on brief for appellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Renée M. Bunker,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 5, 2008\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.       This case requires us to consider\n\nthe circumstances under which a defendant's commission of criminal\n\nacts while free on bail may justify the denial of an offense level\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility.              Discerning no clear\n\nerror   in   the    district   court's    calibration    of    the   sentencing\n\nbalance, we affirm.\n\n             The facts are straightforward.          On January 10, 2007, a\n\nfederal grand jury indicted defendant-appellant Jason Jordan and\n\nothers on several counts related to alleged drug trafficking.\n\nEight days later, the authorities took Jordan into custody.                   On\n\nJanuary 24, a magistrate judge ordered his transfer to an inpatient\n\ndrug-treatment      program.     Following    a     period    of   therapy,   the\n\nmagistrate judge released Jordan on personal recognizance.                    The\n\nconditions     of     his   release      included     prohibitions      against\n\n\"commit[ting] any offense in violation of federal, state or local\n\nlaw,\" \"possessing a . . . dangerous weapon[],\" and making \"any . .\n\n. use of alcohol.\"\n\n             Jordan reentered the community on March 8, 2007.            In the\n\nearly morning hours of June 15 (while still out on bail), he was\n\nstopped for speeding in Portland, Maine.             He admitted that he had\n\nbeen drinking, flunked a field sobriety test, and registered a\n\nblood alcohol level of 0.10.             A search of his car revealed a\n\ndouble-edged knife tucked into the driver's side door pocket.\n\nLocal authorities charged him with operating a motor vehicle while\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\funder the influence of alcohol, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29-A,\n\n§ 2411, and carrying a concealed weapon, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 25, § 2001-A.\n\n           Word of Jordan's travails soon filtered back to the\n\nfederal court.    On July 9, the court revoked his bail.         Ten weeks\n\nlater,   Jordan   pleaded   guilty   to    the   federal   drug-trafficking\n\ncharges.\n\n           The district court directed the probation office to\n\nprepare a presentence investigation report (PSI Report). The PSI\n\nReport calculated Jordan's total offense level at 28 and assigned\n\nhim to criminal history category I.         This combination resulted in\n\na guideline sentencing range of 78-97 months. In constructing that\n\nparadigm, the PSI Report declined to recommend an offense level\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility.          See USSG §3E1.1.   The\n\nReport stated:\n\n           The defendant did . . . admit to the offense\n           of conviction; however, the defendant also\n           continued to engage in criminal behavior while\n           on bond and was arrested for two new criminal\n           offenses.   Therefore, the defendant had not\n           completely withdrawn from criminal conduct and\n           the new conduct is related to the offense of\n           conviction as it is substance abuse (alcohol)\n           related.\n\n           Jordan objected to this portion of the PSI Report,\n\narguing that the June 15 incident was an aberration that should not\n\nbe allowed to overshadow his \"serious efforts to resurrect his life\n\nand to accept the consequences of his conduct.\"             In support, he\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fsubmitted a myriad of letters from friends and family attesting to\n\nhis transformation.        He also explained to the court that on June\n\n15, his companions had urged him to drink; he rebuffed their\n\nexhortations for most of the night and, when he finally succumbed,\n\nhe downed only two drinks.\n\n           Jordan attempted to minimize the dangerous weapon offense\n\nas well.   He stated that the knife was merely a tool to permit him\n\nto open the console inside the automobile.\n\n           The     district     court    devoted    considerable      time   at\n\nsentencing to Jordan's purported acceptance of responsibility.               In\n\nthe end, the court found that Jordan had not carried the devoir of\n\npersuasion and denied the sought-after adjustment.                   The court\n\nexplained that its ruling rested largely on Jordan's drunken\n\ndriving offense,1 and more specifically, Jordan's decision \"to go\n\ninto a bar with a bunch of buddies who [were] drinking.\"             By taking\n\nthat step, Jordan showed that he \"didn't care\" about the bail\n\nconditions;      rather,   he   \"was    willing    to   take   his   chances.\"\n\nRelatedly, the court rejected Jordan's claim to have limited\n\nhimself to two drinks: the quantity of alcohol consumed was more\n\naccurately evidenced, the court thought, by Jordan's blood alcohol\n\nlevel (which betrayed a much greater degree of consumption).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The charges arising out of the June 15 incident were still\npending when the district court sentenced Jordan.\n\n                                        -4-\n\f          Finally,   the    court    explained   why   it    perceived   a\n\nconnection between acceptance of responsibility for the drunken\n\ndriving offense and the offenses of conviction:\n\n                 In my view a person who is entitled to\n          acceptance of responsibility fully understands\n          the course of criminal conduct they're\n          involved with and is telling the Court that I\n          am admitting my criminal conduct, and that\n          admission includes the fact that I will\n          continue to refrain from criminal conduct\n          while out on bail.     That [did not] happen\n          here, and I'm not getting the inclination from\n          Mr. Jordan that during this period of time he\n          had made a reasoned determination that he was\n          going to change.\n\n          The court proceeded to impose a mid-range sentence of 80\n\nmonths in prison.       This timely appeal ensued.          In it, Jordan\n\nalleges that the district court gave undue weight to his drunken\n\ndriving offense in denying him a downward adjustment for acceptance\n\nof responsibility.   He argues that the court erred by considering\n\nthe drunken driving offense at all or, in the alternative, by\n\nemphasizing that offense at the expense of other factors (such as\n\nhis willingness to plead guilty and his enthusiastic participation\n\nin drug-treatment programs).\n\n          We review a district court's answers to abstract legal\n\nquestions, including its interpretation of the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines, de novo.     See United States v. Muñiz, 49 F.3d 36, 41\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).   The court's findings of fact, however, are reviewed\n\nonly for clear error.    St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 701.     This clear-error\n\n                                    -5-\n\fstandard applies to a sentencing court's factbound determination\n\nthat a defendant has not accepted responsibility.                     See United\n\nStates v. Deppe, 509 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v.\n\nRoyer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            Our   focus   here   is    on    section   3E1.1   of   the     federal\n\nsentencing guidelines. Subsection (a) of that section provides for\n\na two-level reduction in a defendant's offense level \"[i]f the\n\ndefendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his\n\noffense.\"     Subsection    (b)       allows   an   additional      level    to   be\n\nsubtracted if certain other conditions also are satisfied. Because\n\neligibility for the two-level adjustment under subsection (a) is a\n\nprerequisite for receipt of the extra level under subsection (b),\n\nwe concentrate on the requirements of the former subsection.\n\n            On appeal, Jordan challenges only the district court's\n\nfactfinding, conceding that the court was \"legally correct[] in its\n\ninterpretation of section 3E1.1.\"            Appellant's Br. at 7.        But that\n\nconcession is a bit misleading because Jordan’s factual arguments\n\nimplicate a question of law.          Hence, we must address that question\n\nbefore moving to the heart of his claim.\n\n            To support his factual argument that the district court\n\ncommitted clear error by denying him a credit for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility due to his post-indictment criminal conduct, Jordan\n\nasserts that cases upholding comparable rulings typically reflect\n\na nexus between the conduct underlying the offense of conviction\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fand the post-indictment criminal conduct.            It follows, his thesis\n\nruns, that there must be a \"significant connection\" between the\n\nindicted conduct and the post-indictment conduct, which requirement\n\ncan be satisfied only if the latter conduct is a \"significant\n\ncontinuation\" of the former conduct.          Appellant's Br. at 10-12.\n\n          This gloss misreads the law in this area.            In the first\n\nplace, the commentary to section 3E1.1 belies Jordan’s suggestion\n\nthat district courts are barred from considering post-indictment\n\ncriminal conduct absent a significant connection to the offense of\n\nconviction.    That commentary furnishes a non-exclusive compendium\n\nof factors that sentencing courts may consider in assessing a\n\ndefendant's asserted acceptance of responsibility.                This list\n\nincludes the defendant's \"voluntary termination or withdrawal from\n\ncriminal conduct or associations.\"        USSG §3E1.1 cmt. 1(b).         The\n\nplain meaning of this language extends to all criminal conduct, not\n\nmerely to criminal conduct that is of the same type as, or even\n\nrelated to, the offense of conviction.\n\n          In   the    second   place,   our   case    law   reinforces   this\n\ninterpretation.      For example, in United States v. McLaughlin, 378\n\nF.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir. 2004), we invited consideration of whether a\n\ndefendant had \"voluntarily ceased all participation in criminal\n\nactivity\" (emphasis supplied). So too United States v. O'Neil, 936\n\nF.2d 599, 601 (1st Cir. 1991), in which then-Chief Judge Breyer\n\nexplained that a district court \"could reasonably conclude that the\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f[defendant's] later conduct (such as his use of marijuana in\n\nviolation of bail conditions explicitly forbidding drug use) showed\n\nthat [he] lacked 'authentic remorse'\" and, thus, bore upon his\n\nacceptance of responsibility with respect to a charge of breaking\n\ninto a post office and stealing mail.\n\n          The heavy weight of authority in other circuits is to the\n\nsame effect.2   In United States v. Mara, 523 F.3d 1036, 1038 (9th\n\nCir. 2008), the Ninth Circuit recently wrote, \"[t]hat a defendant's\n\ncontinuing criminal conduct is different in nature, character, or\n\ndegree from the offense of conviction does not undermine the fact\n\nthat it is inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\"    See\n\nalso United States v. Prince, 204 F.3d 1021, 1023-24 (10th Cir.\n\n2000) (defendant charged with bank robbery denied acceptance-of-\n\nresponsibility credit after stabbing fellow inmate during period of\n\npresentencing detention); United States v. Ceccarani, 98 F.3d 126,\n\n130-31 (3d Cir. 1996) (defendant charged with firearms offense\n\ndenied acceptance-of-responsibility credit after testing positive\n\nfor drug use); United States v. Pace, 17 F.3d 341, 343 (11th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       To be sure, the Sixth Circuit has articulated a narrower\nrule. See United States v. Morrison, 983 F.2d 730, 735 (6th Cir.\n1993).    That court apparently allows consideration only of\n\"related\" crimes in this context. This is a minority view, and we\ndo not adhere to it. Moreover, the criminal conduct in this case\n— drunken driving — involves substance abuse. The district court\ndetermined that substance abuse had played a part in Jordan's\ninvolvement in narcotics trafficking. To that extent, then, the\npost-indictment conduct was related to the offense of conviction.\n\n                                -8-\n\f1994) (defendant charged with tax fraud denied acceptance-of-\n\nresponsibility credit after testing positive for drugs).\n\n           That ends this aspect of the matter.                     Criminal conduct,\n\nwhatever   its     nature,   is     a    powerful    indicium         of    a   lack   of\n\ncontrition.      Thus, we hold that a district court, in determining\n\nthe propriety vel non of an acceptance-of-responsibility credit,\n\nmay   consider    a   defendant's       commission       of    any    post-indictment\n\ncriminal conduct, whether or not it bears a significant connection\n\nto, or constitutes a significant continuation of, the offense of\n\nconviction.      In other words, no particular nexus is required.\n\n           We turn next to the purely factual question of whether\n\nthe district court clearly erred in refusing to allow Jordan a\n\ndiscount for acceptance of responsibility.                    We think not.\n\n           In this instance, the court concluded that Jordan's\n\ndrunken    driving     offense,         coupled    with       his     self-interested\n\nprevarication about the extent of his imbibing, showed that he had\n\nnot accepted responsibility in any authentic sense.                       On the record\n\nbefore us, that conclusion seems eminently reasonable.                          Jordan's\n\nextravagant      consumption   of       alcohol,    as    well       as   his   cavalier\n\ndecision to drive while intoxicated, provided an adequate predicate\n\nfor a finding that he had not voluntarily ceased all criminal\n\nactivity and, thus, had not genuinely accepted responsibility. See\n\nMcLaughlin, 378 F.3d at 38.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f            Jordan's decision to consume intoxicants, troubling in\n\nitself, has even more bite because he blamed his involvement in the\n\ndrug-trafficking conspiracy on an escalating addiction to alcohol\n\nand drugs. By getting drunk, he displayed indifference to the root\n\ncause of his original problem.      We have recognized before, and\n\ntoday reaffirm, that such a \"high degree of insensitivity\" calls\n\ninto legitimate question the sincerity of a defendant's professed\n\ndesire to mend his ways.    United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).     We hold, therefore, that it was not clearly\n\nerroneous for the district court to deny a reduction for acceptance\n\nof responsibility on that basis.\n\n            Equally unavailing is Jordan's argument that, even if the\n\nsentencing court properly viewed the drunken driving offense as\n\npart of the mix, it struck the wrong balance between that conduct\n\nand Jordan's significant rehabilitative efforts.      We acknowledge\n\nboth that recovery from an addiction can have its ups and downs and\n\nthat the sentencing court had discretion to discount a single\n\nadverse incident in light of an otherwise steadfast commitment to\n\nrecovery.    But this is a quintessential judgment call, and we\n\ncannot say, under all the circumstances, that the court clearly\n\nerred in striking the balance differently (and, thus, denying a\n\ndownward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            We need go no further.3    For the reasons elucidated\n\nabove, we reject Jordan's claim of sentencing error.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       Jordan has made a halfhearted argument that the district\ncourt committed clear error by finding that his blood alcohol level\nbelied his claim of having had only two drinks on the night of the\ndrunken driving incident.     Because that argument has not been\ndeveloped in any meaningful way, we deem it abandoned. See United\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Following a period of therapy, the magistrate judge released Jordan on personal recognizance.

In the early morning hours of June 15 (while still out on bail), he was stopped for speeding in Portland, Maine. He admitted that he had been drinking, flunked a field sobriety test, and registered a blood alcohol level of 0.10. A search of his car revealed a double-edged knife tucked into the driver's side door pocket. Local authorities charged him with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, <i>see</i> Me.Rev.Stat.

This clear-error standard applies to a sentencing court's factbound determination that a defendant has not accepted responsibility. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Deppe,</i> 509 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Royer,</i> 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>Our focus here is on section 3E1.1 of the federal sentencing guidelines. Subsection (a) of that section provides for a two-level reduction in a defendant's offense level \"[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" Subsection (b) allows an additional level to be subtracted if certain other conditions also are satisfied. Because eligibility for the two-level adjustment under subsection (a) is a prerequisite for receipt of the extra level under subsection (b), we concentrate on the requirements of the former subsection.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Jordan challenges only the district court's factfinding, conceding that the court was \"legally correct[] in its interpretation of section 3E1.1.\" Appellant's Br. at 7. But that concession is a bit misleading because Jordan's factual arguments implicate a question of law. Hence, we must address that question before moving to the heart of his claim.</p>\n<p>To support his factual argument that the district court committed clear error by denying him a credit for acceptance of responsibility due to his post-indictment criminal conduct, Jordan asserts that cases upholding comparable rulings typically reflect a nexus between the conduct underlying the offense of conviction and the post-indictment criminal conduct. It follows, his thesis runs, that there <i>must</i> be a \"significant connection\" between the indicted conduct and the post-indictment conduct, which requirement can be satisfied only if the latter conduct is a \"significant continuation\" of the former conduct. Appellant's Br. at 10-12.</p>\n<p>This gloss misreads the law in this area. In the first place, the commentary to section 3E1.1 belies Jordan's suggestion that district courts are barred from considering post-indictment criminal conduct absent a significant connection to the offense of conviction. That commentary furnishes a non-exclusive compendium of factors that sentencing courts may consider in assessing a defendant's asserted acceptance of responsibility. This list includes the defendant's \"voluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations.\" USSG § 3E1.1 cmt. 1(b). The plain meaning of this language extends to all criminal conduct, not merely to criminal conduct that is of the same type as, or even related to, the offense of conviction.</p>\n<p>In the second place, our case law reinforces this interpretation. For example, in <i>United States v. McLaughlin,</i> 378 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir.2004), we invited consideration of whether a defendant had \"voluntarily ceased <i>all</i> participation in criminal activity\" (emphasis supplied). So too <i>United States v. O'Neil,</i> 936 F.2d 599, 601 (1st Cir.1991), in which then-Chief Judge Breyer explained that a district court \"could reasonably conclude that the [defendant's] later conduct (such as his use of marijuana in violation of bail conditions explicitly forbidding drug use) showed that [he] lacked `authentic remorse'\" and, thus, bore upon <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> his acceptance of responsibility with respect to a charge of breaking into a post office and stealing mail.</p>\n<p>The heavy weight of authority in other circuits is to the same effect.<sup>[2]</sup> In <i>United States v. Mara,</i> 523 F.3d 1036, 1038 (9th Cir.2008), the Ninth Circuit recently wrote, \"[t]hat a defendant's continuing criminal conduct is different in nature, character, or degree from the offense of conviction does not undermine the fact that it is inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\" <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Prince,</i> 204 F.3d 1021, 1023-24 (10th Cir. 2000) (defendant charged with bank robbery denied acceptance-of-responsibility credit after stabbing fellow inmate during period of presentencing detention); <i>United States v. Ceccarani,</i> 98 F.3d 126, 130-31 (3d Cir.1996) (defendant charged with firearms offense denied acceptance-of-responsibility credit after testing positive for drug use); <i>United States v. Pace,</i> 17 F.3d 341, 343 (11th Cir.1994) (defendant charged with tax fraud denied acceptance-of-responsibility credit after testing positive for drugs).</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. Criminal conduct, whatever its nature, is a powerful indicium of a lack of contrition. Thus, we hold that a district court, in determining the propriety vel non of an acceptance-of-responsibility credit, may consider a defendant's commission of any post-indictment criminal conduct, whether or not it bears a significant connection to, or constitutes a significant continuation of, the offense of conviction. In other words, no particular nexus is required.</p>\n<p>We turn next to the purely factual question of whether the district court clearly erred in refusing to allow Jordan a discount for acceptance of responsibility. We think not.</p>\n<p>In this instance, the court concluded that Jordan's drunken driving offense, coupled with his self-interested prevarication about the extent of his imbibing, showed that he had not accepted responsibility in any authentic sense. On the record before us, that conclusion seems eminently reasonable. Jordan's extravagant consumption of alcohol, as well as his cavalier decision to drive while intoxicated, provided an adequate predicate for a finding that he had not voluntarily ceased all criminal activity and, thus, had not genuinely accepted responsibility. <i>See </i><i>McLaughlin,</i> 378 F.3d at 38.</p>\n<p>Jordan's decision to consume intoxicants, troubling in itself, has even more bite because he blamed his involvement in the drug-trafficking conspiracy on an escalating addiction to alcohol and drugs. By getting drunk, he displayed indifference to the root cause of his original problem. We have recognized before, and today reaffirm, that such a \"high degree of insensitivity\" calls into legitimate question the sincerity of a defendant's professed desire to mend his ways. <i>United States v. Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2000). We hold, therefore, that it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility on that basis.</p>\n<p>Equally unavailing is Jordan's argument that, even if the sentencing court properly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> viewed the drunken driving offense as part of the mix, it struck the wrong balance between that conduct and Jordan's significant rehabilitative efforts. We acknowledge both that recovery from an addiction can have its ups and downs and that the sentencing court had discretion to discount a single adverse incident in light of an otherwise steadfast commitment to recovery. But this is a quintessential judgment call, and we cannot say, under all the circumstances, that the court clearly erred in striking the balance differently (and, thus, denying a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility).</p>\n<p>We need go no further.<sup>[3]</sup> For the reasons elucidated above, we reject Jordan's claim of sentencing error.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The charges arising out of the June 15 incident were still pending when the district court sentenced Jordan.</p>\n<p>[2]  To be sure, the Sixth Circuit has articulated a narrower rule. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Moreover, the criminal conduct in this case  drunken driving  involves substance abuse.

Wrobleski, Jr., on brief, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Renée M. Bunker, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This case requires us to consider the circumstances under which a defendant's commission of criminal acts while free on bail may justify the denial of an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Discerning no clear error in the district court's calibration of the sentencing balance, we affirm.</p>\n<p>The facts are straightforward. On January 10, 2007, a federal grand jury indicted defendant-appellant Jason Jordan and others on several counts related to alleged drug trafficking. Eight days later, the authorities took Jordan into custody. On January 24, a magistrate judge ordered his transfer to an inpatient drug-treatment program. Following a period of therapy, the magistrate judge released Jordan on personal recognizance. The conditions of his release included prohibitions against \"commit[ting] any offense in violation of federal, state or local law,\" \"possessing a... dangerous weapon[],\" and making \"any ... use of alcohol.\"</p>\n<p>Jordan reentered the community on March 8, 2007. In the early morning hours of June 15 (while still out on bail), he was stopped for speeding in Portland, Maine. He admitted that he had been drinking, flunked a field sobriety test, and registered a blood alcohol level of 0.10. A search of his car revealed a double-edged knife tucked into the driver's side door pocket. Local authorities charged him with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, <i>see</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 29-A, § 2411, and carrying a concealed weapon, <i>see</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 25, § 2001-A.</p>\n<p>Word of Jordan's travails soon filtered back to the federal court. On July 9, the court revoked his bail. Ten weeks later, Jordan pleaded guilty to the federal drug-trafficking charges.</p>\n<p>The district court directed the probation office to prepare a presentence investigation report (PSI Report). The PSI Report <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> calculated Jordan's total offense level at 28 and assigned him to criminal history category I. This combination resulted in a guideline sentencing range of 78-97 months. In constructing that paradigm, the PSI Report declined to recommend an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See</i> USSG § 3E1.1. The Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote>The defendant did ... admit to the offense of conviction; however, the defendant also continued to engage in criminal behavior while on bond and was arrested for two new criminal offenses. Therefore, the defendant had not completely withdrawn from criminal conduct and the new conduct is related to the offense of conviction as it is substance abuse (alcohol) related.</blockquote>\n<p>Jordan objected to this portion of the PSI Report, arguing that the June 15 incident was an aberration that should not be allowed to overshadow his \"serious efforts to resurrect his life and to accept the consequences of his conduct.\" In support, he submitted a myriad of letters from friends and family attesting to his transformation. He also explained to the court that on June 15, his companions had urged him to drink; he rebuffed their exhortations for most of the night and, when he finally succumbed, he downed only two drinks.</p>\n<p>Jordan attempted to minimize the dangerous weapon offense as well. He stated that the knife was merely a tool to permit him to open the console inside the automobile.</p>\n<p>The district court devoted considerable time at sentencing to Jordan's purported acceptance of responsibility. In the end, the court found that Jordan had not carried the devoir of persuasion and denied the sought-after adjustment. The court explained that its ruling rested largely on Jordan's drunken driving offense,<sup>[1]</sup> and more specifically, Jordan's decision \"to go into a bar with a bunch of buddies who [were] drinking.\" By taking that step, Jordan showed that he \"didn't care\" about the bail conditions; rather, he \"was willing to take his chances.\" Relatedly, the court rejected Jordan's claim to have limited himself to two drinks: the quantity of alcohol consumed was more accurately evidenced, the court thought, by Jordan's blood alcohol level (which betrayed a much greater degree of consumption).</p>\n<p>Finally, the court explained why it perceived a connection between acceptance of responsibility for the drunken driving offense and the offenses of conviction:</p>\n<blockquote>In my view a person who is entitled to acceptance of responsibility fully understands the course of criminal conduct they're involved with and is telling the Court that I am admitting my criminal conduct, and that admission includes the fact that I will continue to refrain from criminal conduct while out on bail. That [did not] happen here, and I'm not getting the inclination from Mr. Jordan that during this period of time he had made a reasoned determination that he was going to change.</blockquote>\n<p>The court proceeded to impose a mid-range sentence of 80 months in prison. This timely appeal ensued. In it, Jordan alleges that the district court gave undue weight to his drunken driving offense in denying him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. He argues that the court erred by considering the drunken driving offense at all or, in the alternative, by emphasizing that offense at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> the expense of other factors (such as his willingness to plead guilty and his enthusiastic participation in drug-treatment programs).</p>\n<p>We review a district court's answers to abstract legal questions, including its interpretation of the federal sentencing guidelines, de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v.
