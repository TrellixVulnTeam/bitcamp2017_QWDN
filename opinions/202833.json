The pivotal issue in this\n\ncase concerns the application of the Racketeer Influenced and\n\nCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1962, to a street\n\ngang engaged in violent, but noneconomic, criminal activity.            That\n\nissue possesses constitutional implications weighty enough to have\n\nled one of our sister circuits to fashion a special, more rigorous,\n\nversion of RICO's statutory \"affecting commerce\" requirement for\n\nuse in connection with defendants involved with enterprises that\n\nare engaged exclusively in noneconomic criminal activity.                See\n\nWaucaush v. United States, 380 F.3d 251, 256 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\nAlthough we are reluctant to create a circuit split, we conclude,\n\nafter grappling with this difficult question, that the normal\n\nrequirements of the RICO statute apply to defendants involved with\n\nenterprises that are engaged only in noneconomic criminal activity.\n\nBased on that conclusion and on our resolution of a golconda of\n\nother issues ably raised by highly competent counsel, we affirm the\n\nappellants' convictions.    The tale follows.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           We begin with a brief synopsis of the facts.            We will\n\nembellish upon that synopsis as we reach and discuss particular\n\nissues.\n\n           In the mid-1990s, a group of youths of Cape Verdean\n\nancestry   routinely   congregated    around   Wendover   Street   in    the\n\nDorchester section of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1995, one of these\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fyouths (Nardo Lopes) killed another (Bobby Mendes).                    Nardo then\n\nwent into hiding; as of the time of trial in this case, he remained\n\na fugitive from justice.\n\n              Nardo's brother, Augusto Lopes, was also a Wendover\n\nregular.      Though he was incarcerated at the time of the Mendes\n\nslaying, he resolved upon his release from prison, in July of 1996,\n\nto kill the potential witnesses against his brother.                 That resolve\n\nextended to many of his old Wendover Street associates.\n\n              In late 1997, Augusto Lopes began associating with Manny\n\nMonteiro, who introduced him to a group of individuals whose base\n\nof operations was Stonehurst Street in Dorchester.                   Lopes's new\n\nfriends were part of a street gang that controlled Stonehurst\n\nStreet.    He soon learned that Stonehurst members \"had problems\"\n\nwith their Wendover counterparts.                Although the source was never\n\nclearly established, the antagonism was real: during the period\n\nfrom   1998    to   2000,   a   wave   of    violence     transpired    in   which\n\nStonehurst members repeatedly shot at Wendover members and Wendover\n\nmembers retaliated in kind.        Augusto Lopes was integrally involved\n\nin this cacophony of ongoing mayhem.\n\n              In September of 2004, a federal grand jury returned a\n\nthirty-three        count   superseding          indictment   naming     thirteen\n\ndefendants.      Three of these defendants are appellants here.              With\n\nrespect to them, the flagship charge was that they had violated\n\nRICO   through      their   membership      in    a   racketeering   enterprise:\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fStonehurst.        The indictment alleged that Stonehurst's primary\n\npurpose was \"to shoot and kill members, associates, and perceived\n\nsupporters of a rival gang in Boston known as Wendover.\"1                     To\n\nbuttress this allegation, the indictment enumerated nearly two\n\ndozen       instances   of   murder   and    assault   with   intent   to   kill\n\npurportedly committed by Stonehurst members.\n\n               Seven individuals, including all three appellants, were\n\ntried together on assorted charges stemming from their involvement\n\nwith Stonehurst.        Augusto Lopes became a government witness and\n\ntestified against his former Stonehurst allies, as did two other\n\ncooperating witnesses (Marcelino Rodrigues and Jason Burgo).                The\n\ngovernment also adduced testimony from a number of other eye-\n\nwitnesses about various shootings.             Police testimony, ballistics\n\nevidence, and the like completed the prosecution's case.\n\n               Following a twenty-six day trial, four defendants were\n\nacquitted.       The three appellants did not fare as well.\n\n               The jurors convicted one appellant, Jackson Nascimento,\n\nof racketeering, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), racketeering conspiracy, id.\n\n§ 1962(d), conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering in\n\nviolation of the Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering statute\n\n\n        1\n      The indictment also charged that another purpose of the\nenterprise was \"to sell crack cocaine and marijuana.\" However, the\nevidence at trial indicated that while individual Stonehurst\nmembers had engaged in drug trafficking, Stonehurst itself had not.\nAccordingly, the trial judge ruled as a matter of law that there\nwas insufficient evidence to prove that the Stonehurst enterprise\nengaged in drug dealing. We assume the correctness of this ruling.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f(VICAR),     id.   §   1959(a)(5),   a   VICAR   assault    charge,   id.   §\n\n1959(a)(3), and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of\n\nviolence, id. § 924(c).      The racketeering conviction was supported\n\nby special findings to the effect that Nascimento had (i) shot\n\nZilla DoCanto and (ii) conspired to murder members of Wendover.\n\nThe jury rejected the government's contention that Nascimento had\n\nperpetrated a second shooting and acquitted him of a second count\n\nof violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).\n\n           The jurors convicted a second appellant, Lance Talbert,\n\non a RICO conspiracy count, a substantive RICO count, and a count\n\ncharging VICAR murder conspiracy.          The jury found specially that\n\nTalbert had shot Wendover member Adiello DaRosa and had conspired\n\nto murder members of Wendover.           The government also had charged\n\nTalbert with having engaged in another shooting but dropped those\n\ncharges at the close of the evidence.\n\n           The     jurors   convicted      the   third   appellant,    Kamal\n\nLattimore, on both a RICO conspiracy count and a substantive RICO\n\ncount.   However, the district court immediately granted a judgment\n\nof acquittal as to the latter count.         The jury acquitted Lattimore\n\nof a firearms charge and of charges of VICAR assault and VICAR\n\nconspiracy.\n\n           Following the verdict, the appellants moved for judgments\n\nof acquittal or, in the alternative, new trials.           See Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 29, 33.    The district court denied these motions in full.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f             On    December     15,   2005,      the   district   court    sentenced\n\nNascimento to a 171-month incarcerative term, Talbert to a 57-month\n\nincarcerative term, and Lattimore to a 46-month incarcerative term.\n\nThese timely appeals ensued.\n\n                                           II.\n\n             Five elements must coalesce to make out a substantive\n\nRICO violation.           The government must show: \"(1) an enterprise\n\nexisted; (2) the enterprise participated in or its activities\n\naffected interstate commerce; (3) the defendant was employed by or\n\nwas associated with the enterprise; (4) the defendant conducted or\n\nparticipated in the conduct of the enterprise; (5) through a\n\npattern of racketeering activity.\"                 United States v. Marino, 277\n\nF.3d   11,   33    (1st      Cir.   2002).       The   appellants   challenge     the\n\nsufficiency       of   the    evidence     on    the   first,   second,   and   fifth\n\nelements.\n\n             VICAR, as well as RICO, is in play here.               VICAR requires\n\nthat a defendant have committed a crime of violence in return for\n\nsomething of pecuniary value from, or in order to advance or\n\nmaintain his position within, an enterprise affecting interstate\n\ncommerce that is engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1959.         Thus, a successful sufficiency challenge to the\n\nRICO   convictions           also   will     serve     to   undermine     the   VICAR\n\nconvictions.       Similarly, inasmuch as Nascimento's conviction under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924 was predicated on his having committed a VICAR\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fassault on Zilla DoCanto, that conviction will be nullified if the\n\nVICAR charge is found to be unsupportable.\n\n            Although     the     appellants'          arguments     come       in    a\n\nkaleidoscopic array of shapes and sizes (including frontal attacks\n\non the sufficiency of the evidence, questions about statutory\n\nconstruction, constitutional challenges, and complaints about jury\n\ninstructions), we organize our discussion thematically, element by\n\nelement.\n\n                                         A.\n\n            The first element of a RICO offense requires proof of the\n\nexistence    of   an   enterprise.        The   enterprise        need   not    be    a\n\nlegitimate business or a form of organization sanctioned by state\n\nlaw.     United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 587 (1981).                        It\n\n\"need only be a group of persons associated together for a common\n\npurpose of engaging in a criminal course of conduct.\"                          United\n\nStates v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16, 28 (1st Cir. 2003) (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Despite    the     absence    of    any    requirement       of    formal\n\nsanction, the government nonetheless must prove that the enterprise\n\nexisted in some coherent and cohesive form.              Turkette, 452 U.S. at\n\n583.     It follows that the enterprise must have been an \"ongoing\n\norganization\" operating as a \"continuous unit.\" Connolly, 341 F.3d\n\nat 25.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f            In all events, the enterprise must be distinct from the\n\npattern of racketeering activity that constitutes the fifth, and\n\nfinal, element of a RICO offense.          See Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583.\n\nAn   enterprise   is   chiefly   distinguished       from    the    pattern     of\n\nracketeering activity by the fact that it possesses some goal or\n\npurpose    more   pervasive   and   more       enduring   than     the    instant\n\ngratification that can accrue from the successful completion of\n\neach particular criminal act.       See Connolly, 341 F.3d at 25.\n\n            Here, the appellants argue that the government failed to\n\npresent sufficient evidence of the existence of an enterprise or,\n\nalternatively, that the district court's jury instructions obscured\n\nthe difference between RICO's \"enterprise\" and \"pattern\" elements.\n\nIn a related vein, they argue that the government failed to prove\n\nthat the enterprise was of sufficient duration vis-à-vis the time\n\nframe that was set forth in the indictment.                  We address these\n\narguments sequentially.\n\n                                    1.\n\n            We first ponder the sufficiency of the government's\n\nevidence concerning the existence of the enterprise.               With respect\n\nto this issue, we review the record de novo to determine whether,\n\ntaking the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the\n\nlight most hospitable to the government's theory of the case, a\n\nrational   jury   could   find   beyond    a    reasonable    doubt      that   the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fgovernment had established the disputed element of the offense.\n\nSee United States v. Cruz-Arroyo, 461 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            In attacking the sufficiency of the government's evidence\n\nanent the existence of an enterprise, the appellants point to\n\ntestimony    from     various     cooperating    witnesses     who   described\n\nStonehurst as a loose aggregation of friends that lacked colors,\n\ninitiation rites, and a formal hierarchy.              For example, Augusto\n\nLopes testified that Stonehurst was \"just a group\" whose members\n\n\"were all friends with each other, certain individuals acted out,\n\nand some individuals didn't do nothing at all.\"               Similarly, Burgo\n\nsaid   at   one    point   that   Stonehurst    was   \"just   a   name.\"   The\n\nappellants suggest that this testimony distinguishes this case from\n\nUnited States v. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 2001), a case in\n\nwhich we upheld the application of RICO to a street gang that \"had\n\ncolors and signs, . . . had older members who instructed younger\n\nones, its members referred to the gang as family, and it had\n\n'sessions' where important decisions were made.\"              Id. at 19.\n\n            We agree that the factors mentioned in Patrick are\n\nrelevant to the question of whether a street gang constitutes an\n\nenterprise — but their presence or absence is not dispositive of\n\nthe issue.        Here, the government provided other testimony that\n\ncould have prompted a jury reasonably to conclude that Stonehurst\n\nwas an enterprise.         After all, Stonehurst members used a shared\n\ncache of firearms that were regarded as property of the gang.              The\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fweapons were handed around and used by several different Stonehurst\n\nmembers to shoot Wendover sympathizers.           One erstwhile Stonehurst\n\nmember, Rodrigues, testified that he had traveled to purchase\n\nweapons for \"the group\" and clarified that by \"the group\" he meant\n\n\"Stonehurst.\"\n\n           In addition to testimony about Stonehurst's arsenal, the\n\nrecord contains testimony suggesting that Stonehurst members self-\n\nidentified as belonging to an organization.          Cooperating witnesses\n\nwere able to identify precisely a wide variety of individuals as\n\nbeing associated with Stonehurst.      The witnesses also displayed an\n\nability to distinguish between members and friends.\n\n           Then, too, Stonehurst members kept tabs on one another\n\nand informed one another when things would be \"hot\" because of a\n\nrecent shooting. They acted on behalf of one another by attempting\n\nto assassinate witnesses to each other's crimes.             And, finally,\n\nmembers trained other members in the use of night vision goggles,\n\nbinoculars,   and   police   evasion    tactics     to   enable   them   more\n\nefficiently to carry out their shared purpose of killing Wendover\n\nmembers.\n\n           Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, we conclude, as did the district court, that even\n\nthough   Stonehurst   lacked   some    of   the    accouterments    of   more\n\nstructured street gangs, a rational jury could find that it had a\n\nsufficiently well-defined shape to constitute an enterprise in the\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\frequisite sense.      Stonehurst exhibited group cohesion over time;\n\nits   membership    pooled    and   shared    resources;    the      individuals\n\ninvolved had a sense of belonging and self-identified as Stonehurst\n\nmembers; and the group had a well-honed set of goals.                  We think\n\nthat this is enough, if barely, to constitute a RICO enterprise.\n\nSee Connolly, 341 F.3d at 27.\n\n                                      2.\n\n           Talbert makes a related contention: that even if the\n\nevidence suffices to support a finding that Stonehurst was an\n\nenterprise, the district court's jury instructions were confusing.\n\nHe directs his umbrage at the court's instruction that a RICO\n\nenterprise need not have an \"ascertainable structure.\"                As Talbert\n\nacknowledges, this instruction has been approved as good law in\n\nthis circuit.      See Patrick, 248 F.3d at 18.\n\n           Some challenges to jury instructions are reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion.        See, e.g., United States v. Perez, 299 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).        Others, however, assign error in, say, the\n\nnature of the elements of an offense.         That type of claim engenders\n\nde novo review.     See, e.g., Marino, 277 F.3d at 28; see also United\n\nStates v. Figueroa-Encarnacíon, 343 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(noting the standard-of-review distinction).               Because Talbert's\n\nchallenge is rooted not in an abstract principle of law but in the\n\ntrial   court's    choice    of   language,   with   a   view   to   minimizing\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fpotential juror confusion, the abuse of discretion standard governs\n\nour review.\n\n            Because the challenged instruction tracks an explicit\n\nholding    of    this    court,     Talbert     starts   at    a    considerable\n\ndisadvantage.     He insists, however, that where, as here, there is\n\nonly \"minimal\" evidence of the existence of an enterprise, the\n\ntrial court should avoid the topic of ascertainable structure\n\naltogether. In a close case, his thesis runs, such an instruction,\n\nthough technically correct, promotes juror confusion.\n\n            This argument is untenable.               When an instruction is\n\npertinent to the issues submitted to the jury and constitutes an\n\naccurate statement of the law, it is hard to imagine any basis for\n\na claim of error.       See United States v. Keene, 341 F.3d 78, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 2003). Here, moreover, the district court took great pains to\n\nemphasize that \"[a]n enterprise is not merely a related assortment\n\nof criminal activities.\"           Rather, the court said, \"there must be\n\nsome goal — a purpose of engaging in a course of conduct — beyond\n\nthis isolated benefit that can come from the commission of each\n\ncriminal act.\"     The court also made clear that \"[t]he enterprise\n\nelement    [of   the    offense]    is    different   from    the   racketeering\n\nactivity element.\"        These instructions were pellucid as to the\n\ndistinctions between the \"enterprise\" and \"pattern\" elements of the\n\noffense.    We see no realistic possibility that they were a source\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fof juror confusion. Consequently, the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in charging the jury as it did.\n\n                                   3.\n\n          The appellants lodge a final objection to the finding\n\nthat Stonehurst constituted an enterprise.         This objection centers\n\non the longevity of the enterprise.          It is not a claim that\n\nStonehurst's existence was too ephemeral to satisfy the minimum\n\nduration required by the RICO statute, see H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell\n\nTel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 242 (1989) (discussing the continuity\n\nrequirement applicable to RICO enterprises), but rather a claim\n\nthat the duration of Stonehurst's existence, as proven, fell short\n\nof the period suggested in the indictment.\n\n          The argument proceeds as follows.         First, the appellants\n\nnote that the indictment specified that the named defendants\n\n\"[f]rom a time unknown, but at least by July 1996, until the date\n\nof the Indictment\" — September 30, 2004 — \"did unlawfully and\n\nknowingly conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the\n\nconduct of the affairs of the [e]nterprise, through a pattern of\n\nracketeering activity.\"      They then point out that the district\n\ncourt told the jury, without objection, that in order to establish\n\nthe enterprise element, the government had to prove that \"the\n\nenterprise [had] continue[d] in essentially unchanged form during\n\nsubstantially   the    entire   period   alleged    in   the   indictment\"\n\n(emphasis supplied).    Next, the appellants remind us that \"when a\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fcause is submitted to the jury under an instruction, not patently\n\nincorrect or internally inconsistent, to which no timely objection\n\nhas been lodged, the instruction becomes the law of the case.\"\n\nUnited States v. Gomes, 969 F.2d 1290, 1294 (1st Cir. 1992).           The\n\nquestion then becomes — or so the appellants say — whether the\n\ngovernment provided \"evidence sufficient to establish the elements\n\nrequired by the actual instructions given.\"               United States v.\n\nZanghi, 189 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir. 1999).         The appellants conclude\n\nthat this question must be answered in the negative.\n\n            The district court rejected this construct.           It found\n\nthat Rodrigues's testimony supported a finding that the enterprise\n\nexisted from at least 1997 until at least 2001.           It further found\n\nthat the evidence indicating that the Wendover/Stonehurst feud had\n\nits origins in the Mendes killing was enough to support the\n\nconclusion that Stonehurst was active as far back as 1995.           While\n\nit   acknowledged   that   there   was    no   evidence   of   Stonehurst's\n\nexistence from 2002 through 2004, the court found such evidence\n\nunnecessary because substantially all the relevant activity of the\n\nenterprise took place during the 1996-2001 time frame.           The court\n\nadded that, in any event, the exact duration of the enterprise was\n\nnot an essential element of the offense.              In its view, the\n\ngovernment demonstrated the required continuity, and no more was\n\nexigible.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f            The court concluded by analyzing what had happened as a\n\ntype of variance.        A variance occurs when \"the proof at trial\n\ndepicts a scenario that differs materially from the scenario limned\n\nin the indictment.\"      United States v. Escobar-de Jesús, 187 F.3d\n\n148, 172 (1st Cir. 1999).          The existence of a variance does not\n\nautomatically result in the vacation of a conviction.             A variance\n\nonly   requires   the    setting    aside   of   a   conviction   if   it   is\n\nprejudicial. See United States v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).        Discerning no prejudice from this particular\n\nvariance, the district court denied the appellants' motions for\n\neither judgment of acquittal or a new trial.\n\n            The appellants attack the district court's ruling on\n\nseveral levels.    Their first attack is fact-oriented: they concede\n\nthat Rodrigues testified that he was a Stonehurst member from 1997\n\nthrough 2001, but they assert that he only described activities\n\noccurring during 1998 and 2000.         This is too isthmian a view of\n\nRodrigues's testimony.\n\n            Rodrigues testified that the shootings between Wendover\n\nand Stonehurst \"started . . .           back in '95\" and were \"still\n\nongoing.\"   At the very least, this testimony supports the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Stonehurst, as an entity dedicated to\n\nwreaking havoc on Wendover, existed through the end of Rodrigues's\n\ntenure (2001). The question, then, is whether the jury verdict can\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fbe supported by testimony concerning that somewhat truncated time\n\nspan.\n\n             The appellants, citing the Second Circuit's decision in\n\nUnited States v. Morales, 185 F.3d 74 (2d Cir. 1999), insist that\n\nit cannot.    In Morales, the indictment alleged that the defendants\n\nhad belonged to a continuous enterprise that existed for a nine-\n\nyear period.     Id. at 78.    The proof, however, showed conclusively\n\nthat the enterprise had been dormant for seven years in the middle\n\nof that period because its entire membership had been incarcerated.\n\nId. at 79.     The court held that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nshow that the \"enterprise existed for the duration alleged in the\n\nindictment.\"     Id. at 81.    The court refused to \"consider whether\n\nthe evidence was sufficient to support a finding of a shorter\n\nracketeering enterprise\" on the ground that the \"indictment charged\n\na single nine-year enterprise, and the jury was instructed that it\n\ncould only convict on the racketeering and racketeering-dependent\n\ncounts if it found that the specific enterprise set out in the\n\nindictment existed.\"     Id.\n\n             The appellants asseverate that this case and Morales are\n\npeas in a pod.    They are not.   The concerns underlying the decision\n\nin Morales are very different from what is involved here.           In\n\nMorales, the government attempted to play fast and loose with\n\nRICO's continuity requirement — and it did so in a way that\n\nthreatened to impair the defendants' rights (by constructing the\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\findictment in a manner that allowed the introduction, in a single\n\ntrial, of evidence concerning two distinct criminal organizations).\n\nUnder those circumstances, we readily understand why the Morales\n\ncourt was disinclined to allow the government to argue, after\n\nputting before the jury significantly inculpatory evidence from\n\nboth periods, that either organization, by itself, could have\n\nsatisfied the continuity requirement.             That would, in effect, have\n\ngiven the government a second bite at the cherry.\n\n          The    scenario    here       is   vastly   different.         While   the\n\nindictment may have marginally overclaimed — the record contains\n\nvery little concerning the 2002-2004 period — there was no question\n\nof shifting enterprises and no attempt to stack the deck by\n\nintroducing     damning     bits        of     evidence     from    a     different\n\norangization's    conduct    in     a    different        era.     Moreover,     the\n\ngovernment had adduced ample proof that a single enterprise was\n\ncontinuously active in the slightly narrowed period.                    Indeed, the\n\ntrial seems to have proceeded on the premise that this narrowed\n\nperiod was the relevant time frame.2\n\n          To cinch matters, the appellants had every reason to\n\nbelieve that the period from 1996 through 2001 would be the crucial\n\nperiod for purposes of the RICO and other racketeering-dependent\n\ncounts.   Of     the   twenty-one       racketeering       acts    listed   in   the\n\n\n     2\n      The trial transcript reveals quite clearly that the able\ndistrict judge reined in witnesses who attempted to discuss matters\noutside that time frame.\n\n                                        -18-\n\findictment, twenty were alleged to have occurred in that time frame\n\n(the lone exception — the general charge that Stonehurst members\n\nhad conspired to kill Wendover members — was described as having\n\nspanned the period from 1996 until 2004).            This not only erases any\n\ndoubt that the indictment gave the appellants fair notice of the\n\nfocus of the charges against them, but also confirms that the\n\ngovernment did not benefit in any way from describing a slightly\n\nlonger period in the indictment.\n\n            Under these circumstances, we do not think that the\n\ngovernment can be said to have assumed the burden of proving the\n\noperation of Stonehurst from 1996 to 2004 merely by mentioning\n\nthose dates in the indictment.            The period represented a mere\n\nfactual    allegation;   it   did   not   constitute     an   element   of   the\n\noffense.    That is a significant difference.           See United States v.\n\nMueffelman,    470   F.3d   33,   38   (1st   Cir.    2006)   (describing    the\n\ndifference between a deviation from the charging terms and a\n\ndeviation from facts alleged in an indictment).\n\n            In the last analysis, we see no merit in the appellants'\n\n\"law of the case\" argument.       The district court charged the jury in\n\nrelevant part that the government had the burden of proving that\n\nthe enterprise operated continuously \"during substantially the\n\nentire period alleged in the indictment.\"              \"Substantially\" is a\n\nrelative term, which invites a weighing of the salience of covered\n\nitems against the salience of non-covered items. Cf. United States\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fv. Castaneda, 162 F.3d 832 838 (5th Cir. 1998) (holding that a\n\nparty      has    \"substantially          performed\"       when     his        \"relatively\n\ninsignificant      omissions\"       are    \"dwarfed    by    [his]    performance\").\n\nBearing in mind that virtually all the overt acts that comprised\n\nthe substance of the indictment were completed prior to 2002, we\n\nthink that a rational jury could conclude that the period form 1996\n\nthrough 2001 was \"substantially\" the entire period covered by the\n\nindictment.\n\n                                           B.\n\n              A second element of a RICO violation is an effect on\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce. Foreign commerce is not implicated\n\nhere,   and      the   district     court       instructed    the     jury       that   the\n\ninterstate commerce requirement would be satisfied by a showing\n\nthat Stonehurst's actions had at least a de minimis effect on\n\ninterstate commerce.        This instruction would have been unarguably\n\ncorrect in most RICO cases.               See, e.g., Marino, 277 F.3d at 35;\n\nUnited States v. Riddle, 249 F.3d 529, 537 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nSeizing on the fact that Stonehurst did not engage in any economic\n\nactivity, see supra note 1, the appellants argue that this case is\n\ndifferent.        In   their    view,      the    instruction     misstates        RICO's\n\nstatutory requirement with respect to enterprises that have not\n\nengaged in economic activity. They argue, in the alternative, that\n\nif   the    instruction        is   correct       as   a     matter       of    statutory\n\ninterpretation, the statute is unconstitutional as applied to their\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fenterprise.        As    a    fallback,    they    assert       that,    even      if   the\n\ninstruction       can    withstand    these       attacks,       the    evidence        was\n\ninsufficient to satisfy even the modest de minimis standard.                              We\n\nconsider each facet of this asseverational array.\n\n                                          1.\n\n            We start with the appellants' contention that, on the\n\nfacts of this case, the RICO statute requires more than a de\n\nminimis effect on interstate commerce.                  This is an uphill battle;\n\nthis court has held, squarely and explicitly, that a de minimis\n\neffect on interstate commerce is all that is required to satisfy\n\nRICO's     commerce      element.         See    Marino,      277     F.3d    at    35.\n\n            The     appellants      attempt       to    skirt    this    obstacle         by\n\nsuggesting that a more rigorous standard pertains in cases, like\n\nthis one, in which a RICO enterprise has not engaged in economic\n\nactivity.      To       distinguish   Marino,          they   point     out   that      the\n\nenterprise in question there was found to be involved in drug\n\ntrafficking — plainly a form of economic activity.\n\n            This argument is peculiar.             Although nothing in the text\n\nof RICO suggests it, the appellants urge us to read a single phrase\n\nin   the   statute       as   requiring        different      things    in    different\n\nsituations: in a case involving an enterprise engaged in economic\n\nactivity, the government would have to show only a de minimis\n\neffect on interstate commerce, whereas in a case involving an\n\nenterprise engaged in violence but not in economic activity, the\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fgovernment     would   have    to   show   a   more   substantial   effect   on\n\ninterstate commerce.          We reject this iridescent reading of the\n\nstatute.\n\n              By its terms, the RICO statute applies to any \"enterprise\n\nengaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or\n\nforeign commerce.\"       18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).           There is nothing in\n\neither the statutory language or the legislative history that\n\nsupports the appellants' contention that these words mean different\n\nthings as applied to different types of enterprises.                Courts are\n\nnot charged with the task of writing statutes or improving upon\n\nthem but, rather, with the more mundane task of figuring out,\n\nconsistent with the statutory text, what the authoring Congress\n\nintended.     This division of functions, as well as basic principles\n\nof statutory construction, counsels persuasively against a court\n\ntrying   to    tease   from   the   simple     word   \"affect\"   sophisticated\n\ngradations of meaning that will vary from situation to situation.\n\nSee Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 143 (1994) (\"Ascribing\n\nvarious meanings to a single iteration of [a word] . . . would open\n\nPandora's jar.\").3\n\n\n     3\n      Among their gallimaufry of arguments, the appellants suggest\nthat our opinion in United States v. McCormack, 371 F.3d 22, 28\n(1st Cir. 2004), vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. 1098 (2005),\nrequired a showing of a heightened effect on commerce to sustain a\nHobbs Act conviction when the victim of the robbery was not a\nbusiness. This suggestion overlooks the fact that we applied a de\nminimis standard in McCormack itself. See id. (stating that the\nevidence showed \"a 'realistic probability' that the [underlying\ncrime] would have a de minimis effect on interstate commerce\").\n\n                                      -22-\n\f          The appellants try to clear this hurdle by using the\n\nSixth Circuit's decision in Waucaush as a springboard.      That court\n\nadopted the position that the appellants espouse, holding that the\n\nRICO statute reaches an enterprise engaged in noneconomic violent\n\ncrime only if the enterprise's activities have a substantial effect\n\non interstate commerce. 380 F.3d at 255-56. The appellants invite\n\nus to follow Waucaush.   We respectfully decline the invitation.\n\n          In reaching this result, the Waucaush court did not\n\nemploy any of the usual tools of statutory construction. The\n\nabsence of anything in the reasoning of that court that explains\n\nhow it is possible, consistent with sound canons of statutory\n\nconstruction, to read the word \"affect\" as possessing two different\n\nmeanings depending upon additional facts not mentioned in the\n\nstatute itself, makes the decision suspect.\n\n          Instead   of   relying   upon   principles   of   statutory\n\nconstruction, the Waucaush court based its holding on a professed\n\ndesire to \"avoid interpreting a statute to prohibit conduct which\n\nCongress may not constitutionally regulate.\"   Id. at 255.4   Echoing\n\nthis refrain, the appellants argue, in effect, that application of\n\n\nThe language in McCormack to which the appellants advert relates to\nthe degree of scrutiny, not the quantum of proof.\n     4\n      We think it is useful to note at this juncture that Waucaush\nwas decided without the benefit of the Supreme Court's decision in\nGonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), a precedent that we find\ninstructive on the constitutional issue. See Part II(B)(2), infra.\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\fthe RICO statute to their activities raises grave constitutional\n\nconcerns and, for that reason, we should abstain from reading the\n\nstatute as encompassing noneconomic activities that have only a de\n\nminimis effect on interstate commerce.                  To hammer home this point,\n\nthey    remind    us   that   the    Supreme      Court    recently    deployed    the\n\nconstitutional avoidance doctrine in construing a federal arson\n\nstatute to avoid commerce power concerns.                    See Jones v. United\n\nStates,    529    U.S.    848,    857-58    (2000)      (construing    18   U.S.C.    §\n\n844(i)).\n\n            This       argument     reflects      a     misunderstanding     of    the\n\noperation of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. Since Jones\n\nand Waucaush were decided, the Supreme Court has made it clear that\n\nthe    doctrine    does   not     serve    to    give    alternative    meanings     to\n\nstatutory phrases in cases in which a statute's application might\n\nbe constitutionally dubious.               Courts simply are not \"free to\n\n'interpret' statutes as becoming inoperative when they 'approach\n\nconstitutional limits.'\"            Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 384\n\n(2005).    Rather, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance operates\n\nat \"the lowest common denominator,\" providing a single definition\n\nfor a phrase that is then applied even in cases in which a broader\n\nreading would not be constitutionally dubious.                  Id. at 380.\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter: because, in Marino,\n\nwe already have defined the word \"affecting\" as used in the RICO\n\nstatute, we are not now free to alter the meaning of that term for\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\fa particular fact pattern.           Nor is the option of limiting the\n\ndefinition of the term \"enterprise\" to profit-seeking entities open\n\nto us.     See Nat'l Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249,\n\n262 (1994).      Given the case law, there is simply no room remaining\n\nfor efforts at constitutional avoidance.\n\n               Jones is not to the contrary.        In that case, the Court\n\nfocused upon a particular phrase in the federal arson statute:\n\n\"used     in   interstate    or   foreign    commerce   or   in   any   activity\n\naffecting interstate or foreign commerce.\"              18 U.S.C. § 844 (i).\n\nThe   Court     determined    that   the     word   \"used\"   denotes     \"active\n\nemployment.\"       Jones, 529 at 855.        Utilizing that definition, it\n\nconcluded that the statute did not cover the burning of owner-\n\noccupied residential real estate.            See id. at 859.      The Court did\n\nnot give the statutory language a case-specific meaning but,\n\nrather, provided a single definition applicable in all cases.5               The\n\nappellants ask us to do something very different here: to give two\n\ndivergent meanings to a single word in a single statute and to pick\n\nand choose between those definitions depending on the facts of\n\nfuture cases.      We are not willing to undertake so exotic a mission.\n\n\n      5\n      The Jones Court specifically distinguished the phrasing of\nthe arson statute from statutes reaching all activity \"affecting\ncommerce,\" describing the latter phrase as \"words that, when\nunqualified, signal Congress' intent to invoke its full authority\nunder the Commerce Clause.\" Jones, 529 U.S. at 854. Given that\nthe RICO statute uses precisely this phraseology, we do not think\nthat Jones lends any support to the notion that the words \"affect\n. . . commerce\" may be read vagariously in the name of\nconstitutional avoidance.\n\n                                      -25-\n\f           In a final sortie, the appellants argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in refusing to limit the definition of conduct that\n\n\"affect[s]\" commerce to conduct detrimental to commerce.             This\n\nargument is gleaned from the Supreme Court's holding in Scheidler,\n\n510 U.S. at 262, that RICO could be applied to an enterprise that\n\nengaged in racketeering activity notwithstanding the absence of an\n\neconomic   motive.      The   Scheidler   Court   reasoned   that   \"[a]n\n\nenterprise can surely have a detrimental influence on interstate or\n\nforeign commerce without having its own profit-seeking motives.\"\n\nId. at 258.   The appellants read this language as implying that\n\nonly detrimental effects on commerce are within the contemplation\n\nof the RICO statute when applied to enterprises that are not\n\neconomically motivated.\n\n           Although one district court has read Scheidler in this\n\nrestrictive manner, see United States v. Garcia, 143 F. Supp. 2d\n\n791, 815 (E.D. Mich. 2000), we are not persuaded.        The fact that\n\nthe Scheidler Court discussed only detrimental effects is something\n\nof a makeweight; that analysis corresponded to the facts of the\n\nparticular case.     Nothing in the opinion suggests that the Court's\n\ncasual reference to \"detrimental influence\" was intended to limit\n\nthe \"affecting commerce\" language of the RICO statute.\n\n           The right of the federal government to use the power\n\nconferred by the Commerce Clause for regulatory objectives, apart\n\nfrom the direct promotion and protection of interstate commerce,\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fhas been ingrained in our jurisprudence for over a century.                 See,\n\ne.g., Champion v. Ames (The Lottery Case), 188 U.S. 321, 362\n\n(1903).    Because the word \"affect\" has an established meaning in\n\nstatutes defining the scope of federal jurisdiction as bespeaking\n\nan intention to legislate to the outermost perimeter of Congress's\n\nCommerce   Clause    power,   see   Jones,   529   U.S.   at   854,     statutes\n\nregulating undescribed activities that \"affect\" interstate commerce\n\nperforce must reach all activities that come within Congress's\n\npower. This paradigm includes ensuring that the tools of commerce\n\nare not employed in a manner injurious to the public.               Hodel v. Va.\n\nSurface Min. & Reclam. Ass'n, Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 281-82 (1981).\n\n           Against this backdrop, we cannot say that the word\n\n\"affect,\" as used in the RICO statute, is restricted to conduct\n\nthat produces detrimental effects on commerce.            This is especially\n\ntrue where, as here, we are asked to apply the definition in a\n\nsubset of RICO cases (i.e., cases involving enterprises engaged\n\nexclusively     in   noneconomic    activities),    thereby         creating   an\n\nanomalous situation in which a single word in a single statute\n\nsimultaneously would have varying meanings, depending on context.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in\n\nrefusing   to   deviate   from   the   accepted    meaning     of    the   phrase\n\n\"affect[ing] . . . commerce.\"\n\n                                       2.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\f            We move now to the appellants' most touted claim of\n\nerror: that the RICO statute, as applied to an enterprise engaged\n\nexclusively in noneconomic criminal activity, is unconstitutional.\n\nIn framing this claim, the appellants place great weight on a\n\ntrilogy of recent Supreme Court cases establishing limits on the\n\nfederal government's power to legislate under the Commerce Clause.\n\nSee United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 627 (2000); Jones, 529\n\nU.S. at 859; United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 567 (1995).\n\nThese cases, in combination, galvanized the Sixth Circuit in\n\nWaucaush, so the opinions deserve careful attention.\n\n            In the first of these cases, the Court struck down a\n\nfederal statute that, without reference to any effect on commerce,\n\ncriminalized the possession of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a\n\nschool.     Lopez, 514 U.S. at 551.       In concluding that Congress\n\nlacked power under the Commerce Clause to enact the school-zone\n\nlegislation, the Court explained that the commerce power may only\n\nbe used to justify three different kinds of laws: those regulating\n\nthe   channels   of   interstate    commerce,   those   regulating   the\n\ninstrumentalities of and things moving in interstate commerce, and\n\nthose regulating activities substantially affecting interstate\n\ncommerce.   See id. at 558-59.     Because it is this third category of\n\nregulatory authority that is in issue here, we elaborate briefly on\n\nit.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f            With respect to this third category, the Court noted that\n\nindividual instances of regulated conduct need not be substantial\n\nas long as the aggregate conduct exerts a substantial effect on\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce.                 See id.     The Court warned,\n\nhowever, that aggregation is appropriate only as to \"economic\"\n\nactivities.    Id. at 560.        The Court has since defined \"economic,\"\n\nin   the   relevant     sense,      as     relating    to   the   \"production,\n\ndistribution, or consumption of commodities.\"               Gonzales v. Raich,\n\n545 U.S. 1, 25 (2005) (quoting Webster's Third New International\n\nDictionary 720 (1966)).\n\n            The second case in the trilogy built upon this foundation.\n\nThere, the Court struck down the Violence Against Women Act, which\n\nhad sought to provide federal civil remedies to victims of gender-\n\nmotivated violence.      Morrison, 529 U.S. at 602.          Notwithstanding a\n\ncongressional      finding   that    gender-motivated       violence    exerts   a\n\nsubstantial drain on the economy, the Morrison Court \"reject[ed] the\n\nargument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal\n\nconduct    based    solely   on     that   conduct's      aggregate    effect    on\n\ninterstate commerce.\"        Id. at 617.        The Court explained that \"the\n\nsuppression of violent crime and the vindication of its victims\" was\n\nquintessentially within the police power of the several states (and,\n\nby implication, not within the federal commerce power per se).                  Id.\n\nat 618.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\f          The remaining case in the trilogy is Jones. As previously\n\ndiscussed, see supra Part II(B)(1), the Jones Court held that the\n\nincineration of private residences was beyond the reach of a federal\n\narson statute. 529 U.S. at 859. That narrow interpretation enabled\n\nthe Court to avoid \"grave and doubtful constitutional questions.\"\n\nId. at 857.\n\n          Drawing on these precedents, the appellants maintain that\n\ntheir criminal activities are an almost exact match for the violent\n\ncriminal conduct that the Morrison Court refused to aggregate (and,\n\nthus, placed beyond the reach of Congress's Commerce Clause power).\n\nThey add, moreover, that federal regulation of noneconomic street\n\ncrime under a theory of aggregation would obliterate any semblance\n\nof a constitutional limit on federal power.   Cf. Lopez, 514 U.S. at\n\n567 (commenting that the Constitution's enumeration of federal\n\npowers \"presupposes something not enumerated\").\n\n          We share the appellants' concern that the government's\n\ntheory here, aggressively pursued, might threaten to trespass on an\n\narea of traditional state concern. But though the argument has some\n\nbite, it ultimately fails to persuade.\n\n          The principal problem with the argument is that it runs\n\nat cross purposes with the Supreme Court's decision in Raich (the\n\nCourt's most recent explication of the scope of federal power under\n\nthe Commerce Clause).   The Raich decision is critically important\n\nfor present purposes because it is more directly on point than any\n\n\n                               -30-\n\fcase in the earlier trilogy.         Lopez and Morrison involved facial\n\nchallenges to federal statutes: in each case, the parties asserted\n\nthat a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress's\n\ncommerce power in its entirety.       Jones was an exercise in statutory\n\nconstruction.\n\n           The case at hand, however, entails an as-applied challenge\n\nto a generally valid federal statute.          Raich is of the same genre;\n\nit involved a request \"to excise individual applications of a\n\nconcededly valid statutory scheme.\"           Raich, 545 U.S. at 23.        The\n\nRaich Court deemed this distinction \"pivotal\" because when \"the\n\nclass of activities is regulated and the class is within the reach\n\nof federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial,\n\nindividual instances of the class.\"          Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Raich supplies a gloss on the earlier trilogy and, in the\n\nbargain, offers meaningful guidance as to how courts should approach\n\nas-applied challenges under the Commerce Clause.\n\n           In Raich, the Supreme Court upheld two provisions of the\n\nControlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 844(a), as\n\napplied to the intrastate and noncommercial cultivation of medical\n\nmarijuana.   Raich, 545 U.S. at 9.       There, the plaintiffs sought to\n\ndefine   their   activity   at   a   level    of   specificity   designed   to\n\nhighlight its noneconomic nature.           The Court rejected this effort\n\nat miniaturization, preferring instead to defer to Congress's\n\ndeclaration of the level of specificity with which an activity\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fshould be classified for the purpose of determining whether that\n\nactivity, in the aggregate, affects interstate commerce.                See id.\n\nat 30.      The Court refused to credit either the Ninth Circuit's\n\neffort to isolate a separate and distinct class of activity, id. at\n\n26, or the state legislature's effort to \"surgically excise[]\"\n\nmedical marijuana from the generality of the drug laws, id. at 30.\n\nThe Court chose instead to defer to Congress's decision not to\n\ndistinguish between medical marijuana cultivated for noncommercial\n\npurposes and the mine-run of marijuana cultivation.                  Id. at 22.\n\nBecause there was no basis on which \"to excise individual components\n\nof   that   larger   scheme,\"   the    Court    concluded     that    marijuana\n\ncultivation writ large was the appropriate activity to be considered\n\nin the Commerce Clause calculus.             Id. at 28.      Accordingly, the\n\nplaintiffs' as-applied challenge failed.          See id. at 32-33.\n\n             Of course, Raich is arguably distinguishable from the case\n\nat hand on the ground that marijuana is a fungible commodity,\n\ncapable of seeping into the interstate market regardless of the\n\npurpose for which it is grown.         But we refuse to accord decretory\n\nsignificance to a distinction that the Raich majority did not deem\n\ndecisive.      The majority emphasized that           it   is the \"class of\n\nactivity\" that is relevant.       Id. at 17.      Such classes need not be\n\ndelineated with \"scientific exactitude.\"          Id.      This formulation is\n\nmarkedly different from the one offered by Justice Scalia, who\n\nargued   unsuccessfully    that   Congress      may   regulate    noneconomic\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fintrastate activities \"only where the failure to do so could . . .\n\nundercut its regulation of interstate commerce.\" Id. at 39 (Scalia,\n\nJ., concurring in the judgment) (alteration in original).      While\n\nJustice Scalia attributes this view to the majority, see id., we\n\nread the majority opinion — especially its disclaimer of \"scientific\n\nexactitude\" — as declining to require so rigid a taxonomy.    See id.\n\nat 26-27 (opinion of the Court) (requiring only that Congress act\n\n\"rationally\" when making a \"policy judgment\" that purely intrastate\n\nactivities are an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme).\n\nWe think that Justice Scalia's election not to join the Court's\n\nopinion bears witness to the majority's unwillingness to take a more\n\nextreme view.\n\n           Refined to bare essence, Raich teaches that when Congress\n\nis addressing a problem that is legitimately within its purview, an\n\ninquiring court should be slow to interfere. Assuming the existence\n\nof a rational basis for the solution that Congress has devised, the\n\ncourt should respect the level of generality at which Congress chose\n\nto act.   See id. at 22.   It is simply too \"impractical\" for a court\n\nto insist that Congress make \"detailed findings proving that each\n\nactivity regulated within a comprehensive statute is essential to\n\nthe statutory scheme.\"     Id. at 21 n.32.\n\n           Given the lessons of Raich, it is evident that the\n\nappellants' constitutional argument — like that of the Waucaush\n\ncourt — misapprehends the relevant unit of analysis.    The linchpin\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\fof their argument is the fact that Stonehurst's activities were\n\nundertaken without an economic motive.             In the long run, however,\n\nthat isolated fact is of little significance.             The correct mode of\n\nanalysis   requires     a   more    global     view.   \"Congress's     power   to\n\ncriminalize . . . conduct pursuant to the Commerce Clause turns on\n\nthe economic nature of the class of conduct defined in the statute\n\nrather than the economic facts . . . of a single case.\"                   United\n\nStates v. Morales-de Jesús, 372 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir. 2004) (emphasis\n\nsupplied).\n\n           Thus, the class of activity is the relevant unit of\n\nanalysis and, within wide limits, it is Congress — not the courts\n\n— that decides how to define a class of activity.                    All that is\n\nnecessary to deflect a Commerce Clause challenge to a general\n\nregulatory statute is a showing that the statute itself deals\n\nrationally   with   a   class      of   activity   that   has    a   substantial\n\nrelationship to interstate or foreign commerce.                 See Maryland v.\n\nWirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 196 n.27 (1968). The intrastate or noneconomic\n\ncharacter of individual instances within that class is of no\n\nconsequence.   See id.      This core principle is fully applicable to\n\ncriminal statutes.      See Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 154\n\n(1971) (cited with approval in Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558).\n\n           The appellants' argument cannot withstand scrutiny under\n\nthis framework.       The RICO statute by its terms is limited to\n\nracketeering enterprises that \"affect . . . commerce,\" and the VICAR\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\fstatute is similarly circumscribed.       This jurisdictional element\n\nties the statutes directly to commerce in a more explicit way than\n\nthe statutes at issue in Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561, or Morrison, 529\n\nU.S. at 611, or, since neither section 841(a)(1) nor 844(a) has a\n\nnexus requirement, even Raich.     See United States v. Crenshaw, 359\n\nF.3d 977, 986-87 (8th Cir. 2004) (drawing this distinction with\n\nrespect to VICAR).\n\n           What is more, the general class of activity is a wholly\n\nlegitimate target of Commerce Clause legislation. Racketeering\n\nactivity, as a general matter, is based largely on greed.             Cf. 1\n\nTimothy 6:10 (\"[T]he love of money is the root of all evil.\").\n\nParticular manifestations include loansharking, extortion, and a\n\nhost of other financially driven crimes.         See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)\n\n(defining \"racketeering activity\").            Therefore, that class of\n\nactivity   is   sufficiently   economic   in    nature   that   it   may   be\n\naggregated for Commerce Clause purposes. See Perez, 402 U.S. at 154\n\n(upholding aggregation of extortionate credit transactions).\n\n           Given the obvious ties between organized violence and\n\nracketeering activity — the former is a frequent concomitant of the\n\nlatter — we defer to Congress's rational judgment, as part of its\n\neffort to crack down on racketeering enterprises, to enact a statute\n\nthat targeted organized violence.         See Raich, 545 U.S. at 22\n\n(describing as a \"modest\" task judicial scrutiny of whether Congress\n\nhad a rational basis for encompassing particular activity within the\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\fsweep of a statute); Crenshaw, 359 F.3d at, 986 (upholding VICAR\n\nagainst a Commerce Clause challenge and discussing the legitimacy\n\nof   targeting   violence   in   aid    of   racketeering   as   a   means   of\n\ncontrolling racketeering enterprises).           Thus, applying the RICO\n\nstatute to the appellants' activities does not offend the Commerce\n\nClause.6\n\n                                       3.\n\n            We next examine the appellants' contention               that the\n\ngovernment failed to adduce evidence sufficient to show even a de\n\nminimis connection between Stonehurst's activities and interstate\n\ncommerce.   Because Stonehurst has not been engaged in racketeering\n\nactivity of an economic nature, we employ heightened scrutiny\n\nthroughout this examination.       See United States v. McCormack, 371\n\nF.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussed supra note 3), vacated on\n\nother grounds, 543 U.S. 1098 (2005).\n\n            The evidence most loudly bruited by the government relates\n\nto the fact that one of the shootings perpetrated by Stonehurst\n\noccurred in a round-the-clock tire shop engaged in interstate\n\ncommerce.    The shooting took place after midnight and the ensuing\n\ninvestigation caused the shop to close for several hours.\n\n\n      6\n      To be sure, this degree of deference to congressional\nclassifications may create perverse incentives. Yet, one of the\ndissenters in Raich made this argument, see Raich, 545 U.S. at 46\n(O'Connor, J., dissenting), and the majority bluntly rejected it.\nSee id. at 25 n.34 (opinion of the Court). We, like the Justices,\nare confident that political checks and balances will prevent any\nsuch legislative overreaching.\n\n                                   -36-\n\f              The government first posits that the temporary closing of\n\na business engaged in interstate commerce had an effect on commerce\n\nsufficient to satisfy the de minimis standard.           In support of this\n\nproposition, it cites cases such as United States v. Vega Molina,\n\n407 F.3d 511, 527 (1st Cir. 2005), United States v. Juvenile Male,\n\n118 F.3d 1344, 1349 (9th Cir. 1997), and United States v. Davis, 30\n\nF.3d 613, 615 (5th Cir. 1994).        But the suggested comparison is not\n\napt: in those cases, the closed business was itself the target of\n\na planned robbery.        In contrast, the Stonehurst members had no\n\ndesigns on the tire shop per se; they merely held a grudge against\n\none of the shop's customers and happened to find it convenient to\n\nambush him there.\n\n              To add another distinguishing dimension, the closings in\n\nthe   cited    cases   were   for   longer   intervals   and,   thus,   caused\n\nconsiderably more disruption of the business.              See, e.g., Vega\n\nMolina, 407 F.3d at 527 (describing a full-day closure); Juvenile\n\nMale, 118 F.3d at 1349 (describing a closure lasting \"several\n\ndays\"); Davis, 30 F.3d at 615 (describing the temporary shutdown of\n\nfour gas stations).      In contrast, the tire shop here was closed, in\n\nthe dead of night, for a matter of hours.         Moreover, the proprietor\n\ntestified that he \"suspected\" that some business had been lost\n\nbecause there was less \"paperwork\" than usual but he could not\n\ndefinitively identify any such shortfall.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\f             The    government    also    posits   that   Stonehurst     members'\n\nregular use of cellular telephones as a means of coordinating their\n\nactivities comprised the requisite nexus to commerce.                  But again,\n\nthe cases that it cites are of scant assistance.              In each of them,\n\nthe court mentioned telephone use only after it had enumerated a\n\nseries of more binding links to commerce.                 See United States v.\n\nDelgado, 401 F.3d 290, 297 (5th Cir. 2005) (chronicling involvement\n\nin international drug trafficking, use of the mails, and use of\n\nWestern Union); United States v. Pipkins, 378 F.3d 1281, 1294-95\n\n(11th Cir. 2004) (describing trafficking of women and recruitment\n\nof prostitutes across state lines), vacated on other grounds, 544\n\nU.S. 902 (2005).\n\n             To be sure, one court has ruled that \"telephone use by the\n\n[enterprise] sufficiently affects interstate commerce to satisfy the\n\nRICO nexus requirement,\" United States v. Muskovsky, 863 F.2d 1319,\n\n1325 (7th Cir. 1988), but the enterprise at issue there was engaged\n\nin economic activity.        We are more dubious here both because the\n\nenterprise was devoted to noneconomic activities and because the\n\ngovernment's evidence concerning cell-phone use was skimpy.\n\n             The government's best evidence on this point consisted of\n\ntestimony to the effect that gang members communicated with each\n\nother   by   cell    phone   in   order     to   keep   abreast   of    important\n\ninformation, such as when things had become \"hot\" following a\n\nshooting.     In addition, at least two shootings attributable to\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\fStonehurst (those directed at Wendover members Luis Carvalho and\n\nAntonio Cabral) were precipitated by cell-phone calls to or between\n\nStonehurst members identifying where the intended victim might be\n\nfound.   There was, however, some countervailing evidence.      For\n\nexample, the government's star witness, Augusto Lopes, stated that\n\nStonehurst did \"[n]ot necessarily\" use cell phones to discuss acts\n\nof violence because \"they can be bugged.\"\n\n          In the end, we need not resolve whether either the tire\n\nshop or cell-phone evidence, alone or in tandem, suffices to make\n\nout the requisite de minimis connection between the enterprise and\n\ninterstate commerce.    As we explain below, there is surer footing\n\nin this case for a finding that the government satisfied the\n\n\"affecting commerce\" element of the offense.\n\n          The record reflects that Stonehurst maintained an arsenal\n\n— no fewer than nine different firearms used by Stonehurst members\n\nin carrying out Stonehurst business.    This and other evidence led\n\nthe district court to conclude that Stonehurst was a \"massive\n\npurchaser of guns.\"    With one exception (a Smith & Wesson revolver\n\nmade in Massachusetts), all the firearms acquired by Stonehurst had\n\nbeen manufactured outside of Massachusetts and, thus, had moved in\n\ninterstate commerce.\n\n          The appellants try to blunt the force of this evidence by\n\ncitation to United States v. Kallestad, 236 F.3d 225 (5th Cir.\n\n2000), in which the Fifth Circuit stated \"[i]t is one thing for\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\fCongress to prohibit possession of a weapon that has itself moved\n\nin interstate commerce, but it is quite another thing for Congress\n\nto prohibit homicides using such weapons.\"      Id. at 229.   Were the\n\nwielding of out-of-state guns, simpliciter, the only hook on which\n\nthe \"affecting commerce\" element could be hung, the Fifth Circuit's\n\ncaveat might give us pause.    Here, however, the \"gun\" evidence is\n\nstrengthened measurably by testimony that, during the currency of\n\nthe RICO conspiracy, Lattimore traveled from Massachusetts to New\n\nHampshire,   purchased   a    firearm,   and   brought   it   back   to\n\nMassachusetts.   That weapon became part of Stonehurst's arsenal and\n\nwas later fired by a Stonehurst member at a car in which Wendover\n\nmembers were thought to be riding.\n\n          The fact that a Stonehurst member actually crossed state\n\nlines to purchase a weapon for use in carrying out the enterprise's\n\nactivities is entitled to great weight in the decisional calculus;\n\ncrossing state lines for purpose of engaging in a commercial\n\ntransaction is a paradigmatic example of an activity that falls\n\nwithin the compass of the commerce power.7      Cf. United States v.\n\nClark, 435 F.3d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir. 2006) (noting that \"requiring\n\ntravel in foreign commerce, coupled with engagement in a commercial\n\n\n     7\n      Travel to another state in order to effectuate a gun purchase\ndistinguishes this case from Garcia, a district court case relied\non by the appellants. In finding insufficient evidence of economic\nactivity to sustain a RICO conviction of a street gang, the Garcia\ncourt took pains to note the absence of any allegation \"that the\nmembers of the [gang] traveled out of state to purchase weapons.\"\n143 F. Supp. 2d at 807.\n\n                                 -40-\n\ftransaction    while    abroad,   implicates   foreign   commerce   to    a\n\nconstitutionally adequate degree\").        This purchase, coupled with\n\nthe evidence concerning the amassed arsenal of firearms manufactured\n\nout of state, suffices to satisfy RICO's interstate commerce nexus.\n\nIt follows that the tire shop evidence and the evidence of cell-\n\nphone use are, in the circumstances of this case, merely frosting\n\non the cake.\n\n                                    C.\n\n          The final element in the RICO equation requires the\n\ngovernment to show that a defendant participated in the conduct of\n\nthe enterprise \"through a pattern of racketeering activity.\"             18\n\nU.S.C. § 1962(c).      A pattern requires a minimum of two racketeering\n\nacts.   See id. § 1961(5).        The word \"through\" implies a nexus\n\nbetween these racketeering acts and the enterprise.          That nexus\n\nexists when a defendant is able to commit the predicate racketeering\n\nacts either by means or as a result of his involvement with the\n\nenterprise.    See Marino, 277 F.3d at 27.\n\n          In this instance, the jury found that Nascimento had\n\ncommitted two racketeering acts: (i) shooting DoCanto and (ii)\n\nconspiring to kill Wendover members.      He argues before us that the\n\nevidence did not support a finding that a relationship existed\n\nbetween the DoCanto shooting and his membership in Stonehurst.           If\n\nthis argument prevails, it would thwart the government's effort to\n\n\n\n\n                                   -41-\n\fprove    a   pattern   of   racketeering   activity,   and   Nascimento's\n\nconviction would topple.\n\n             Nascimento marshals a similar argument concerning his\n\nVICAR conviction for assault in aid of racketeering. VICAR forbids,\n\ninter alia, committing assault with a dangerous weapon \"for the\n\npurpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position\n\nin\" a racketeering enterprise.       Id. § 1959(a)(3).       Thus, if the\n\nevidence was inadequate to support a finding that he shot DoCanto\n\nto maintain his position in Stonehurst, then the VICAR conviction\n\ncannot stand.\n\n             In approaching these arguments, one fact sticks out like\n\na sore thumb. Despite the perfervid rhetoric in which the arguments\n\nare couched, Nascimento does not challenge the sufficiency of the\n\ngovernment's proof that he actually shot DoCanto.              Our task,\n\ntherefore, is to undertake de novo review in order to ascertain\n\nwhether, taking all reasonable inferences in the government's favor,\n\nrational jurors could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nnecessary relationship existed between Nascimento's shooting of\n\nDoCanto and his membership in Stonehurst.       See Connolly, 341 F.3d\n\nat 22.\n\n             The record reflects that on the night of November 29,\n\n1998, DoCanto was standing near her car.         Her boyfriend, Anildo\n\nRocha, was inside the vehicle.        Nascimento opened fire, hitting\n\nDoCanto in the left leg.     Although there is no evidence that either\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\fDoCanto or Rocha were Wendover members, Augusto Lopes testified that\n\nNascimento stated that he had fired the shots with the intention of\n\nhitting the man in the car, whom he mistakenly believed to be\n\nDoCanto's brother, Joaquim \"Big Rocky\" Martins.    In light of this\n\ntestimony, Nascimento's claim of error boils down to a plaint that\n\nthe evidence was too thin to warrant a finding that Nascimento\n\nunderstood his intended target — Big Rocky — to be affiliated with\n\nWendover.\n\n            This plaint rests heavily on Lopes's further testimony\n\nthat \"Big Rocky . . . wasn't associated with nobody.\"   Lopes added,\n\nhowever, that Big Rocky \"was actually involved in the problems.\"\n\nThe jury, of course, was entitled to discount the former statement\n\nand to credit the latter.   See, e.g., United States v. Alicea, 205\n\nF.3d 480, 483 (1st Cir. 2000) (acknowledging jury's \"prerogative to\n\ncredit some parts of a witness's testimony and disregard other\n\npotentially contradictory portions\").\n\n            Endeavoring to parry this thrust, Nascimento argues that\n\nthe allusion to \"the problems\" might be a reference to the fact that\n\nBig Rocky was a witness to the Mendes murder committed by Nardo\n\nLopes, not a reference to any involvement with Wendover.       That\n\ninterpretation is propped up by Rodrigues's testimony that he\n\nunderstood Big Rocky to be one of the witnesses against Nardo Lopes.\n\nBut the government counters, with considerable force, that at a\n\ndifferent place in his testimony Augusto Lopes unequivocally named\n\n\n                                -43-\n\fBig Rocky as a Wendover collaborator.    The government also notes\n\nthat the jury heard testimony from an admitted Wendover member,\n\nAdiello DaRosa, that Big Rocky was associated with Wendover.\n\n          Sifting through conflicting testimony and determining\n\nwhere the truth lies is the sort of work that falls squarely within\n\nthe jury's province.   So it is here: the question is one of fact,\n\nand the answer depends on what evidence the jurors deign to credit.\n\nWhen a jury, which has seen and heard the witnesses, picks and\n\nchooses among conflicting accounts, an appellate court should almost\n\nalways honor that choice. See United States v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302,\n\n311 (1st Cir. 2006) (explaining that it is \"ultimately the province\n\nof the jury to assess the significance of any contradictions in the\n\nevidence\").\n\n          That effectively ends this aspect of the matter. Once the\n\njury had decided which account of Big Rocky's status should be\n\ncredited, the legal implications of that decision were clear.\n\nConsequently, we reject Nascimento's claim of error.8\n\n\n\n     8\n      Nascimento offers a laundry list of cases in which courts\nhave overturned convictions under RICO and VICAR based on the\nprosecution's failure to establish the requisite nexus between the\npredicate act and the enterprise.    See, e.g., United States v.\nBruno, 383 F.3d 65, 85-86 (2d Cir. 2004); United States v.\nFerguson, 246 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir. 2001); United States v.\nPolanco, 145 F.3d 536, 539-40 (2d Cir. 1998); United States v.\nThai, 29 F.3d 785, 818 (2d Cir. 1994). Without exception, these\ncases — all of which either explore the degree of attenuation\npermissible between a racketeering act and an enterprise or\nhighlight the utter absence of any evidence supporting a\nrelationship between the two — are inapposite.\n\n                               -44-\n\f            Nascimento argues in the alternative that, given the\n\ncontradictions in the testimony, the jury could not rationally have\n\nfound him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.       He cites United States\n\nv. Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998), for the familiar\n\nproposition that when the evidence, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, supports both a theory of guilt and\n\nan equally likely theory of innocence, reasonable jurors must\n\nperforce entertain a reasonable doubt.        In this case, however, the\n\njury was under no compulsion to deem the contrasting theories of\n\nguilt and innocence equally likely.        The jury plausibly could have\n\ncredited the clear and unambiguous statement of DaRosa, himself a\n\nWendover stalwart and presumably a reliable source of information\n\nabout the gang's composition, that Big Rocky was a Wendover member\n\nand was for that reason \"part of the problems.\"\n\n            Nascimento advances a further argument to the effect that\n\nVICAR requires an even tighter relationship between a predicate\n\nracketeering act and an enterprise because the act must be \"for the\n\npurpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position\n\nin   an   enterprise.\"   18   U.S.C.   §   1959(a).   This   argument   is\n\nforeclosed by precedent: the VICAR provision is satisfied as long\n\nas the criminal act can be said to have been expected of the\n\ndefendant by reason of his membership in the enterprise.          United\n\nStates v. Tse, 135 F.3d 200, 206 (1st Cir. 1998). The totality of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -45-\n\fthe evidence in regard to Nascimento's shooting of DoCanto passes\n\nthat test.\n\n           To say more on this point would be superogatory.                  We\n\nconclude, on whole-record review, that the evidence was sufficient\n\nto sustain both an inference that Nascimento fired at DoCanto as\n\npart of an effort to eliminate a member of the rival Wendover gang\n\nand an inference that this conduct was expected of him by reason of\n\nhis   membership   in    Stonehurst.         Thus,   there   is   an   adequate\n\nrelationship,    for    both   RICO   and    VICAR   purposes,    between    the\n\nchallenged racketeering act and the enterprise.\n\n                                      III.\n\n           The jury convicted both Talbert and Nascimento on a trio\n\nof charges: a substantive RICO offense, RICO conspiracy, and VICAR\n\nconspiracy to commit murder.      In each case, one of the racketeering\n\nacts undergirding the substantive RICO charge was conspiracy to\n\ncommit murder.     These two appellants now say that the interplay\n\nbetween the substantive RICO charge and the conspiracy charges\n\noffended the Double Jeopardy Clause.           For the reasons that follow,\n\nwe reject their importunings.\n\n           One branch of the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the\n\ngovernment from punishing a person twice for the same offense.              See\n\nU.S. Const., amend. V.     Despite this proscription, the same conduct\n\nsometimes can be punished under more than one statute.             See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Morris, 99 F.3d 476, 477-78 (1st Cir. 1996).               Such\n\n\n                                      -46-\n\fmultiple punishments are permissible if the underlying offenses are\n\ndistinct from one another, that is, if each offense \"requires proof\n\nof a fact that the other does not.\"        Blockburger v. United States,\n\n284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932).\n\n           Here, Talbert and Nascimento argue that because conspiracy\n\nto commit murder served as a predicate act for their substantive\n\nRICO convictions, the VICAR charge that they conspired to commit\n\nmurder lacked any element distinct from the substantive RICO charge.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, each of them argues that his conviction for\n\nconspiracy to violate RICO was a lesser included offense within his\n\nsubstantive RICO conviction and, thus, barred under the Blockburger\n\ntest.   See Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 168 (1977) (discussing the\n\nrelationship between lesser included offenses and double jeopardy).\n\n           These arguments are not persuasive.        In Marino, 277 F.3d\n\nat 39, we held \"that a substantive RICO violation and a RICO\n\nconspiracy are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.\"\n\nIn the same opinion, we rejected the notion that a VICAR violation\n\nis a lesser included offense of a substantive RICO violation.           See\n\nid.\n\n           The    appellants'   attempts    to   distinguish   Marino   are\n\nunavailing.      They focus on two facts: (i) that Marino involved a\n\ngreater number of racketeering acts and (ii) that here, unlike in\n\nMarino, the purpose of the enterprise (killing Wendover members) was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fidentical to the object of the charged conspiracy. Neither of those\n\ndistinctions makes a dispositive difference.\n\n           The Blockburger test \"depends on the elements of the\n\ncrimes and not the similarity of the underlying facts.\"                 United\n\nStates v. LeMoure, 474 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir. 2007).                  Thus, in\n\nresolving a double jeopardy challenge such as that advanced here,\n\na court should not bog itself down in the minutiae of the evidence\n\nunderlying the charges but, rather, should confine itself to the\n\nstatutory elements of the two offenses.        Because a \"RICO conspiracy\n\nand a RICO violation do not necessarily require the participation\n\nof the same people,\" Marino, 277 F.3d at 39 (emphasis in the\n\noriginal), it is beside the point whether, in a particular instance,\n\nthe   racketeering   acts   are   few   or   many,   or   whether    the   RICO\n\nconspirators and the RICO participants are identical. By the same\n\ntoken, the fact that the purpose of the enterprise and the object\n\nof the conspiracy happen to coincide is of no moment.               See United\n\nStates v. Sessa, 125 F.3d 68, 72 (2d Cir. 1997).\n\n           The appellants' fallback position rests on Wharton's Rule,\n\nwhich carves out a modest exception to the general principle that\n\nthere is no bar to conviction for both a criminal conspiracy and a\n\nsubstantive criminal offense committed within the course of the\n\nconspiracy.   See United States v. Previte, 648 F.2d 73, 76-77 (1st\n\nCir. 1981) (explicating the rule). Wharton's Rule is limited to\n\ninstances — adultery is a prime example — in which, as a statutory\n\n\n                                   -48-\n\fmatter,   the   completed   offense    necessarily   involves    conspiracy\n\nbetween the participants.     See United States v. Iannelli, 420 U.S.\n\n770, 785 (1975).     We rejected a Wharton's Rule challenge in an\n\nearlier RICO case, see Marino, 277 F.3d at 39, and because the rule\n\noperates at the statutory level, see Iannelli, 420 U.S. at 780, we\n\nlikewise reject the appellants' fact-bound attempt to resurrect what\n\namounts to the same argument.\n\n           That brings this chapter to a close.       The short of it is\n\nthat these appeals do not implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n           The last leg of our journey requires us to consider\n\nNascimento's assertion that the district court erred in refusing to\n\nsuppress evidence seized from his room during an arrest.\n\n           The facts are as follows.        Nascimento was facing state\n\ncriminal charges arising out of the DoCanto shooting.           He failed to\n\nreport as required and a state magistrate issued a default warrant.\n\nOn December 7, 1999, the police — armed with the arrest warrant but\n\nno search warrant — arrived at Nascimento's home.               Following a\n\nconsensual entry, they informed Nascimento (who was clad only in his\n\nunderwear) that he was to be arrested.        Because Nascimento seemed\n\ncompliant, the officers did not handcuff him.\n\n           Two officers escorted Nascimento through the house to his\n\nbedroom so that he could get dressed.       Once there, the officers did\n\na quick sweep of the bed for weapons and sat Nascimento on it.          One\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fof the officers proceeded to the clothes closet located eight to ten\n\nfeet from the bed.          The officer performed a brief sweep of the\n\ncloset, noticed an unlocked cabinet on the top shelf, reached in,\n\nand   discovered   a   gun    frame.     At    that   point,   Nascimento   was\n\nhandcuffed.\n\n            Following his indictment in this case, Nascimento moved\n\nto suppress the gun frame as the fruit of an illegal search.                See\n\nU.S. Const., amend. IV.         The district court denied the motion.\n\nNascimento appeals from this ruling.\n\n            It would be difficult to regard the introduction of the\n\ngun frame as harmless: it was matched by a government ballistics\n\nexpert to shell casings found at one of the Stonehurst shootings.\n\nThe fact that Nascimento had possession of the gun frame also served\n\nto corroborate Augusto Lopes, who testified that Nascimento had\n\ndisassembled a gun following a shooting, handed the barrel to Lopes\n\nfor disposal, and kept the frame. Given the force of this evidence,\n\nwe think it best to address Nascimento's claim on its merits.\n\n            At the outset, it seems useful to distinguish between\n\nsearches   incident    to    arrest    and    protective   sweeps.   Officers\n\neffecting an arrest are entitled to make a search incident to that\n\narrest.    Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 763 (1969).           The scope\n\nof a search incident to an arrest is restricted to the area within\n\nthe immediate control of the arrestee, that is, \"the area from\n\n\n\n\n                                       -50-\n\fwithin which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible\n\nevidence.\"   Id.\n\n          Protective sweeps are conceptually distinct from searches\n\nincident to arrest.   They are not justified by the potential threat\n\nposed by the arrestee but, rather, by the potential threat posed by\n\nunseen third parties who may be lurking on the premises.        See\n\nMaryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 336 (1990).         Consequently, a\n\nprotective sweep is limited to a \"cursory visual inspection of those\n\nplaces where a person might be hiding.\"     Id. at 327; see United\n\nStates v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 149-51 (1st Cir. 2005) (discussing\n\nprotective sweep doctrine).\n\n          In this case, the district court cited both Chimel and\n\nBuie.   We confine our analysis more narrowly: because the cabinet\n\nsearched was too small to accommodate a person, we concentrate on\n\nwhether the search passes muster under Chimel.\n\n          There is some disarray in the case law as to standard of\n\nreview that pertains to a determination of the permissible scope of\n\na search incident to arrest.      Some courts have used a clearly\n\nerroneous standard.   See, e.g., United States v. Morales, 923 F.2d\n\n621, 626-27 (8th Cir. 1991); United States v. Bennett, 908 F.2d 189,\n\n193-94 (7th Cir. 1990).    Others have undertaken de novo review.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Abdul-Saboor, 85 F.3d 664, 667 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1996); United States v. Johnson, 18 F.3d 293, 294 (5th Cir.\n\n1994) (opinion on rehearing).      In our judgment, a bifurcated\n\n\n                                -51-\n\fstandard of review is appropriate.         See United States v. Espinoza,\n\n___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2007) [No. 06-2065, slip op. at 5-7]\n\n(discussing general approach to appellate review of district court\n\nrulings on suppression motions); cf. United States v. Coker, 433\n\nF.3d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 2005) (discussing the bifurcated standard of\n\nreview applicable to suppression rulings in the context of the Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel).        Under that approach, we review the\n\ndistrict court's factual findings for clear error but review de novo\n\nits ultimate constitutional conclusion.\n\n             Before moving to the heart of Nascimento's argument, we\n\npause   to   brush   aside   a   potential   complication.    The   police\n\noriginally encountered Nascimento in the front of the apartment. At\n\nthat time, the cabinet was unquestionably beyond his immediate\n\ncontrol. Under the circumstances, however, it was not inappropriate\n\nfor the police to escort Nascimento to his bedroom in order that he\n\nmight get dressed.\n\n             When police encounter and arrest a partially clothed\n\nindividual in his home, the need to dress him may constitute an\n\nexigency justifying the officers in entering another room in order\n\nto obtain needed clothing.        See United States v. Gwinn, 219 F.3d\n\n326, 333 (4th Cir. 2000). Generalizations are hazardous because one\n\ncan imagine infinitely variable fact patterns.         It suffices to say\n\nthat both human dignity and the New England climate counseled here\n\nin favor of a more complete wardrobe.          In addition, the district\n\n\n                                    -52-\n\fcourt supportably found that the police neither manipulated the\n\nsituation nor used Nascimento's dishabille as a pretext to carry out\n\nan otherwise impermissible search.         Accordingly, the conduct of the\n\npolice in deciding to dress the suspect falls within the reasonable\n\nlatitude   afforded   arresting     officers     in    coping   with    exigent\n\ncircumstances.   See United States v. Cook, 277 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (explaining that \"common sense and practical considerations\n\nmust guide judgments about the reasonableness of searches and\n\nseizures\").\n\n           This brings us to the search itself. The evidence at the\n\nsuppression hearing indicated that, as a matter of policy, Boston\n\npolice officers in similar situations allowed arrestees to select\n\nthe clothes that they wished to wear.                 The arrestee, however,\n\ntypically would not be given direct access to the closet.              Thus, the\n\nquestion reduces to whether a cabinet eight to ten feet away from an\n\nunrestrained   suspect   can   be   said    to   be    within   the    suspect's\n\nimmediate control. Emphasizing that there were two officers between\n\nhim and the closet, Nascimento argues that we should answer this\n\nquestion in the negative.      To buttress his argument, he calls our\n\nattention to United States v. Johnson, 16 F.3d 69 (5th Cir. 1994),\n\nmodified on rehearing, 18 F.3d 293, in which the Fifth Circuit found\n\nthat a briefcase some eight feet away from an unrestrained suspect\n\nwas not under his immediate control.             See id. at 70-72.        In so\n\n\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\fholding, the court stressed that four officers were present in the\n\nroom.    Id. at 71.\n\n            In    our    estimation,     Johnson   is    of    little   help   to\n\nNascimento.      There, unlike in the case at hand, the officers \"never\n\nfelt threatened\" and never \"believed that Johnson was about to\n\ndestroy evidence.\"        Id. at 72.    Despite that mindset, they engaged\n\nin \"precisely the type of generalized, warrantless search prohibited\n\nby Chimel.\"      Id.\n\n            This case is a horse of a different hue.                 The officers\n\nwere arresting a person whom they knew to have been charged with a\n\ncrime of violence.       Law enforcement officers who embark on perilous\n\nduties   are     not    expected   to   ignore   the    need   for    commonsense\n\nprecautions.      And here, in sharp contradistinction to Johnson, the\n\nofficers targeted their search to the closet, which was about to\n\nbecome the locus of activity.           The district court found as a fact\n\nthat the closet was readily accessible to Nascimento.                That finding\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.\n\n            That is game, set, and match.               Given the finding of\n\naccessibility, the closet (and, thus, the cabinet) was within\n\nNascimento's immediate control.9 Accordingly, we uphold the district\n\ncourt's ultimate conclusion that the scope of the search was within\n\n\n\n     9\n      This result is consistent with our earlier implication that,\nin a small space such as a 10-foot by 10-foot room, even a\nhandcuffed suspect has a \"grab area\" covering most of the room.\nSee United States v. Ortiz, 146 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                        -54-\n\fpermissible limits.      See Abdul-Saboor, 85 F.3d at 671 (holding an\n\narea that is \"conceivably accessible\" to arrestee to be within his\n\nimmediate control). On that basis, the district court appropriately\n\ndenied the motion to suppress.\n\n                                       V.\n\n            We   need   go   no   further.   Concluding,   as   we   do,   the\n\nappellants' arguments lack force, we affirm their convictions.             We\n\nadd only that while this case may venture near the outer edge of\n\nconduct encompassed by the RICO statute, Stonehurst's activities do\n\nnot cross that line.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n                    — Concurring Opinion Follows —\n\n\n\n\n                                      -55-\n\f           BOUDIN,   Chief   Judge,   concurring.   Although   several\n\nimportant issues are raised on these appeals, the one of greatest\n\ncontinuing importance concerns RICO's commerce requirement, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1962(c) (2000), and the constitutional challenge by the\n\ndefendants based on United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), and\n\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000)--the duo itself\n\nhaving been distinguished more recently by Gonzales v. Raich, 545\n\nU.S. 1 (2005).10\n\n           RICO reaches an enterprise that \"affect[s]\" interstate\n\ncommerce, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a term of art usually signifying\n\nCongress's intent to regulate to the limit of its Commerce Clause\n\npowers.   Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 115\n\n(2001).   In our case, the evidence showed the gang's regular use of\n\nguns that had moved in interstate commerce, as well as one trip by\n\na gang member across state lines to procure such weapons.      The guns\n\nwere not peripheral; they related directly and centrally to the\n\ngang's activities.    This nexus is enough to satisfy the Commerce\n\nClause.   That the acquisition of such weaponry swells, rather than\n\nimpedes, interstate commerce long ago ceased to matter.         United\n\nStates v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 113 (1941).\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848 (2000), is also cited\nalong with the Lopez-Morrison duo, but Jones was a statutory\ninterpretation case and did not directly engage the scope of\nCongress's commerce power.\n\n                                  -56-\n\f           The commerce link in our case is at least as strong and\n\narguably stronger than that of a prior felon who acquires, in some\n\nlocal \"street\" transaction, a gun that happened to be made in\n\nanother state.     The act of a felon receiving or possessing such a\n\ngun (or, indeed, even a single bullet) has for many years been a\n\nfederal criminal offense, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), based on the\n\nprior movement of the gun in interstate commerce.            Scarborough v.\n\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 563 (1977).            Here, multiple weapons and\n\ntheir use as part of the criminal enterprise were amply proved.\n\nGiven Scarborough, our own case appears a fortiori.\n\n           Some courts in upholding the felon-in-possession statute\n\nassert that it regulates an \"instrumentality\" of commerce, namely\n\nthe gun.   E.g., United States v. Dorris, 236 F.3d 582, 586 (10th\n\nCir.   2000).    But    in   truth   the   statute   criminalizes   conduct--\n\npossession or receipt of a gun by a felon--and the gun's provenance\n\nprovides a sufficient nexus to commerce to permit federal regulation\n\nof that conduct.       The offending conduct here is the use of guns to\n\nkill people as part of a criminal enterprise; and the interstate\n\norigins of the guns permit Congress to regulate that conduct.             If\n\nCongress can regulate the mere possession of a gun because the gun\n\nat one time traveled in interstate commerce, surely it can also\n\nregulate an enterprise that uses such guns to kill.\n\n           There are other analogous statutes.            The federal car-\n\njacking statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2119 (2000), makes murder and lesser\n\n\n                                      -57-\n\fviolence into federal crimes simply because the vehicle once moved\n\nin interstate commerce, and it has repeatedly been upheld.     E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Cobb, 144 F.3d 319, 320-21 (4th Cir. 1998).     And\n\ncourts regularly uphold wire and mail fraud convictions because a\n\nsingle call or mailing, playing an incidental role in the scheme,\n\ncreates a link to an instrumentality of interstate commerce, e.g.,\n\nSchmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 710-715 (1989); Pereira v.\n\nUnited States, 347 U.S. 1, 8 (1954).    In fact, the call or mailing\n\nmay itself be intrastate so the link is the use of facilities that\n\nalso serve interstate customers, e.g., United States v. Gil, 297\n\nF.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2002).\n\n          Lopez and Morrison concerned statutes that did not require\n\nany jury finding that the conduct in the particular case used\n\nfacilities of interstate commerce or affected such commerce. Lopez,\n\n514 U.S. at 561; Morrison, 529 U.S. at 613.    The legality of each\n\nstatute in these two cases depended on imputing (in Lopez) or\n\nupholding (in Morrison) a generalized Congressional determination\n\nthat a class of primarily local activities taken together had some\n\ncumulative effect on commerce, even if individual effects were too\n\nsmall to count.   Lopez, 514 U.S. at 563; Morrison, 529 U.S. at 615.\n\n          The cumulative impact theory had been well established in\n\ncommerce clause cases since Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942).\n\nIn Lopez and Morrison, the Supreme Court restricted the theory to\n\ncases of economic activity.    Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561; Morrison, 529\n\n\n                                -58-\n\fU.S. at 611.   But the restriction, which we must assume continues to\n\nbe good law, has nothing to do with a case where the statute\n\nrequires and the evidence shows that the defendants themselves had\n\nthe   requisite   effect   on   commerce--here   by   the   purchase   and\n\npossession of weaponry.\n\n          Raich is yet a different kind of problem.             Marijuana\n\ncultivation taken as a whole is a commercial activity affecting\n\ninterstate commerce; but the Supreme Court upheld the criminal ban\n\neven where marijuana is grown for personal non-economic use and\n\nconsumed in-state.     Its rationale was that Congress could reach\n\ncases of this kind because, given the practical difficulties of\n\ndistinguishing, a ban on such intrastate, noncommercial production\n\nwas an \"essential part of the larger regulatory scheme.\"       Raich, 545\n\nU.S. at 27.\n\n          The present case is easier for the government than was\n\nRaich.   To repeat, the RICO statute requires that the particular\n\nenterprise itself affect interstate commerce and a jury, supported\n\nby evidence, determined that the enterprise in this case did affect\n\nsuch commerce.    The guns traveled in interstate commerce; so too did\n\none of the enterprise's gun purchasers.     This is sufficient to pass\n\nconstitutional muster. Cf. Scarborough, 431 U.S. 563.        However much\n\nRaich may or may not affect Lopez and Morrison, the convictions in\n\nthis case satisfy established precedent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -59-\n\f          Congress' use of the Commerce Clause to reach local crimes\n\nor criminals plausibly linked in the individual case to interstate\n\ncommerce may or may not be good federalism policy but its legality\n\nis too well established to be revisited by the lower federal courts.\n\nConceivably, the link in a particular case may be too slight or\n\nfaint; every murder is of someone whose next meal might otherwise\n\nhave come from a large supermarket chain purchasing its products\n\ninterstate.   See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 564.   But the arsenal of guns in\n\nthis case is not a slight or faint connection and is sufficient to\n\nsustain federal jurisdiction under existing Supreme Court precedent.\n\n\n\n\n                                -60-\n\f",

That issue possesses constitutional implications weighty enough to have led one of our sister circuits to fashion a special, more rigorous, version of RICO's statutory \"affecting commerce\" requirement for use in connection with defendants involved with enterprises that are engaged exclusively in noneconomic criminal activity. <i>See Waucaush v. United States,</i> 380 F.3d 251, 256 (6th Cir.2004). Although we are reluctant to create a circuit split, we conclude, after grappling with this difficult question, that the normal requirements of the RICO statute apply to defendants involved with enterprises that are engaged only in noneconomic criminal activity. Based on that conclusion and on our resolution of a golconda of other issues ably raised by highly competent counsel, we affirm the appellants' convictions. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a brief synopsis of the facts. We will embellish upon that synopsis as we reach and discuss particular issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1990s, a group of youths of Cape Verdean ancestry routinely congregated around Wendover Street in the Dorchester section of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1995, one of these youths (Nardo Lopes) killed another (Bobby Mendes). Nardo then went into hiding; as of the time of trial in this case, he remained a fugitive from justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nardo's brother, Augusto Lopes, was also a Wendover regular. Though he was incarcerated at the time of the Mendes slaying, he resolved upon his release from prison, in July of 1996, to kill the potential witnesses against his brother. That resolve extended to many of his old Wendover Street associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1997, Augusto Lopes began associating with Manny Monteiro, who introduced him to a group of individuals whose base of operations was Stonehurst Street in Dorchester. Lopes's new friends were part of a street gang that controlled Stonehurst Street. He soon learned that Stonehurst members \"had problems\" with their Wendover counterparts. Although the source was never clearly established, the antagonism was real: during the period from 1998 to 2000, a wave of violence transpired in which Stonehurst members repeatedly shot at Wendover members and Wendover members retaliated in kind. Augusto Lopes was integrally involved in this cacophony of ongoing mayhem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 2004, a federal grand jury returned a thirty-three count superseding indictment naming thirteen defendants. Three of these defendants are appellants here. With respect to them, the flagship charge was that they had violated RICO through their membership in a racketeering enterprise: Stonehurst. The indictment alleged that Stonehurst's primary purpose was \"to shoot and kill members, associates, and perceived supporters of a rival gang in Boston known as Wendover.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> To buttress this allegation, the indictment enumerated nearly two dozen instances of murder and assault with intent to kill purportedly committed by Stonehurst members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seven individuals, including all three appellants, were tried together on assorted charges stemming from their involvement with Stonehurst. Augusto Lopes became a government witness and testified against his former Stonehurst allies, as did two other cooperating witnesses (Marcelino Rodrigues and Jason Burgo). The government also adduced testimony from a number of other eye-witnesses about various shootings. Police testimony, ballistics evidence, and the like completed the prosecution's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a twenty-six day trial, four defendants were acquitted. The three appellants did not fare as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors convicted one appellant, Jackson Nascimento, of racketeering, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), racketeering conspiracy, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1962(d), conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering in violation of the Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering statute (VICAR), <i>id.</i> &#167; 1959(a)(5), a VICAR assault charge, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1959(a)(3), and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, <i>id.</i> &#167; 924(c). The racketeering conviction was supported by special findings to the effect that Nascimento had (i) shot Zilla DoCanto and (ii) conspired to murder members of Wendover. The jury rejected the government's contention that Nascimento had perpetrated a second shooting and acquitted him of a second count of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors convicted a second appellant, Lance Talbert, on a RICO conspiracy count, a substantive RICO count, and a count charging VICAR murder conspiracy. The jury found specially that Talbert had shot Wendover member Adiello DaRosa and had conspired to murder members of Wendover. The government also had charged Talbert with having engaged in another shooting but dropped those charges at the close of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors convicted the third appellant, Kamal Lattimore, on both a RICO conspiracy count and a substantive RICO count. However, the district court immediately granted a judgment of acquittal as to the latter count. The jury acquitted Lattimore of a firearms charge and of charges of VICAR assault and VICAR conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the verdict, the appellants moved for judgments of acquittal or, in the alternative, new trials. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, 33. The district court denied these motions in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 2005, the district court sentenced Nascimento to a 171-month incarcerative term, Talbert to a 57-month incarcerative term, and Lattimore to a 46-month incarcerative term. These timely appeals ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five elements must coalesce to make out a substantive RICO violation. The government must show: \"(1) an enterprise existed; (2) the enterprise participated in or its activities affected interstate commerce; (3) the defendant was employed by or was associated with the enterprise; (4) the defendant conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise; (5) through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" <i>United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 33 (1st Cir.2002). The appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on the first, second, and fifth elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VICAR, as well as RICO, is in play here. VICAR requires that a defendant have committed a crime of violence in return for something of pecuniary value from, or in order to advance or maintain his position within, an enterprise affecting interstate commerce that is engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959. Thus, a successful sufficiency challenge to the RICO convictions also will serve to undermine the VICAR convictions. Similarly, inasmuch as Nascimento's conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924 was predicated on his having committed a VICAR assault on Zilla DoCanto, that conviction will be nullified if the VICAR charge is found to be unsupportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellants' arguments come in a kaleidoscopic array of shapes and sizes (including frontal attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence, questions about statutory construction, constitutional challenges, and complaints about jury instructions), we organize our discussion thematically, element by element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first element of a RICO offense requires proof of the existence of an enterprise. The enterprise need not be a legitimate business or a form of organization sanctioned by state law. <i>United States v. Turkette,</i> 452 U.S. 576, 587, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). It \"need only be a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a criminal course of conduct.\" <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d 16, 28 (1st Cir.2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the absence of any requirement of formal sanction, the government nonetheless must prove that the enterprise existed in some coherent and cohesive form. <i>Turkette,</i> 452 U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524. It follows that the enterprise must have been an \"ongoing organization\" operating as a \"continuous unit.\" <i>Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity that constitutes the fifth, and final, element of a RICO offense. <i>See Turkette,</i> 452 U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524. An enterprise is chiefly distinguished from the pattern of racketeering activity by the fact that it possesses some goal or purpose more pervasive and more enduring than the instant gratification that can accrue from the successful completion of each particular criminal act. <i>See Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellants argue that the government failed to present sufficient evidence of the existence of an enterprise or, alternatively, that the district court's jury instructions obscured the difference between RICO's \"enterprise\" and \"pattern\" elements. In a related vein, they argue that the government failed to prove that the enterprise was of sufficient duration vis-&#224;-vis the time frame that was set forth in the indictment. We address these arguments sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>1.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first ponder the sufficiency of the government's evidence concerning the existence of the enterprise. With respect to this issue, we review the record de novo to determine whether, taking the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the government's theory of the case, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the government had established the disputed element of the offense. <i>See United States v. Cruz-Arroyo,</i> 461 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In attacking the sufficiency of the government's evidence anent the existence of an enterprise, the appellants point to testimony from various cooperating witnesses who described Stonehurst as a loose aggregation of friends that lacked colors, initiation rites, and a formal hierarchy. For example, Augusto Lopes testified that Stonehurst was \"just a group\" whose members \"were all friends with each other, certain individuals acted out, and some individuals didn't do nothing at all.\" Similarly, Burgo said at one point that Stonehurst was \"just a name.\" The appellants suggest that this testimony distinguishes this case from <i>United States v. Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d 11 (1st Cir.2001), a case in which we upheld the application of RICO to a street gang that \"had colors and signs, . . . had older members who instructed younger ones, its members referred to the gang as family, and it had `sessions' where important decisions were made.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the factors mentioned in <i>Patrick</i> are relevant to the question of whether a street gang constitutes an enterprise &#8212; but their presence or absence is not dispositive of the issue. Here, the government provided other testimony that could have prompted a jury reasonably to conclude that Stonehurst was an enterprise. After all, Stonehurst members used a shared cache of firearms that were regarded as property of the gang. The weapons were handed around and used by several different Stonehurst members to shoot Wendover sympathizers. One erstwhile Stonehurst member, Rodrigues, testified that he had traveled to purchase weapons for \"the group\" and clarified that by \"the group\" he meant \"Stonehurst.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to testimony about Stonehurst's arsenal, the record contains testimony suggesting that Stonehurst members self-identified as belonging to an organization. Cooperating witnesses were able to identify precisely a wide variety of individuals as being associated with Stonehurst. The witnesses also displayed an ability to distinguish between members and friends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, Stonehurst members kept tabs on one another and informed one another when things would be \"hot\" because of a recent shooting. They acted on behalf of one another by attempting to assassinate witnesses to each other's crimes. And, finally, members trained other members in the use of night vision goggles, binoculars, and police evasion tactics to enable them more efficiently to carry out their shared purpose of killing Wendover members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude, as did the district court, that even though Stonehurst lacked some of the accouterments of more structured street gangs, a rational jury could find that it had a sufficiently well-defined shape to constitute an enterprise in the requisite sense. Stonehurst exhibited group cohesion over time; its membership pooled and shared resources; the individuals involved had a sense of belonging and self-identified as Stonehurst members; and the group had a well-honed set of goals. We think that this is enough, if barely, to constitute a RICO enterprise. <i>See Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>2.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Talbert makes a related contention: that even if the evidence suffices to support a finding that Stonehurst was an enterprise, the district court's jury instructions were confusing. He directs his umbrage at the court's instruction that a RICO enterprise need not have an \"ascertainable structure.\" As Talbert acknowledges, this instruction has been approved as good law in this circuit. <i>See Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some challenges to jury instructions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Perez,</i> 299 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2002). Others, however, assign error in, say, the nature of the elements of an offense. That type of claim engenders de novo review. <i>See, e.g., Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 28; <i>see also United States v. Figueroa-Encarnac&#237;on,</i> 343 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.2003) (noting the standard-of-review distinction). Because Talbert's challenge is rooted not in an abstract principle of law but in the trial court's choice of language, with a view to minimizing potential juror confusion, the abuse of discretion standard governs our review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the challenged instruction tracks an explicit holding of this court, Talbert starts at a considerable disadvantage. He insists, however, that where, as here, there is only \"minimal\" evidence of the existence of an enterprise, the trial court should avoid the topic of ascertainable structure altogether. In a close case, his thesis runs, such an instruction, though technically correct, promotes juror confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is untenable. When an instruction is pertinent to the issues submitted to the jury and constitutes an accurate statement of the law, it is hard to imagine any basis for a claim of error. <i>See United States v. Keene,</i> 341 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir.2003). Here, moreover, the district court took great pains to emphasize that \"[a]n enterprise is not merely a related assortment of criminal activities.\" Rather, the court said, \"there must be some goal &#8212; a purpose of engaging in a course of conduct &#8212; beyond this isolated benefit that can come from the commission of each criminal act.\" The court also made clear that \"[t]he enterprise element [of the offense] is different from the racketeering activity element.\" These instructions were pellucid as to the distinctions between the \"enterprise\" and \"pattern\" elements of the offense. We see no realistic possibility that they were a source of juror confusion. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in charging the jury as it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>3.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants lodge a final objection to the finding that Stonehurst constituted an enterprise. This objection centers on the longevity of the enterprise. It is not a claim that Stonehurst's existence was too ephemeral to satisfy the minimum duration required by the RICO statute, <i>see H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co.,</i> 492 U.S. 229, 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) (discussing the continuity requirement applicable to RICO enterprises), but rather a claim that the duration of Stonehurst's existence, as proven, fell short of the period suggested in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument proceeds as follows. First, the appellants note that the indictment specified that the named defendants \"[f]rom a time unknown, but at least by July 1996, until the date of the Indictment\" &#8212; September 30, 2004 &#8212; \"did unlawfully and knowingly conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the [e]nterprise, through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" They then point out that the district court told the jury, without objection, that in order to establish the enterprise element, the government had to prove that \"the enterprise [had] continue[d] in essentially unchanged form <i>during substantially the entire period alleged in the indictment</i>\" (emphasis supplied). Next, the appellants remind us that \"when a cause is submitted to the jury under an instruction, not patently incorrect or internally inconsistent, to which no timely objection has been lodged, the instruction becomes the law of the case.\" <i>United States v. Gomes,</i> 969 F.2d 1290, 1294 (1st Cir.1992). The question then becomes &#8212; or so the appellants say &#8212; whether the government provided \"evidence sufficient to establish the elements required by the actual instructions given.\" <i>United States v. Zanghi,</i> 189 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir.1999). The appellants conclude that this question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this construct. It found that Rodrigues's testimony supported a finding that the enterprise existed from at least 1997 until at least 2001. It further found that the evidence indicating that the Wendover/Stonehurst feud had its origins in the Mendes killing was enough to support the conclusion that Stonehurst was active as far back as 1995. While it acknowledged that there was no evidence of Stonehurst's existence from 2002 through 2004, the court found such evidence unnecessary because substantially all the relevant activity of the enterprise took place during the 1996-2001 time frame. The court added that, in any event, the exact duration of the enterprise was not an essential element of the offense. In its view, the government demonstrated the required continuity, and no more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court concluded by analyzing what had happened as a type of variance. A variance occurs when \"the proof at trial depicts a scenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Escobar-de Jes&#250;s,</i> 187 F.3d 148, 172 (1st Cir.1999). The existence of a variance does not automatically result in the vacation of a conviction. A variance only requires the setting aside of a conviction if it is prejudicial. <i>See United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2003). Discerning no prejudice from this particular variance, the district court denied the appellants' motions for either judgment of acquittal or a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants attack the district court's ruling on several levels. Their first attack is fact-oriented: they concede that Rodrigues testified that he was a Stonehurst member from 1997 through 2001, but they assert that he only described activities occurring during 1998 and 2000. This is too isthmian a view of Rodrigues's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodrigues testified that the shootings between Wendover and Stonehurst \"started . . . back in '95\" and were \"still ongoing.\" At the very least, this testimony supports the district court's conclusion that Stonehurst, as an entity dedicated to wreaking havoc on Wendover, existed through the end of Rodrigues's tenure (2001). The question, then, is whether the jury verdict can be supported by testimony concerning that somewhat truncated time span.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, citing the Second Circuit's decision in <i>United States v. Morales,</i> 185 F.3d 74 (2d Cir.1999), insist that it cannot. In <i>Morales,</i> the indictment alleged that the defendants had belonged to a continuous enterprise that existed for a nine-year period. <i>Id.</i> at 78. The proof, however, showed conclusively that the enterprise had been dormant for seven years in the middle of that period because its entire membership had been incarcerated. <i>Id.</i> at 79. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to show that the \"enterprise existed for the duration alleged in the indictment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 81. The court refused to \"consider whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of a shorter racketeering enterprise\" on the ground that the \"indictment charged a single nine-year enterprise, and the jury was instructed that it could only convict on the racketeering and racketeering-dependent counts if it found that the specific enterprise set out in the indictment existed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants asseverate that this case and <i>Morales</i> are peas in a pod. They are not. The concerns underlying the decision in <i>Morales</i> are very different from what is involved here. In <i>Morales,</i> the government attempted to play fast and loose with RICO's continuity requirement &#8212; and it did so in a way that threatened to impair the defendants' rights (by constructing the indictment in a manner that allowed the introduction, in a single trial, of evidence concerning two distinct criminal organizations). Under those circumstances, we readily understand why the <i>Morales</i> court was disinclined to allow the government to argue, after putting before the jury significantly inculpatory evidence from both periods, that either organization, by itself, could have satisfied the continuity requirement. That would, in effect, have given the government a second bite at the cherry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scenario here is vastly different. While the indictment may have marginally overclaimed &#8212; the record contains very little concerning the 2002-2004 period &#8212; there was no question of shifting enterprises and no attempt to stack the deck by introducing damning bits of evidence from a different organization's conduct in a different era. Moreover, the government had adduced ample proof that a single enterprise was continuously active in the slightly narrowed period. Indeed, the trial seems to have proceeded on the premise that this narrowed period was the relevant time frame.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the appellants had every reason to believe that the period from 1996 through 2001 would be the crucial period for purposes of the RICO and other racketeering-dependent counts. Of the twenty-one racketeering acts listed in the indictment, twenty were alleged to have occurred in that time frame (the lone exception &#8212; the general charge that Stonehurst members had conspired to kill Wendover members &#8212; was described as having spanned the period from 1996 until 2004). This not only erases any doubt that the indictment gave the appellants fair notice of the focus of the charges against them, but also confirms that the government did not benefit in any way from describing a slightly longer period in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we do not think that the government can be said to have assumed the burden of proving the operation of Stonehurst from 1996 to 2004 merely by mentioning those dates in the indictment. The period represented a mere factual allegation; it did not constitute an element of the offense. That is a significant difference. <i>See United States v. Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2006) (describing the difference between a deviation from the charging terms and a deviation from facts alleged in an indictment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, we see no merit in the appellants' \"law of the case\" argument. The district court charged the jury in relevant part that the government had the burden of proving that the enterprise operated continuously \"during substantially the entire period alleged in the indictment.\" \"Substantially\" is a relative term, which invites a weighing of the salience of covered items against the salience of non-covered items. <i>Cf. United States v. Castaneda,</i> 162 F.3d 832 838 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that a party has \"substantially performed\" when his \"relatively insignificant omissions\" are \"dwarfed by [his] performance\"). Bearing in mind that virtually all the overt acts that comprised the substance of the indictment were completed prior to 2002, we think that a rational jury could conclude that the period form 1996 through 2001 was \"substantially\" the entire period covered by the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second element of a RICO violation is an effect on interstate or foreign commerce. Foreign commerce is not implicated here, and the district court instructed the jury that the interstate commerce requirement would be satisfied by a showing that Stonehurst's actions had at least a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. This instruction would have been unarguably correct in most RICO cases. <i>See, e.g., Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 35; <i>United States v. Riddle,</i> 249 F.3d 529, 537 (6th Cir.2001). Seizing on the fact that Stonehurst did not engage in any economic activity, <i>see supra</i> note 1, the appellants argue that this case is different. In their view, the instruction misstates RICO's statutory requirement with respect to enterprises that have not engaged in economic activity. They argue, in the alternative, that if the instruction is correct as a matter of statutory interpretation, the statute is unconstitutional as applied to their enterprise. As a fallback, they assert that, even if the instruction can withstand these attacks, the evidence was insufficient to satisfy even the modest de minimis standard. We consider each facet of this asseverational array.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>1.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the appellants' contention that, on the facts of this case, the RICO statute requires more than a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. This is an uphill battle; this court has held, squarely and explicitly, that a de minimis effect on interstate commerce is all that is required to satisfy RICO's commerce element. <i>See Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants attempt to skirt this obstacle by suggesting that a more rigorous standard pertains in cases, like this one, in which a RICO enterprise has not engaged in economic activity. To distinguish <i>Marino,</i> they point out that the enterprise in question there was found to be involved in drug trafficking &#8212; plainly a form of economic activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is peculiar. Although nothing in the text of RICO suggests it, the appellants urge us to read a single phrase in the statute as requiring different things in different situations: in a case involving an enterprise engaged in economic activity, the government would have to show only a de minimis effect on interstate commerce, whereas in a case involving an enterprise engaged in violence but not in economic activity, the government would have to show a more substantial effect on interstate commerce. We reject this iridescent reading of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the RICO statute applies to any \"enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c). There is nothing in either the statutory language or the legislative history that supports the appellants' contention that these words mean different things as applied to different types of enterprises. Courts are not charged with the task of writing statutes or improving upon them but, rather, with the more mundane task of figuring out, consistent with the statutory text, what the authoring Congress intended. This division of functions, as well as basic principles of statutory construction, counsels persuasively against a court trying to tease from the simple word \"affect\" sophisticated gradations of meaning that will vary from situation to situation. <i>See Ratzlaf v. United States,</i> 510 U.S. 135, 143, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994) (\"Ascribing various meanings to a single iteration of [a word] . . . would open Pandora's jar.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants try to clear this hurdle by using the Sixth Circuit's decision in <i>Waucaush</i> as a springboard. That court adopted the position that the appellants espouse, holding that the RICO statute reaches an enterprise engaged in noneconomic violent crime only if the enterprise's activities have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. 380 F.3d at 255-56. The appellants invite us to follow <i>Waucaush.</i> We respectfully decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this result, the <i>Waucaush</i> court did not employ any of the usual tools of statutory construction. The absence of anything in the reasoning of that court that explains how it is possible, consistent with sound canons of statutory construction, to read the word \"affect\" as possessing two different meanings depending upon additional facts not mentioned in the statute itself, makes the decision suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of relying upon principles of statutory construction, the <i>Waucaush</i> court based its holding on a professed desire to \"avoid interpreting a statute to prohibit conduct which Congress may not constitutionally regulate.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Echoing this refrain, the appellants argue, in effect, that application of the RICO statute to their activities raises grave constitutional concerns and, for that reason, we should abstain from reading the statute as encompassing noneconomic activities that have only a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. To hammer home this point, they remind us that the Supreme Court recently deployed the constitutional avoidance doctrine in construing a federal arson statute to avoid commerce power concerns. <i>See Jones v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 848, 857-58, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000) (construing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument reflects a misunderstanding of the operation of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. Since <i>Jones</i> and <i>Waucaush</i> were decided, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the doctrine does not serve to give alternative meanings to statutory phrases in cases in which a statute's application might be constitutionally dubious. Courts simply are not \"free to `interpret' statutes as becoming inoperative when they `approach constitutional limits.'\" <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 384, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005). Rather, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance operates at \"the lowest common denominator,\" providing a single definition for a phrase that is then applied even in cases in which a broader reading would not be constitutionally dubious. <i>Id.</i> at 380, 125 S.Ct. 716.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter: because, in <i>Marino,</i> we already have defined the word \"affecting\" as used in the RICO statute, we are not now free to alter the meaning of that term for a particular fact pattern. Nor is the option of limiting the definition of the term \"enterprise\" to profit-seeking entities open to us. <i>See Nat'l Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler,</i> 510 U.S. 249, 262, 114 S.Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed.2d 99 (1994). Given the case law, there is simply no room remaining for efforts at constitutional avoidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Jones</i> is not to the contrary. In that case, the Court focused upon a particular phrase in the federal arson statute: \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). The Court determined that the word \"used\" denotes \"active employment.\" <i>Jones,</i> 529 U.S. at 855, 120 S.Ct. 1904. Utilizing that definition, it concluded that the statute did not cover the burning of owner-occupied residential real estate. <i>See id.</i> at 859, 120 S.Ct. 1904. The Court did not give the statutory language a case-specific meaning but, rather, provided a single definition applicable in all cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The appellants ask us to do something very different here: to give two divergent meanings to a single word in a single statute and to pick and choose between those definitions depending on the facts of future cases. We are not willing to undertake so exotic a mission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final sortie, the appellants argue that the district court erred in refusing to limit the definition of conduct that \"affect[s]\" commerce to conduct detrimental to commerce. This argument is gleaned from the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Scheidler,</i> 510 U.S. at 262, 114 S.Ct. 798, that RICO could be applied to an enterprise that engaged in racketeering activity notwithstanding the absence of an economic motive. The <i>Scheidler</i> Court reasoned that \"[a]n enterprise can surely have a detrimental influence on interstate or foreign commerce without having its own profit-seeking motives.\" <i>Id.</i> at 258, 114 S.Ct. 798. The appellants read this language as implying that <i>only</i> detrimental effects on commerce are within the contemplation of the RICO statute when applied to enterprises that are not economically motivated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although one district court has read <i>Scheidler</i> in this restrictive manner, <i>see United States v. Garcia,</i> 143 F.Supp.2d 791, 815 (E.D.Mich.2000), we are not persuaded. The fact that the <i>Scheidler</i> Court discussed only detrimental effects is something of a makeweight; that analysis corresponded to the facts of the particular case. Nothing in the opinion suggests that the Court's casual reference to \"detrimental influence\" was intended to limit the \"affecting commerce\" language of the RICO statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right of the federal government to use the power conferred by the Commerce Clause for regulatory objectives, apart from the direct promotion and protection of interstate commerce, has been ingrained in our jurisprudence for over a century. <i>See, e.g., Champion v. Ames (The Lottery Case),</i> 188 U.S. 321, 362, 23 S.Ct. 321, 47 L.Ed. 492 (1903). Because the word \"affect\" has an established meaning in statutes defining the scope of federal jurisdiction as bespeaking an intention to legislate to the outermost perimeter of Congress's Commerce Clause power, <i>see Jones,</i> 529 U.S. at 854, 120 S.Ct. 1904, statutes regulating undescribed activities that \"affect\" interstate commerce perforce must reach all activities that come within Congress's power. This paradigm includes ensuring that the tools of commerce are not employed in a manner injurious to the public. <i>Hodel v. Va. Surface Min. &amp; Reclam. Ass'n, Inc.,</i> 452 U.S. 264, 281-82, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we cannot say that the word \"affect,\" as used in the RICO statute, is restricted to conduct that produces detrimental effects on commerce. This is especially true where, as here, we are asked to apply the definition in a subset of RICO cases (i.e., cases involving enterprises engaged exclusively in noneconomic activities), thereby creating an anomalous situation in which a single word in a single statute simultaneously would have varying meanings, depending on context. We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in refusing to deviate from the accepted meaning of the phrase \"affect[ing] . . . commerce.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>2.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We move now to the appellants' most touted claim of error: that the RICO statute, as applied to an enterprise engaged exclusively in noneconomic criminal activity, is unconstitutional. In framing this claim, the appellants place great weight on a trilogy of recent Supreme Court cases establishing limits on the federal government's power to legislate under the Commerce Clause. <i>See United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 627, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000); <i>Jones,</i> 529 U.S. at 859, 120 S.Ct. 1904; <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 567, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). These cases, in combination, galvanized the Sixth Circuit in <i>Waucaush,</i> so the opinions deserve careful attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first of these cases, the Court struck down a federal statute that, without reference to any effect on commerce, criminalized the possession of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 551, 115 S.Ct. 1624. In concluding that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to enact the school-zone legislation, the Court explained that the commerce power may only be used to justify three different kinds of laws: those regulating the channels of interstate commerce, those regulating the instrumentalities of and things moving in interstate commerce, and those regulating activities substantially affecting interstate commerce. <i>See id.</i> at 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624. Because it is this third category of regulatory authority that is in issue here, we elaborate briefly on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to this third category, the Court noted that individual instances of regulated conduct need not be substantial as long as the aggregate conduct exerts a substantial effect on interstate or foreign commerce. <i>See id.</i> The Court warned, however, that aggregation is appropriate only as to \"economic\" activities. <i>Id.</i> at 560, 115 S.Ct. 1624. The Court has since defined \"economic,\" in the relevant sense, as relating to the \"production, distribution, or consumption of commodities.\" <i>Gonzales v. Raich,</i> 545 U.S. 1, 25, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 720 (1966)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second case in the trilogy built upon this foundation. There, the Court struck down the Violence Against Women Act, which had sought to provide federal civil remedies to victims of gender-motivated violence. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 602, 120 S.Ct. 1740. Notwithstanding a congressional finding that gender-motivated violence exerts a substantial drain on the economy, the <i>Morrison</i> Court \"reject[ed] the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 617, 120 S.Ct. 1740. The Court explained that \"the suppression of violent crime and the vindication of its victims\" was quintessentially within the police power of the several states (and, by implication, not within the federal commerce power per se). <i>Id.</i> at 618, 120 S.Ct. 1740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining case in the trilogy is <i>Jones.</i> As previously discussed, <i>see supra</i> Part II(B)(1), the <i>Jones</i> Court held that the incineration of private residences was beyond the reach of a federal arson statute. 529 U.S. at 859, 120 S.Ct. 1904. That narrow interpretation enabled the Court to avoid \"grave and doubtful constitutional questions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 857, 120 S.Ct. 1904.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing on these precedents, the appellants maintain that their criminal activities are an almost exact match for the violent criminal conduct that the <i>Morrison</i> Court refused to aggregate (and, thus, placed beyond the reach of Congress's Commerce Clause power). They add, moreover, that federal regulation of noneconomic street crime under a theory of aggregation would obliterate any semblance of a constitutional limit on federal power. <i>Cf. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 567, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (commenting that the Constitution's enumeration of federal powers \"presupposes something not enumerated\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We share the appellants' concern that the government's theory here, aggressively pursued, might threaten to trespass on an area of traditional state concern. But though the argument has some bite, it ultimately fails to persuade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal problem with the argument is that it runs at cross purposes with the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Raich</i> (the Court's most recent explication of the scope of federal power under the Commerce Clause). The <i>Raich</i> decision is critically important for present purposes because it is more directly on point than any case in the earlier trilogy. <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> involved facial challenges to federal statutes: in each case, the parties asserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress's commerce power in its entirety. <i>Jones</i> was an exercise in statutory construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand, however, entails an as-applied challenge to a generally valid federal statute. <i>Raich</i> is of the same genre; it involved a request \"to excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.\" <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S. at 23, 125 S.Ct. 2195. The <i>Raich</i> Court deemed this distinction \"pivotal\" because when \"the class of activities is regulated and the class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). <i>Raich</i> supplies a gloss on the earlier trilogy and, in the bargain, offers meaningful guidance as to how courts should approach as-applied challenges under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Raich,</i> the Supreme Court upheld two provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 844(a), as applied to the intrastate and noncommercial cultivation of medical marijuana. <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S. at 9, 125 S.Ct. 2195. There, the plaintiffs sought to define their activity at a level of specificity designed to highlight its noneconomic nature. The Court rejected this effort at miniaturization, preferring instead to defer to Congress's declaration of the level of specificity with which an activity should be classified for the purpose of determining whether that activity, in the aggregate, affects interstate commerce. <i>See id.</i> at 30, 125 S.Ct. 2195. The Court refused to credit either the Ninth Circuit's effort to isolate a separate and distinct class of activity, <i>id.</i> at 26, 125 S.Ct. 2195, or the state legislature's effort to \"surgically excise[]\" medical marijuana from the generality of the drug laws, <i>id.</i> at 30, 125 S.Ct. 2195. The Court chose instead to defer to Congress's decision not to distinguish between medical marijuana cultivated for noncommercial purposes and the mine-run of marijuana cultivation. <i>Id.</i> at 22, 125 S.Ct. 2195. Because there was no basis on which \"to excise individual components of that larger scheme,\" the Court concluded that marijuana cultivation writ large was the appropriate activity to be considered in the Commerce Clause calculus. <i>Id.</i> at 28, 125 S.Ct. 2195. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' as-applied challenge failed. <i>See id.</i> at 32-33, 125 S.Ct. 2195.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, <i>Raich</i> is arguably distinguishable from the case at hand on the ground that marijuana is a fungible commodity, capable of seeping into the interstate market regardless of the purpose for which it is grown. But we refuse to accord decretory significance to a distinction that the <i>Raich</i> majority did not deem decisive. The majority emphasized that it is the \"class of activity\" that is relevant. <i>Id.</i> at 17, 125 S.Ct. 2195. Such classes need not be delineated with \"scientific exactitude.\" <i>Id.</i> This formulation is markedly different from the one offered by Justice Scalia, who argued unsuccessfully that Congress may regulate noneconomic intrastate activities \"only where the failure to do so could . . . undercut its regulation of interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 39, 125 S.Ct. 2195 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (alteration in original). While Justice Scalia attributes this view to the majority, <i>see id.,</i> we read the majority opinion &#8212; especially its disclaimer of \"scientific exactitude\" &#8212; as declining to require so rigid a taxonomy. <i>See id.</i> at 26-27, 125 S.Ct. 2195 (opinion of the Court) (requiring only that Congress act \"rationally\" when making a \"policy judgment\" that purely intrastate activities are an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme). We think that Justice Scalia's election not to join the Court's opinion bears witness to the majority's unwillingness to take a more extreme view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refined to bare essence, <i>Raich</i> teaches that when Congress is addressing a problem that is legitimately within its purview, an inquiring court should be slow to interfere. Assuming the existence of a rational basis for the solution that Congress has devised, the court should respect the level of generality at which Congress chose to act. <i>See id.</i> at 22, 125 S.Ct. 2195. It is simply too \"impractical\" for a court to insist that Congress make \"detailed findings proving that each activity regulated within a comprehensive statute is essential to the statutory scheme.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21 n. 32, 125 S.Ct. 2195.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the lessons of <i>Raich,</i> it is evident that the appellants' constitutional argument &#8212; like that of the <i>Waucaush</i> court &#8212; misapprehends the relevant unit of analysis. The linchpin of their argument is the fact that Stonehurst's activities were undertaken without an economic motive. In the long run, however, that isolated fact is of little significance. The correct mode of analysis requires a more global view. \"Congress's power to criminalize . . . conduct pursuant to the Commerce Clause turns on the economic nature of the <i>class of conduct</i> defined in the statute rather than the economic facts . . . of a single case.\" <i>United States v. Morales-de Jes&#250;s,</i> 372 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir.2004) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the class of activity is the relevant unit of analysis and, within wide limits, it is Congress &#8212; not the courts &#8212; that decides how to define a class of activity. All that is necessary to deflect a Commerce Clause challenge to a general regulatory statute is a showing that the statute itself deals rationally with a class of activity that has a substantial relationship to interstate or foreign commerce. <i>See Maryland v. Wirtz,</i> 392 U.S. 183, 196 n. 27, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968). The intrastate or noneconomic character of individual instances within that class is of no consequence. <i>See id.</i> This core principle is fully applicable to criminal statutes. <i>See Perez v. United States,</i> 402 U.S. 146, 154, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971) (cited with approval in <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. 1624).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' argument cannot withstand scrutiny under this framework. The RICO statute by its terms is limited to racketeering enterprises that \"affect . . . commerce,\" and the VICAR statute is similarly circumscribed. This jurisdictional element ties the statutes directly to commerce in a more explicit way than the statutes at issue in <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624, or <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 611, 120 S.Ct. 1740, or, since neither section 841(a)(1) nor 844(a) has a nexus requirement, even <i>Raich. See United States v. Crenshaw,</i> 359 F.3d 977, 986-87 (8th Cir.2004) (drawing this distinction with respect to VICAR).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, the general class of activity is a wholly legitimate target of Commerce Clause legislation. Racketeering activity, as a general matter, is based largely on greed. <i>Cf.</i> 1 Timothy 6:10 (\"[T]he love of money is the root of all evil.\"). Particular manifestations include loansharking, extortion, and a host of other financially driven crimes. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(1) (defining \"racketeering activity\"). Therefore, that class of activity is sufficiently economic in nature that it may be aggregated for Commerce Clause purposes. <i>See Perez,</i> 402 U.S. at 154, 91 S.Ct. 1357 (upholding aggregation of extortionate credit transactions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the obvious ties between organized violence and racketeering activity &#8212; the former is a frequent concomitant of the latter &#8212; we defer to Congress's rational judgment, as part of its effort to crack down on racketeering enterprises, to enact a statute that targeted organized violence. <i>See Raich,</i> 545 U.S. at 22, 125 S.Ct. 2195 (describing as a \"modest\" task judicial scrutiny of whether Congress had a rational basis for encompassing particular activity within the sweep of a statute); <i>Crenshaw,</i> 359 F.3d at 986 (upholding VICAR against a Commerce Clause challenge and discussing the legitimacy of targeting violence in aid of racketeering as a means of controlling racketeering enterprises). Thus, applying the RICO statute to the appellants' activities does not offend the Commerce Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>3.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next examine the appellants' contention that the government failed to adduce evidence sufficient to show even a de minimis connection between Stonehurst's activities and interstate commerce. Because Stonehurst has not been engaged in racketeering activity of an economic nature, we employ heightened scrutiny throughout this examination. <i>See United States v. McCormack,</i> 371 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.2004) (discussed <i>supra</i> note 3), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 543 U.S. 1098, 125 S.Ct. 992, 160 L.Ed.2d 998 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence most loudly bruited by the government relates to the fact that one of the shootings perpetrated by Stonehurst occurred in a round-the-clock tire shop engaged in interstate commerce. The shooting took place after midnight and the ensuing investigation caused the shop to close for several hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government first posits that the temporary closing of a business engaged in interstate commerce had an effect on commerce sufficient to satisfy the de minimis standard. In support of this proposition, it cites cases such as <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 527 (1st Cir.2005), <i>United States v. Juvenile Male,</i> 118 F.3d 1344, 1349 (9th Cir.1997), and <i>United States v. Davis,</i> 30 F.3d 613, 615 (5th Cir.1994). But the suggested comparison is not apt: in those cases, the closed business was itself the target of a planned robbery. In contrast, the Stonehurst members had no designs on the tire shop per se; they merely held a grudge against one of the shop's customers and happened to find it convenient to ambush him there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To add another distinguishing dimension, the closings in the cited cases were for longer intervals and, thus, caused considerably more disruption of the business. <i>See, e.g., Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 527 (describing a full-day closure); <i>Juvenile Male,</i> 118 F.3d at 1349 (describing a closure lasting \"several days\"); <i>Davis,</i> 30 F.3d at 615 (describing the temporary shutdown of four gas stations). In contrast, the tire shop here was closed, in the dead of night, for a matter of hours. Moreover, the proprietor testified that he \"suspected\" that some business had been lost because there was less \"paperwork\" than usual but he could not definitively identify any such shortfall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also posits that Stonehurst members' regular use of cellular telephones as a means of coordinating their activities comprised the requisite nexus to commerce. But again, the cases that it cites are of scant assistance. In each of them, the court mentioned telephone use only after it had enumerated a series of more binding links to commerce. <i>See United States v. Delgado,</i> 401 F.3d 290, 297 (5th Cir.2005) (chronicling involvement in international drug trafficking, use of the mails, and use of Western Union); <i>United States v. Pipkins,</i> 378 F.3d 1281, 1294-95 (11th Cir.2004) (describing trafficking of women and recruitment of prostitutes across state lines), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 544 U.S. 902, 125 S.Ct. 1617, 161 L.Ed.2d 275 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, one court has ruled that \"telephone use by the [enterprise] sufficiently affects interstate commerce to satisfy the RICO nexus requirement,\" <i>United States v. Muskovsky,</i> 863 F.2d 1319, 1325 (7th Cir.1988), but the enterprise at issue there was engaged in economic activity. We are more dubious here both because the enterprise was devoted to noneconomic activities and because the government's evidence concerning cell-phone use was skimpy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's best evidence on this point consisted of testimony to the effect that gang members communicated with each other by cell phone in order to keep abreast of important information, such as when things had become \"hot\" following a shooting. In addition, at least two shootings attributable to Stonehurst (those directed at Wendover members Luis Carvalho and Antonio Cabral) were precipitated by cell-phone calls to or between Stonehurst members identifying where the intended victim might be found. There was, however, some countervailing evidence. For example, the government's star witness, Augusto Lopes, stated that Stonehurst did \"[n]ot necessarily\" use cell phones to discuss acts of violence because \"they can be bugged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we need not resolve whether either the tire shop or cell-phone evidence, alone or in tandem, suffices to make out the requisite de minimis connection between the enterprise and interstate commerce. As we explain below, there is surer footing in this case for a finding that the government satisfied the \"affecting commerce\" element of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects that Stonehurst maintained an arsenal &#8212; no fewer than nine different firearms used by Stonehurst members in carrying out Stonehurst business. This and other evidence led the district court to conclude that Stonehurst was a \"massive purchaser of guns.\" With one exception (a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver made in Massachusetts), all the firearms acquired by Stonehurst had been manufactured outside of Massachusetts and, thus, had moved in interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants try to blunt the force of this evidence by citation to <i>United States v. Kallestad,</i> 236 F.3d 225 (5th Cir.2000), in which the Fifth Circuit stated \"[i]t is one thing for Congress to prohibit possession of a weapon that has itself moved in interstate commerce, but it is quite another thing for Congress to prohibit homicides using such weapons.\" <i>Id.</i> at 229. Were the wielding of out-of-state guns, simpliciter, the only hook on which the \"affecting commerce\" element could be hung, the Fifth Circuit's caveat might give us pause. Here, however, the \"gun\" evidence is strengthened measurably by testimony that, during the currency of the RICO conspiracy, Lattimore traveled from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, purchased a firearm, and brought it back to Massachusetts. That weapon became part of Stonehurst's arsenal and was later fired by a Stonehurst member at a car in which Wendover members were thought to be riding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that a Stonehurst member actually crossed state lines to purchase a weapon for use in carrying out the enterprise's activities is entitled to great weight in the decisional calculus; crossing state lines for purpose of engaging in a commercial transaction is a paradigmatic example of an activity that falls within the compass of the commerce power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Cf. United States v. Clark,</i> 435 F.3d 1100, 1114 (9th Cir.2006) (noting that \"requiring travel in foreign commerce, coupled with engagement in a commercial transaction while abroad, implicates foreign commerce to a constitutionally adequate degree\"). This purchase, coupled with the evidence concerning the amassed arsenal of firearms manufactured out of state, suffices to satisfy RICO's interstate commerce nexus. It follows that the tire shop evidence and the evidence of cell-phone use are, in the circumstances of this case, merely frosting on the cake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final element in the RICO equation requires the government to show that a defendant participated in the conduct of the enterprise \"through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c). A pattern requires a minimum of two racketeering acts. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1961(5). The word \"through\" implies a nexus between these racketeering acts and the enterprise. That nexus exists when a defendant is able to commit the predicate racketeering acts either by means or as a result of his involvement with the enterprise. <i>See Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the jury found that Nascimento had committed two racketeering acts: (i) shooting DoCanto and (ii) conspiring to kill Wendover members. He argues before us that the evidence did not support a finding that a relationship existed between the DoCanto shooting and his membership in Stonehurst. If this argument prevails, it would thwart the government's effort to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, and Nascimento's conviction would topple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nascimento marshals a similar argument concerning his VICAR conviction for assault in aid of racketeering. VICAR forbids, inter alia, committing assault with a dangerous weapon \"for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in\" a racketeering enterprise. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1959(a)(3). Thus, if the evidence was inadequate to support a finding that he shot DoCanto to maintain his position in Stonehurst, then the VICAR conviction cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In approaching these arguments, one fact sticks out like a sore thumb. Despite the perfervid rhetoric in which the arguments are couched, Nascimento does not challenge the sufficiency of the government's proof that he actually shot DoCanto. Our task, therefore, is to undertake de novo review in order to ascertain whether, taking all reasonable inferences in the government's favor, rational jurors could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the necessary relationship existed between Nascimento's shooting of DoCanto and his membership in Stonehurst. <i>See Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects that on the night of November 29, 1998, DoCanto was standing near her car. Her boyfriend, Anildo Rocha, was inside the vehicle. Nascimento opened fire, hitting DoCanto in the left leg. Although there is no evidence that either DoCanto or Rocha were Wendover members, Augusto Lopes testified that Nascimento stated that he had fired the shots with the intention of hitting the man in the car, whom he mistakenly believed to be DoCanto's brother, Joaquim \"Big Rocky\" Martins. In light of this testimony, Nascimento's claim of error boils down to a plaint that the evidence was too thin to warrant a finding that Nascimento understood his intended target &#8212; Big Rocky &#8212; to be affiliated with Wendover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This plaint rests heavily on Lopes's further testimony that \"Big Rocky . . . wasn't associated with nobody.\" Lopes added, however, that Big Rocky \"was actually involved in the problems.\" The jury, of course, was entitled to discount the former statement and to credit the latter. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d 480, 483 (1st Cir.2000) (acknowledging jury's \"prerogative to credit some parts of a witness's testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endeavoring to parry this thrust, Nascimento argues that the allusion to \"the problems\" might be a reference to the fact that Big Rocky was a witness to the Mendes murder committed by Nardo Lopes, not a reference to any involvement with Wendover. That interpretation is propped up by Rodrigues's testimony that he understood Big Rocky to be one of the witnesses against Nardo Lopes. But the government counters, with considerable force, that at a different place in his testimony Augusto Lopes unequivocally named Big Rocky as a Wendover collaborator. The government also notes that the jury heard testimony from an admitted Wendover member, Adiello DaRosa, that Big Rocky was associated with Wendover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sifting through conflicting testimony and determining where the truth lies is the sort of work that falls squarely within the jury's province. So it is here: the question is one of fact, and the answer depends on what evidence the jurors deign to credit. When a jury, which has seen and heard the witnesses, picks and chooses among conflicting accounts, an appellate court should almost always honor that choice. <i>See United States v. Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d 302, 311 (1st Cir.2006) (explaining that it is \"ultimately the province of the jury to assess the significance of any contradictions in the evidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That effectively ends this aspect of the matter. Once the jury had decided which account of Big Rocky's status should be credited, the legal implications of that decision were clear. Consequently, we reject Nascimento's claim of error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nascimento argues in the alternative that, given the contradictions in the testimony, the jury could not rationally have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. He cites <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.1998), for the familiar proposition that when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, supports both a theory of guilt and an equally likely theory of innocence, reasonable jurors must perforce entertain a reasonable doubt. In this case, however, the jury was under no compulsion to deem the contrasting theories of guilt and innocence equally likely. The jury plausibly could have credited the clear and unambiguous statement of DaRosa, himself a Wendover stalwart and presumably a reliable source of information about the gang's composition, that Big Rocky was a Wendover member and was for that reason \"part of the problems.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nascimento advances a further argument to the effect that VICAR requires an even tighter relationship between a predicate racketeering act and an enterprise because the act must be \"for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in an enterprise.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a). This argument is foreclosed by precedent: the VICAR provision is satisfied as long as the criminal act can be said to have been expected of the defendant by reason of his membership in the enterprise. <i>United States v. Tse,</i> 135 F.3d 200, 206 (1st Cir.1998). The totality of the evidence in regard to Nascimento's shooting of DoCanto passes that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be superogatory. We conclude, on whole-record review, that the evidence was sufficient to sustain both an inference that Nascimento fired at DoCanto as part of an effort to eliminate a member of the rival Wendover gang and an inference that this conduct was expected of him by reason of his membership in Stonehurst. Thus, there is an adequate relationship, for both RICO and VICAR purposes, between the challenged racketeering act and the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted both Talbert and Nascimento on a trio of charges: a substantive RICO offense, RICO conspiracy, and VICAR conspiracy to commit murder. In each case, one of the racketeering acts undergirding the substantive RICO charge was conspiracy to commit murder. These two appellants now say that the interplay between the substantive RICO charge and the conspiracy charges offended the Double Jeopardy Clause. For the reasons that follow, we reject their importunings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One branch of the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the government from punishing a person twice for the same offense. <i>See</i> U.S. Const., amend. V. Despite this proscription, the same conduct sometimes can be punished under more than one statute. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Morris,</i> 99 F.3d 476, 477-78 (1st Cir. 1996). Such multiple punishments are permissible if the underlying offenses are distinct from one another, that is, if each offense \"requires proof of a fact that the other does not.\" <i>Blockburger v. United States,</i> 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Talbert and Nascimento argue that because conspiracy to commit murder served as a predicate act for their substantive RICO convictions, the VICAR charge that they conspired to commit murder lacked any element distinct from the substantive RICO charge. Second, and relatedly, each of them argues that his conviction for conspiracy to violate RICO was a lesser included offense within his substantive RICO conviction and, thus, barred under the <i>Blockburger</i> test. <i>See Brown v. Ohio,</i> 432 U.S. 161, 168, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977) (discussing the relationship between lesser included offenses and double jeopardy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments are not persuasive. In <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 39, we held \"that a substantive RICO violation and a RICO conspiracy are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.\" In the same opinion, we rejected the notion that a VICAR violation is a lesser included offense of a substantive RICO violation. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' attempts to distinguish <i>Marino</i> are unavailing. They focus on two facts: (i) that <i>Marino</i> involved a greater number of racketeering acts and (ii) that here, unlike in <i>Marino,</i> the purpose of the enterprise (killing Wendover members) was identical to the object of the charged conspiracy. Neither of those distinctions makes a dispositive difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Blockburger</i> test \"depends on the elements of the crimes and not the similarity of the underlying facts.\" <i>United States v. LeMoure,</i> 474 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir.2007). Thus, in resolving a double jeopardy challenge such as that advanced here, a court should not bog itself down in the minutiae of the evidence underlying the charges but, rather, should confine itself to the statutory elements of the two offenses. Because a \"RICO conspiracy and a RICO violation do not <i>necessarily</i> require the participation of the same people,\" <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 39 (emphasis in the original), it is beside the point whether, in a particular instance, the racketeering acts are few or many, or whether the RICO conspirators and the RICO participants are identical. By the same token, the fact that the purpose of the enterprise and the object of the conspiracy happen to coincide is of no moment. <i>See United States v. Sessa,</i> 125 F.3d 68, 72 (2d Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' fallback position rests on Wharton's Rule, which carves out a modest exception to the general principle that there is no bar to conviction for both a criminal conspiracy and a substantive criminal offense committed within the course of the conspiracy. <i>See United States v. Previte,</i> 648 F.2d 73, 76-77 (1st Cir.1981) (explicating the rule). Wharton's Rule is limited to instances &#8212; adultery is a prime example &#8212; in which, as a statutory matter, the completed offense necessarily involves conspiracy between the participants. <i>See Iannelli v. United States,</i> 420 U.S. 770, 785, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975). We rejected a Wharton's Rule challenge in an earlier RICO case, <i>see Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 39, and because the rule operates at the statutory level, <i>see Iannelli,</i> 420 U.S. at 780, 95 S.Ct. 1284, we likewise reject the appellants' fact-bound attempt to resurrect what amounts to the same argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That brings this chapter to a close. The short of it is that these appeals do not implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>IV.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last leg of our journey requires us to consider Nascimento's assertion that the district court erred in refusing to suppress evidence seized from his room during an arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are as follows. Nascimento was facing state criminal charges arising out of the DoCanto shooting. He failed to report as required and a state magistrate issued a default warrant. On December 7, 1999, the police &#8212; armed with the arrest warrant but no search warrant &#8212; arrived at Nascimento's home. Following a consensual entry, they informed Nascimento (who was clad only in his underwear) that he was to be arrested. Because Nascimento seemed compliant, the officers did not handcuff him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two officers escorted Nascimento through the house to his bedroom so that he could get dressed. Once there, the officers did a quick sweep of the bed for weapons and sat Nascimento on it. One of the officers proceeded to the clothes closet located eight to ten feet from the bed. The officer performed a brief sweep of the closet, noticed an unlocked cabinet on the top shelf, reached in, and discovered a gun frame. At that point, Nascimento was handcuffed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his indictment in this case, Nascimento moved to suppress the gun frame as the fruit of an illegal search. <i>See</i> U.S. Const., amend. IV. The district court denied the motion. Nascimento appeals from this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be difficult to regard the introduction of the gun frame as harmless: it was matched by a government ballistics expert to shell casings found at one of the Stonehurst shootings. The fact that Nascimento had possession of the gun frame also served to corroborate Augusto Lopes, who testified that Nascimento had disassembled a gun following a shooting, handed the barrel to Lopes for disposal, and kept the frame. Given the force of this evidence, we think it best to address Nascimento's claim on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it seems useful to distinguish between searches incident to arrest and protective sweeps. Officers effecting an arrest are entitled to make a search incident to that arrest. <i>Chimel v. California,</i> 395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). The scope of a search incident to an arrest is restricted to the area within the immediate control of the arrestee, that is, \"the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protective sweeps are conceptually distinct from searches incident to arrest. They are not justified by the potential threat posed by the arrestee but, rather, by the potential threat posed by unseen third parties who may be lurking on the premises. <i>See Maryland v. Buie,</i> 494 U.S. 325, 336, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990). Consequently, a protective sweep is limited to a \"cursory visual inspection of those places where a person might be hiding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 327, 110 S.Ct. 1093; <i>see United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 149-51 (1st Cir.2005) (discussing protective sweep doctrine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court cited both <i>Chimel</i> and <i>Buie.</i> We confine our analysis more narrowly: because the cabinet searched was too small to accommodate a person, we concentrate on whether the search passes muster under <i>Chimel.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some disarray in the case law as to standard of review that pertains to a determination of the permissible scope of a search incident to arrest. Some courts have used a clearly erroneous standard. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Morales,</i> 923 F.2d 621, 626-27 (8th Cir.1991); <i>United States v. Bennett,</i> 908 F.2d 189, 193-94 (7th Cir.1990). Others have undertaken de novo review. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Abdul-Saboor,</i> 85 F.3d 664, 667 (D.C.Cir. 1996); <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 18 F.3d 293, 294 (5th Cir.1994) (opinion on rehearing). In our judgment, a bifurcated standard of review is appropriate. <i>See United States v. Espinoza,</i> 490 F.3d 41, 45-46 (1st Cir.2007) (discussing general approach to appellate review of district court rulings on suppression motions); <i>cf. United States v. Coker,</i> 433 F.3d 39, 41 (1st Cir.2005) (discussing the bifurcated standard of review applicable to suppression rulings in the context of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel). Under that approach, we review the district court's factual findings for clear error but review de novo its ultimate constitutional conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before moving to the heart of Nascimento's argument, we pause to brush aside a potential complication. The police originally encountered Nascimento in the front of the apartment. At that time, the cabinet was unquestionably beyond his immediate control. Under the circumstances, however, it was not inappropriate for the police to escort Nascimento to his bedroom in order that he might get dressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When police encounter and arrest a partially clothed individual in his home, the need to dress him may constitute an exigency justifying the officers in entering another room in order to obtain needed clothing. <i>See United States v. Gwinn,</i> 219 F.3d 326, 333 (4th Cir.2000). Generalizations are hazardous because one can imagine infinitely variable fact patterns. It suffices to say that both human dignity and the New England climate counseled here in favor of a more complete wardrobe. In addition, the district court supportably found that the police neither manipulated the situation nor used Nascimento's dishabille as a pretext to carry out an otherwise impermissible search. Accordingly, the conduct of the police in deciding to dress the suspect falls within the reasonable latitude afforded arresting officers in coping with exigent circumstances. <i>See United States v. Cook,</i> 277 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (explaining that \"common sense and practical considerations must guide judgments about the reasonableness of searches and seizures\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the search itself. The evidence at the suppression hearing indicated that, as a matter of policy, Boston police officers in similar situations allowed arrestees to select the clothes that they wished to wear. The arrestee, however, typically would not be given direct access to the closet. Thus, the question reduces to whether a cabinet eight to ten feet away from an unrestrained suspect can be said to be within the suspect's immediate control. Emphasizing that there were two officers between him and the closet, Nascimento argues that we should answer this question in the negative. To buttress his argument, he calls our attention to <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 16 F.3d 69 (5th Cir. 1994), <i>modified on rehearing,</i> 18 F.3d 293, in which the Fifth Circuit found that a briefcase some eight feet away from an unrestrained suspect was not under his immediate control. <i>See id.</i> at 70-72. In so holding, the court stressed that four officers were present in the room. <i>Id.</i> at 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our estimation, <i>Johnson</i> is of little help to Nascimento. There, unlike in the case at hand, the officers \"never felt threatened\" and never \"believed that Johnson was about to destroy evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 72. Despite that mindset, they engaged in \"precisely the type of generalized, warrantless search prohibited by <i>Chimel.</i>\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a horse of a different hue. The officers were arresting a person whom they knew to have been charged with a crime of violence. Law enforcement officers who embark on perilous duties are not expected to ignore the need for commonsense precautions. And here, in sharp contradistinction to <i>Johnson,</i> the officers targeted their search to the closet, which was about to become the locus of activity. The district court found as a fact that the closet was readily accessible to Nascimento. That finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is game, set, and match. Given the finding of accessibility, the closet (and, thus, the cabinet) was within Nascimento's immediate control.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Accordingly, we uphold the district court's ultimate conclusion that the scope of the search was within permissible limits. <i>See Abdul-Saboor,</i> 85 F.3d at 671 (holding an area that is \"conceivably accessible\" to arrestee to be within his immediate control). On that basis, the district court appropriately denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>V.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Concluding, as we do, the appellants' arguments lack force, we affirm their convictions. We add only that while this case may venture near the outer edge of conduct encompassed by the RICO statute, Stonehurst's activities do not cross that line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The indictment also charged that another purpose of the enterprise was \"to sell crack cocaine and marijuana.\" However, the evidence at trial indicated that while individual Stonehurst members had engaged in drug trafficking, Stonehurst itself had not.

This suggestion overlooks the fact that we applied a de minimis standard in <i>McCormack</i> itself. <i>See id.</i> (stating that the evidence showed \"a `realistic probability' that the [underlying crime] would have a de minimis effect on interstate commerce\"). The language in <i>McCormack</i> to which the appellants advert relates to the degree of scrutiny, not the quantum of proof.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We think it is useful to note at this juncture that<i>Waucaush</i> was decided without the benefit of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Gonzales v.

Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000) &#8212; the duo itself having been distinguished more recently by <i>Gonzales v. Raich,</i> 545 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RICO reaches an enterprise that \"affect[s]\" interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), a term of art usually signifying Congress's intent to regulate to the limit of its Commerce Clause powers. <i>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,</i> 532 U.S. 105, 115, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001). In our case, the evidence showed the gang's regular use of guns that had moved in interstate commerce, as well as one trip by a gang member across state lines to procure such weapons. The guns were not peripheral; they related directly and centrally to the gang's activities. This nexus is enough to satisfy the Commerce Clause. That the acquisition of such weaponry swells, rather than impedes, interstate commerce long ago ceased to matter. <i>United States v. Darby,</i> 312 U.S. 100, 113, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commerce link in our case is at least as strong and arguably stronger than that of a prior felon who acquires, in some local \"street\" transaction, a gun that happened to be made in another state. The act of a felon receiving or possessing such a gun (or, indeed, even a single bullet) has for many years been a federal criminal offense, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), based on the prior movement of the gun in interstate commerce. <i>Scarborough v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 563, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977). Here, multiple weapons and their use as part of the criminal enterprise were amply proved. Given <i>Scarborough,</i> our own case appears <i>a fortiori.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts in upholding the felon-in-possession statute assert that it regulates an \"instrumentality\" of commerce, namely the gun. <i>E.g., United States v. Dorris,</i> 236 F.3d 582, 586 (10th Cir.2000). But in truth the statute criminalizes <i>conduct</i>&#8212;possession or receipt of a gun by a felon-and the gun's provenance provides a sufficient nexus to commerce to permit federal regulation of that conduct. The offending conduct here is the use of guns to kill people as part of a criminal enterprise; and the interstate origins of the guns permit Congress to regulate that conduct. If Congress can regulate the mere possession of a gun because the gun at one time traveled in interstate commerce, surely it can also regulate an enterprise that uses such guns to kill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other analogous statutes. The federal car-jacking statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 (2000), makes murder and lesser violence into federal crimes simply because the vehicle once moved in interstate commerce, and it has repeatedly been upheld. <i>E.g., United States v. Cobb,</i> 144 F.3d 319, 320-21 (4th Cir.1998). And courts regularly uphold wire and mail fraud convictions because a single call or mailing, playing an incidental role in the scheme, creates a link to an instrumentality of interstate commerce, <i>e.g., Schmuck v. United States,</i> 489 U.S. 705, 710-715, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989); <i>Pereira v. United States,</i> 347 U.S. 1, 8, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954). In fact, the call or mailing may itself be intrastate so the link is the use of facilities that also serve interstate customers, <i>e.g., United States v. Gil,</i> 297 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> concerned statutes that did not require any jury finding that the conduct in the particular case used facilities of interstate commerce or affected such commerce. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624; <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 613, 120 S.Ct. 1740. The legality of each statute in these two cases depended on imputing (in <i>Lopez</i>) or upholding (in <i>Morrison</i>) a generalized Congressional determination that a <i>class</i> of primarily local activities taken together had some cumulative effect on commerce, even if individual effects were too small to count. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 563, 115 S.Ct. 1624; <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 615, 120 S.Ct. 1740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cumulative impact theory had been well established in commerce clause cases since <i>Wickard v. Filburn,</i> 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942). In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the Supreme Court restricted the theory to cases of economic activity. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624; <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 611, 120 S.Ct. 1740. But the restriction, which we must assume continues to be good law, has nothing to do with a case where the statute requires and the evidence shows that the defendants themselves had the requisite effect on commerce&#8212;here by the purchase and possession of weaponry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Raich</i> is yet a different kind of problem. Marijuana cultivation taken as a whole is a commercial activity affecting interstate commerce; but the Supreme Court upheld the criminal ban even where marijuana is grown for personal non-economic use and consumed in-state. Its rationale was that Congress could reach cases of this kind because, given the practical difficulties of distinguishing, a ban on such intrastate, noncommercial production was an \"essential part of the larger regulatory scheme.\" <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S. at 27, 125 S.Ct. 2195.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present case is easier for the government than was <i>Raich.</i> To repeat, the RICO statute requires that the particular enterprise itself affect interstate commerce and a jury, supported by evidence, determined that the enterprise in this case did affect such commerce. The guns traveled in interstate commerce; so too did one of the enterprise's gun purchasers. This is sufficient to pass constitutional muster. <i>Cf. Scarborough,</i> 431 U.S. 563, 97 S.Ct. 1963. However much <i>Raich</i> may or may not affect <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the convictions in this case satisfy established precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress' use of the Commerce Clause to reach local crimes or criminals <i>plausibly linked in the individual case</i> to interstate commerce may or may not be good federalism policy but its legality is too well established to be revisited by the lower federal courts. Conceivably, the link in a particular case may be too slight or faint; every murder is of someone whose next meal might otherwise have come from a large supermarket chain purchasing its products interstate. <i>See Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 564, 115 S.Ct. 1624. But the arsenal of guns in this case is not a slight or faint connection and is sufficient to sustain federal jurisdiction under existing Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> <i>Jones v.

That issue possesses constitutional implications weighty enough to have led one of our sister circuits to fashion a special, more rigorous, version of RICO's statutory \"affecting commerce\" requirement for use in connection with defendants involved with enterprises that are engaged exclusively in noneconomic criminal activity. <i>See Waucaush v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787404\"><a href=\"/opinion/787404/robert-allen-waucaush-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 256 (6th Cir.2004). Although we are reluctant to create a circuit split, we conclude, after grappling with this difficult question, that the normal requirements of the RICO statute apply to defendants involved with enterprises that are engaged only in noneconomic criminal activity. Based on that conclusion and on our resolution of a golconda of other issues ably raised by highly competent counsel, we affirm the appellants' convictions. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a brief synopsis of the facts.

In 1995, one of these youths (Nardo Lopes) killed another (Bobby Mendes). Nardo then went into hiding; as of the time of trial in this case, he remained a fugitive from justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nardo's brother, Augusto Lopes, was also a Wendover regular. Though he was incarcerated at the time of the Mendes slaying, he resolved upon his release from prison, in July of 1996, to kill the potential witnesses against his brother. That resolve extended to many of his old Wendover Street associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1997, Augusto Lopes began associating with Manny Monteiro, who introduced him to a group of individuals whose base of operations was Stonehurst Street in Dorchester. Lopes's new friends were part of a street gang that controlled Stonehurst Street. He soon learned that Stonehurst members \"had problems\" with their Wendover counterparts. Although the source was never clearly established, the antagonism was real: during the period from 1998 to 2000, a wave of violence transpired in which Stonehurst members repeatedly shot at Wendover members and Wendover members retaliated in kind. Augusto Lopes was integrally involved in this cacophony of ongoing mayhem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 2004, a federal grand jury returned a thirty-three count superseding indictment naming thirteen defendants. Three of these defendants are appellants here. With respect to them, the flagship charge was that they had violated RICO through their membership in a racketeering enterprise: Stonehurst. The indictment alleged that Stonehurst's primary purpose was \"to shoot and kill members, associates, and perceived supporters of a rival gang in Boston known as Wendover.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> To buttress this allegation, the indictment enumerated nearly two dozen instances of murder and assault with intent to kill purportedly committed by Stonehurst members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seven individuals, including all three appellants, were tried together on assorted charges stemming from their involvement with Stonehurst. Augusto Lopes became a government witness and testified against his former Stonehurst allies, as did two other cooperating witnesses (Marcelino Rodrigues and Jason Burgo). The government also adduced testimony from a number of other eye-witnesses about various shootings. Police testimony, ballistics evidence, and the like completed the prosecution's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a twenty-six day trial, four defendants were acquitted.

The racketeering conviction was supported by special findings to the effect that Nascimento had (i) shot Zilla DoCanto and (ii) conspired to murder members of Wendover. The jury rejected the government's contention that Nascimento had perpetrated a second shooting and acquitted him of a second count of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors convicted a second appellant, Lance Talbert, on a RICO conspiracy count, a substantive RICO count, and a count charging VICAR murder conspiracy. The jury found specially that Talbert had shot Wendover member Adiello DaRosa and had conspired to murder members of Wendover. The government also had charged Talbert with having engaged in another shooting but dropped those charges at the close of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors convicted the third appellant, Kamal Lattimore, on both a RICO conspiracy count and a substantive RICO count.

Thus, a successful sufficiency challenge to the RICO convictions also will serve to undermine the VICAR convictions. Similarly, inasmuch as Nascimento's conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924 was predicated on his having committed a VICAR assault on Zilla DoCanto, that conviction will be nullified if the VICAR charge is found to be unsupportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellants' arguments come in a kaleidoscopic array of shapes and sizes (including frontal attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence, questions about statutory construction, constitutional challenges, and complaints about jury instructions), we organize our discussion thematically, element by element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first element of a RICO offense requires proof of the existence of an enterprise.

With respect to this issue, we review the record de novo to determine whether, taking the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the government's theory of the case, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the government had established the disputed element of the offense. <i>See United States v. Cruz-Arroyo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202375\"><a href=\"/opinion/202375/united-states-v-cruz-arroyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In attacking the sufficiency of the government's evidence anent the existence of an enterprise, the appellants point to testimony from various cooperating witnesses who described Stonehurst as a loose aggregation of friends that lacked colors, initiation rites, and a formal hierarchy. For example, Augusto Lopes testified that Stonehurst was \"just a group\" whose members \"were all friends with each other, certain individuals acted out, and some individuals didn't do nothing at all.\" Similarly, Burgo said at one point that Stonehurst was \"just a name.\" The appellants suggest that this testimony distinguishes this case from <i>United States v. Patrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199398\"><a href=\"/opinion/199398/united-states-v-patrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001), a case in which we upheld the application of RICO to a street gang that \"had colors and signs, . . . had older members who instructed younger ones, its members referred to the gang as family, and it had `sessions' where important decisions were made.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the factors mentioned in <i>Patrick</i> are relevant to the question of whether a street gang constitutes an enterprise &#8212; but their presence or absence is not dispositive of the issue. Here, the government provided other testimony that could have prompted a jury reasonably to conclude that Stonehurst was an enterprise. After all, Stonehurst members used a shared cache of firearms that were regarded as property of the gang. The weapons were handed around and used by several different Stonehurst members to shoot Wendover sympathizers. One erstwhile Stonehurst member, Rodrigues, testified that he had traveled to purchase weapons for \"the group\" and clarified that by \"the group\" he meant \"Stonehurst.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to testimony about Stonehurst's arsenal, the record contains testimony suggesting that Stonehurst members self-identified as belonging to an organization. Cooperating witnesses were able to identify precisely a wide variety of individuals as being associated with Stonehurst. The witnesses also displayed an ability to distinguish between members and friends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, Stonehurst members kept tabs on one another and informed one another when things would be \"hot\" because of a recent shooting. They acted on behalf of one another by attempting to assassinate witnesses to each other's crimes. And, finally, members trained other members in the use of night vision goggles, binoculars, and police evasion tactics to enable them more efficiently to carry out their shared purpose of killing Wendover members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude, as did the district court, that even though Stonehurst lacked some of the accouterments of more structured street gangs, a rational jury could find that it had a sufficiently well-defined shape to constitute an enterprise in the requisite sense. Stonehurst exhibited group cohesion over time; its membership pooled and shared resources; the individuals involved had a sense of belonging and self-identified as Stonehurst members; and the group had a well-honed set of goals. We think that this is enough, if barely, to constitute a RICO enterprise. <i>See Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>2.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Talbert makes a related contention: that even if the evidence suffices to support a finding that Stonehurst was an enterprise, the district court's jury instructions were confusing. He directs his umbrage at the court's instruction that a RICO enterprise need not have an \"ascertainable structure.\" As Talbert acknowledges, this instruction has been approved as good law in this circuit. <i>See Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some challenges to jury instructions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200062\"><a href=\"/opinion/200062/united-states-v-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2002). Others, however, assign error in, say, the nature of the elements of an offense. That type of claim engenders de novo review. <i>See, e.g., Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 28; <i>see also United States v. Figueroa-Encarnac&#237;on,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783504\"><a href=\"/opinion/783504/united-states-v-ramon-figueroa-encarnacion-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2003) (noting the standard-of-review distinction). Because Talbert's challenge is rooted not in an abstract principle of law but in the trial court's choice of language, with a view to minimizing potential juror confusion, the abuse of discretion standard governs our review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the challenged instruction tracks an explicit holding of this court, Talbert starts at a considerable disadvantage. He insists, however, that where, as here, there is only \"minimal\" evidence of the existence of an enterprise, the trial court should avoid the topic of ascertainable structure altogether. In a close case, his thesis runs, such an instruction, though technically correct, promotes juror confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is untenable. When an instruction is pertinent to the issues submitted to the jury and constitutes an accurate statement of the law, it is hard to imagine any basis for a claim of error. <i>See United States v. Keene,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200608\"><a href=\"/opinion/200608/united-states-v-keene/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.2003). Here, moreover, the district court took great pains to emphasize that \"[a]n enterprise is not merely a related assortment of criminal activities.\" Rather, the court said, \"there must be some goal &#8212; a purpose of engaging in a course of conduct &#8212; beyond this isolated benefit that can come from the commission of each criminal act.\" The court also made clear that \"[t]he enterprise element [of the offense] is different from the racketeering activity element.\" These instructions were pellucid as to the distinctions between the \"enterprise\" and \"pattern\" elements of the offense. We see no realistic possibility that they were a source of juror confusion. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in charging the jury as it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>3.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants lodge a final objection to the finding that Stonehurst constituted an enterprise. This objection centers on the longevity of the enterprise. It is not a claim that Stonehurst's existence was too ephemeral to satisfy the minimum duration required by the RICO statute, <i>see H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 242, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span> (1989) (discussing the continuity requirement applicable to RICO enterprises), but rather a claim that the duration of Stonehurst's existence, as proven, fell short of the period suggested in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument proceeds as follows. First, the appellants note that the indictment specified that the named defendants \"[f]rom a time unknown, but at least by July 1996, until the date of the Indictment\" &#8212; September 30, 2004 &#8212; \"did unlawfully and knowingly conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the [e]nterprise, through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" They then point out that the district court told the jury, without objection, that in order to establish the enterprise element, the government had to prove that \"the enterprise [had] continue[d] in essentially unchanged form <i>during substantially the entire period alleged in the indictment</i>\" (emphasis supplied). Next, the appellants remind us that \"when a cause is submitted to the jury under an instruction, not patently incorrect or internally inconsistent, to which no timely objection has been lodged, the instruction becomes the law of the case.\" <i>United States v. Gomes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587243\"><a href=\"/opinion/587243/united-states-v-nazira-a-gomes/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1290</span></a></span>, 1294 (1st Cir.1992). The question then becomes &#8212; or so the appellants say &#8212; whether the government provided \"evidence sufficient to establish the elements required by the actual instructions given.\" <i>United States v. Zanghi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198610\"><a href=\"/opinion/198610/united-states-v-zanghi/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.1999). The appellants conclude that this question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this construct. It found that Rodrigues's testimony supported a finding that the enterprise existed from at least 1997 until at least 2001. It further found that the evidence indicating that the Wendover/Stonehurst feud had its origins in the Mendes killing was enough to support the conclusion that Stonehurst was active as far back as 1995. While it acknowledged that there was no evidence of Stonehurst's existence from 2002 through 2004, the court found such evidence unnecessary because substantially all the relevant activity of the enterprise took place during the 1996-2001 time frame. The court added that, in any event, the exact duration of the enterprise was not an essential element of the offense. In its view, the government demonstrated the required continuity, and no more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court concluded by analyzing what had happened as a type of variance. A variance occurs when \"the proof at trial depicts a scenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Escobar-de Jes&#250;s,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765611\"><a href=\"/opinion/765611/united-states-v-eusebio-escobar-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 172 (1st Cir.1999). The existence of a variance does not automatically result in the vacation of a conviction. A variance only requires the setting aside of a conviction if it is prejudicial. <i>See United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200391\"><a href=\"/opinion/200391/united-states-v-oviedo-villarman/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2003). Discerning no prejudice from this particular variance, the district court denied the appellants' motions for either judgment of acquittal or a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants attack the district court's ruling on several levels. Their first attack is fact-oriented: they concede that Rodrigues testified that he was a Stonehurst member from 1997 through 2001, but they assert that he only described activities occurring during 1998 and 2000. This is too isthmian a view of Rodrigues's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodrigues testified that the shootings between Wendover and Stonehurst \"started . . . back in '95\" and were \"still ongoing.\" At the very least, this testimony supports the district court's conclusion that Stonehurst, as an entity dedicated to wreaking havoc on Wendover, existed through the end of Rodrigues's tenure (2001). The question, then, is whether the jury verdict can be supported by testimony concerning that somewhat truncated time span.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, citing the Second Circuit's decision in <i>United States v. Morales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765362\"><a href=\"/opinion/765362/united-states-v-ricardo-morales-aka-ichi-and-jesus-mendez-aka-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1999), insist that it cannot. In <i>Morales,</i> the indictment alleged that the defendants had belonged to a continuous enterprise that existed for a nine-year period. <i>Id.</i> at 78. The proof, however, showed conclusively that the enterprise had been dormant for seven years in the middle of that period because its entire membership had been incarcerated. <i>Id.</i> at 79. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to show that the \"enterprise existed for the duration alleged in the indictment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 81. The court refused to \"consider whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of a shorter racketeering enterprise\" on the ground that the \"indictment charged a single nine-year enterprise, and the jury was instructed that it could only convict on the racketeering and racketeering-dependent counts if it found that the specific enterprise set out in the indictment existed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants asseverate that this case and <i>Morales</i> are peas in a pod. They are not. The concerns underlying the decision in <i>Morales</i> are very different from what is involved here. In <i>Morales,</i> the government attempted to play fast and loose with RICO's continuity requirement &#8212; and it did so in a way that threatened to impair the defendants' rights (by constructing the indictment in a manner that allowed the introduction, in a single trial, of evidence concerning two distinct criminal organizations). Under those circumstances, we readily understand why the <i>Morales</i> court was disinclined to allow the government to argue, after putting before the jury significantly inculpatory evidence from both periods, that either organization, by itself, could have satisfied the continuity requirement. That would, in effect, have given the government a second bite at the cherry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scenario here is vastly different. While the indictment may have marginally overclaimed &#8212; the record contains very little concerning the 2002-2004 period &#8212; there was no question of shifting enterprises and no attempt to stack the deck by introducing damning bits of evidence from a different organization's conduct in a different era. Moreover, the government had adduced ample proof that a single enterprise was continuously active in the slightly narrowed period. Indeed, the trial seems to have proceeded on the premise that this narrowed period was the relevant time frame.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the appellants had every reason to believe that the period from 1996 through 2001 would be the crucial period for purposes of the RICO and other racketeering-dependent counts. Of the twenty-one racketeering acts listed in the indictment, twenty were alleged to have occurred in that time frame (the lone exception &#8212; the general charge that Stonehurst members had conspired to kill Wendover members &#8212; was described as having spanned the period from 1996 until 2004). This not only erases any doubt that the indictment gave the appellants fair notice of the focus of the charges against them, but also confirms that the government did not benefit in any way from describing a slightly longer period in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we do not think that the government can be said to have assumed the burden of proving the operation of Stonehurst from 1996 to 2004 merely by mentioning those dates in the indictment. The period represented a mere factual allegation; it did not constitute an element of the offense. That is a significant difference. <i>See United States v. Mueffelman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202534\"><a href=\"/opinion/202534/united-states-v-mueffelman/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir. 2006) (describing the difference between a deviation from the charging terms and a deviation from facts alleged in an indictment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, we see no merit in the appellants' \"law of the case\" argument. The district court charged the jury in relevant part that the government had the burden of proving that the enterprise operated continuously \"during substantially the entire period alleged in the indictment.\" \"Substantially\" is a relative term, which invites a weighing of the salience of covered items against the salience of non-covered items. <i>Cf. United States v. Castaneda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"16318\"><a href=\"/opinion/16318/united-states-v-castaneda/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span> 838 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that a party has \"substantially performed\" when his \"relatively insignificant omissions\" are \"dwarfed by [his] performance\"). Bearing in mind that virtually all the overt acts that comprised the substance of the indictment were completed prior to 2002, we think that a rational jury could conclude that the period form 1996 through 2001 was \"substantially\" the entire period covered by the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second element of a RICO violation is an effect on interstate or foreign commerce. Foreign commerce is not implicated here, and the district court instructed the jury that the interstate commerce requirement would be satisfied by a showing that Stonehurst's actions had at least a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. This instruction would have been unarguably correct in most RICO cases. <i>See, e.g., Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 35; <i>United States v. Riddle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773146\"><a href=\"/opinion/773146/united-states-v-jeffrey-riddle-99-3405-lavance-turnage-99-3406-bernard/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 537 (6th Cir.2001). Seizing on the fact that Stonehurst did not engage in any economic activity, <i>see supra</i> note 1, the appellants argue that this case is different. In their view, the instruction misstates RICO's statutory requirement with respect to enterprises that have not engaged in economic activity. They argue, in the alternative, that if the instruction is correct as a matter of statutory interpretation, the statute is unconstitutional as applied to their enterprise. As a fallback, they assert that, even if the instruction can withstand these attacks, the evidence was insufficient to satisfy even the modest de minimis standard. We consider each facet of this asseverational array.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>1.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the appellants' contention that, on the facts of this case, the RICO statute requires more than a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. This is an uphill battle; this court has held, squarely and explicitly, that a de minimis effect on interstate commerce is all that is required to satisfy RICO's commerce element. <i>See Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants attempt to skirt this obstacle by suggesting that a more rigorous standard pertains in cases, like this one, in which a RICO enterprise has not engaged in economic activity. To distinguish <i>Marino,</i> they point out that the enterprise in question there was found to be involved in drug trafficking &#8212; plainly a form of economic activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is peculiar. Although nothing in the text of RICO suggests it, the appellants urge us to read a single phrase in the statute as requiring different things in different situations: in a case involving an enterprise engaged in economic activity, the government would have to show only a de minimis effect on interstate commerce, whereas in a case involving an enterprise engaged in violence but not in economic activity, the government would have to show a more substantial effect on interstate commerce. We reject this iridescent reading of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the RICO statute applies to any \"enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c). There is nothing in either the statutory language or the legislative history that supports the appellants' contention that these words mean different things as applied to different types of enterprises. Courts are not charged with the task of writing statutes or improving upon them but, rather, with the more mundane task of figuring out, consistent with the statutory text, what the authoring Congress intended. This division of functions, as well as basic principles of statutory construction, counsels persuasively against a court trying to tease from the simple word \"affect\" sophisticated gradations of meaning that will vary from situation to situation. <i>See Ratzlaf v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112919\"><a href=\"/opinion/112919/ratzlaf-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span>, 143, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112919\"><a href=\"/opinion/112919/ratzlaf-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That court adopted the position that the appellants espouse, holding that the RICO statute reaches an enterprise engaged in noneconomic violent crime only if the enterprise's activities have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. 380 F.3d at 255-56. The appellants invite us to follow <i>Waucaush.</i> We respectfully decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this result, the <i>Waucaush</i> court did not employ any of the usual tools of statutory construction. The absence of anything in the reasoning of that court that explains how it is possible, consistent with sound canons of statutory construction, to read the word \"affect\" as possessing two different meanings depending upon additional facts not mentioned in the statute itself, makes the decision suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of relying upon principles of statutory construction, the <i>Waucaush</i> court based its holding on a professed desire to \"avoid interpreting a statute to prohibit conduct which Congress may not constitutionally regulate.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Echoing this refrain, the appellants argue, in effect, that application of the RICO statute to their activities raises grave constitutional concerns and, for that reason, we should abstain from reading the statute as encompassing noneconomic activities that have only a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.

In that case, the Court focused upon a particular phrase in the federal arson statute: \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). The Court determined that the word \"used\" denotes \"active employment.\" <i>Jones,</i> 529 U.S. at 855, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118370\"><a href=\"/opinion/118370/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The fact that the <i>Scheidler</i> Court discussed only detrimental effects is something of a makeweight; that analysis corresponded to the facts of the particular case. Nothing in the opinion suggests that the Court's casual reference to \"detrimental influence\" was intended to limit the \"affecting commerce\" language of the RICO statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right of the federal government to use the power conferred by the Commerce Clause for regulatory objectives, apart from the direct promotion and protection of interstate commerce, has been ingrained in our jurisprudence for over a century. <i>See, e.g., Champion v.

This is especially true where, as here, we are asked to apply the definition in a subset of RICO cases (i.e., cases involving enterprises engaged exclusively in noneconomic activities), thereby creating an anomalous situation in which a single word in a single statute simultaneously would have varying meanings, depending on context.

In concluding that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to enact the school-zone legislation, the Court explained that the commerce power may only be used to justify three different kinds of laws: those regulating the channels of interstate commerce, those regulating the instrumentalities of and things moving in interstate commerce, and those regulating activities substantially affecting interstate commerce. <i>See id.</i> at 558-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The <i>Raich</i> decision is critically important for present purposes because it is more directly on point than any case in the earlier trilogy. <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> involved facial challenges to federal statutes: in each case, the parties asserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress's commerce power in its entirety. <i>Jones</i> was an exercise in statutory construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand, however, entails an as-applied challenge to a generally valid federal statute. <i>Raich</i> is of the same genre; it involved a request \"to excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.\" <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S. at 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799995\"><a href=\"/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The <i>Raich</i> Court deemed this distinction \"pivotal\" because when \"the class of activities is regulated and the class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). <i>Raich</i> supplies a gloss on the earlier trilogy and, in the bargain, offers meaningful guidance as to how courts should approach as-applied challenges under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Raich,</i> the Supreme Court upheld two provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 844(a), as applied to the intrastate and noncommercial cultivation of medical marijuana. <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S. at 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799995\"><a href=\"/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The linchpin of their argument is the fact that Stonehurst's activities were undertaken without an economic motive. In the long run, however, that isolated fact is of little significance. The correct mode of analysis requires a more global view. \"Congress's power to criminalize . . . conduct pursuant to the Commerce Clause turns on the economic nature of the <i>class of conduct</i> defined in the statute rather than the economic facts . . . of a single case.\" <i>United States v.

All that is necessary to deflect a Commerce Clause challenge to a general regulatory statute is a showing that the statute itself deals rationally with a class of activity that has a substantial relationship to interstate or foreign commerce. <i>See Maryland v.

Particular manifestations include loansharking, extortion, and a host of other financially driven crimes. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(1) (defining \"racketeering activity\").

Because Stonehurst has not been engaged in racketeering activity of an economic nature, we employ heightened scrutiny throughout this examination. <i>See United States v.

The shooting took place after midnight and the ensuing investigation caused the shop to close for several hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government first posits that the temporary closing of a business engaged in interstate commerce had an effect on commerce sufficient to satisfy the de minimis standard. In support of this proposition, it cites cases such as <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201589\"><a href=\"/opinion/201589/united-states-v-vega-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 527 (1st Cir.2005), <i>United States v.

But the suggested comparison is not apt: in those cases, the closed business was itself the target of a planned robbery. In contrast, the Stonehurst members had no designs on the tire shop per se; they merely held a grudge against one of the shop's customers and happened to find it convenient to ambush him there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To add another distinguishing dimension, the closings in the cited cases were for longer intervals and, thus, caused considerably more disruption of the business. <i>See, e.g., Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 527 (describing a full-day closure); <i>Juvenile Male,</i> 118 F.3d at 1349 (describing a closure lasting \"several days\"); <i>Davis,</i> 30 F.3d at 615 (describing the temporary shutdown of four gas stations). In contrast, the tire shop here was closed, in the dead of night, for a matter of hours. Moreover, the proprietor testified that he \"suspected\" that some business had been lost because there was less \"paperwork\" than usual but he could not definitively identify any such shortfall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also posits that Stonehurst members' regular use of cellular telephones as a means of coordinating their activities comprised the requisite nexus to commerce. But again, the cases that it cites are of scant assistance. In each of them, the court mentioned telephone use only after it had enumerated a series of more binding links to commerce. <i>See United States v.

We are more dubious here both because the enterprise was devoted to noneconomic activities and because the government's evidence concerning cell-phone use was skimpy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's best evidence on this point consisted of testimony to the effect that gang members communicated with each other by cell phone in order to keep abreast of important information, such as when things had become \"hot\" following a shooting. In addition, at least two shootings attributable to Stonehurst (those directed at Wendover members Luis Carvalho and Antonio Cabral) were precipitated by cell-phone calls to or between Stonehurst members identifying where the intended victim might be found. There was, however, some countervailing evidence. For example, the government's star witness, Augusto Lopes, stated that Stonehurst did \"[n]ot necessarily\" use cell phones to discuss acts of violence because \"they can be bugged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we need not resolve whether either the tire shop or cell-phone evidence, alone or in tandem, suffices to make out the requisite de minimis connection between the enterprise and interstate commerce. As we explain below, there is surer footing in this case for a finding that the government satisfied the \"affecting commerce\" element of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects that Stonehurst maintained an arsenal &#8212; no fewer than nine different firearms used by Stonehurst members in carrying out Stonehurst business. This and other evidence led the district court to conclude that Stonehurst was a \"massive purchaser of guns.\" With one exception (a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver made in Massachusetts), all the firearms acquired by Stonehurst had been manufactured outside of Massachusetts and, thus, had moved in interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants try to blunt the force of this evidence by citation to <i>United States v.

Were the wielding of out-of-state guns, simpliciter, the only hook on which the \"affecting commerce\" element could be hung, the Fifth Circuit's caveat might give us pause. Here, however, the \"gun\" evidence is strengthened measurably by testimony that, during the currency of the RICO conspiracy, Lattimore traveled from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, purchased a firearm, and brought it back to Massachusetts. That weapon became part of Stonehurst's arsenal and was later fired by a Stonehurst member at a car in which Wendover members were thought to be riding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that a Stonehurst member actually crossed state lines to purchase a weapon for use in carrying out the enterprise's activities is entitled to great weight in the decisional calculus; crossing state lines for purpose of engaging in a commercial transaction is a paradigmatic example of an activity that falls within the compass of the commerce power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Cf. United States v. Clark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793116\"><a href=\"/opinion/793116/united-states-v-michael-lewis-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></a></span>, 1114 (9th Cir.2006) (noting that \"requiring travel in foreign commerce, coupled with engagement in a commercial transaction while abroad, implicates foreign commerce to a constitutionally adequate degree\"). This purchase, coupled with the evidence concerning the amassed arsenal of firearms manufactured out of state, suffices to satisfy RICO's interstate commerce nexus. It follows that the tire shop evidence and the evidence of cell-phone use are, in the circumstances of this case, merely frosting on the cake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final element in the RICO equation requires the government to show that a defendant participated in the conduct of the enterprise \"through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c). A pattern requires a minimum of two racketeering acts. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1961(5). The word \"through\" implies a nexus between these racketeering acts and the enterprise. That nexus exists when a defendant is able to commit the predicate racketeering acts either by means or as a result of his involvement with the enterprise. <i>See Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the jury found that Nascimento had committed two racketeering acts: (i) shooting DoCanto and (ii) conspiring to kill Wendover members. He argues before us that the evidence did not support a finding that a relationship existed between the DoCanto shooting and his membership in Stonehurst. If this argument prevails, it would thwart the government's effort to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, and Nascimento's conviction would topple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nascimento marshals a similar argument concerning his VICAR conviction for assault in aid of racketeering. VICAR forbids, inter alia, committing assault with a dangerous weapon \"for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in\" a racketeering enterprise. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1959(a)(3). Thus, if the evidence was inadequate to support a finding that he shot DoCanto to maintain his position in Stonehurst, then the VICAR conviction cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In approaching these arguments, one fact sticks out like a sore thumb. Despite the perfervid rhetoric in which the arguments are couched, Nascimento does not challenge the sufficiency of the government's proof that he actually shot DoCanto. Our task, therefore, is to undertake de novo review in order to ascertain whether, taking all reasonable inferences in the government's favor, rational jurors could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the necessary relationship existed between Nascimento's shooting of DoCanto and his membership in Stonehurst. <i>See Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects that on the night of November 29, 1998, DoCanto was standing near her car. Her boyfriend, Anildo Rocha, was inside the vehicle. Nascimento opened fire, hitting DoCanto in the left leg. Although there is no evidence that either DoCanto or Rocha were Wendover members, Augusto Lopes testified that Nascimento stated that he had fired the shots with the intention of hitting the man in the car, whom he mistakenly believed to be DoCanto's brother, Joaquim \"Big Rocky\" Martins. In light of this testimony, Nascimento's claim of error boils down to a plaint that the evidence was too thin to warrant a finding that Nascimento understood his intended target &#8212; Big Rocky &#8212; to be affiliated with Wendover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This plaint rests heavily on Lopes's further testimony that \"Big Rocky . . . wasn't associated with nobody.\" Lopes added, however, that Big Rocky \"was actually involved in the problems.\" The jury, of course, was entitled to discount the former statement and to credit the latter. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 483 (1st Cir.2000) (acknowledging jury's \"prerogative to credit some parts of a witness's testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endeavoring to parry this thrust, Nascimento argues that the allusion to \"the problems\" might be a reference to the fact that Big Rocky was a witness to the Mendes murder committed by Nardo Lopes, not a reference to any involvement with Wendover. That interpretation is propped up by Rodrigues's testimony that he understood Big Rocky to be one of the witnesses against Nardo Lopes. But the government counters, with considerable force, that at a different place in his testimony Augusto Lopes unequivocally named Big Rocky as a Wendover collaborator. The government also notes that the jury heard testimony from an admitted Wendover member, Adiello DaRosa, that Big Rocky was associated with Wendover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sifting through conflicting testimony and determining where the truth lies is the sort of work that falls squarely within the jury's province. So it is here: the question is one of fact, and the answer depends on what evidence the jurors deign to credit. When a jury, which has seen and heard the witnesses, picks and chooses among conflicting accounts, an appellate court should almost always honor that choice. <i>See United States v. Gobbi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202578\"><a href=\"/opinion/202578/united-states-v-gobbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 311 (1st Cir.2006) (explaining that it is \"ultimately the province of the jury to assess the significance of any contradictions in the evidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That effectively ends this aspect of the matter. Once the jury had decided which account of Big Rocky's status should be credited, the legal implications of that decision were clear. Consequently, we reject Nascimento's claim of error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nascimento argues in the alternative that, given the contradictions in the testimony, the jury could not rationally have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. He cites <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198160\"><a href=\"/opinion/198160/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1998), for the familiar proposition that when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, supports both a theory of guilt and an equally likely theory of innocence, reasonable jurors must perforce entertain a reasonable doubt. In this case, however, the jury was under no compulsion to deem the contrasting theories of guilt and innocence equally likely. The jury plausibly could have credited the clear and unambiguous statement of DaRosa, himself a Wendover stalwart and presumably a reliable source of information about the gang's composition, that Big Rocky was a Wendover member and was for that reason \"part of the problems.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nascimento advances a further argument to the effect that VICAR requires an even tighter relationship between a predicate racketeering act and an enterprise because the act must be \"for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in an enterprise.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a). This argument is foreclosed by precedent: the VICAR provision is satisfied as long as the criminal act can be said to have been expected of the defendant by reason of his membership in the enterprise. <i>United States v. Tse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751343\"><a href=\"/opinion/751343/united-states-v-stephen-tse/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 206 (1st Cir.1998). The totality of the evidence in regard to Nascimento's shooting of DoCanto passes that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be superogatory. We conclude, on whole-record review, that the evidence was sufficient to sustain both an inference that Nascimento fired at DoCanto as part of an effort to eliminate a member of the rival Wendover gang and an inference that this conduct was expected of him by reason of his membership in Stonehurst. Thus, there is an adequate relationship, for both RICO and VICAR purposes, between the challenged racketeering act and the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted both Talbert and Nascimento on a trio of charges: a substantive RICO offense, RICO conspiracy, and VICAR conspiracy to commit murder. In each case, one of the racketeering acts undergirding the substantive RICO charge was conspiracy to commit murder. These two appellants now say that the interplay between the substantive RICO charge and the conspiracy charges offended the Double Jeopardy Clause. For the reasons that follow, we reject their importunings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One branch of the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the government from punishing a person twice for the same offense. <i>See</i> U.S. Const., amend.

Second, and relatedly, each of them argues that his conviction for conspiracy to violate RICO was a lesser included offense within his substantive RICO conviction and, thus, barred under the <i>Blockburger</i> test. <i>See Brown v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109695\"><a href=\"/opinion/109695/brown-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109695\"><a href=\"/opinion/109695/brown-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 39, we held \"that a substantive RICO violation and a RICO conspiracy are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.\" In the same opinion, we rejected the notion that a VICAR violation is a lesser included offense of a substantive RICO violation. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' attempts to distinguish <i>Marino</i> are unavailing. They focus on two facts: (i) that <i>Marino</i> involved a greater number of racketeering acts and (ii) that here, unlike in <i>Marino,</i> the purpose of the enterprise (killing Wendover members) was identical to the object of the charged conspiracy. Neither of those distinctions makes a dispositive difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Blockburger</i> test \"depends on the elements of the crimes and not the similarity of the underlying facts.\" <i>United States v.

Thus, in resolving a double jeopardy challenge such as that advanced here, a court should not bog itself down in the minutiae of the evidence underlying the charges but, rather, should confine itself to the statutory elements of the two offenses. Because a \"RICO conspiracy and a RICO violation do not <i>necessarily</i> require the participation of the same people,\" <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 39 (emphasis in the original), it is beside the point whether, in a particular instance, the racketeering acts are few or many, or whether the RICO conspirators and the RICO participants are identical. By the same token, the fact that the purpose of the enterprise and the object of the conspiracy happen to coincide is of no moment. <i>See United States v.

Wharton's Rule is limited to instances &#8212; adultery is a prime example &#8212; in which, as a statutory matter, the completed offense necessarily involves conspiracy between the participants. <i>See Iannelli v.

The short of it is that these appeals do not implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>IV.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last leg of our journey requires us to consider Nascimento's assertion that the district court erred in refusing to suppress evidence seized from his room during an arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are as follows. Nascimento was facing state criminal charges arising out of the DoCanto shooting. He failed to report as required and a state magistrate issued a default warrant. On December 7, 1999, the police &#8212; armed with the arrest warrant but no search warrant &#8212; arrived at Nascimento's home. Following a consensual entry, they informed Nascimento (who was clad only in his underwear) that he was to be arrested. Because Nascimento seemed compliant, the officers did not handcuff him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two officers escorted Nascimento through the house to his bedroom so that he could get dressed. Once there, the officers did a quick sweep of the bed for weapons and sat Nascimento on it. One of the officers proceeded to the clothes closet located eight to ten feet from the bed. The officer performed a brief sweep of the closet, noticed an unlocked cabinet on the top shelf, reached in, and discovered a gun frame. At that point, Nascimento was handcuffed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his indictment in this case, Nascimento moved to suppress the gun frame as the fruit of an illegal search. <i>See</i> U.S. Const., amend. IV. The district court denied the motion. Nascimento appeals from this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be difficult to regard the introduction of the gun frame as harmless: it was matched by a government ballistics expert to shell casings found at one of the Stonehurst shootings. The fact that Nascimento had possession of the gun frame also served to corroborate Augusto Lopes, who testified that Nascimento had disassembled a gun following a shooting, handed the barrel to Lopes for disposal, and kept the frame. Given the force of this evidence, we think it best to address Nascimento's claim on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it seems useful to distinguish between searches incident to arrest and protective sweeps. Officers effecting an arrest are entitled to make a search incident to that arrest. <i>Chimel v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107979\"><a href=\"/opinion/107979/chimel-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 763, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107979\"><a href=\"/opinion/107979/chimel-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Others have undertaken de novo review. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

In our judgment, a bifurcated standard of review is appropriate. <i>See United States v.

The police originally encountered Nascimento in the front of the apartment. At that time, the cabinet was unquestionably beyond his immediate control. Under the circumstances, however, it was not inappropriate for the police to escort Nascimento to his bedroom in order that he might get dressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When police encounter and arrest a partially clothed individual in his home, the need to dress him may constitute an exigency justifying the officers in entering another room in order to obtain needed clothing. <i>See United States v. Gwinn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769518\"><a href=\"/opinion/769518/united-states-v-dennis-blane-gwinn/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 333 (4th Cir.2000). Generalizations are hazardous because one can imagine infinitely variable fact patterns. It suffices to say that both human dignity and the New England climate counseled here in favor of a more complete wardrobe. In addition, the district court supportably found that the police neither manipulated the situation nor used Nascimento's dishabille as a pretext to carry out an otherwise impermissible search. Accordingly, the conduct of the police in deciding to dress the suspect falls within the reasonable latitude afforded arresting officers in coping with exigent circumstances. <i>See United States v. Cook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776186\"><a href=\"/opinion/776186/united-states-v-donald-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (explaining that \"common sense and practical considerations must guide judgments about the reasonableness of searches and seizures\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the search itself. The evidence at the suppression hearing indicated that, as a matter of policy, Boston police officers in similar situations allowed arrestees to select the clothes that they wished to wear. The arrestee, however, typically would not be given direct access to the closet. Thus, the question reduces to whether a cabinet eight to ten feet away from an unrestrained suspect can be said to be within the suspect's immediate control. Emphasizing that there were two officers between him and the closet, Nascimento argues that we should answer this question in the negative. To buttress his argument, he calls our attention to <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662475\"><a href=\"/opinion/662475/united-states-v-skirvin-george-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1994), <i>modified on rehearing,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664659\"><a href=\"/opinion/664659/united-states-v-skirvin-george-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, in which the Fifth Circuit found that a briefcase some eight feet away from an unrestrained suspect was not under his immediate control. <i>See id.</i> at 70-72. In so holding, the court stressed that four officers were present in the room. <i>Id.</i> at 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our estimation, <i>Johnson</i> is of little help to Nascimento. There, unlike in the case at hand, the officers \"never felt threatened\" and never \"believed that Johnson was about to destroy evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 72. Despite that mindset, they engaged in \"precisely the type of generalized, warrantless search prohibited by <i>Chimel.</i>\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a horse of a different hue. The officers were arresting a person whom they knew to have been charged with a crime of violence. Law enforcement officers who embark on perilous duties are not expected to ignore the need for commonsense precautions. And here, in sharp contradistinction to <i>Johnson,</i> the officers targeted their search to the closet, which was about to become the locus of activity. The district court found as a fact that the closet was readily accessible to Nascimento. That finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is game, set, and match. Given the finding of accessibility, the closet (and, thus, the cabinet) was within Nascimento's immediate control.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Accordingly, we uphold the district court's ultimate conclusion that the scope of the search was within permissible limits. <i>See Abdul-Saboor,</i> 85 F.3d at 671 (holding an area that is \"conceivably accessible\" to arrestee to be within his immediate control).

The act of a felon receiving or possessing such a gun (or, indeed, even a single bullet) has for many years been a federal criminal offense, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), based on the prior movement of the gun in interstate commerce. <i>Scarborough v.

Given <i>Scarborough,</i> our own case appears <i>a fortiori.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts in upholding the felon-in-possession statute assert that it regulates an \"instrumentality\" of commerce, namely the gun. <i>E.g., United States v. Dorris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160556\"><a href=\"/opinion/160556/united-states-v-dorris/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 586 (10th Cir.2000). But in truth the statute criminalizes <i>conduct</i>&#8212;possession or receipt of a gun by a felon-and the gun's provenance provides a sufficient nexus to commerce to permit federal regulation of that conduct. The offending conduct here is the use of guns to kill people as part of a criminal enterprise; and the interstate origins of the guns permit Congress to regulate that conduct. If Congress can regulate the mere possession of a gun because the gun at one time traveled in interstate commerce, surely it can also regulate an enterprise that uses such guns to kill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other analogous statutes. The federal car-jacking statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 (2000), makes murder and lesser violence into federal crimes simply because the vehicle once moved in interstate commerce, and it has repeatedly been upheld. <i>E.g., United States v.

And courts regularly uphold wire and mail fraud convictions because a single call or mailing, playing an incidental role in the scheme, creates a link to an instrumentality of interstate commerce, <i>e.g., Schmuck v.

Marijuana cultivation taken as a whole is a commercial activity affecting interstate commerce; but the Supreme Court upheld the criminal ban even where marijuana is grown for personal non-economic use and consumed in-state.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1963</span></a></span>. However much <i>Raich</i> may or may not affect <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the convictions in this case satisfy established precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress' use of the Commerce Clause to reach local crimes or criminals <i>plausibly linked in the individual case</i> to interstate commerce may or may not be good federalism policy but its legality is too well established to be revisited by the lower federal courts. Conceivably, the link in a particular case may be too slight or faint; every murder is of someone whose next meal might otherwise have come from a large supermarket chain purchasing its products interstate. <i>See Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 564, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1624</span></a></span>. But the arsenal of guns in this case is not a slight or faint connection and is sufficient to sustain federal jurisdiction under existing Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> <i>Jones v.
