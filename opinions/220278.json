Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f      SOUTER, Associate Justice.           South Shore Imported Cars, Inc.\n\nbrought this action against Volkswagen of America, Inc., for breach\n\nof an auto sales franchise agreement in violation of Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 93B, known as the Dealer's Bill of Rights.                       The statute\n\nlimits   a   manufacturer     like   V.W.       from    terminating       a   dealer's\n\nfranchise    agreement   except      for     good      cause,   id.   §    5(a),    and\n\nspecifically requires a reasonable opportunity to cure a violation\n\nof the agreement, id. § 5(h), and a minimum notice of 60 days with\n\nspecification    of   cause    prior       to   the     effective     date     of   any\n\ntermination, id. § 5(b).\n\n      In December 2008, South Shore's bank cancelled its revolving\n\ncredit agreement for financing inventory purchases from V.W.                        The\n\nbank informed V.W., which in turn notified South Shore that loss of\n\nthe line of credit was a breach of the franchise agreement (a claim\n\nnot disputed) and demanded that the dealer obtain a substitute.\n\nWhen South Shore's efforts failed, V.W. told the dealer in mid-June\n\nthat it had 15 days to obtain new credit, and on July 7, 2009, V.W.\n\nserved South Shore with the 60-day notice of termination, effective\n\nSeptember 8.\n\n      Although new bank financing was elusive, South Shore's efforts\n\nto   sell the   dealership reached           the    point   of   a    purchase-sale\n\nagreement on August 28, which was sent to V.W. on August 31.                        The\n\nsale was conditioned on V.W.'s approval, and South Shore requested\n\nV.W. to send the buyers an application form in accordance with the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffranchise terms, requiring V.W. to treat such an application in\n\ngood faith but giving V.W. time for consideration extending well\n\nbeyond September 8.\n\n     On September 4, V.W. decided not to forward the form to the\n\nbuyers, and South Shore filed the present action on the stated\n\neffective date of termination of the agreement, originally in state\n\ncourt.   The state court had not acted on South Shore's request for\n\nan injunction against termination by the time V.W. removed the case\n\nto federal court, after which the parties executed a stand-still\n\nagreement requiring V.W. to continue to deal with South Shore\n\nduring litigation, but expressly saving V.W.'s claims and rights,\n\nand this was embodied in an injunction issued by agreement.                  In the\n\naction itself, South Shore claimed that V.W.'s willingness to\n\ncontinue   to   deal     with   it   from     December   2008   to    July    2009\n\nconstituted a waiver of South Shore's breach, thus depriving V.W.\n\nof the good cause necessary to justify termination, and entailing\n\nthe further consequence that V.W. itself broke the agreement by\n\nrefusing to     tender    a   franchise      application   to   the   buyer    and\n\nconsider it in good faith.\n\n     On cross-motions for summary judgement, the district court saw\n\nno merit in the waiver argument.             The court went on, however, to\n\nconsider South Shore's claim that a week before the effective date\n\nof franchise termination, V.W. was obligated by the franchise\n\nagreement and by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 4(c)(8), to give full\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fconsideration   to   the   intending     buyer   as   an   applicant   for   a\n\ndealership, which if favorable would supposedly have satisfied the\n\ncondition on which the purchase-sale agreement was hinged.                   In\n\nawarding summary judgement to V.W., the district court held that no\n\nobligation to consider the buyer ever arose under the terms of the\n\ncontract or the statute, because the duty to consider was premised\n\non South Shore's possession of a franchise that could be sold,\n\nwhereas by the week before the termination date the franchise\n\nagreement was no longer in full force and effect and consequently\n\nthe franchise could not be conveyed.\n\n     In pursuing de novo review in this court, Wilson v. Moulison\n\nN. Corp., 639 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2011), South Shore has abandoned\n\nits waiver theory, and argues instead that the district court was\n\nin error to rest on the notion of a diminished franchise right as\n\nnegating V.W.'s obligation to consider a franchise application by\n\nthe buyer.   South Shore says it was not purporting to transfer the\n\nfranchise, but was instead attempting to sell its assets and\n\ninventory during the period within which, it claims, the franchise\n\nagreement was in full effect and it was statutorily entitled to\n\nattempt to \"cure\" the otherwise good cause to terminate.\n\n     This appeal can be resolved fairly simply on V.W.'s argument\n\nthat its obligation under the franchise agreement to consider a\n\nbuyer at South Shore's behest did not extend to a buyer proposed a\n\nweek before the scheduled termination of the franchise itself.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fThis route to decision necessarily clears several hurdles that\n\nSouth Shore stresses at some length.              First, South Shore claims\n\nthat an injunction against terminating the franchise during the\n\npendency of litigation as authorized by § 5(g) of the statute\n\nrequired V.W. to respect South Shore's contract rights (such as\n\nrequiring consideration of a buyer's application for franchise) as\n\nif the parties were dealing without imminent termination.                 However\n\nthat may be, the short answer is that South Shore's request for an\n\ninjunction    under    §    5(g)   was   never   ruled    upon,   since     it   was\n\nsuperceded by the parties' agreement for an injunction on terms to\n\nwhich the parties assented.          Those terms provided that consent to\n\nenter the order was not to be taken as waiving V.W.'s position that\n\nthe franchise agreement had already terminated, or as an extension\n\nor renewal of that agreement. If, then, V.W.'s litigating position\n\nwas sound (as we hold it was), it was unaffected by the consensual\n\ninjunction.\n\n     Second,    we    see   nothing      potentially     dispositive   in    South\n\nShore's argument that its statutory right to a reasonable time to\n\ncure any material breach amounting to good cause to terminate\n\nextended to a right to demand V.W.'s active consideration of a\n\nbuyer with good bank credit so long as it requested this before the\n\nmoment   of   franchise      termination.        The   argument   confuses       two\n\ndistinct rights.      The statutory right to cure within a reasonable\n\ntime, § 5(h), applies by definition to the act of breach, losing\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\finventory financing.   South Shore never succeeded in getting new\n\ncredit and has never claimed that it did.   V.W.'s acceptance of a\n\nproposed buyer by awarding a new franchise would not have cured the\n\nbreach but would have obligated South Shore to terminate its own\n\nfranchise agreement voluntarily in accordance with its terms.\n\nTerminating the franchise would have ended the period of the\n\nbreach, but not by curing it.\n\n     Finally, it does not matter whether the district court was on\n\nsound ground when it reasoned that the purchase-sale agreement\n\nfailed to trigger an obligation on V.W.'s part to consider the\n\nbuyer's franchise application because at the moment of South\n\nShore's demand the franchise was no longer in full force, and South\n\nShore was therefore attempting to \"assign\" what it \"no longer\n\nowned.\"   South Shore Imported Cars, Inc. v. Volkswagen of America,\n\nInc., No. 09-11570, 2010 WL 1137558, at * 6 (D. Mass. March 22,\n\n2010).    For even if the sales contract was not an attempted\n\nassignment of the franchise (as by its inclusion of intangibles),\n\nand even if any such purported assignment was at odds with the\n\nfranchise agreement, South Shore still has its claim that V.W. was\n\nbound by statute to honor its contractual obligation to give good\n\nfaith consideration to a franchise application by a proposed buyer,\n\nand for reasons given in V.W.'s brief we are satisfied that this\n\nclaim misconstrues the contract.\n\n     Quite simply, V.W.'s contractual obligation to consider the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fapplication of the franchise's intending buyer cannot be applied to\n\nSouth Shore's request a week before termination, because both by\n\nstatute and by contract, V.W. had the right to a longer period to\n\nmake due diligence enquiries about the buyer than the remaining\n\nperiod of the franchise.       The statute gives V.W. at least 30 and up\n\nto 60 days to decide on the buyer's application, § 4(e)(8), and the\n\nfranchise agreement provides for 45.          South Shore is thus claiming\n\nthat V.W. must exercise due diligence and come to a decision (or be\n\nbound by a default approval under § 4(e)(8)) beyond the effective\n\nperiod of the franchise agreement.\n\n     South Shore has two answers to this objection.             The first is\n\nto emphasize that the agreement obligates V.W. to give good faith\n\nconsideration to any buyer proposed by South Shore \"during the term\n\nof this agreement,\" which it in effect says must mean that V.W. is\n\nobliged   to   consider   an   eleventh-hour      application    even   if   it\n\nrequires action beyond the stated termination date.             We think this\n\nis an unlikely reading, however, in light of the further provision\n\nin the next subsection of the agreement that if a manufacturer does\n\napprove such an application, \"[u]pon the consummation of Dealer's\n\napproved proposal, Dealer will deliver to [V.W.] a voluntary\n\ntermination of this Agreement.\"            But in circumstances like those\n\nhere, a voluntary termination would be superfluous.             Even on South\n\nShore's view, the termination for unremedied good cause would be\n\npostponed only until V.W. made a decision (in fact or by default),\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fafter which the prior dealer would have no franchise under the\n\nagreement that it could terminate voluntarily. Since contracts are\n\nto be read as a whole, the reasonable reading of the agreement is\n\nthat V.W. must consider a dealer's proposed successor only when the\n\nremaining duration of the agreement includes sufficient time for\n\nthe period of enquiry by the manufacturer that the statute and\n\nagreement allow.\n\n     South Shore has pointed to nothing in the statute specifically\n\ninconsistent with this reading,1 but it does argue that if such a\n\nreading is accepted, \"nothing would prevent a manufacturer from\n\nsimply sending a notice of termination to deliberately thwart and\n\ndelay a dealer from selling its dealership assets to a third-party\n\nbuyer.\" But, as is already apparent, there is much to prevent such\n\na ploy:   § 5(a) requires good cause for a termination and forbids\n\nbad faith and arbitrary or unconscionable action.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because no injunction under § 5(g) of the statute was issued\nin this case, we intimate nothing about whether such an injunction\nwould require a different result.\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

For even if the sales contract was not an attempted\n\nassignment of the franchise (as by its inclusion of intangibles),\n\nand even if any such purported assignment was at odds with the\n\nfranchise agreement, South Shore still has its claim that V.W. was\n\nbound by statute to honor its contractual obligation to give good\n\nfaith consideration to a franchise application by a proposed buyer,\n\nand for reasons given in V.W.'s brief we are satisfied that this\n\nclaim misconstrues the contract.\n\n     Quite simply, V.W.'s contractual obligation to consider the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fapplication of the franchise's intending buyer cannot be applied to\n\nSouth Shore's request a week before termination, because both by\n\nstatute and by contract, V.W. had the right to a longer period to\n\nmake due diligence enquiries about the buyer than the remaining\n\nperiod of the franchise.       The statute gives V.W. at least 30 and up\n\nto 60 days to decide on the buyer's application, § 4(e)(8), and the\n\nfranchise agreement provides for 45.          South Shore is thus claiming\n\nthat V.W. must exercise due diligence and come to a decision (or be\n\nbound by a default approval under § 4(e)(8)) beyond the effective\n\nperiod of the franchise agreement.\n\n     South Shore has two answers to this objection.             The first is\n\nto emphasize that the agreement obligates V.W. to give good faith\n\nconsideration to any buyer proposed by South Shore \"during the term\n\nof this agreement,\" which it in effect says must mean that V.W. is\n\nobliged   to   consider   an   eleventh-hour      application    even   if   it\n\nrequires action beyond the stated termination date.             We think this\n\nis an unlikely reading, however, in light of the further provision\n\nin the next subsection of the agreement that if a manufacturer does\n\napprove such an application, \"[u]pon the consummation of Dealer's\n\napproved proposal, Dealer will deliver to [V.W.] a voluntary\n\ntermination of this Agreement.\"            But in circumstances like those\n\nhere, a voluntary termination would be superfluous.             Even on South\n\nShore's view, the termination for unremedied good cause would be\n\npostponed only until V.W. made a decision (in fact or by default),\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fafter which the prior dealer would have no franchise under the\n\nagreement that it could terminate voluntarily. Since contracts are\n\nto be read as a whole, the reasonable reading of the agreement is\n\nthat V.W. must consider a dealer's proposed successor only when the\n\nremaining duration of the agreement includes sufficient time for\n\nthe period of enquiry by the manufacturer that the statute and\n\nagreement allow.\n\n     South Shore has pointed to nothing in the statute specifically\n\ninconsistent with this reading,1 but it does argue that if such a\n\nreading is accepted, \"nothing would prevent a manufacturer from\n\nsimply sending a notice of termination to deliberately thwart and\n\ndelay a dealer from selling its dealership assets to a third-party\n\nbuyer.\" But, as is already apparent, there is much to prevent such\n\na ploy:   § 5(a) requires good cause for a termination and forbids\n\nbad faith and arbitrary or unconscionable action.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because no injunction under § 5(g) of the statute was issued\nin this case, we intimate nothing about whether such an injunction\nwould require a different result.\n\n                                -8-\n\f</pre>",
