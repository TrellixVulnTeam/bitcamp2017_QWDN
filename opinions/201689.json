The redactions in this published\nversion, indicated by double brackets, are intended to make public\nthe court's legal rulings while protecting grand jury secrecy and\nrelated interests. See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena, Judith\nMiller, 397 F.3d 964, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 2005); In re Lindsey, 148\nF.3d 1100 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n\f          BOUDIN,    Chief   Judge.       This   case    presents     important\n\nquestions involving grand jury operations and the attorney-client\n\nprivilege.   Because the grand jury investigation is ongoing, our\n\ndiscussion omits a certain amount of detail and by a separate order\n\nthe decision is being sealed.      However, the court anticipates that\n\nan expurgated version of the opinion or summary of the key legal\n\nrulings will be published in due course.\n\n          Background.      In the course of a grand jury investigation\n\nin [[    ]], a lawyer (Lawyer I) directed his client (\"Client A\")\n\nto commit perjury in testifying before the grand jury, after\n\ninitially advising him to tell the truth.         The same lawyer has also\n\nrepresented another client (\"Client B\") who might or might not have\n\nsome connection with the earlier perjury.              In [[      ]], Lawyer I\n\ntold Client A to recant the false testimony.            Lawyer I did so after\n\nconsulting with Lawyer II, who represented [[                  ]] other clients\n\n(collectively \"Group C\") variously connected with Client B and with\n\npertinent events.\n\n          Learning    of     the   perjury,      the    government     is   now\n\ninvestigating the possible involvement of others with that perjury\n\nand with other possible crimes.       The present grand jury summoned\n\nLawyer I, and the prosecutor sought to question him about the prior\n\nperjury of Client A including the involvement of others with that\n\nperjury and its subornation.       Lawyer I refused to answer a number\n\nof these questions, saying that answering them would invade Client\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fB's   attorney-client      privilege     and     the    joint-defense       privilege\n\nenjoyed by the Group C clients.\n\n            That questions to Lawyer I might invade the privilege of\n\nClient B is clear but the Group C clients are not represented by\n\nLawyer I but by Lawyer II who practices independently. However, it\n\nwas Lawyer I's position, not contested by the government at this\n\nstage, that the two lawyers at the relevant times had a joint-\n\ndefense    arrangement     which     allowed      them,    without     waiving      the\n\nattorney-client    privilege,       to   exchange        confidences    that      their\n\nrespective clients may have confided to them separately.\n\n            Eventually the government moved to compel Lawyer I to\n\nanswer    the   disputed       questions,      arguing    that   the    crime-fraud\n\nexception defeated the claim of privilege as to both Client B and\n\nthe Group C clients.       Upon Lawyer I’s request, the court notified\n\nClient B’s current counsel--unaffiliated with Lawyer I--and counsel\n\nfor each of the Group C clients; [[                                         ]].\n\n            At the government’s behest, the district court also\n\ndirected Lawyer I not to reveal to anyone (other than his own\n\ncounsel) the “substance of the government’s motion to compel”--an\n\norder the government thought essential to protect against the risk\n\nthat Lawyer I might affect or influence other potential grand jury\n\nwitnesses.      Client     B    objected    that       under   Fed.    R.   Crim.    P.\n\n6(e)(2)(A), Lawyer I could not be barred from disclosing to Client\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fB or anyone else what he (Lawyer I) learned as a grand jury witness\n\nor elsewhere.\n\n          Current counsel for two [[                  ]] Group C clients\n\nalso objected to the motion to compel.           Lawyer II provided an\n\naffidavit describing his representation of the Group C clients; in\n\naddition to other details about his consultations with Lawyer I, he\n\nsaid that incident to their joint defense arrangement he had\n\ndisclosed to Lawyer I confidential information received from at\n\nleast one of the Group C clients.\n\n          The    district   court   held   several   hearings   and   heard\n\narguments as to whether or not the privilege was abrogated.            The\n\ngovernment also made two ex parte filings whose contents were not\n\nmade known to opposing counsel; a redacted version of one of the\n\nfilings was, however, supplied to opposing counsel.        Such ex parte\n\nsubmissions, although surprising to those unacquainted with the\n\npractice, have precedent in certain contexts including grand jury\n\nmatters and privilege claims.       See In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n\n(Violette), 183 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The court also considered the government’s request that\n\nit engage in a limited type of in camera inquiry suggested as a\n\npossibility by the Supreme Court in United States v. Zolin, 491\n\nU.S. 554 (1989).       In such an inquiry the judge may examine\n\nprivileged material itself to determine whether it is or remains\n\nprivileged.     The district judge expressed reservations about his\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcapacity, given the complexities of the background events, to\n\nconduct such a limited inquiry which would involve the judge in\n\nquestioning Lawyer I and not merely reviewing documents. In the\n\nend, the government chose to rest on what it already adduced and\n\nabandoned its request for an in camera inquiry under Zolin.\n\n             Thereafter, in March 2004, the district court granted the\n\ngovernment's motion to compel answers to the government's listed\n\nquestions.    Requests by Client B and one of the Group C clients to\n\nallow their lawyers to interview Lawyer I about the underlying\n\nevents were denied.       The objecting clients then sought access to\n\nall of the filings made so far in the district court, including the\n\ngovernment's ex parte filings. This too was denied in October 2004\n\nwhen   the   district     court   issued    a   memorandum   explaining   its\n\ndecisions in more detail.\n\n             In   the   October   2004   memorandum,   the   district   judge\n\nexplained his reasons for concluding that the crime-fraud exception\n\napplied.     The judge said he was satisfied that the government had\n\nmade a \"prima facie showing\" not only of Lawyer I's corruption but\n\nalso, [[                     ]], of\n\n             a shared intent by the Clients--when making\n             the communications the government seeks to\n             discover--to    use   otherwise   privileged\n             attorney-client communications to facilitate\n             corruption and frustration of the grand jury\n             inquiry.\n\nThe district judge stressed that he was not finding that any of the\n\nclients had in fact corruptly communicated with counsel.            He only\n\n                                      -5-\n\ffound enough of a likelihood had been established to justify\n\ncompelling Lawyer I's answers--albeit \"limited only to those lines\n\nof inquiry\" identified by the government.\n\n          The   district   court    expressed   discomfort   with   the\n\ngovernment's bypassing of the Zolin in camera inquiry, warning that\n\nthis might result in a remand.           The court also explained its\n\nreasons for concluding that the court had authority to forbid\n\nLawyer I from disclosing to anyone, including Lawyer II and to\n\nClient B and the Group C clients, what he had been asked in the\n\ngrand jury or other information pertaining to “the subject matter”\n\nof the grand jury inquiry.\n\n          On this appeal, Client B and the Group C clients, as the\n\nalleged privilege holders, have attacked the prima facie standard\n\nadopted by the district court and, in the alternative, argued that\n\neven this allegedly too lenient standard has not been met.      Client\n\nB also urges that the government and district court were obliged to\n\nfollow the Zolin in camera procedure.        Finally, the clients say\n\nthat the non-disclosure order to Lawyer I was barred by Fed R.\n\nCrim. P. 6(e)(2) and that it was overly broad as well.\n\n          The customary standard of review in cases of privilege is\n\nthat strictly legal questions are reviewed de novo, raw fact\n\nfindings are reviewed for clear error, and the application of legal\n\nstandards to specific facts with a measure of deference.            See\n\nCavallaro v. United States, 284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fUnited States v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 129 F.3d 681, 683 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).1   We begin with the privilege question, which involves both\n\nlaw and law-application issues, and then return to the Rule 6 issue\n\nwhich presents solely a question of law.\n\n           Privilege.      Familiarly, the attorney-client privilege--\n\nsomewhat simplified--is a privilege of a client to refuse to\n\ntestify   or   to   have   his   counsel    testify     as   to    confidential\n\ncommunications      between   the   two    made   in   connection     with   the\n\nrendering of legal representation, see Cavallaro, 284 F.3d at 245;\n\nsee also Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403 (1976); 8\n\nWigmore, Evidence § 2292 (McNaughton rev. 1961).                  It extends as\n\nwell to communications made within the framework of a joint defense\n\narrangement.     In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 274 F.3d 563, 572 (1st\n\nCir. 2001);    United States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hosp. Rental\n\nServ., Inc., 874 F.2d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           The crime-fraud exception–-one of several qualifications\n\nto the attorney-client privilege–-withdraws protection where the\n\nclient sought or employed legal representation in order to commit\n\nor facilitate a crime or fraud. Specifically, courts have required\n\nthe privilege challenger to present evidence: “(1) that the client\n\n\n\n     1\n      The decisions, e.g., Violette, sometimes say that privilege\ndeterminations are reviewed for abuse of discretion, but this is\nthe \"umbrella\" usage of the phrase by which, for example, an\nabstract error of law–-certainly not reviewed deferentially–-is\ndescribed as one kind of abuse of discretion. E.g., Cooter & Gell\nv. Hartmark Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 402 (1990).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwas engag[ed] in (or was planning) criminal or fraudulent activity\n\nwhen the attorney-client communications took place; and (2) that\n\nthe communications were intended by the client to facilitate or\n\nconceal the criminal or fraudulent activity.”     Violette, 183 F.3d\n\nat 75.2\n\n          Like the privilege itself, the exception, where employed\n\nin a federal criminal case, is effectively a creature of federal\n\ncommon law.   See Fed. R. Evid. 501.   This means that federal judges\n\nstart with a core of common precedent reflecting the privilege but\n\nalso have power to refine and adjust both the substance and\n\nprocedure in light of reason and experience.     See Zolin, 491 U.S.\n\nat 562-63; Violette, 183 F.3d at 77-78. The process of development\n\nis far from over.\n\n          It is often hard to determine whether the attorney-client\n\nrelationship has been misused by the client for crime or fraud\n\nwithout seeing the document, or hearing the testimony, as to which\n\nthe privilege is claimed.    To overcome this problem (as well as\n\nother privilege problems) judges have sometimes been willing to\n\nreview privileged materials by themselves in camera and then decide\n\nwhether the other side is entitled to it.        See, e.g.,   United\n\nStates v. Jacobs, 117 F.3d 82, 87 (2d Cir. 1997).        The Supreme\n\nCourt has blessed this procedure in Zolin.      491 U.S. at 572; see\n\n\n     2\n      See generally United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 106 (1st\nCir.), cert. denied 528 U.S. 872 (1999); United States v. Rakes,\n136 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                -8-\n\falso Edgar v. United States, 82 F.3d 499, 509 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied 519 U.S. 870 (1996).\n\n              Zolin also said that a “lesser evidentiary showing” is\n\nneeded for in camera review than is needed finally to pierce the\n\nprivilege, and that upon this showing whether to conduct in camera\n\nreview is within the trial court’s discretion.      491 U.S. at 572.3\n\nFor such a review, all that was needed was a factual basis “to\n\nsupport a good-faith belief by a reasonable person” that “in camera\n\nreview of the materials may reveal evidence to establish the claim\n\nthat the crime-fraud exception applies.\"      Id. (internal quotation\n\nmark omitted).     \"May\" is a very relaxed test and, as only the judge\n\ngets this initial access, properly so.\n\n              However, Zolin did not answer the question of what level\n\nof proof is needed to pierce the privilege itself, 491 U.S. at 563,\n\nalthough it acknowledged that the statement in Clark v. United\n\nStates, 289 U.S. 1, 14 (1933), that a “prima facie case” was the\n\nneeded showing “has caused some confusion.” Zolin, 491 U.S. at 563\n\nn.7.       In our own case, the district court found a prima facie\n\nshowing had been established, but cautiously did not further\n\nexplain what this meant.      We share its caution but are obliged to\n\nattempt refinement.\n\n\n       3\n      Despite Zolin’s mention of discretion, conceivably on some\nfacts a district court might abuse its discretion by declining to\nconduct an in camera review prior to piercing the privilege. But\na categorical rule would be unwise and Client B has not argued for\none.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f          \"Prima facie\" is among the most rubbery of all legal\n\nphrases; it usually means little more than a showing of whatever is\n\nrequired to permit some inferential leap sufficient to reach a\n\nparticular outcome.    Black’s Law Dictionary 1228 (8th ed. 2004);\n\ne.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).\n\nHere, the outcome is piercing the privilege based on a certain\n\nlevel of proof.   This circuit has previously avoided a calibration\n\nof that level, Violette, 183 F.3d at 78, as has the Supreme Court,\n\nZolin, 491 U.S. at 563, but it is important in this case as to one\n\nclient.\n\n          As we read the consensus of precedent in the circuits, it\n\nis enough to overcome the privilege that there is a reasonable\n\nbasis to believe that the lawyer's services were used by the client\n\nto foster a crime or fraud.4      The circuits--although divided on\n\narticulation   and    on   some   important   practical   details--all\n\neffectively allow piercing of the privilege on something less than\n\na mathematical (more likely than not) probability that the client\n\nintended to use the attorney in furtherance of a crime or fraud.\n\n     4\n      A \"probable\" or \"reasonable\" cause standard is used in the\nSecond, Sixth and Ninth Circuits. Jacobs, 117 F.3d at 87; In re\nGrand Jury Proceedings, 87 F.3d 377, 381 (9th Cir.), cert. denied\n519 U.S. 945 (1996); In re Antitrust Grand Jury, 805 F.2d 155, 165-\n66 (6th Cir. 1986). The Third Circuit requires \"evidence which, if\nbelieved by the fact-finder, would be sufficient to support a\nfinding that the elements of the crime-fraud exception were met,”\nHaines v. Liggett Group Inc., 975 F.2d 81, 95-96 (3d Cir. 1992);\naccord, In re Sealed Case, 754 F.2d 395, 399 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The\nThird and D.C. Circuits have described their standard as similar to\n“probable cause.” Haines, 975 F.2d at 95; In re Sealed Case, 754\nF.2d at 399 n.3.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fThis is a compromise based on policy but so is the existence and\n\nmeasure of the privilege itself.\n\n            Precisely       because     of   the   initial    barrier    of     the\n\nprivilege, it is very hard for an adversary unaided to show that\n\nthe privileged communications were themselves corrupt, so the\n\nrequirements for access cannot be set too high.                      And, if the\n\ncommunications were innocent, the initial look may often not damage\n\nthe client.        In all events, the reasonable cause standard is\n\nintended    to    be   reasonably     demanding;    neither   speculation       nor\n\nevidence that shows only a distant likelihood of corruption is\n\nenough.\n\n            In addition, the privilege is not lost solely because the\n\nclient’s lawyer is corrupt–-as was certainly true in this case\n\nsince the lawyer suborned Client A’s perjury. The crime-fraud\n\nexception    requires       the   client’s     engagement     in     criminal    or\n\nfraudulent       activity   and   the   client’s    intent    with    respect    to\n\nattorney-client communications.              Violette, 183 F.3d at 75, 79.\n\nAccord, In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 144 F.3d 653, 660 (10th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied 525 U.S. 966 (1998); In re Sealed Case, 107 F.3d 46,\n\n49 (D.C. Cir. 1997).        If there are contrary views,5 we do not think\n\nthat they comport with the modern view of the privilege’s nature\n\n     5\n      In re Impounded Case (Law Firm), 879 F.2d. 1211, 1213-14 (3d\nCir. 1989), cited by the government, says that the crime-fraud\nexception may apply even where “pertinent alleged criminality is\nsolely that of the law firm,” but it is unclear in the context of\nthat case whether the court intended that this showing would\nforfeit the privilege of an innocent client.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fand purpose as explained in      Upjohn v. United States, 449 U.S. 383,\n\n389 (1981).\n\n           An additional limitation on piercing is that it is not\n\nenough to find reasonable cause to believe that the client is\n\nguilty of crime or fraud. Forfeiture of the privilege requires the\n\nclient's use or aim to use the lawyer to foster the crime or the\n\nfraud.   As   Rakes explained:\n\n           No general rule withdraws the privilege from\n           communications that occur in the same time\n           frame as criminal [conduct]. . . .      [T]he\n           attorney-client privilege is forfeited inter\n           alia where the client sought the services of\n           the lawyer to enable or aid the client to\n           commit what the client knew or reasonably\n           should have known to be a crime or fraud.\n\n136 F.3d at 4.\n\n           Here, we are satisfied that the reasonable cause standard\n\nis satisfied as to Client B.       [[                               ]]\n\n           Our assessment, like that of the district judge, is\n\npreliminary, reflects no finding that Client B acted wrongfully,\n\nand is limited solely to the issue whether there is reasonable\n\ncause adequate to pierce Client B’s privilege.           The compelled\n\ntestimony of Lawyer I (or other evidence) could turn out to\n\nvindicate Client B entirely and inculpate someone (or no one) else.\n\nThe prima facie case is sometimes assumed to destroy the privilege\n\nonce and for all once the opponent gains access to the material\n\n(which is one reason for the Zolin procedure).     We think that there\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fmay well be room for protective remedies if the privilege is\n\ninitially pierced but this turns out to have been in error.\n\n           It should be noted, finally, that the district court’s\n\ninitial proposal to examine Lawyer I in camera was not a finding\n\nthat the government had met only the lower threshold under Zolin\n\nand therefore could only proceed to issue its motion to compel\n\nafter acquiring additional inculpatory evidence obtained in camera.\n\nIn its October 2004 decision, the district court made quite clear\n\nthat the government had fully met its prima facie burden needed to\n\novercome Client B’s privilege, and it is this conclusion that we\n\naffirm.\n\n           The more difficult problem concerns the Group C clients.\n\nThere is scant evidence that these clients' purpose in retaining\n\nLawyer II was to use his services in furtherance of a crime or\n\nfraud.    True, the district judge made a finding (quoted above) of\n\na “shared intent” to “use otherwise privileged attorney-client\n\ncommunications to facilitate corruption and frustration of the\n\ngrand jury inquiry.”     But his decision points to no facts to\n\nbuttress this finding, nor--more ominously since the government\n\ncertainly should know--is any such raw-fact evidence identified in\n\nthe government’s briefs.\n\n           It is not enough that the lawyer’s work posed an obstacle\n\nto the grand jury; perfectly legitimate representation may do this.\n\n[[                  ]]   To pierce the privilege requires that the\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fclients have an intent to misuse their legal representation (e.g.,\n\nby   enlisting     the    lawyer’s    advice      to   frame   their    perjury)    to\n\nperpetrate the crime or fraud.               Violette, 183 F.3d at 75.             Such\n\nevidence may exist as to Group C but it has not yet been furnished.\n\n             The government relies upon In re Sealed Case, 754 F.2d at\n\n399-402,     where   a     client’s       document     destruction      incident    to\n\nlitigation     was       treated     as     undercutting       the    privilege     of\n\ncommunications between it and its lawyers in that litigation.                      But\n\nthere, the attorneys represented the client in the very litigation\n\nfor which evidence had been destroyed, and in hearings in which the\n\nclient sought to prevent exposure of the destruction, in the course\n\nof   which    they       filed     false     documents     and       verified   their\n\nauthenticity.      Id. at 400, 402.         The lawyers were thus justifiably\n\ncharacterized as “instrumentalities in the ongoing cover-up.”                       Id.\n\nat 402.    In this case, no such misuse of Lawyer II is shown.\n\n             Now that Client B’s privilege has been pierced, some of\n\nwhat the government seeks can conceivably be obtained by questions\n\ndirected to Lawyer I tailored to avoid disclosures that would\n\ninvade     Group     C’s    privilege;        arguably     Lawyer       I-Client     B\n\nconversations can be reached regardless of what information Lawyer\n\nI passed on to the Group C clients.                    How far Lawyer I may be\n\nquestioned about the source of the information--if it came from\n\n\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\fLawyer II or the Group C clients--may be more debatable.                             Other\n\ndifficult questions may also arise.6\n\n                 The government also remains free to ask the district\n\ncourt       to   make    an   in    camera     inquiry    under    Zolin       directed    to\n\novercoming         the   Group      C    clients’     privilege.         The    government\n\nabandoned this quest when it apparently judged that the district\n\ncourt might side with it anyway.                  Nothing prevents the prosecutor\n\nfrom        pursuing     this      route,     either     before    or    after     further\n\nquestioning of Lawyer I, if the district judge is willing to follow\n\nit.     It is for the district court to say whether the low Zolin\n\nstandard         would   warrant        in   camera   questioning       of   the   Group    C\n\nclients.\n\n                 The non-disclosure order.               When in December 2003 the\n\ndistrict court gave notice of the government's motion to compel, it\n\nincluded a protective order directing Lawyer I and his counsel that\n\n“the substance” of the motion to compel should not be further\n\ndisclosed or discussed with any third parties (including Client B,\n\nClient B’s current attorney, Lawyer II or the Group C clients).                            In\n\nits October 2004 memorandum, the district court added that it would\n\ncontinue prohibiting Lawyer I “from discussing the subject matter\n\n\n        6\n      An example is the extent to which–-once Client B’s privilege\nis pierced–-Lawyer I may be made to testify about whether he\nconveyed these clients’ information to Lawyer II. See, e.g., In re\nGrand Jury Subpoena, 274 F.3d 563, 572 (1st Cir. 2001) (“Even when\n[the joint-defense privilege] applies, however, a party always\nremains free to disclose his own communications.”); United States\nv. Agnello, 135 F. Supp. 2d 380, 383 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (same).\n\n                                              -15-\n\fof his grand jury [testimony] with anyone other than his own\n\ncounsel.”\n\n            Together, Client B and the Group C clients urge that the\n\norder is inconsistent with Rule 6(e), is in any event over-broad,\n\nand   violates   the    First   Amendment.     Client    B,     in   particular,\n\ncomplains that Lawyer I’s counsel interpreted the order to extend\n\nbeyond “matter[s] occurring before the grand jury” to preclude\n\nLawyer I from discussing not only what he was asked but also his\n\nrecollection     of    the   underlying   events   in   which    Lawyer   I   was\n\ninvolved.    These include Lawyer I's original subornation and his\n\nlater turn-about advice that Client A recant.\n\n            These past events are matters assuredly of interest to\n\nClient B, given government suspicions of him.            Moreover, as Lawyer\n\nI represented Client B at the time of the subornation, the latter\n\ncertainly has special reason to want to know what his erstwhile\n\nlawyer recalls about those events.7          In the district court, Client\n\nB unsuccessfully sought to clarify and narrow the order and he now\n\nsays that the district court has implicitly confirmed Lawyer I’s\n\ncounsel’s reading.       Whether or not the district court so intended,\n\nthe government does not dispute that the protective order is\n\nintended to have this breadth.\n\n      7\n      The government has not contested standing and quite arguably\nthese interests are enough to give Client B standing to challenge\nthe existence and scope of the secrecy order.       But cf. In re\nSwearingen Aviation Corp., 605 F.2d 125, 126-27 (4th Cir. 1979)\n(rejecting challenge to secrecy order by non-witnesses on grounds\nthat secrecy was meant to benefit witnesses).\n\n                                     -16-\n\f             There are several layers of argument to be peeled away.\n\nThe first is the clients' claim that Rule 6(e) by itself bars the\n\nimposition of any secrecy order on Lawyer I.           Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n6(e)(2)(B) lists categories of persons (e.g., grand jurors and\n\ncourt reporters) who \"must not disclose a matter occurring before\n\nthe grand jury,\" subject to certain exceptions in subsection\n\n6(e)(3). But 6(e)(2)(B) is preceded by subsection 6(e)(2)(A) which\n\nprovides: \"No obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person\n\nexcept in accordance with Rule 6(e)(2)(B).\"\n\n             Witnesses are not listed in Rule 6(e)(2)(B), nor does\n\nLawyer I fall into any of the listed categories of persons who\n\n\"must not\" disclose grand jury matters.        Pertinently the original\n\nadvisory committee note says that \"[t]he rule does not impose any\n\nobligation of secrecy on witnesses\" and, although some districts\n\ndid so prior to the rule, a \"seal of secrecy on witnesses seems an\n\nunnecessary hardship and may lead to injustice if a witness is not\n\npermitted to make a disclosure to counsel or to an associate.\"\n\nRule 6 Advisory Committee Notes, 1944 Note to Subdivision (e).\n\n             At first blush this appears to be a strong argument for\n\nthe   appellants,   but   several   courts   have   read   the   rule   more\n\nnarrowly.8    These decisions take Rule 6(e)(2)(A) to set a default\n\n      8\n      E.g., In re Subpoena To Testify Before Grand Jury Directed to\nCustodian of Records, 864 F.2d 1559, 1563-64 (11th Cir. 1989); In\nre Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, 797 F.2d 676, 680 (8th Cir.),\ncert. dismissed 479 U.S. 1013 (1986). But see United States v.\nRadetsky, 535 F.2d 556, 569 (10th Cir.), cert. denied 429 U.S. 820\n(1976), overruled in part on other grounds by United States v.\n\n                                    -17-\n\frule of permitting disclosure by witnesses absent a contrary order\n\nby the court in that proceeding, but also to leave open the\n\npossibility    of   restrictions    where    they    can   be   justified   by\n\nparticular and compelling circumstances.             See In re Grand Jury\n\nProceedings, 814 F.2d 61, 69 (1st Cir. 1987) (collecting cases but\n\nnot deciding the issue).\n\n            We now decide that the rule’s phrasing can, and should,\n\naccommodate rare exceptions premised on inherent judicial power.\n\nAbsent restriction, courts have inherent power, subject to the\n\nConstitution    and   federal    statutes,   to     impose    secrecy   orders\n\nincident to matters occurring before them.            The general power is\n\nregularly     expressed   in    orders   limiting    access     to   discovery\n\nmaterials, closing sensitive proceedings, and in other contexts.\n\nSometimes these powers are reflected in or reconfirmed by rules,\n\ne.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c), but orders of this kind predated such\n\nrules which ordinarily reflect or refine the underlying authority\n\nwithout displacing it.9\n\n\n\n\nDaily, 921 F.2d 994, 1004 & n.11 (10th Cir. 1990).\n     9\n      See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 42-50 (1991)\n(sanctions rules do not displace courts’ inherent authority);\nUnited States v. Aisenberg, 358 F.3d 1327, 1347 (11th Cir.), cert.\ndenied 125 S. Ct. 276 (2004) (“Although Rule 6(e)(3) enumerates the\nexceptions to the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy . . . the\ndistrict courts have inherent power beyond the literal wording of\nRule 6(e)(3) to disclose grand jury material . . . .”); Matter of\nSpecial March 1981 Grand Jury, 753 F.2d 575, 577 (7th Cir. 1985)\n(court has inherent power to cure improvident disclosure).\n\n                                    -18-\n\f          Those   who    drafted    and    approved   Rule   6(e)   seemingly\n\nintended to do no more than abolish a general practice existing in\n\nsome districts of automatically silencing grand jury witnesses as\n\nto their testimony.     The advisory note says that the rule “does not\n\nimpose” secrecy obligations and does not say that it prohibits such\n\nobligations made by appropriate order.          There is no indication in\n\nthe history of an intent to cut off the courts’ power to restrict\n\ndisclosure based on extraordinary circumstances.             Cf. Aisenberg,\n\n358 F.3d at 1347.\n\n          In this case, we are not dealing with an ordinary grand\n\njury witness.   Lawyer I confessedly suborned perjury of a witness\n\nin a related grand jury proceeding and is connected to certain\n\nunderlying events that may have comprised an effort to frustrate a\n\ngrand jury investigation.          Further, disclosure of what is now\n\nhappening in the present grand jury could help Client B (whose own\n\nprivilege has been pierced under the crime-fraud exception) and the\n\nGroup C clients [[                   ]] coordinate their own testimony.\n\n          Rule 6(e)(2)(A) was not directed to such a situation nor\n\ndoes the First Amendment bar an appropriately tailored order.             The\n\ninterest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings during their\n\npendency has been treated with great respect by the courts.10             The\n\n\n\n     10\n       See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 223 F.3d 213, 218-19\n(3d Cir. 2000); In re Subpoena To Testify, 864 F.2d at 1564; see\nalso 2 Beale et al., Grand Jury Law and Practice § 9:19 (2d ed.\n1997).\n\n                                    -19-\n\fpresent ban is concerned with protecting an ongoing grand jury\n\ninvestigation    from     further     abuse    by   one    who   has   already\n\ndemonstrated     a     capacity     and   intention       to   frustrate   the\n\ninvestigation.       The restriction as to only one witness is planted\n\nin an adequate showing of special need.\n\n           Our circumstances are far away from the only Supreme\n\nCourt case invoked by appellants.             In Butterworth v. Smith, 494\n\nU.S. 624, 635-36 (1990), the Supreme Court struck down a Florida\n\nstatute precluding a state grand jury witness from ever disclosing\n\nhis grand jury testimony.         But the grand jury proceeding had long\n\nbeen completed and it was the permanency of the ban that most\n\ntroubled the Supreme Court.          Id. at 632, 635-36.         Lawyer I or\n\nClient B may return to the district court to request a termination\n\nof the ban whenever the need for it has disappeared.\n\n          This takes us to appellants’ claim that the ban, if\n\nsustainable at all, is overly broad.           The ban appears to cover two\n\ndifferent although related subjects.           One is disclosure by Lawyer\n\nI of whatever happens within the grand jury--questions he has been\n\nasked or may be asked, answers he has given or may give, documents\n\nhe may provide or be shown, and the like.             The other is his own\n\nindependent recollection of events about which he may or may not be\n\nasked including discussions or interactions with Clients A and B.\n\n          The former are, strictly speaking, \"matter[s] occurring\n\nbefore a grand jury\" and their revelation poses the most direct\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fthreat   that    the   government's    hand    may   be    disclosed   to    other\n\nwitnesses, enabling them to alter their own answers or coordinate\n\nevasions.       Such revelations are already prohibited for most of\n\nthose    connected     with   the   grand    jury,   and   extension    of    this\n\nlimitation to Lawyer I, based on the special circumstances of this\n\ncase, is justified.\n\n            It is more difficult to sustain a ban on Lawyer I's\n\ndiscussion with his own former client, or with others, about Lawyer\n\nI's independent recollection of previous events outside the grand\n\njury even though they may be matters about which the grand jury has\n\nquestioned or will question him.             In particular, Client B has a\n\nclear interest in preserving the opportunity to find out what his\n\nformer lawyer recollects about Client B's own involvement and the\n\ninteraction.      Nor does such a discussion, if honestly conducted,\n\nreveal the grand jury's plan of attack.\n\n            Of course, any discussion between Lawyer I and anyone\n\nelse of interest to the grand jury presents an opportunity to\n\nconspire and tailor stories.          But that opportunity exists in any\n\nevent; Lawyer I has not been precluded from all contact with his\n\nown former clients or lawyers for Group C clients.                     Nor do we\n\nnormally prevent indicted co-conspirators from discussing their\n\ncases with one another even though in some cases the prospect that\n\nthey will tailor their stories is very real.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f          The district judge has adopted the broad construction of\n\nhis order, if at all, by indirection, and has never provided an\n\nexplicit grounding for extending the order beyond revelation of the\n\nproceedings before the grand jury.           The original notice barred\n\ndisclosure by Lawyer I only of “the substance of the government’s\n\nmotion   to   compel”;   and   the   October    memorandum    ambiguously\n\nprohibited discussion of “the subject matter of [Lawyer I’s] grand\n\njury [omitted word--presumably “testimony”] with anyone.”\n\n          We do not say that a witness could never be precluded\n\nfrom discussing independent recollections; situations involving\n\nnational security are too obvious a concern to encourage general\n\npronouncements.    Instead, finding the ban unclear in scope but\n\nlacking clear justification for the broader reading, we modify the\n\npresent restriction to cover only (in addition to the substance of\n\nthe government's sealed motion) \"matters occurring before the grand\n\njury\" and not independent recollections of the witness about\n\nexternal prior events as to which the witness has been or may be\n\nquestioned.\n\n          There is one further caveat.        It is difficult to foresee\n\nhow events may develop and we are sensitive to the fact that Client\n\nB and to a lesser extent the Group C clients seemingly had a\n\nprotected relationship with Lawyer I.        Our modified affirmance of\n\nthe   order   limiting   disclosure     by    Lawyer   I   rests   on   the\n\nunderstanding that Lawyer I, Client B and the Group C clients\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fremain free at any time to seek relief from the district court for\n\ngood cause shown so as to permit Lawyer I to disclose some or all\n\nof his grand jury testimony to Client B, the Group C clients or\n\nboth.\n\n          Accordingly, the district court's order granting the\n\nmotion to compel is affirmed as to Client B’s privilege but vacated\n\nas to the Group C clients’ privilege (without prejudice to a\n\nfurther showing by the government with respect to them). The order\n\nlimiting disclosure is modified, and as modified affirmed, to apply\n\nonly to the proceedings before the district court on the motion to\n\ncompel and to \"matters occurring before the grand jury\" as that\n\nphrase is customarily employed and as discussed above.   No costs.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f",

Because the grand jury investigation is ongoing, our discussion omits a certain amount of detail and by a separate order the decision is being sealed. However, the court anticipates that an expurgated version of the opinion or summary of the key legal rulings will be published in due course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Background.</i> In the course of a grand jury investigation in [[ ]], a lawyer (Lawyer I) directed his client (\"Client A\") to commit perjury in testifying before the grand jury, after initially advising him to tell the truth. The same lawyer has also represented another client (\"Client B\") who might or might not have some connection with the earlier perjury. In [[ ]], Lawyer I told Client A to recant the false testimony. Lawyer I did so after consulting with Lawyer II, who represented [[ ]] other clients (collectively \"Group C\") variously connected with Client B and with pertinent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Learning of the perjury, the government is now investigating the possible involvement of others with that perjury and with other possible crimes. The present grand jury summoned Lawyer I, and the prosecutor sought to question him about the prior perjury of Client A including the involvement of others with that perjury and its subornation. Lawyer I refused to answer a number of these questions, saying that answering them would invade Client B's attorney-client privilege and the joint-defense privilege enjoyed by the Group C clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That questions to Lawyer I might invade the privilege of Client B is clear but the Group C clients are not represented by Lawyer I but by Lawyer II who practices independently. However, it was Lawyer I's position, not contested by the government at this stage, that the two lawyers at the relevant times had a joint-defense arrangement which allowed them, without waiving the attorney-client privilege, to exchange confidences that their respective clients may have confided to them separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually the government moved to compel Lawyer I to answer the disputed questions, arguing that the crime-fraud exception defeated the claim of privilege as to both Client B and the Group C clients. Upon Lawyer I's request, the court notified Client B's current counsel&#8212;unaffiliated with Lawyer I&#8212;and counsel for each of the Group C clients; [[ ]].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the government's behest, the district court also directed Lawyer I not to reveal to anyone (other than his own counsel) the \"substance of the government's motion to compel\" &#8212; an order the government thought essential to protect against the risk that Lawyer I might affect or influence other potential grand jury witnesses. Client B objected that under Fed. R.Crim.P. 6(e)(2)(A), Lawyer I could not be barred from disclosing to Client B or anyone else what he (Lawyer I) learned as a grand jury witness or elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Current counsel for two [[ ]] Group C clients also objected to the motion to compel. Lawyer II provided an affidavit describing his representation of the Group C clients; in addition to other details about his consultations with Lawyer I, he said that incident to their joint defense arrangement he had disclosed to Lawyer I confidential information received from at least one of the Group C clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held several hearings and heard arguments as to whether or not the privilege was abrogated. The government also made two <i>ex parte</i> filings whose contents were not made known to opposing counsel; a redacted version of one of the filings was, however, supplied to opposing counsel. Such <i>ex parte</i> submissions, although surprising to those unacquainted with the practice, have precedent in certain contexts including grand jury matters and privilege claims. <i>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Violette),</i> 183 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also considered the government's request that it engage in a limited type of <i>in camera</i> inquiry suggested as a possibility by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Zolin,</i> 491 U.S. 554, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989). In such an inquiry the judge may examine privileged material itself to determine whether it is or remains privileged. The district judge expressed reservations about his capacity, given the complexities of the background events, to conduct such a limited inquiry which would involve the judge in questioning Lawyer I and not merely reviewing documents. In the end, the government chose to rest on what it already adduced and abandoned its request for an <i>in camera</i> inquiry under, <i>Zolin.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in March 2004, the district court granted the government's motion to compel answers to the government's listed questions. Requests by Client B and one of the Group C clients to allow their lawyers to interview Lawyer I about the underlying events were denied. The objecting clients then sought access to all of the filings made so far in the district court, including the government's <i>ex parte</i> filings. This too was denied in October 2004 when the district court issued a memorandum explaining its decisions in more detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the October 2004 memorandum, the district judge explained his reasons for concluding that the crime-fraud exception applied. The judge said he was satisfied that the government had made a \"<i>prima facie</i> showing\" not only of Lawyer I's corruption but also, [[ ]], of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a shared intent by the Clients &#8212; when making the communications the government seeks to discover &#8212; to use otherwise privileged attorney-client communications to facilitate corruption and frustration of the grand jury inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge stressed that he was not finding that any of the clients had <i>in fact</i> corruptly communicated with counsel. He only found enough of a likelihood had been established to justify compelling Lawyer I's answers &#8212; albeit \"limited only to those lines of inquiry\" identified by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court expressed discomfort with the government's bypassing of the <i>Zolin in camera</i> inquiry, warning that this might result in a remand. The court also explained its reasons for concluding that the court had authority to forbid Lawyer I from disclosing to anyone, including Lawyer II and to Client B and the Group C clients, what he had been asked in the grand jury or other information pertaining to \"the subject matter\" of the grand jury inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Client B and the Group C clients, as the alleged privilege holders, have attacked the <i>prima facie</i> standard adopted by the district court and, in the alternative, argued that even this allegedly too lenient standard has not been met. Client B also urges that the government and district court were obliged to follow the <i>Zolin in camera</i> procedure. Finally, the clients say that the non-disclosure order to Lawyer I was barred by Fed R.Crim. P. 6(e)(2) and that it was overly broad as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The customary standard of review in cases of privilege is that strictly legal questions are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> raw fact findings are reviewed for clear error, and the application of legal standards to specific facts with a measure of deference. <i>See Cavallaro v. United States,</i> 284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Mass.

Specifically, courts have required the privilege challenger to present evidence: \"(1) that the client was engag[ed] in (or was planning) criminal or fraudulent activity when the attorney-client communications took place; <i>and</i> (2) that the communications were intended by the client to facilitate or conceal the criminal or fraudulent activity.\" <i>Violette,</i> 183 F.3d at 75.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the privilege itself, the exception, where employed in a federal criminal case, is effectively a creature of federal common law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 501. This means that federal judges start with a core of common precedent reflecting the privilege but also have power to refine and adjust both the substance and procedure in light of reason and experience. <i>See Zolin,</i> 491 U.S. at 562-63, 109 S.Ct. 2619; <i>Violette,</i> 183 F.3d at 77-78. The process of development is far from over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is often hard to determine whether the attorney-client relationship has been misused by the client for crime or fraud without seeing the document, or hearing the testimony, as to which the privilege is claimed. To overcome this problem (as well as other privilege problems) judges have sometimes been willing to review privileged materials by themselves <i>in camera</i> and then decide whether the other side is entitled to it. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Jacobs,</i> 117 F.3d 82, 87 (2d Cir. 1997). The Supreme Court has blessed this procedure in <i>Zolin.</i> 491 U.S. at 572, 109 S.Ct. 2619; <i>see also United States v. Edgar,</i> 82 F.3d 499, 509 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i> 519 U.S. 870, 117 S.Ct. 184, 136 L.Ed.2d 123 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Zolin</i> also said that a \"lesser evidentiary showing\" is needed for <i>in camera</i> review than is needed finally to pierce the privilege, and that upon this showing whether to conduct <i>in camera</i> review is within the trial court's discretion. 491 U.S. at 572, 109 S.Ct. 2619.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> For such a review, all that was needed was a factual basis \"to support a good-faith belief by a reasonable person\" that \"<i>in camera</i> review of the materials may reveal evidence to establish the claim that the crime-fraud exception applies.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). \"May\" is a very relaxed test and, as only the judge gets this initial access, properly so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, <i>Zolin</i> did not answer the question of what level of proof is needed to pierce the privilege itself, 491 U.S. at 563, 109 S.Ct. 2619, although it acknowledged that the statement in <i>Clark v. United States,</i> 289 U.S. 1, 14, 53 S.Ct. 465, 77 L.Ed. 993 (1933), that a \"<i>prima facie</i> case\" was the needed showing \"has caused some confusion.\" <i>Zolin,</i> 491 U.S. at 563 n. 7, 109 S.Ct. 2619. In our own case, the district court found a <i>prima facie</i> showing had been established, but cautiously did not further explain what this meant. We share its caution but are obliged to attempt refinement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Prima facie\" is among the most rubbery of all legal phrases; it usually means little more than a showing of whatever is required to permit some inferential leap sufficient to reach a particular outcome. <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 1228 (8th ed.2004); <i>e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Here, the outcome is piercing the privilege based on a certain level of proof. This circuit has previously avoided a calibration of that level, <i>Violette,</i> 183 F.3d at 78, as has the Supreme Court, <i>Zolin,</i> 491 U.S. at 563, 109 S.Ct. 2619, but it is important in this case as to one client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we read the consensus of precedent in the circuits, it is enough to overcome the privilege that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the lawyer's services were used by the client to foster a crime or fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The circuits &#8212; although divided on articulation and on some important practical details &#8212; all effectively allow piercing of the privilege on something less than a mathematical (more likely than not) probability that the client intended to use the attorney in furtherance of a crime or fraud. This is a compromise based on policy but so is the existence and measure of the privilege itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precisely because of the initial barrier of the privilege, it is very hard for an adversary unaided to show that the privileged communications were themselves corrupt, so the requirements for access cannot be set too high. And, if the communications were innocent, the initial look may often not damage the client. In all events, the reasonable cause standard is intended to be reasonably demanding; neither speculation nor evidence that shows only a distant likelihood of corruption is enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the privilege is not lost solely because the client's <i>lawyer</i> is corrupt &#8212; as was certainly true in this case since the lawyer suborned Client A's perjury. The crime-fraud exception requires the <i>client's</i> engagement in criminal or fraudulent activity and the <i>client's</i> intent with respect to attorney-client communications. <i>Violette,</i> 183 F.3d at 75, 79. <i>Accord, In re Grand Jury Subpoenas,</i> 144 F.3d 653, 660 (10th Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i> 525 U.S. 966, 119 S.Ct. 412, 142 L.Ed.2d 334 (1998); <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> 107 F.3d 46, 49 (D.C.Cir.1997). If there are contrary views,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we do not think that they comport with the modern view of the privilege's nature and purpose as explained in <i>Upjohn v. United States,</i> 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional limitation on piercing is that it is not enough to find reasonable cause to believe that the client is guilty of crime or fraud. Forfeiture of the privilege requires the client's <i>use or aim to use</i> the lawyer to foster the crime or the fraud. As <i>Rakes</i> explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No general rule withdraws the privilege from communications that occur in the same time frame as criminal [conduct].. . . [T]he attorney-client privilege is forfeited <i>inter alia</i> where the client sought the services of the lawyer to enable or aid the client to commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">136 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we are satisfied that the reasonable cause standard is satisfied as to Client B. [[ ]]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our assessment, like that of the district judge, is preliminary, reflects no finding that Client B acted wrongfully, and is limited solely to the issue whether there is reasonable cause adequate to pierce Client B's privilege. The compelled testimony of Lawyer I (or other evidence) could turn out to vindicate Client B entirely and inculpate someone (or no one) else. The <i>prima facie</i> case is sometimes assumed to destroy the privilege once and for all once the opponent gains access to the material (which is one reason for the <i>Zolin</i> procedure). We think that there may well be room for protective remedies if the privilege is initially pierced but this turns out to have been in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It should be noted, finally, that the district court's initial proposal to examine Lawyer I <i>in camera</i> was not a finding that the government had met only the lower threshold under <i>Zolin</i> and therefore could only proceed to issue its motion to compel after acquiring additional inculpatory evidence obtained <i>in camera.</i> In its October 2004 decision, the district court made quite clear that the government had fully met its <i>prima facie</i> burden needed to overcome Client B's privilege, and it is this conclusion that we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more difficult problem concerns the Group C clients. There is scant evidence that these clients' purpose in retaining Lawyer II was to use his services in furtherance of a crime or fraud. True, the district judge made a finding (quoted above) of a \"shared intent\" to \"use otherwise privileged attorney-client communications to facilitate corruption and frustration of the grand jury inquiry.\" But his decision points to no facts to buttress this finding, nor &#8212; more ominously since the government certainly should know &#8212; is any such raw-fact evidence identified in the government's briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not enough that the lawyer's work posed an obstacle to the grand jury; perfectly legitimate representation may do this. [[ ]] To pierce the privilege requires that the clients have an intent to misuse their legal representation (<i>e.g.,</i> by enlisting the lawyer's advice to frame their perjury) to perpetrate the crime or fraud. <i>Violette,</i> 183 F.3d at 75. Such evidence may exist as to Group C but it has not yet been furnished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government relies upon <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> 754 F.2d at 399-402, where a <i>client's</i> document destruction incident to litigation was treated as undercutting the privilege of communications between it and its lawyers in that litigation. But there, the attorneys represented the client in the very litigation for which evidence had been destroyed, and in hearings in which the client sought to prevent exposure of the destruction, in the course of which they filed false documents and verified their authenticity. <i>Id.</i> at 400, 402. The lawyers were thus justifiably characterized as \"instrumentalities in the ongoing cover-up.\" <i>Id.</i> at 402. In this case, no such misuse of Lawyer II is shown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now that Client B's privilege has been pierced, some of what the government seeks can conceivably be obtained by questions directed to Lawyer I tailored to avoid disclosures that would invade Group C's privilege; arguably Lawyer I-Client B conversations can be reached regardless of what information Lawyer I passed on to the Group C clients. How far Lawyer I may be questioned about the <i>source</i> of the information &#8212; if it came from Lawyer II or the Group C clients &#8212; may be more debatable. Other difficult questions may also arise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also remains free to ask the district court to make an <i>in camera</i> inquiry under <i>Zolin</i> directed to overcoming the Group C clients' privilege. The government abandoned this quest when it apparently judged that the district court might side with it anyway. Nothing prevents the prosecutor from pursuing this route, either before or after further questioning of Lawyer I, if the district judge is willing to follow it. It is for the district court to say whether the low <i>Zolin</i> standard would warrant <i>in camera</i> questioning of the Group C clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The non-disclosure order.</i> When in December 2003 the district court gave notice of the government's motion to compel, it included a protective order directing Lawyer I and his counsel that \"the substance\" of the motion to compel should not be further disclosed or discussed with any third parties (including Client B, Client B's current attorney, Lawyer II or the Group C clients). In its October 2004 memorandum, the district court added that it would continue prohibiting Lawyer I \"from discussing the subject matter of his grand jury [testimony] with anyone other than his own counsel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Together, Client B and the Group C clients urge that the order is inconsistent with Rule 6(e), is in any event over-broad, and violates the First Amendment. Client B, in particular, complains that Lawyer I's counsel interpreted the order to extend beyond \"matter[s] occurring before the grand jury\" to preclude Lawyer I from discussing not only what he was asked but also his recollection of the underlying events in which Lawyer I was involved. These include Lawyer I's original subornation and his later turn-about advice that Client A recant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These past events are matters assuredly of interest to Client B, given government suspicions of him. Moreover, as Lawyer I represented Client B at the time of the subornation, the latter certainly has special reason to want to know what his erstwhile lawyer recalls about those events.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In the district court, Client B unsuccessfully sought to clarify and narrow the order and he now says that the district court has implicitly confirmed Lawyer I's counsel's reading. Whether or not the district court so intended, the government does not dispute that the protective order is intended to have this breadth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several layers of argument to be peeled away. The first is the clients' claim that Rule 6(e) by itself bars the imposition of any secrecy order on Lawyer I. Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(2)(B) lists categories of persons (<i>e.g.,</i> grand jurors and court reporters) who \"must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury,\" subject to certain exceptions in subsection 6(e)(3). But 6(e)(2)(B) is preceded by subsection 6(e)(2)(A) which provides: \"No obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with Rule 6(e)(2)(B).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Witnesses are not listed in Rule 6(e)(2)(B), nor does Lawyer I fall into any of the listed categories of persons who \"must not\" disclose grand jury matters. Pertinently the original advisory committee note says that \"[t]he rule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on witnesses\" and, although some districts did so prior to the rule, a \"seal of secrecy on witnesses seems an unnecessary hardship and may lead to injustice if a witness is not permitted to make a disclosure to counsel or to an associate.\" Rule 6 Advisory Committee Notes, 1944 Note to Subdivision (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush this appears to be a strong argument for the appellants, but several courts have read the rule more narrowly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> These decisions take Rule 6(e)(2)(A) to set a default rule of permitting disclosure by witnesses absent a contrary order by the court in that proceeding, but also to leave open the possibility of restrictions where they can be justified by particular and compelling circumstances. <i>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> 814 F.2d 61, 69 (1st Cir.1987) (collecting cases but not deciding the issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now decide that the rule's phrasing can, and should, accommodate rare exceptions premised on inherent judicial power. Absent restriction, courts have inherent power, subject to the Constitution and federal statutes, to impose secrecy orders incident to matters occurring before them. The general power is regularly expressed in orders limiting access to discovery materials, closing sensitive proceedings, and in other contexts. Sometimes these powers are reflected in or reconfirmed by rules, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c), but orders of this kind predated such rules which ordinarily reflect or refine the underlying authority without displacing it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those who drafted and approved Rule 6(e) seemingly intended to do no more than abolish a general practice existing in some districts of automatically silencing grand jury witnesses as to their testimony. The advisory note says that the rule \"does not impose\" secrecy obligations and does not say that it prohibits such obligations made by appropriate order. There is no indication in the history of an intent to cut off the courts' power to restrict disclosure based on extraordinary circumstances. <i>Cf. Aisenberg,</i> 358 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we are not dealing with an ordinary grand jury witness. Lawyer I confessedly suborned perjury of a witness in a related grand jury proceeding and is connected to certain underlying events that may have comprised an effort to frustrate a grand jury investigation. Further, disclosure of what is now happening in the present grand jury could help Client B (whose own privilege has been pierced under the crime-fraud exception) and the Group C clients [[]] coordinate their own testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 6(e)(2)(A) was not directed to such a situation nor does the First Amendment bar an appropriately tailored order. The interest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings during their pendency has been treated with great respect by the courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The present ban is concerned with protecting an ongoing grand jury investigation from further abuse by one who has already demonstrated a capacity and intention to frustrate the investigation. The restriction as to only one witness is planted in an adequate showing of special need.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our circumstances are far away from the only Supreme Court case invoked by appellants. In <i>Butterworth v. Smith,</i> 494 U.S. 624, 635-36, 110 S.Ct. 1376, 108 L.Ed.2d 572 (1990), the Supreme Court struck down a Florida statute precluding a state grand jury witness from ever disclosing his grand jury testimony. But the grand jury proceeding had long been completed and it was the permanency of the ban that most troubled the Supreme Court. <i>Id.</i> at 632, 635-36, 110 S.Ct. 1376. Lawyer I or Client B may return to the district court to request a termination of the ban whenever the need for it has disappeared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This takes us to appellants' claim that the ban, if sustainable at all, is overly broad. The ban appears to cover two different although related subjects. One is disclosure by Lawyer I of whatever happens within the grand jury &#8212; questions he has been asked or may be asked, answers he has given or may give, documents he may provide or be shown, and the like. The other is his own independent recollection of events about which he may or may not be asked including discussions or interactions with Clients A and B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The former are, strictly speaking, \"matter[s] occurring before a grand jury\" and their revelation poses the most direct threat that the government's hand may be disclosed to other witnesses, enabling them to alter their own answers or coordinate evasions. Such revelations are already prohibited for most of those connected with the grand jury, and extension of this limitation to Lawyer I, based on the special circumstances of this case, is justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is more difficult to sustain a ban on Lawyer I's discussion with his own former client, or with others, about Lawyer I's independent recollection of previous events outside the grand jury even though they may be matters about which the grand jury has questioned or will question him. In particular, Client B has a clear interest in preserving the opportunity to find out what his former lawyer recollects about Client B's own involvement and the interaction. Nor does such a discussion, if honestly conducted, reveal the grand jury's plan of attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, any discussion between Lawyer I and anyone else of interest to the grand jury presents an opportunity to conspire and tailor stories. But that opportunity exists in any event; Lawyer I has not been precluded from all contact with his own former clients or lawyers for Group C clients. Nor do we normally prevent indicted co-conspirators from discussing their cases with one another even though in some cases the prospect that they will tailor their stories is very real.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge has adopted the broad construction of his order, if at all, by indirection, and has never provided an explicit grounding for extending the order beyond revelation of the proceedings before the grand jury. The original notice barred disclosure by Lawyer I only of \"the substance of the government's motion to compel\"; and the October memorandum ambiguously prohibited discussion of \"the subject matter of [Lawyer I's] grand jury [omitted word &#8212; presumably \"testimony\"] with anyone.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not say that a witness could never be precluded from discussing independent recollections; situations involving national security are too obvious a concern to encourage general pronouncements. Instead, finding the ban unclear in scope but lacking clear justification for the broader reading, we modify the present restriction to cover only (in addition to the substance of the government's sealed motion) \"matters occurring before the grand jury\" and not independent recollections of the witness about external prior events as to which the witness has been or may be questioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one further caveat. It is difficult to foresee how events may develop and we are sensitive to the fact that Client B and to a lesser extent the Group C clients seemingly had a protected relationship with Lawyer I. Our modified affirmance of the order limiting disclosure by Lawyer I rests on the understanding that Lawyer I, Client B and the Group C clients remain free at any time to seek relief from the district court for good cause shown so as to permit Lawyer I to disclose some or all of his grand jury testimony to Client B, the Group C clients or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court's order granting the motion to compel is <i>affirmed</i> as to Client B's privilege but <i>vacated</i> as to the Group C clients' privilege (without prejudice to a further showing by the government with respect to them). The order limiting disclosure is <i>modified,</i> and <i>as modified affirmed,</i> to apply only to the proceedings before the district court on the motion to compel and to \"matters occurring before the grand jury\" as that phrase is customarily employed and as discussed above. No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> This is a redacted version of the original decision filed under seal on April 26, 2005.

Because the grand jury investigation is ongoing, our discussion omits a certain amount of detail and by a separate order the decision is being sealed. However, the court anticipates that an expurgated version of the opinion or summary of the key legal rulings will be published in due course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Background.</i> In the course of a grand jury investigation in [[ ]], a lawyer (Lawyer I) directed his client (\"Client A\") to commit perjury in testifying before the grand jury, after initially advising him to tell the truth. The same lawyer has also represented another client (\"Client B\") who might or might not have some connection with the earlier perjury. In [[ ]], Lawyer I told Client A to recant the false testimony. Lawyer I did so after consulting with Lawyer II, who represented [[ ]] other clients (collectively \"Group C\") variously connected with Client B and with pertinent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Learning of the perjury, the government is now investigating the possible involvement of others with that perjury and with other possible crimes. The present grand jury summoned Lawyer I, and the prosecutor sought to question him about the prior perjury of Client A including the involvement of others with that perjury and its subornation. Lawyer I refused to answer a number of these questions, saying that answering them would invade Client B's attorney-client privilege and the joint-defense privilege enjoyed by the Group C clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That questions to Lawyer I might invade the privilege of Client B is clear but the Group C clients are not represented by Lawyer I but by Lawyer II who practices independently. However, it was Lawyer I's position, not contested by the government at this stage, that the two lawyers at the relevant times had a joint-defense arrangement which allowed them, without waiving the attorney-client privilege, to exchange confidences that their respective clients may have confided to them separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually the government moved to compel Lawyer I to answer the disputed questions, arguing that the crime-fraud exception defeated the claim of privilege as to both Client B and the Group C clients. Upon Lawyer I's request, the court notified Client B's current counsel&#8212;unaffiliated with Lawyer I&#8212;and counsel for each of the Group C clients; [[ ]].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the government's behest, the district court also directed Lawyer I not to reveal to anyone (other than his own counsel) the \"substance of the government's motion to compel\" &#8212; an order the government thought essential to protect against the risk that Lawyer I might affect or influence other potential grand jury witnesses. Client B objected that under Fed. R.Crim.P. 6(e)(2)(A), Lawyer I could not be barred from disclosing to Client B or anyone else what he (Lawyer I) learned as a grand jury witness or elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Current counsel for two [[ ]] Group C clients also objected to the motion to compel. Lawyer II provided an affidavit describing his representation of the Group C clients; in addition to other details about his consultations with Lawyer I, he said that incident to their joint defense arrangement he had disclosed to Lawyer I confidential information received from at least one of the Group C clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held several hearings and heard arguments as to whether or not the privilege was abrogated. The government also made two <i>ex parte</i> filings whose contents were not made known to opposing counsel; a redacted version of one of the filings was, however, supplied to opposing counsel. Such <i>ex parte</i> submissions, although surprising to those unacquainted with the practice, have precedent in certain contexts including grand jury matters and privilege claims. <i>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Violette),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198604\"><a href=\"/opinion/198604/in-re-grand-jury-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also considered the government's request that it engage in a limited type of <i>in camera</i> inquiry suggested as a possibility by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Zolin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112308\"><a href=\"/opinion/112308/united-states-v-zolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112308\"><a href=\"/opinion/112308/united-states-v-zolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1989). In such an inquiry the judge may examine privileged material itself to determine whether it is or remains privileged. The district judge expressed reservations about his capacity, given the complexities of the background events, to conduct such a limited inquiry which would involve the judge in questioning Lawyer I and not merely reviewing documents. In the end, the government chose to rest on what it already adduced and abandoned its request for an <i>in camera</i> inquiry under, <i>Zolin.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in March 2004, the district court granted the government's motion to compel answers to the government's listed questions. Requests by Client B and one of the Group C clients to allow their lawyers to interview Lawyer I about the underlying events were denied. The objecting clients then sought access to all of the filings made so far in the district court, including the government's <i>ex parte</i> filings. This too was denied in October 2004 when the district court issued a memorandum explaining its decisions in more detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the October 2004 memorandum, the district judge explained his reasons for concluding that the crime-fraud exception applied. The judge said he was satisfied that the government had made a \"<i>prima facie</i> showing\" not only of Lawyer I's corruption but also, [[ ]], of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a shared intent by the Clients &#8212; when making the communications the government seeks to discover &#8212; to use otherwise privileged attorney-client communications to facilitate corruption and frustration of the grand jury inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge stressed that he was not finding that any of the clients had <i>in fact</i> corruptly communicated with counsel. He only found enough of a likelihood had been established to justify compelling Lawyer I's answers &#8212; albeit \"limited only to those lines of inquiry\" identified by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court expressed discomfort with the government's bypassing of the <i>Zolin in camera</i> inquiry, warning that this might result in a remand. The court also explained its reasons for concluding that the court had authority to forbid Lawyer I from disclosing to anyone, including Lawyer II and to Client B and the Group C clients, what he had been asked in the grand jury or other information pertaining to \"the subject matter\" of the grand jury inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Client B and the Group C clients, as the alleged privilege holders, have attacked the <i>prima facie</i> standard adopted by the district court and, in the alternative, argued that even this allegedly too lenient standard has not been met. Client B also urges that the government and district court were obliged to follow the <i>Zolin in camera</i> procedure. Finally, the clients say that the non-disclosure order to Lawyer I was barred by Fed R.Crim. P. 6(e)(2) and that it was overly broad as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The customary standard of review in cases of privilege is that strictly legal questions are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> raw fact findings are reviewed for clear error, and the application of legal standards to specific facts with a measure of deference. <i>See Cavallaro v.

This circuit has previously avoided a calibration of that level, <i>Violette,</i> 183 F.3d at 78, as has the Supreme Court, <i>Zolin,</i> 491 U.S. at 563, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112308\"><a href=\"/opinion/112308/united-states-v-zolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is a compromise based on policy but so is the existence and measure of the privilege itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precisely because of the initial barrier of the privilege, it is very hard for an adversary unaided to show that the privileged communications were themselves corrupt, so the requirements for access cannot be set too high. And, if the communications were innocent, the initial look may often not damage the client. In all events, the reasonable cause standard is intended to be reasonably demanding; neither speculation nor evidence that shows only a distant likelihood of corruption is enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the privilege is not lost solely because the client's <i>lawyer</i> is corrupt &#8212; as was certainly true in this case since the lawyer suborned Client A's perjury. The crime-fraud exception requires the <i>client's</i> engagement in criminal or fraudulent activity and the <i>client's</i> intent with respect to attorney-client communications. <i>Violette,</i> 183 F.3d at 75, 79. <i>Accord, In re Grand Jury Subpoenas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754541\"><a href=\"/opinion/754541/in-re-grand-jury-subpoenas-jane-roe-and-john-doe-intervenor-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 660 (10th Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If there are contrary views,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we do not think that they comport with the modern view of the privilege's nature and purpose as explained in <i>Upjohn v.

Forfeiture of the privilege requires the client's <i>use or aim to use</i> the lawyer to foster the crime or the fraud. As <i>Rakes</i> explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No general rule withdraws the privilege from communications that occur in the same time frame as criminal [conduct].. . . [T]he attorney-client privilege is forfeited <i>inter alia</i> where the client sought the services of the lawyer to enable or aid the client to commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">136 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we are satisfied that the reasonable cause standard is satisfied as to Client B. [[ ]]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our assessment, like that of the district judge, is preliminary, reflects no finding that Client B acted wrongfully, and is limited solely to the issue whether there is reasonable cause adequate to pierce Client B's privilege. The compelled testimony of Lawyer I (or other evidence) could turn out to vindicate Client B entirely and inculpate someone (or no one) else. The <i>prima facie</i> case is sometimes assumed to destroy the privilege once and for all once the opponent gains access to the material (which is one reason for the <i>Zolin</i> procedure). We think that there may well be room for protective remedies if the privilege is initially pierced but this turns out to have been in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It should be noted, finally, that the district court's initial proposal to examine Lawyer I <i>in camera</i> was not a finding that the government had met only the lower threshold under <i>Zolin</i> and therefore could only proceed to issue its motion to compel after acquiring additional inculpatory evidence obtained <i>in camera.</i> In its October 2004 decision, the district court made quite clear that the government had fully met its <i>prima facie</i> burden needed to overcome Client B's privilege, and it is this conclusion that we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more difficult problem concerns the Group C clients. There is scant evidence that these clients' purpose in retaining Lawyer II was to use his services in furtherance of a crime or fraud. True, the district judge made a finding (quoted above) of a \"shared intent\" to \"use otherwise privileged attorney-client communications to facilitate corruption and frustration of the grand jury inquiry.\" But his decision points to no facts to buttress this finding, nor &#8212; more ominously since the government certainly should know &#8212; is any such raw-fact evidence identified in the government's briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not enough that the lawyer's work posed an obstacle to the grand jury; perfectly legitimate representation may do this. [[ ]] To pierce the privilege requires that the clients have an intent to misuse their legal representation (<i>e.g.,</i> by enlisting the lawyer's advice to frame their perjury) to perpetrate the crime or fraud. <i>Violette,</i> 183 F.3d at 75. Such evidence may exist as to Group C but it has not yet been furnished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government relies upon <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> 754 F.2d at 399-402, where a <i>client's</i> document destruction incident to litigation was treated as undercutting the privilege of communications between it and its lawyers in that litigation. But there, the attorneys represented the client in the very litigation for which evidence had been destroyed, and in hearings in which the client sought to prevent exposure of the destruction, in the course of which they filed false documents and verified their authenticity. <i>Id.</i> at 400, 402. The lawyers were thus justifiably characterized as \"instrumentalities in the ongoing cover-up.\" <i>Id.</i> at 402. In this case, no such misuse of Lawyer II is shown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now that Client B's privilege has been pierced, some of what the government seeks can conceivably be obtained by questions directed to Lawyer I tailored to avoid disclosures that would invade Group C's privilege; arguably Lawyer I-Client B conversations can be reached regardless of what information Lawyer I passed on to the Group C clients. How far Lawyer I may be questioned about the <i>source</i> of the information &#8212; if it came from Lawyer II or the Group C clients &#8212; may be more debatable. Other difficult questions may also arise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also remains free to ask the district court to make an <i>in camera</i> inquiry under <i>Zolin</i> directed to overcoming the Group C clients' privilege. The government abandoned this quest when it apparently judged that the district court might side with it anyway. Nothing prevents the prosecutor from pursuing this route, either before or after further questioning of Lawyer I, if the district judge is willing to follow it. It is for the district court to say whether the low <i>Zolin</i> standard would warrant <i>in camera</i> questioning of the Group C clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The non-disclosure order.</i> When in December 2003 the district court gave notice of the government's motion to compel, it included a protective order directing Lawyer I and his counsel that \"the substance\" of the motion to compel should not be further disclosed or discussed with any third parties (including Client B, Client B's current attorney, Lawyer II or the Group C clients). In its October 2004 memorandum, the district court added that it would continue prohibiting Lawyer I \"from discussing the subject matter of his grand jury [testimony] with anyone other than his own counsel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Together, Client B and the Group C clients urge that the order is inconsistent with Rule 6(e), is in any event over-broad, and violates the First Amendment. Client B, in particular, complains that Lawyer I's counsel interpreted the order to extend beyond \"matter[s] occurring before the grand jury\" to preclude Lawyer I from discussing not only what he was asked but also his recollection of the underlying events in which Lawyer I was involved. These include Lawyer I's original subornation and his later turn-about advice that Client A recant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These past events are matters assuredly of interest to Client B, given government suspicions of him. Moreover, as Lawyer I represented Client B at the time of the subornation, the latter certainly has special reason to want to know what his erstwhile lawyer recalls about those events.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In the district court, Client B unsuccessfully sought to clarify and narrow the order and he now says that the district court has implicitly confirmed Lawyer I's counsel's reading. Whether or not the district court so intended, the government does not dispute that the protective order is intended to have this breadth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several layers of argument to be peeled away. The first is the clients' claim that Rule 6(e) by itself bars the imposition of any secrecy order on Lawyer I. Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(2)(B) lists categories of persons (<i>e.g.,</i> grand jurors and court reporters) who \"must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury,\" subject to certain exceptions in subsection 6(e)(3). But 6(e)(2)(B) is preceded by subsection 6(e)(2)(A) which provides: \"No obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with Rule 6(e)(2)(B).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Witnesses are not listed in Rule 6(e)(2)(B), nor does Lawyer I fall into any of the listed categories of persons who \"must not\" disclose grand jury matters. Pertinently the original advisory committee note says that \"[t]he rule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on witnesses\" and, although some districts did so prior to the rule, a \"seal of secrecy on witnesses seems an unnecessary hardship and may lead to injustice if a witness is not permitted to make a disclosure to counsel or to an associate.\" Rule 6 Advisory Committee Notes, 1944 Note to Subdivision (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush this appears to be a strong argument for the appellants, but several courts have read the rule more narrowly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> These decisions take Rule 6(e)(2)(A) to set a default rule of permitting disclosure by witnesses absent a contrary order by the court in that proceeding, but also to leave open the possibility of restrictions where they can be justified by particular and compelling circumstances. <i>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484937\"><a href=\"/opinion/484937/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-appeal-of-hilton-fernandez-diamante-in-re/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.1987) (collecting cases but not deciding the issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now decide that the rule's phrasing can, and should, accommodate rare exceptions premised on inherent judicial power. Absent restriction, courts have inherent power, subject to the Constitution and federal statutes, to impose secrecy orders incident to matters occurring before them. The general power is regularly expressed in orders limiting access to discovery materials, closing sensitive proceedings, and in other contexts. Sometimes these powers are reflected in or reconfirmed by rules, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c), but orders of this kind predated such rules which ordinarily reflect or refine the underlying authority without displacing it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those who drafted and approved Rule 6(e) seemingly intended to do no more than abolish a general practice existing in some districts of automatically silencing grand jury witnesses as to their testimony. The advisory note says that the rule \"does not impose\" secrecy obligations and does not say that it prohibits such obligations made by appropriate order. There is no indication in the history of an intent to cut off the courts' power to restrict disclosure based on extraordinary circumstances. <i>Cf. Aisenberg,</i> 358 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we are not dealing with an ordinary grand jury witness. Lawyer I confessedly suborned perjury of a witness in a related grand jury proceeding and is connected to certain underlying events that may have comprised an effort to frustrate a grand jury investigation. Further, disclosure of what is now happening in the present grand jury could help Client B (whose own privilege has been pierced under the crime-fraud exception) and the Group C clients [[]] coordinate their own testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 6(e)(2)(A) was not directed to such a situation nor does the First Amendment bar an appropriately tailored order. The interest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings during their pendency has been treated with great respect by the courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The present ban is concerned with protecting an ongoing grand jury investigation from further abuse by one who has already demonstrated a capacity and intention to frustrate the investigation. The restriction as to only one witness is planted in an adequate showing of special need.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our circumstances are far away from the only Supreme Court case invoked by appellants.

One is disclosure by Lawyer I of whatever happens within the grand jury &#8212; questions he has been asked or may be asked, answers he has given or may give, documents he may provide or be shown, and the like. The other is his own independent recollection of events about which he may or may not be asked including discussions or interactions with Clients A and B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The former are, strictly speaking, \"matter[s] occurring before a grand jury\" and their revelation poses the most direct threat that the government's hand may be disclosed to other witnesses, enabling them to alter their own answers or coordinate evasions. Such revelations are already prohibited for most of those connected with the grand jury, and extension of this limitation to Lawyer I, based on the special circumstances of this case, is justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is more difficult to sustain a ban on Lawyer I's discussion with his own former client, or with others, about Lawyer I's independent recollection of previous events outside the grand jury even though they may be matters about which the grand jury has questioned or will question him. In particular, Client B has a clear interest in preserving the opportunity to find out what his former lawyer recollects about Client B's own involvement and the interaction. Nor does such a discussion, if honestly conducted, reveal the grand jury's plan of attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, any discussion between Lawyer I and anyone else of interest to the grand jury presents an opportunity to conspire and tailor stories. But that opportunity exists in any event; Lawyer I has not been precluded from all contact with his own former clients or lawyers for Group C clients. Nor do we normally prevent indicted co-conspirators from discussing their cases with one another even though in some cases the prospect that they will tailor their stories is very real.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge has adopted the broad construction of his order, if at all, by indirection, and has never provided an explicit grounding for extending the order beyond revelation of the proceedings before the grand jury. The original notice barred disclosure by Lawyer I only of \"the substance of the government's motion to compel\"; and the October memorandum ambiguously prohibited discussion of \"the subject matter of [Lawyer I's] grand jury [omitted word &#8212; presumably \"testimony\"] with anyone.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not say that a witness could never be precluded from discussing independent recollections; situations involving national security are too obvious a concern to encourage general pronouncements. Instead, finding the ban unclear in scope but lacking clear justification for the broader reading, we modify the present restriction to cover only (in addition to the substance of the government's sealed motion) \"matters occurring before the grand jury\" and not independent recollections of the witness about external prior events as to which the witness has been or may be questioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one further caveat. It is difficult to foresee how events may develop and we are sensitive to the fact that Client B and to a lesser extent the Group C clients seemingly had a protected relationship with Lawyer I. Our modified affirmance of the order limiting disclosure by Lawyer I rests on the understanding that Lawyer I, Client B and the Group C clients remain free at any time to seek relief from the district court for good cause shown so as to permit Lawyer I to disclose some or all of his grand jury testimony to Client B, the Group C clients or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court's order granting the motion to compel is <i>affirmed</i> as to Client B's privilege but <i>vacated</i> as to the Group C clients' privilege (without prejudice to a further showing by the government with respect to them). The order limiting disclosure is <i>modified,</i> and <i>as modified affirmed,</i> to apply only to the proceedings before the district court on the motion to compel and to \"matters occurring before the grand jury\" as that phrase is customarily employed and as discussed above. No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> This is a redacted version of the original decision filed under seal on April 26, 2005.
