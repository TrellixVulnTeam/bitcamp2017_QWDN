MEISES, a/k/a DAVID VAZQUEZ-COSS, a/k/a JUAN A. MIESES,\n                   and JOSE L. REYES-GUERRERO,\n\n                        Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n             APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n            [Hon. Francisco A. Besosa, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n              Lipez, Leval,* and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Leslie W. O'Brien for appellant Reyes-Guerrero.\n     Rafael F. Castro Lang for appellant Meises.\n     Courtney L. Coker, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division,\nand Luke Cass, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                             May 13, 2011\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.   Appellants Juan Mieses1 and Jose\n\nReyes-Guerrero were arrested in a reverse sting operation after\n\nthey drove to a sham drug deal, with a third co-defendant, in a\n\nvehicle containing $100,000 in cash.2   A jury found both appellants\n\nguilty of a single drug conspiracy count.       On appeal, the pair\n\nclaim that their convictions must be vacated because of three\n\nsignificant errors at trial: (1) the government's use of improper\n\noverview testimony from the lead law enforcement agent in the case,\n\n(2) the indirect admission of the third co-defendant's out-of-court\n\nstatement implicating appellants, and (3) the district court's\n\nrefusal to allow the jury to hear an audiotape recorded on the day\n\nof their arrests.3     Reyes-Guerrero further asserts that he is\n\nentitled to a judgment of acquittal because the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n\n            As we shall explain, the overview testimony at issue here\n\nwas improper and, to its credit, the district court acknowledged\n\nthe error when it considered appellants' post-trial motions for\n\nacquittal.    See United States v. Reyes-Guerrero, 638 F. Supp. 2d\n\n\n     1\n       The indictment and other court documents spell \"Mieses\" as\n\"Meises,\" and we do likewise in the official caption of this case.\nIn the remainder of the opinion, however, we adopt the spelling\nused by Mieses in his brief.\n     2\n       In a classic sting operation, an undercover agent attempts\nto purchase drugs from a suspect. In a reverse sting, agents offer\nto sell drugs to their targets. United States v. Pinillos-Prieto,\n419 F.3d 61, 64 (1st Cir. 2005).\n     3\n         Only Mieses challenges the admission of the audiotape.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f177, 185-90      (D.P.R. 2009).          We also conclude that the district\n\ncourt erred in allowing testimony revealing the co-defendant's\n\ninculpatory    statement.         Those    two   significant      errors     entitle\n\nappellants    to    a     new   trial,    and    we   therefore     vacate    their\n\nconvictions and remand for such new proceedings.4\n\n                                          I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n           The facts underlying appellants' convictions, viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to the jury's verdict, see United States\n\nv. Poulin, 631 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir. 2011), are as follows.\n\n           Puerto Rico Police Sergeant Roberto Cruz, a member of a\n\nfederal   drug     task    force,5   worked      undercover    in    2007     in   an\n\ninvestigation targeting Genito Toribio-Custodio (\"Custodio\"), an\n\nalleged trafficker who operated in the Dominican Republic and\n\nPuerto Rico.       Also participating in the undercover investigation\n\nwas Marcos Antonio Torres, a longtime drug trafficker who had been\n\na paid government informant since 2005.6              The undercover operation\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       We explain in Section II why we reject Reyes-Guerrero's\nsufficiency argument.\n     5\n       At the time of the trial in this case, Cruz had been\nassigned to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration's\n(DEA) Task Force for fourteen years.\n     6\n       Torres testified that he began drug trafficking when he was\nsixteen and continued until he was arrested about two decades\nlater.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fended prematurely when Custodio detected surveillance units and\n\nfled from Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic.\n\n            Seeking to reactivate the investigation the next year,\n\nCruz instructed Torres to solicit Custodio for a cocaine deal in\n\nPuerto Rico.     On June 19, 2008, in the first of a series of\n\nrecorded phone calls, Torres informed Custodio that he had 220\n\nkilograms to sell. Initially cautious, Custodio asked Torres if he\n\nstill communicated with Cruz, whom Custodio did not trust.   Torres\n\nsaid they were not in touch.   Although Custodio originally said he\n\nwould travel to Puerto Rico within a few days, he instead arranged\n\nfor his \"partner\" – Dario Pereyra-Rubis (\"Rubis\") – to carry out\n\nthe deal.    A few days later, during a meeting in San Juan that\n\nTorres recorded, Rubis expressed interest in buying 150 kilograms\n\nof cocaine and proposed paying for them after his clients paid him.\n\nTorres told Rubis that he could deal only in twenty-five kilogram\n\namounts, and he would provide the drugs only if Rubis brought\n\n$100,000.   Rubis contacted a client by phone to advise that a deal\n\nwas in the works, and he then left to consult with the client face-\n\nto-face.\n\n            In a follow-up phone call with Custodio, who had already\n\nspoken with Rubis, Torres repeated his refusal to defer payment for\n\nthe drugs and offered to accept a $100,000 deposit.      In another\n\nphone call the same evening, when Rubis insisted on getting the\n\ndrugs without cash down, Torres told Rubis that his buyers should\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fcome with the money \"so that they are present in the negotiation\"\n\nand they \"know where their money is.\"              Rubis said he would continue\n\nto try to reach an agreement.\n\n           Sensing continuing mistrust on the part of Rubis and\n\nCustodio, Cruz arranged for Torres to show Rubis sham kilograms of\n\ncocaine – packages of wood wrapped with the type of tape commonly\n\nused by drug traffickers.            Their meeting at a shopping center on\n\nJune 26 was videotaped, and Cruz also was on the scene as part of\n\nthe surveillance team.         Rubis's concerns apparently were resolved\n\nwhen he saw the \"cocaine,\" and Torres testified that Rubis became\n\n\"in a hurry to make the deal.\"\n\n           In a series of conversations between Rubis and Torres on\n\nthe   morning    of   June    27,    the    deal   was   confirmed   for   fifteen\n\nkilograms at $14,000 apiece, with $100,000 in cash to be paid on\n\nthe spot and the balance due a day later.                Torres testified that,\n\nin the first call, Rubis reported that he was \"with the people, the\n\nowners of the money with the money; and that he was desperate to\n\n. . . make the deal, and he didn't want the people to get bored and\n\nleave.\"   They agreed to meet at 2 p.m., and in a subsequent call\n\nTorres told Rubis to come to the shopping center where they had\n\npreviously met.\n\n           DEA    Task       Force    members,      including   Cruz,      set   up\n\nsurveillance with videotaping equipment near the shopping center.\n\nAgents saw Rubis arrive at the shopping center alone in a green\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fMazda that belonged to appellant Reyes-Guerrero, briefly leave the\n\narea, and then return with Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero in a Ford\n\nminivan.     Mieses was driving, Reyes-Guerrero was in the front\n\npassenger seat, and Rubis was sitting in the back.          Mieses dropped\n\nRubis off near where Torres, equipped with a small audio recorder,\n\nwas waiting, and then drove on a short distance before parking the\n\nvan.   When Torres asked why Rubis was late, Rubis replied that he\n\nhad arrived earlier, but he needed to wait for \"the owners of the\n\nmoney\" to come with the cash.       After Torres complained that he did\n\nnot want to meet anyone else, Rubis explained that \"the people\"\n\nwould not give the money to him (i.e., Rubis) because they did not\n\ntrust him.    Asked if the owners were there yet, Rubis said they\n\nwere \"in their car,\" and he then escorted Torres to the minivan.\n\nTorres testified that, as they proceeded to the vehicle, Rubis\n\nassured him that these individuals were trustworthy and that he had\n\npreviously carried out drug transactions with them.\n\n            According to Torres, when he and Rubis arrived at the\n\npassenger side of the van, Reyes-Guerrero rolled down his window\n\nand Rubis briefly introduced the men. Reyes-Guerrero directed them\n\nto \"get in\" the car, but Torres refused because he feared being\n\nkidnapped.    Torres then asked if they were ready; Mieses replied\n\n\"yes\" and Reyes-Guerrero nodded.          Torres asked to see the money,\n\nprompting    Mieses   to   reach   behind   his   seat   and,   with   Reyes-\n\nGuerrero's help, pull out a shoe box.          Reyes-Guerrero passed the\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fbox to Torres, who opened it and asked how much money it contained.\n\nAfter responding \"$100,000,\" Mieses asked about \"the merchandise,\"\n\nand Torres told him that it was in his car.       Mieses then asked,\n\n\"How are we going to do this?\"     Torres responded that he would\n\nreturn to his car and drive off, and the others should follow.    As\n\nTorres walked away from the minivan, he passed his hand over his\n\nhead in a prearranged signal to let Cruz know that he had seen the\n\nmoney and the deal was underway.\n\n          Significantly, although the conversation between Torres\n\nand Rubis in the parking lot was recorded by the device Torres\n\ncarried, the exchange among the men at the minivan could not be\n\nheard on the tape.     Cruz attributed the glitch to background\n\ntraffic noise at that location, and Torres testified that a gap is\n\nnot unusual when he carries a recording device.   Cruz and the other\n\nTask Force members were too far away from the minivan to hear the\n\nmen talking, and the jury thus heard only Torres's account of what\n\nwas said there.7\n\n          After Torres signaled Cruz, Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero\n\nwere quickly arrested, and Rubis, who had tried to flee, was\n\napprehended several blocks away. A blue Reebok shoe box containing\n\n$100,000 was recovered from the van, and a subsequent inspection of\n\n\n     7\n       In fact, no transcript was made from any part of that day's\naudiotape, and the tape was not played for the jury.      Torres's\ntestimony was thus the only evidence on what was said throughout\nthe June 27 episode, including during the exchange between Torres\nand Rubis before they approached the minivan.\n\n                               -7-\n\fthe vehicle revealed a hidden compartment beneath the rear floor.\n\nRubis indicated a willingness to cooperate with law enforcement\n\nauthorities, and he was interviewed at the DEA offices by Cruz and\n\nanother   Task      Force   agent.     Cruz   testified    that,   after    the\n\ninterview,    the    targets   of    his   investigation   changed,   and    he\n\nreported that Reyes-Guerrero and Mieses were immediately processed\n\nand detained.       Rubis, Reyes-Guerrero, and Mieses were all charged\n\nwith a single count of conspiracy to possess five or more kilograms\n\nof cocaine with intent to distribute the drugs.            See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A).\n\nB. Procedural Background\n\n           During appellants' five-day trial in February 2009, the\n\ngovernment presented the details of the reverse sting largely\n\nthrough the testimony of Cruz and Torres.          The jury also heard the\n\naudio recordings of the preparatory telephone calls involving\n\nRubis, Torres, and Custodio and saw the videotapes of the sham\n\ncocaine display and the attempted transaction. Despite defendants'\n\nobjections, the court allowed the prosecutor to ask Cruz what role\n\ndefendants played within the drug trafficking organization.                Cruz\n\nidentified Mieses as \"one of the buyers,\" and Reyes-Guerrero as\n\n\"the other buyer.\"      Cruz also described them as the \"owners of the\n\nmoney.\"      Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero defended by arguing \"mere\n\npresence,\" attempting to persuade the jury that they were merely\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fbystanders to Rubis's drug deal.8          The strategy was unsuccessful,\n\nand both men were found guilty.\n\n             In   post-trial    motions    for    judgments    of    acquittal,\n\nappellants challenged the court's instruction on \"mere presence\"\n\nand asserted that the court erred in allowing Cruz to present\n\noverview testimony that was based on hearsay.              They further argued\n\nthat the evidence adduced by the government was insufficient as a\n\nmatter of law to support the guilty verdicts.\n\n             In a thorough and thoughtful opinion, the district court\n\nacknowledged that Cruz's testimony about appellants' roles in the\n\ndrug transaction had been improperly admitted, Reyes-Guerrero, 638\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 190, and that the error \"may have constituted\n\nsufficient grounds for the granting of a new trial pursuant to a\n\nharmless error standard.\"       Id. at 179 n.1.         Because the defendants\n\nhad not moved for such relief, however, the court addressed only\n\ntheir request for acquittal.         Id.     It concluded that Torres's\n\ntestimony alone provided ample support for findings of guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, id. at 192-93, and it therefore denied the\n\nmotions.9\n\n             On appeal, appellants raise four arguments.             First, they\n\njointly     reiterate   their   contention       that    admission    of   Cruz's\n\n\n\n     8\n         Rubis disappeared after posting bond and has not been tried.\n     9\n         The court rejected the appellants' claim of instructional\nerror.\n\n                                     -9-\n\foverview testimony – specifically, his assertions that they played\n\nthe role of buyers – was reversible error.             Second, they challenge\n\nthe admission of Cruz's testimony about his post-arrest interview\n\nwith Rubis.       They argue that Cruz's revelation that after the\n\ninterview the targets of his investigation changed necessarily\n\nimplied a statement by Rubis identifying Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero\n\nas co-conspirators in the drug deal.             Admission of that implied\n\nout-of-court statement, they assert, violated their rights under\n\nthe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.                 Third, Mieses\n\nchallenges the court's refusal to allow the jury to hear a portion\n\nof the audio recording made by Torres on June 27.                Mieses insists\n\nthat   the    recording   was   relevant    to   the   jurors'    appraisal   of\n\nTorres's testimony about the conversation at the minivan and why it\n\nwas not captured on the tape.        Finally, Reyes-Guerrero renews his\n\nsufficiency argument, which is where we begin our discussion.\n\n                                     II.\n\n              Reyes-Guerrero argues that he is entitled to a judgment\n\nof acquittal because a conspiracy charge requires proof of the\n\ndefendant's \"own words or actions\" and the record in this case\n\ninvolves only \"the mouth of the government informant.\"                 He asserts\n\nthat Torres's uncorroborated testimony is insufficient to support\n\na   finding    that   Reyes-Guerrero       was   a   knowing     and   voluntary\n\nparticipant in a conspiracy, see United States v. Bristol-Mártir,\n\n570 F.3d 29, 39 (1st Cir. 2009), and he insists that the jury could\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fproperly conclude only that he happened to be present when Rubis\n\ntransacted a drug deal.\n\n            Reyes-Guerrero undervalues the evidence against him.10\n\nThe testimony of a single witness can be enough to support the\n\ngovernment's case, United States v. De La Paz-Rentas, 613 F.3d 18,\n\n24-25 (1st Cir. 2010), and even the uncorroborated testimony of an\n\ninformant    may    suffice   \"to   establish    the   facts    underlying   a\n\ndefendant's conviction,\" United States v. Merlino, 592 F.3d 22, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).       The jury assesses witness credibility, United\n\nStates v. Rivera-Rodríguez, 617 F.3d 581, 596 n.6 (1st Cir. 2010),\n\nand the jurors in this case were properly informed about Torres's\n\ndrug-dealing past and cautioned about accepting his testimony.11\n\n            Moreover, the government did not rest solely on informant\n\ntestimony to rebut Reyes-Guerrero's mere presence defense.               The\n\ngovernment   also    introduced     recordings   of    phone   conversations,\n\nvideotapes, and Cruz's testimony based on direct surveillance. The\n\nearly phone conversations between Torres and Rubis indicated that\n\n\n     10\n       For purposes of our sufficiency analysis, we do not consider\nthe testimony of Cruz to which appellants have objected.\n     11\n       In its pre-deliberations charge to the jury, the court gave\nthe following instruction:\n\n          You have heard the testimony of Mark Anthony Torres.\n     He provided evidence under contract agreements with the\n     Government and received money from the Government in\n     exchange for providing information. Some people in this\n     position are truthful when testifying. Still, you should\n     consider the testimony of Mark Anthony Torres with\n     particular caution.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fRubis was acting as a broker for buyers who were reluctant to part\n\nwith their cash before obtaining drugs, and the events on the\n\nmorning of the scheduled transaction permitted the jury to infer\n\nthat appellants were those buyers. Moreover, Rubis reported in one\n\ncall that he was with the \"owners of the money,\" and he later\n\nappeared for the deal with Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero – and the\n\nmoney. Reyes-Guerrero's travel to the scene of the transaction, in\n\na vehicle containing a hidden compartment suitable for transporting\n\ndrugs, was his own conduct that has considerable significance in\n\nlight of the other evidence.    In addition, Rubis told Torres he\n\noriginally had arrived early for the transaction but then was\n\ndelayed because he had to wait for the buyers.   That explanation as\n\nrecounted by Torres – i.e., Rubis's early arrival and subsequent\n\nreturn – matched the observations of the Task Force agents on the\n\nscene.\n\n          The informant testimony, if believed by the jury, was\n\nparticularly damaging. Torres testified that Reyes-Guerrero nodded\n\nhis head when asked if he was ready to proceed with the deal,\n\nsignaling active participation.       Although Torres's report that\n\nReyes-Guerrero had helped to retrieve the box of money from behind\n\nthe driver's seat was more ambiguous, it was nonetheless additional\n\nevidence that the jury could have viewed as proof of Reyes-\n\nGuerrero's complicity in the transaction. The jury thus had before\n\nit sufficient evidence pointing to Reyes-Guerrero's guilt.\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f            Although a guilty verdict was not inevitable – as we\n\nexplain below – our rejection of Reyes-Guerrero's sufficiency claim\n\nis   not   inconsistent      with   our   decision   to   vacate   appellants'\n\nconvictions.        Our concerns, and the stakes, are considerably\n\ndifferent when we evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport a jury verdict than when we assess the impact of discrete\n\nevidentiary errors on that verdict.          If even the properly admitted\n\nevidence would not permit a reasonable jury to find guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, the government has failed to prove its case and\n\nthe defendant is entitled to acquittal.           If, instead, the properly\n\nadmitted    evidence    is    sufficient     to   prove   guilt,   but     other,\n\nerroneously admitted evidence might have influenced the verdict,\n\nour concern is that the defendant was denied a fair trial.                    The\n\nremedy in such circumstances is a new trial, not acquittal.\n\n            Here,    taking    into   account     only    the   evidence    whose\n\nadmission is not challenged, the record was sufficient for a jury\n\nto conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Reyes-Guerrero was more\n\nthan an innocent bystander to Rubis's transaction.                   Hence, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of his motion for acquittal.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            Appellants assert three evidence-related errors. Two are\n\nclaims of wrongful admission of testimony by Cruz: his overview\n\ntestimony identifying appellants as the buyers in the drug deal and\n\nhis report about his post-arrest interview with Rubis.               The third\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fclaim, raised only by Mieses, is that the court erred in refusing\n\nto admit a portion of the audiotape recorded on the day of the\n\nattempted cocaine purchase. We discuss the merits of each of these\n\ncontentions before turning to the question of harmless error.\n\nA. Cruz's Overview Testimony\n\n           In United States v. Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2009), we reviewed at length why the government must be wary of\n\nusing a law enforcement agent in a multi-defendant drug trial to\n\nprovide an \"overview\" of the prosecution's case, and we sharply\n\ncriticized the U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico for its\n\nrepeated improper use of the practice.     See id. at 16-27; see also\n\nUnited States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 117-20 (1st Cir. 2004).       Both\n\nFlores-de-Jesús and our earlier decision in Casas particularly\n\ncondemned testimony from an agent, not based on personal knowledge,\n\ndescribing the roles played in the drug conspiracy by individual\n\ndefendants.   Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d at 16, 24; Casas, 356 F.3d\n\nat 118-19.    Such descriptions amount to impermissible testimony\n\nfrom the agent \"that each of the defendants was guilty of the\n\nconspiracy charged.\"     Casas, 356 F.3d at 119 (quoted in Flores-de-\n\nJesús, 569 F.3d at 24).\n\n           In similar fashion to Flores-de-Jesús and Casas, the lead\n\nlaw enforcement officer in this case, Agent Cruz, was called as the\n\nfirst   witness   at   trial.   He   testified   to   the   step-by-step\n\nprogression of the investigation, describing the phone calls and\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fmeetings that culminated in the arrests at the shopping center. At\n\nthe end of the direct examination, after confirming that Cruz had\n\nlistened to all of the phone calls and audio recordings, conversed\n\nwith and supervised Torres, and watched the meetings between Rubis\n\nand Torres that were videotaped, the prosecutor asked Cruz what\n\nrole each individual had played in the conspiracy.    Cruz testified\n\nthat Rubis was \"a broker within the drug trafficking organization,\"\n\nMieses \"in this deal was one of the buyers,\" and Reyes-Guerrero was\n\n\"the other buyer.\"\n\n     Flores-de-Jesús was issued approximately four months after the\n\ntrial in this case, between appellants' filing of post-trial\n\nmotions for judgment of acquittal and the district court's ruling\n\non the motions.   In its decision on the motions, the district court\n\nobserved that Flores-de-Jesús had drawn \"clear boundaries between\n\npermissible and impermissible 'overview testimony' at the beginning\n\nof trial.\"   638 F. Supp. 2d at 188 (citing Flores-de-Jesús, 569\n\nF.3d at 19-20).      It concluded that, although a case agent may\n\ndescribe the course of an investigation to provide background\n\ninformation, Cruz's pronouncement that the defendants were the\n\nbuyers was plainly improper.    Id.    The testimony did not satisfy\n\nthe requirements for lay witness testimony under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 701, the court held, because it was \"not based squarely on\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fpersonal knowledge.\"       Id. at 189.12     Cruz was not a participant in\n\nthe attempted drug deal and, \"[i]mportantly, . . . was unable to\n\nhear any of the words allegedly spoken by the defendants at the\n\ntime the informant approached them to make the drug exchange.\" Id.\n\n     On appeal, appellants argue that the impermissible role-in-\n\nthe-offense testimony was reversible error entitling them to a new\n\ntrial.     The government insists that Cruz's testimony did not\n\nviolate    the   principles   outlined      in   Flores-de-Jesús     and   Casas\n\nbecause,    unlike   the    agents    in    those    cases,   Cruz    directly\n\nparticipated in every aspect of the investigation.            The government\n\nrecounts the evidence to which Cruz was directly exposed – the\n\nconversations and meetings between Rubis and Torres, and the\n\nencounter at the van – and argues that Cruz's \"testimony about\n\n[appellants'] roles as buyers was based on his perception of events\n\nthat he participated in and was therefore proper lay opinion\n\ntestimony under Rule 701.\"\n\n\n\n\n     12\n          Rule 701 provides:\n\n          If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the\n     witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences\n     is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a)\n     rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b)\n     helpful to a clear understanding of the witness'\n     testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and\n     (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other\n     specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 701.\n\n                                     -16-\n\f     The government is correct that this case differs from Flores-\n\nde-Jesús   and   Casas.     Those   cases    both   involved   wide-ranging\n\noverview testimony by law enforcement agents whose descriptions of\n\nthe conspiracies at issue relied heavily on information told to\n\nthem by others – i.e., on inadmissible hearsay – rather than on\n\ntheir own personal knowledge. See Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d at 24;\n\nCasas, 356 F.3d at 119.13    By contrast, Cruz played a hands-on role\n\nin nearly every aspect of the investigation underlying this case,\n\nand most of his testimony consisted of describing the sequence of\n\nevents that he had seen and heard.          Such testimony is permissible\n\nand \"valuable to provide background information and to explain how\n\nand why the agents even came to be involved with th[e] particular\n\ndefendant[s].\" Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d at 19 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (first alteration in original).14\n\n\n     13\n        Overview evidence often provides an anticipatory summary\nof the prosecution's case by previewing the testimony of other\nwitnesses. See Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d at 16-17. In Casas, the\ncircumstances were \"particularly problematic\" because the agent's\ntestimony \"was likely based on the testimony of a cooperating co-\nconspirator whom the government chose not to call at trial,\"\nleaving the defendants unable to cross-examine the cooperator or\n\"'challenge a conclusion drawn from what he had said.'\" Flores-de-\nJesús, 569 F.3d at 24 n.8 (quoting Casas, 356 F.3d at 119).\n     14\n       Although testimony explaining why the investigation turned\nits focus to a particular defendant is rarely competent evidence on\nthe principal question of whether the defendant is guilty, it can\nbe useful to avoid jury confusion and speculation as to why agents\nsuddenly began to conduct surveillance on the defendant. It can\ntherefore be acceptable despite its lack of relevance to the\nquestion of guilt or innocence, so long as it does not involve\ncommunicating incompetent and prejudicial information to the jury.\nAs we shall explain, the problems associated with evidence offered\n\n                                    -17-\n\f     In the way that matters to us here, however, this case is\n\nequivalent to Flores-de-Jesús and Casas. Appellants challenge only\n\nCruz's testimony announcing their roles in the conspiracy.                     In\n\nFlores-de-Jesús, we characterized the agent's role-in-the-offense\n\nconclusion as \"[t]he most troubling part\" of his testimony.                   See\n\n569 F.3d at 24.         We observed that, \"[w]hen a law enforcement\n\nwitness 'express[es] opinions as to defendants' culpability based\n\non the totality of information gathered in the course of their\n\ninvestigation[],'       these    conclusory       statements     often    involve\n\nimpermissible lay opinion testimony, without any basis in personal\n\nknowledge, about the role of the defendant in the conspiracy.\" Id.\n\nat 19 (quoting United States v. Garcia, 413 F.3d 201, 211 (2d Cir.\n\n2005) (second and third alterations in original)).\n\n     Cruz's opinion on the defendants' roles was flawed in part by\n\njust such a lack of personal knowledge.                  As the district court\n\npointed   out,   Cruz    did    not   see    or   hear    the   only   explicitly\n\ninculpatory conduct attributed to appellants – the interaction of\n\nMieses and Reyes-Guerrero with Rubis and Torres at the minivan.\n\nCruz admitted that his knowledge of appellants' interaction with\n\nRubis and Torres came solely from Torres: \"The informant is the\n\nonly one that can declare as to what happened there.\"                  Inevitably,\n\nTorres's report about what he had observed inside the vehicle – the\n\n\nto show the context of law enforcement actions can involve\nviolations of the hearsay rule or the Sixth Amendment. See infra\nPart II.B.\n\n                                      -18-\n\fmost harmful evidence in the case – was part of Cruz's calculus in\n\nascribing roles to the defendants in the conspiracy.15\n\n      Hence, we agree with the district court that Cruz's challenged\n\ntestimony failed, at least in part, to satisfy the requirement that\n\nlay   opinions   be   \"rationally   based   on   the   perception   of   the\n\nwitness,\" Fed. R. Evid. 701(a).       As the Second Circuit has noted,\n\nthe \"'traditional objective'\" of Rule 701 is \"to afford the trier\n\nof fact 'an accurate reproduction of the event' at issue.\" Garcia,\n\n413 F.3d at 211 (quoting advisory committee note on 1972 Proposed\n\nRules).    Cruz neither saw nor heard the critical episode in the\n\n\n      15\n       Before eliciting Cruz's opinion on Rubis's and appellants'\nroles, the prosecutor engaged in the following exchange with him:\n\n      Q: Did you listen to all the calls in this case?\n      A: Yes, sir.\n      . . .\n      Q: Did you have conversations with the informant\n      [Torres]?\n      A: Yes, sir.\n      Q: Did you supervise the informant?\n      A: Yes, sir.\n      Q: Did you listen to the audio recordings of any meetings\n      the informant had with [Rubis]?\n      A: Yes, sir.\n      Q: And did you watch the two meetings that we viewed here\n      today?\n      A: Yes, sir.\n\nThe prosecutor then asked what role each of the three men had\nplayed, \"[b]ased on everything you observed.\" In the context of\nthe questioning, a jury would almost surely understand that Cruz's\nresponse to this question was informed not only by what he had\n\"observed,\" but also by what he had heard in the audio recordings\nand what he had learned from his conversations with Torres,\nincluding an account of what happened in the minivan.        As we\nexplain infra, even if that assumption is incorrect, the result\nhere would be the same.\n\n                                    -19-\n\finvestigation, and his opinions as to defendants' roles in the\n\nconspiracy,   based   in   part   on     Torres's   perceptions   of   the\n\ninteraction, were thus inadmissible under Rule 701(a).16\n\n     Even if the government could argue that Cruz was capable of\n\ninferring appellants' roles based only on what he had personally\n\nobserved, his testimony would still be impermissible because it did\n\nnot satisfy Rule 701's requirement that lay opinion evidence be\n\n\"helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the\n\ndetermination of a fact in issue.\"       Fed. R. Evid. 701(b).    The nub\n\nof that requirement is to exclude testimony where \"'the witness is\n\nno better suited than the jury'\" to make the judgment at issue,\n\nUnited States v. Kornegay, 410 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Jackman, 48 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995)), providing\n\n\"'assurance[] against the admission of opinions which would merely\n\ntell the jury what result to reach,'\"       United States v. Kaplan, 490\n\nF.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Rea, 958\n\nF.2d 1206, 1215 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 704 advisory\n\ncommittee's note on 1972 Proposed Rules)).\n\n\n\n     16\n       Indeed, the government's attempt on appeal to justify Cruz's\ntestimony as lay opinion within the scope of Rule 701 is\ninconsistent with its argument at trial. When the defense objected\nto the offer of Cruz's interpretation of the events, the government\nresponded: \"This witness was supervising the informant. He told\nhim exactly what to do. He was on surveillance many, many times.\nHe heard the phone calls. . . . So he's a fact witness.\" Given\nCruz's lack of personal knowledge and other problems discussed\ninfra, his role-in-the-offense testimony did not qualify as either\nfact evidence or proper lay opinion.\n\n                                  -20-\n\f       Cruz had no insight to offer the jurors based on personal\n\nknowledge of the appellants' inculpatory conduct.                   Like them, he\n\nhad to rely on Torres's account of what occurred in the vehicle.\n\nLike them, he heard the audio recordings of the phone calls.\n\nAlthough he was present at the scene when surveillance videotapes\n\nwere recorded, the jurors watched the tapes of those encounters,\n\nallowing them to see what Cruz had seen.                Indeed, when asked on\n\ncross-examination why he concluded that Mieses was a buyer, Cruz\n\nresponded: \"Because Mr. Meises and Mr. [Reyes-]Guerrero were the\n\ntwo    that   were   in    custody   of   the   money    at   the   time   of    the\n\nintervention. They were the two that were protecting that money so\n\nnothing would happen to it.\"               In other words, Cruz inferred\n\nappellants' roles not from any direct knowledge, but from the same\n\ncircumstantial evidence that was before the jury – effectively\n\nusurping the jury's role as fact-finder.17 Moreover, as used by the\n\ngovernment, the testimony amounted to argumentative interpretation.\n\nIt    was   perfectly     appropriate     for   the   prosecutor    to   argue   in\n\nsummation that the evidence of the defendants' actions and words\n\nsupported the inference that they were the buyers. But having Cruz\n\nso testify amounted to simply dressing up argument as evidence.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n        Notably, Cruz's explanation relied on two levels of\ninference beyond the undisputed fact that appellants arrived in the\nvehicle with the cash: first, that appellants were guarding the\nmoney and, second, that the money belonged to them.         Neither\ninference was based on conduct observed by Cruz.\n\n                                        -21-\n\f      The difference between Cruz's information and the base of\n\nknowledge necessary to make a lay opinion helpful to the jury in a\n\ncase such as this is apparent when the circumstances here are\n\ncontrasted with a scenario described by the Second Circuit in\n\nGarcia:\n\n      [W]hen an undercover agent participates in a hand-to-hand\n      drug exchange with a number of persons, the agent may\n      well testify that, in his opinion, a particular\n      participant,   \"X,\" was     the  person   directing   the\n      transaction. Such an opinion is based on his personal\n      perception of such subjective factors as the respect\n      various participants showed \"X,\" their deference to \"X\"\n      when he spoke, and their consummation of the deal only\n      upon a subtly signaled approval by \"X.\" By allowing the\n      agent to state his opinion as to a person's role in such\n      circumstances, Rule 701 affords the jury an insight into\n      an event that was uniquely available to an eyewitness.\n\n413 F.3d at 211-12.      Cruz, as he admitted himself, was not an\n\neyewitness with unique access to appellants' conduct; his testimony\n\ncould only have replaced, rather than aided, the jury's assessment\n\nof   the   evidence.18   It   was   thus   not   admissible   lay   opinion\n\ntestimony.    See Garcia, 413 F.3d at 213-14 (explaining that jurors\n\nare not \"'helped' within the meaning of Rule 701 by opinion\n\ntestimony that, in addition to telling them 'what was in the\n\nevidence,' also told them 'what inferences to draw from it'\"\n\n(quoting United States v. Grinage, 390 F.3d 746, 750 (2d Cir.\n\n\n      18\n        We note that the opinion of the law enforcement agent\ndescribed by the court in Garcia concerns an individual's\nobservable role in relation to other participants at the scene of\na drug transaction, not the individual's overall role in the\nconspiracy. The latter would be more likely to rest on evidence\nbeyond the agent's perceptions at the scene.\n\n                                    -22-\n\f2004));       see    also   4   Jack   B.   Weinstein    &   Margaret   A.    Berger,\n\nWeinstein's Federal Evidence § 701.05 (Joseph M. McLaughlin, ed.,\n\n2d ed. 2011) (noting that, to protect the jury's role as fact-\n\nfinder, courts must be wary of lay opinion testimony whose \"sole\n\nfunction is to answer the same question that the trier of fact is\n\nto consider in its deliberations\"); Garcia, 413 F.3d at 210-11.\n\n       The usurpation problem that arises when a witness testifies to\n\nopinions based on evidence that was also available to the jurors is\n\ncompounded when the witness is a government agent whose testimony\n\n– as here – is effectively a judgment on the question of guilt or\n\ninnocence.           This is one variant of the imprimatur problem we\n\ndescribed       in    Flores-de-Jesús        and   Casas.     There,    we    focused\n\nprimarily on our concern that the government agent's preview of\n\nother witnesses' testimony would endorse their testimony \"in what\n\ncan only be viewed as an attempt by the government to bolster the\n\ncredibility of those later witnesses.\"                  See Flores-de-Jesús, 569\n\nF.3d at 26; see also id. at 17-19; Casas, 356 F.3d at 120.19\n\n       Although the vouching concern also exists here to the extent\n\nthat        Cruz's    role-in-the-offense          opinion   implicitly      endorsed\n\nTorres's later testimony describing appellants' conduct in the\n\n\n\n       19\n        As we observed in Flores-de-Jesús, the government is\nparticularly eager for such testimony in drug conspiracy cases\n\"where so much of the government's case relies on the often\nproblematic testimony of confidential informants with unsavory\npasts or cooperating co-defendants with myriad credibility\nproblems.\" 569 F.3d at 26-27.\n\n                                            -23-\n\fminivan, the problem with Cruz's testimony extends beyond vouching\n\nfor what the jury may perceive as a less credible witness.                         The\n\njurors were told that, based on the same evidence before them, an\n\nexperienced government agent had rejected appellants' mere presence\n\ndefense   and    concluded      that    they       were       participants    in   the\n\nconspiracy.      Given    the   effect   on    juries         of    the   government's\n\nimprimatur, see Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d at 18; Casas, 356 F.3d at\n\n120, it was patently unfair for Cruz to present his view of\n\nappellants'     culpability.      \"It    is    .    .     .   the   jury's    singular\n\nresponsibility to decide from the evidence admitted at trial\n\nwhether the government has carried its burden of proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"       Garcia, 413 F.3d at 215; see also Grinage, 390\n\nF.3d at 751 (\"[T]he agent was presented to the jury with an aura of\n\nexpertise and authority which increased the risk that the jury\n\nwould be swayed by his testimony, rather than rely on its own\n\ninterpretation . . . .\").20\n\n     In sum, Cruz's testimony about appellants' roles in the June\n\n27 transaction lacked a foundation of personal knowledge of facts\n\nessential to his opinion, usurped the jury's fact-finding function,\n\n\n\n\n     20\n        Cruz's law enforcement experience, of course, was not an\nappropriate basis for his opinions as a lay witness. See Garcia,\n413 F.3d at 216-17. Nor would the opinion have been proper if Cruz\nhad been qualified as an expert, which he was not. As we said\nabout similar testimony in Casas, Cruz's \"testimony that particular\npersons were members of the conspiracy was not an appropriate\nsubject for expert testimony.\" 356 F.3d at 120.\n\n                                       -24-\n\fand improperly endorsed the government's theory of the case.\n\nHence, it is beyond debate that the testimony was wrongly admitted.\n\nB. Cruz's Testimony about the Post-Arrest Interview of Rubis\n\n     1.      Background\n\n     During     cross-examination     of    Agent   Cruz,    Reyes-Guerrero's\n\ncounsel elicited the fact that Reyes-Guerrero was not a target of\n\nthe Task Force investigation until the day of the arrests.                  Cruz\n\nspecifically acknowledged that Reyes-Guerrero's name did not appear\n\nin the four or five official investigative reports – known as \"DEA-\n\n6 reports\" – that were prepared before that day.                    On redirect\n\nexamination by the government, Cruz confirmed that Reyes-Guerrero's\n\nname did appear in the last such report, \"the arrest report.\"              When\n\nthe prosecutor followed up by asking about the contents of that\n\nreport, defense counsel objected and the court convened a bench\n\nconference.\n\n     The final DEA report described the post-arrest interview of\n\nRubis   by    Cruz   and   another   Task   Force   agent.     In    the   bench\n\nconference, the prosecutor explained that he would not try to\n\n\"elicit the actual statements\" uttered by Rubis in the interview,\n\napparently recognizing that such testimony would trigger hearsay\n\nand Confrontation Clause problems.            Rather, he would ask about\n\nRubis's offer to cooperate, whether he was interviewed outside the\n\npresence of the others, \"[a]nd what did [Cruz] do after the meeting\n\nwas over.\"     Reyes-Guerrero's counsel protested that evidence about\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fthe interview would be hearsay because the prosecutor was \"trying\n\nto establish the truth of the matter asserted,\" and he emphasized\n\nthat \"Rubis is not here.\"\n\n     The district court, after suggesting that any statement from\n\nRubis would be admissible as a statement by a co-conspirator,21\n\nallowed the prosecutor to proceed.     The following exchange then\n\noccurred:\n\n     Q: Agent Cruz, the DEA-6 that I just asked you about,\n     without saying what is in that DEA-6, specifically, the\n     whole report, what's it about?\n     A: That report is an interview that was made to Mr. Rubis\n     Dario after the arrest.\n     Q: After all three were arrested?\n     A: Yes, after all three were arrested.\n     . . .\n     Q: Okay. Where were these two individuals while you were\n     interviewing him?\n     A: These two individuals were in the cell at the office.\n     Q: Why were they not in the interview?\n     A: Because the interview was being carried out with Mr.\n     Rubis only and with us because he had the intention of\n     cooperating with us.\n     Q: After this interview, did the targets of your\n     investigation at this point change?\n     A: Yes, sir.\n     Q: Okay. After this interview, what did you decide to do\n     with Defendant [Reyes-Guerrero]?\n\nCruz then testified that the defendants were processed and taken to\n\na federal detention facility.\n\n\n\n\n     21\n       There is no question that the hearsay exception for co-\nconspirator statements made \"during the course and in furtherance\nof the conspiracy,\" Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), does not apply to\nRubis's post-arrest statements. See United States v. Lombard, 72\nF.3d 170, 189 n.25 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                -26-\n\f       On appeal, appellants argue that Cruz implicitly testified\n\nthat Rubis had identified them as co-conspirators, and they assert\n\nthat the indirect admission of Rubis's statement violated their\n\nrights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as\n\ndescribed in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).        Under\n\nCrawford, the admission of testimonial hearsay against a defendant\n\nis prohibited unless the declarant is unavailable to testify at\n\ntrial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine\n\nhim.        Id. at 68; United States v. Castro-Davis, 612 F.3d 53, 64\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).       Although Rubis was unavailable, having become a\n\nfugitive, appellants had no prior opportunity to question him about\n\nhis interview statements.22\n\n       We begin our assessment of this claim with the government's\n\ncontention that the Crawford issue was not preserved.\n\n       2.     Forfeiture\n\n       The government argues that neither appellant may pursue a\n\nConfrontation Clause challenge on appeal because Reyes-Guerrero\n\nobjected at trial on hearsay grounds, without referencing the\n\nConfrontation Clause or Crawford, and Mieses did not object at all.\n\n\n\n\n       22\n       Mieses mistakenly invokes Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S.\n123 (1968), which addresses the admission of a non-testifying\ncodefendant's out-of-court statements in a joint trial. Rubis was\nnot tried with Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero, and \"a literal Bruton\nobjection\" therefore \"ma[kes] no sense.\" United States v. Cabrera-\nRivera, 583 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 2009).     We thus construe his\nConfrontation Clause claim as a Crawford challenge. See id.\n\n                                   -27-\n\f       We can easily dispatch the argument as to Reyes-Guerrero.\n\nAlthough the government accurately recites our precedent holding\n\nthat    an    objection     on    hearsay    grounds       will    not    preserve    a\n\nConfrontation Clause claim, see United States v. Rivera-Rodríguez,\n\n617 F.3d 581, 594 (1st Cir. 2010), we have in the past looked to\n\nthe    full    context     of    counsel's      colloquy    with    the    court     in\n\ndetermining      whether    a    Crawford    challenge      was    preserved.        In\n\nCabrera-Rivera, for example, we found it \"obvious that counsel was\n\nobjecting to [defendant's] inability to confront the declarant\"\n\nwhere counsel had pointed to the declarant's unavailability at\n\ntrial.       See 583 F.3d at 36 (citing counsel's statement that the\n\ndeclarant \"is not here to --\").              We therefore concluded that the\n\ndefendant had preserved his Confrontation Clause claim. Here, too,\n\ncounsel      plainly   raised     both   hearsay    and     Confrontation      Clause\n\nconcerns.       See, e.g., Tr. Transcript (Feb. 19, 2009), at 10\n\n(\"Because Rubis is not here, and . . . the attorney is trying to\n\nestablish the truth of the matter asserted because of this.\")\n\n(emphasis added); id. at 10-11 (\"There's a . . . thin line, your\n\nHonor, and it might . . . this hearsay information, your Honor, we\n\ndon't know which context it happens;              and, also, Mr. Rubis, again,\n\nis not here.\") (emphasis added).23\n\n\n       23\n       As a practical matter, the same underlying concerns would\nbe at play if we addressed the testimony at issue here solely as a\nhearsay problem, see United States v. Gomez, 617 F.3d 88, 96-97 (2d\nCir. 2010), and we would reach the same outcome. See also United\nStates v. Dukagjini, 326 F.3d 45, 56 n.6 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting\n\n                                         -28-\n\f       Mieses's counsel, by contrast, was largely silent throughout\n\nthe exchange on this issue.                 He participated in the sidebar\n\nconference discussing the proposed testimony, however, and voiced\n\nhis agreement that the prejudice from the line of questioning\n\noutweighed its probative value. In context, where the interests of\n\nboth defendants were identical, we are satisfied that Mieses's\n\ncounsel incorporated Reyes-Guerrero's more fully stated objection\n\ninto his brief comment.\n\n       We thus afford plenary review to both appellants' claims.                  We\n\ngenerally      review     preserved       evidentiary     errors   for    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion, but \"[w]e review de novo whether the strictures of the\n\nConfrontation Clause have been met.\" Rivera-Rodríguez, 617 F.3d at\n\n590 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       3.    Analysis\n\n       Out-of-court statements excluded from evidence under Crawford\n\nmust   be    both     testimonial     –    i.e.,    statements     an    objectively\n\nreasonable declarant could have anticipated would be used at trial\n\n–   and     offered     for   their   truth,       thus   constituting     hearsay.\n\nCrawford, 541 U.S. at 51-52; id. at 59 n.9; Castro-Davis, 612 F.3d\n\nat 65.      It is not disputed that Rubis's assertions in his post-\n\n\nthat the hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause \"'are generally\ndesigned to protect similar values,'\" though \"the Supreme Court has\n'been careful not to equate' them\" (quoting Idaho v. Wright, 497\nU.S. 805, 814 (1990)); Ryan v. Miller, 303 F.3d 231, 247 (2d Cir.\n2002) (\"[A]ccusatory assertions introduced without the testimony of\nthe accuser not only violate the Confrontation Clause, but they\nalso violate rules against hearsay.\").\n\n                                          -29-\n\farrest interview were testimonial. The government also appears to\n\naccept that testimony revealing an \"actual statement[]\" by Rubis\n\nabout appellants' complicity in the drug deal would be inadmissible\n\nhearsay.   It seeks to defeat appellants' Crawford claim on two\n\nother grounds: (1) no actual statement, and thus no improper\n\nhearsay, was introduced into evidence, and (2) Reyes-Guerrero's\n\ncounsel opened the door to the challenged testimony.24\n\n           a.   No Statement\n\n     In the pertinent portion of the challenged exchange, Cruz was\n\nasked, in essence, if Rubis had said anything during his interview\n\nthat changed the targets of the investigation and prompted the\n\ndefendants' arrests.   Cruz answered affirmatively.   The government\n\nmaintains that the prosecutor's examination was \"adroitly focused\n\n. . . on the actions that Agent Cruz took after speaking to Rubis,\"\n\n\n\n     24\n        The government cites precedent for the proposition that\n\"[s]tatements offered for the limited purpose of showing what\neffect the statement had on the listener are not hearsay,\" but it\nmakes no direct argument that we should view any statement by Rubis\nas nonhearsay. See Brief of the United States at 53 (citing United\nStates v. Cruz-Díaz, 550 F.3d 169, 176 (1st Cir. 2008); United\nStates v. Bailey, 270 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 2001)). Instead, in\nthe sentence immediately following its citations to Cruz-Díaz and\nBailey, the government asserts that \"[t]here was no violation here\nbecause Rubis's statement was not introduced.\" Even if we were to\ngenerously view the government to be arguing, alternatively, that\nadmission of Rubis's statement was permissible because it was not\noffered for the truth of the matter asserted, that argument would\nbe unavailing. As we shall explain, the government offered the\nevidence about Cruz's interview of Rubis to rebut an inference that\nReyes-Guerrero was not a participant in the crime – i.e., for the\ntruth of Rubis's implicit statement that Reyes-Guerrero and Mieses\nwere involved.\n\n                               -30-\n\fwhile appellants argue that \"[n]o juror of normal intelligence,\n\nhearing this exchange, could have failed to get the prosecutor's\n\npoint that Rubis, in his statement to the agents, had implicated\n\n[him] as a co-conspirator.\"        Reyes-Guerrero Brief at 21; see also\n\nMieses Brief at 32.        Appellants assert that \"the import of this\n\ntestimony is no less clear than if Rubis had been directly quoted.\"\n\nReyes-Guerrero Reply Brief at 5.\n\n       We agree with appellants that a reasonable jury could only\n\nhave understood Cruz to have communicated that Rubis had identified\n\nappellants    as   participants    in    the     drug   deal.     It   makes   no\n\ndifference that the government took care not to introduce Rubis's\n\n\"actual statements.\"       Although the government could properly seek\n\nto rebut Reyes-Guerrero's suggestion that the appellants were\n\ninnocent bystanders, it did so with testimony that plainly told the\n\njurors that Rubis said they were co-conspirators rather than with\n\nthe    available    evidence     circumstantially         pointing     to   their\n\nculpability.\n\n       In United States v. Maher, 454 F.3d 13 (1st Cir. 2006), we\n\ndeclined to discuss Crawford's applicability to \"testimony from\n\nwhich . . . the jury would necessarily infer that the declarant had\n\nsaid   X,   but    which   did   not    itself    quote   or    paraphrase     the\n\ndeclarant's statements.\"         Id. at 20-21.          We observed that the\n\ndefendant in that case had made \"no effort to explain why Crawford\n\nshould be read to extend\" to such statements.               Id. at 21.      Here,\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fthe issue is addressed head-on by both appellants.                   We conclude\n\nthat the right to cross-examine an out-of-court accuser applies\n\nwith full force in the circumstances of this case.\n\n         The opportunity to cross-examine the declarant \"to tease out\n\nthe truth,\" Crawford, 541 U.S. at 67, is no less vital when a\n\nwitness      indirectly,      but   still     unmistakably,    recounts     a    co-\n\ndefendant's out-of-court accusation.              The concerns animating the\n\nright to confrontation are especially acute when the statement at\n\nissue originates from an ex parte examination by a law enforcement\n\nofficer.      See Crawford, 541 U.S. at 50-51; id. at 51 (\"An accuser\n\nwho makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony\n\nin   a    sense    that   a   person    who   makes   a   casual   remark   to    an\n\nacquaintance does not.\").              Hence, if what the jury hears is, in\n\nsubstance,        an   untested,    out-of-court      accusation    against      the\n\ndefendant, particularly if the inculpatory statement is made to law\n\nenforcement authorities, the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to\n\nconfront the declarant is triggered.              Accord Ryan v. Miller, 303\n\nF.3d 231, 249 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"If the substance of the prohibited\n\ntestimony is evident even though it was not introduced in the\n\nprohibited form, the testimony is still inadmissible.\"); United\n\nStates v. Reyes, 18 F.3d 65, 69 (2d Cir. 1994) (\"[A]lthough the\n\njury was not told exactly what words [the co-defendants] had\n\nspoken, [the witness's] testimony clearly conveyed the substance of\n\nwhat they had said.\").\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\f     Indeed, any other conclusion would permit the government to\n\nevade the limitations of the Sixth Amendment and the Rules of\n\nEvidence by weaving an unavailable declarant's statements into\n\nanother witness's testimony by implication.25 The government cannot\n\nbe permitted to \"circumvent the Confrontation Clause by introducing\n\nthe same substantive testimony in a different form.\"     Ryan, 303\n\n\n     25\n        This risk of violation of the hearsay rule or the\nConfrontation Clause reinforces the importance of prosecutors\nunderstanding the limitations on so-called background or context\nevidence. If, for example, such evidence includes the fact that a\nknown participant in the crime was observed conferring in\nsuspicious circumstances with the defendant, it can be useful and\nacceptable for the investigating agent to explain that he began to\nwatch the defendant because of this observed meeting. It does not\nfollow, however, that the objective of explaining why the agent\nfocused on the defendant – or why the agent proceeded to arrest the\ndefendant – justifies prejudicial hearsay testimony. See Maher,\n454 F.3d at 20 (\"[I]nvestigating officers . . . should not . . . be\nallowed to relate historical aspects of the case, such as\ncomplaints and reports of others containing inadmissible hearsay.\nSuch statements are sometimes erroneously admitted under the\nargument that the officers are entitled to give the information\nupon which they acted.\").\n     We take it to be common ground that the government may not\nhave an agent testify, \"X told us that the defendant was involved\nin the crime.\"      Quoting X's out-of-court accusation remains\nimpermissible if the agent's testimony is changed to say, \"We began\nto investigate the defendant because X told us that the defendant\nwas involved in the crime,\" and the government seeks to justify it\nby arguing that X's out-of-court statement was offered not for its\ntruth but only to explain why the agent focused on (or arrested)\nthe defendant. Nor does the result change if, instead of quoting\nthe out-of-court statement, the government communicates its content\nto the jury by implication.     In such instances, the relatively\nminor \"probative value [of the evidence of why the agent began\nsurveillance or made an arrest] is substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice\" that results from communicating the\naccusatory hearsay to the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 403; see also Maher,\n454 F.3d at 20 (\"The need for this evidence is slight, and the\nlikelihood of misuse great.\" (quoting 2 Broun, et al., McCormick on\nEvidence § 249, at 103 (5th ed. 1999)(emphasis omitted)).\n\n                               -33-\n\fF.3d at 248; see also, e.g., Mason v. Scully, 16 F.3d 38, 43 (2d\n\nCir. 1994) (\"The fact that the content of [the co-conspirator's]\n\nstatement    to    [the   detective]    was    not   revealed    in    detail   was\n\nimmaterial, for the plain implication that the prosecutor sought to\n\nelicit . . . was that the conversation . . . led the police to\n\nfocus on [the defendant].\"); People v. Cruz, 474 N.Y.S.2d 142, 144\n\n(N.Y. App. Div. 1984) (\"The prosecutor's questioning of [the\n\nwitness] concerning a conversation with [a non-testifying witness],\n\nwhich directly preceded [the witness's] testimony that he made two\n\narrests in the case was improper inasmuch as it was designed to\n\ncreate the impression in the jurors' minds that [the non-testifying\n\nwitness] had implicated the defendant . . . .\"); People v. Felder,\n\n485 N.Y.S.2d 576, 577 (N.Y. App. Div. 1985) (finding error where\n\nwitness testified that \"the complainant made a response following\n\nwhich 'we patted down both subjects, placed them in handcuffs, and\n\nremoved     them   from    the   bar,'\"       because    \"[e]ven      though    [the\n\ncomplainant's]      response     was   not    admitted    into     evidence,     the\n\ntestimony left the jurors with the clear impression that . . . the\n\narrests were made as a result of this response\").\n\n     We therefore reject the government's argument that Cruz's\n\ntestimony was proper because it omitted \"the actual statements\"\n\nmade by Rubis.      See Maher, 454 F.3d at 23 (\"[W]e are on firm ground\n\nin warning prosecutors of the risks they face in backdoor attempts\n\n\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\fto get statements by non-testifying confidential informants before\n\na jury.\").\n\n            b.    The Opened Door\n\n      The government suggests that, even if Cruz's testimony about\n\nthe interview indirectly resulted in the introduction of an out-of-\n\ncourt statement, the testimony was nonetheless proper to rebut\n\nReyes-Guerrero's cross-examination eliciting the fact that the two\n\ndefendants were never mentioned in the investigative reports prior\n\nto the incident at the van.         In the sidebar discussion following\n\nReyes-Guerrero's objection at trial, the prosecutor stated that he\n\nhad avoided referring to the interview in his direct questioning\n\nbut defense counsel's focus on Reyes-Guerrero's absence from the\n\nDEA reports had triggered a need for the testimony.\n\n      The   government's     argument    on   this   issue   borders    on   the\n\nfrivolous.       The testimony elicited by Reyes-Guerrero's counsel\n\nabout the early DEA reports was proper evidence in support of\n\nappellants' mere presence defense, showing that appellants had not\n\npreviously    been   known    to   law   enforcement    authorities.         The\n\ngovernment does not explain in its brief how that testimony opened\n\nthe door to evidence on the content of Rubis's interview.                    At\n\ntrial, the prosecutor asserted that the evidence was necessary\n\nrebuttal because, in context, the questioning on the early reports\n\nwas   \"diminishing     [appellants']     culpability.\"        That     may   be.\n\nDefendants are entitled to cross-examine government witnesses in an\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\feffort to diminish their own culpability, and the government is\n\nentitled to counter with appropriate rebuttal evidence.        The\n\nevidence of appellants' absence from the earlier reports was\n\nneither inaccurate nor misleading, and the government did not\n\ncontend otherwise. The government could properly have countered by\n\nshowing, for example, that appellants did appear in the final\n\nreport, which was prepared after the incident at the van and\n\ndescribed the transaction.   By no means, however, did the cross-\n\nexamination testimony require or justify rebuttal that violated the\n\nConfrontation Clause.\n\n     Moreover, the government's rationale essentially acknowledges\n\nthat the evidence of Rubis's accusation of complicity was offered\n\nto establish the truth of the accusation – i.e., that appellants\n\nwere participants in the drug transaction, notwithstanding the\n\nsilence of the early reports. Hence, admission of Cruz's testimony\n\nabout the interview was improper.\n\nC. Harmless Error\n\n     Both appellants argue that the errors described above entitle\n\nthem to a new trial.    Reyes-Guerrero asserts that admission of\n\nCruz's overview testimony and the indirect admission of Rubis's\n\nout-of-court statements each is reversible error on its own, and\n\nMieses additionally argues that the multiple errors require the\n\ngrant of a new trial under the cumulative error doctrine.      See\n\n\n\n\n                               -36-\n\fUnited States v. Meserve, 271 F.3d 314, 331-32 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     The    inquiry   to    determine    whether   cumulative    errors    are\n\nharmless is the same as for individual error, Meserve, 271 F.3d at\n\n332, and we therefore think it most efficient to move beyond\n\nindividual analyses of harmlessness to consider the combined effect\n\nof the two erroneously admitted portions of Cruz's testimony. \"The\n\nadmission of improper testimony is harmless if it is 'highly\n\nprobable that the error did not influence the verdict.'\"             Flores-\n\nde-Jesús, 569 F.3d at 27 (quoting Casas, 356 F.3d at 121).26               The\n\ngovernment bears the burden to establish harmlessness, id., and the\n\ninquiry    requires   a    case-specific    examination    of   factors   that\n\ninclude \"the centrality of the tainted material,\" its prejudicial\n\nimpact, and any other indications that \"the error affected the\n\nfactfinder's resolution of a material issue.\"             Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d\n\nat 1182 (quoted in Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d at 27); see also\n\nCabrera-Rivera, 583 F.3d at 36.\n\n     Without    question,      as   we   described   in addressing Reyes-\n\nGuerrero's sufficiency claim, there was ample evidence aside from\n\n\n\n     26\n        Constitutional errors, such as a Confrontation Clause\nviolation, require reversal unless shown to be harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. See Cabrera-Rivera, 583 F.3d at 36. In this\ncase, we use the non-constitutional standard that is more favorable\nto the government because our harmless error analysis embraces both\nconstitutional and non-constitutional errors. The government is\nunable to meet that easier test for showing harmlessness and,\nhence, it could not meet the more exacting constitutional standard.\n\n                                     -37-\n\fCruz's improper testimony from which a reasonable factfinder could\n\ninfer    that   appellants         played       the     roles   that    Cruz    and    Rubis\n\nattributed to them.           We strongly doubt, however, that the jury was\n\nunaffected by Cruz's improper testimony, which communicated to the\n\njurors that Cruz, an experienced drug investigator, and Rubis, who\n\nadmitted his guilt, had both identified appellants as participants\n\nin the conspiracy.           We have recognized the \"'devastating'\" impact\n\nof a co-defendant's extrajudicial statements, Cabrera-Rivera, 583\n\nF.3d at 37 (quoting Bruton, 391 U.S. at 136), and an essential\n\npremise of our warnings about overview evidence is that jurors view\n\nthe     testimony       of     law     enforcement         officers        as   especially\n\nauthoritative, see Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d at 17-18.\n\n      Importantly,           the     prosecution         depended      heavily    on    the\n\nbelievability       of       Torres,      a    paid     government     informant.        In\n\nevaluating harmless error, we cannot presume the jury would have\n\naccepted     his    testimony        as       readily    without     the    corroboration\n\nprovided by Cruz's testimony.                   Indeed, consistent with standard\n\npractice for informant witnesses, the court instructed the jurors\n\nto consider Torres's testimony with caution.                     See Flores-de-Jesús,\n\n569   F.3d   at    26    (noting       the      \"often    problematic       testimony    of\n\nconfidential informants with unsavory pasts\").\n\n      The other evidence of appellants' knowing involvement was\n\nsuggestive, but not overwhelming.                     In recorded calls on the day of\n\nthe arrests, Rubis said he was with the buyers, but he did not\n\n\n                                               -38-\n\fidentify them by name.          Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero were seated in\n\nthe front of the minivan, while the known conspirator – and the\n\nmoney     –   were   in   the   back.     That   vehicle,    with   its   hidden\n\ncompartment, was not registered to either appellant, and the\n\ncompartment was not visible to the driver or passengers.27                  Cruz\n\ntestified that the video taken of the attempted drug deal does not\n\nshow Mieses talking at all – despite Torres's testimony that Mieses\n\nmade several incriminating statements. The jury in fact heard none\n\nof the recorded conversations among the men that day – including\n\nRubis's statement, reported by Torres, that the owners of the money\n\nwere in the car – because the audio recording was not introduced\n\ninto evidence.\n\n     The government's heavy reliance on the informant's credibility\n\nmade the overview evidence particularly damaging in this case.               In\n\neffect, the jurors were told it was unnecessary to make their own\n\nassessment of Torres's credibility because Cruz did it for them\n\nwhen he announced unequivocally that appellants were \"the owners\"\n\nof the money. Rubis's accusation validated Cruz's assessment. See\n\nUnited States v. Gomez, 617 F.3d 88, 97 (2d Cir. 2010) (\"The\n\nimproperly      admitted    evidence    had    substantial   weight   precisely\n\n\n\n     27\n       The minivan was inspected by DEA Task Force Agent Victor\nJavier Salgado-Betancourt, who was trained to find secret\ncompartments in motor vehicles.     He testified that the hidden\ncompartment he discovered was designed to open only when several\nbuttons or components inside the vehicle were activated at the same\ntime.\n\n                                        -39-\n\fbecause it went to the core of the government's case against [the\n\ndefendant], placing an unimpeachable accusation before the jury.\").\n\n     In sum, the tainted evidence was central to the prosecution's\n\ncase and potentially disastrous to the appellants' defense of mere\n\npresence.    The contested statements were not \"'cumulative of other\n\ncompelling proof'\" that the defendants \"'committed the charged\n\n[crime],'\" United States v. Earle, 488 F.3d 537, 546 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Barthelho,\n\n129 F.3d 663, 670 (1st Cir. 1997)); rather, Cruz's testimony sealed\n\nany gap the jury may have perceived between the circumstantial\n\nevidence and a finding of guilt.           Hence, we cannot say that it is\n\n\"highly   probable\"      that   the    errors   did   not   affect    the   jury's\n\nresolution    of   the    case     and,   accordingly,      we   conclude    that\n\nappellants are entitled to a new trial.\n\nD. Exclusion of the Audiotape\n\n     Our conclusion that appellants' convictions must be vacated\n\nbased   on   the   overview      and   Sixth    Amendment    errors    makes    it\n\nunnecessary to rule on Mieses's contention that the district court\n\nerred in excluding the audio recording made by informant Torres on\n\nthe day of the arrests.         Because the issue is likely to arise again\n\nin the new trial, however, we see value in examining this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\f      Torres   testified   that     Mieses   made   several   incriminating\n\nstatements during their encounter at the van,28 and Mieses's counsel\n\nsought to cross-examine Torres with the recording, which all\n\nparties agreed did not contain either defendant's voice.                  When\n\ncounsel asked for a ten-minute break during cross-examination to\n\nfind the relevant portion of the one-hour recording, the government\n\nobjected that the tape was incomplete and therefore both misleading\n\nand prejudicial.     The prosecutor also protested that the recording\n\nwas   inadmissible   without   an    English   translation.         The   court\n\nrejected admission of the recording, stating: \"I don't see any\n\nreason why I should admit this tape . . . .          [T]his is too little,\n\ntoo late.\"\n\n      Mieses's   counsel   again    urged    admission   of   the   recording\n\nfollowing the government's redirect examination of Torres. Counsel\n\nemphasized that \"[t]he most important factor in this case is what\n\nwas said inside that van,\" and \"the most important thing is that\n\nthe voice[s] of the Defendants are not heard there.\"                The court\n\nlistened to the recording at counsel's request, but then reaffirmed\n\nits initial decision, noting that it was \"clear from all the\n\ntestimony\" that the defendants' voices were \"not heard in any\n\ntape.\"\n\n\n\n      28\n        As described in Section I, Torres testified that Mieses\nreported that the shoe box in the van contained $100,000, and he\nasked Torres about \"the merchandise,\" as well as \"how are we going\nto do this.\"\n\n                                     -41-\n\f     Mieses presses an argument on appeal that was implicit in the\n\nobjections raised at trial, but not fully articulated there.    He\n\nargues that the crucial aspect of the recording is not that the\n\ndefendants' voices are absent – a fact that no one disputes.\n\nRather, he asserts that the jurors needed to hear the recording so\n\nthey could decide whether – as Torres claimed – the audio was\n\nfaulty, or whether Torres had fabricated the exchange in the\n\nminivan. Stressing the plausibility of the latter view during oral\n\nargument on appeal, defense counsel noted that, at a minimum, the\n\nrecorder should have picked up the statements that Torres claimed\n\nto have made to appellants.29    Mieses insists that a translated\n\ntranscript of the recording should not have been a prerequisite for\n\nits admission because the issue was not what was said on the tape,\n\nbut why the conversation described by Torres was not there – a\n\nquestion of recording quality, not content.\n\n     Indeed, the government made much of the supposedly faulty\n\nequipment in its closing argument, emphasizing that the critical\n\nconversation was unavailable to be played for the jurors through no\n\nfault of its own:\n\n     Couldn't get an audio of it. Agent Cruz explained to you\n     why. The wind was blowing. The equipment didn't half\n     work. . . . Electronics are that way. This equipment is\n     not perfect. People are not perfect. And how many times\n     in this trial did our equipment not work? How many times\n\n\n     29\n       When asked what is audible on the tape, counsel stated that\nTorres and Rubis could be heard talking as they approached the van\nand as they walked away from the van.\n\n                                -42-\n\f       does your cell phone drop a call?                Think about your\n       common experience as an individual.\n\n            We could not get what happened in that van on audio.\n       Sure, I'd love to be able to play that to you. But that\n       doesn't take away what the informant – the man that sat\n       there – who was cross-examined for hours and hours and\n       hours. He didn't want to be here. His family didn't\n       want him here.     You heard the testimony.       But he\n       testified to you what exactly went on in that van.\n\nMieses's claim of error, briefly stated, is that exclusion of the\n\naudio    recording      compromised    his    ability    to    respond     to   this\n\nargument.\n\n         As noted, we need not decide whether the district court,\n\nwhich received an imperfect articulation of Mieses's claim, abused\n\nits discretion in excluding the audiotape.               We observe, however,\n\nthat    the   absence    of   defendants'     voices    on    the   recording    was\n\npotentially significant evidence rebutting Torres's incriminating\n\naccount of their behavior.           The government and the defense argue\n\ndifferent reasons for the recording device's failure to pick up\n\nReyes-Guerrero's and Mieses's voices. We see little reason why the\n\ncorrect explanation should not be a jury question, as to which the\n\nsounds captured on the tape itself might be potent evidence.\n\nAssuming the lack of an English transcript of the recording was\n\nadequate      reason    for   the   exclusion,   defendants         can   prepare   a\n\ntranscript before their retrial.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f                                    IV.\n\n     For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the judgments of\n\nconviction     and   remand   to   the    district   court   for   further\n\nproceedings.\n\n     So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f",

On appeal, the pair claim that their convictions must be vacated because of three significant errors at trial: (1) the government's use of improper overview testimony from the lead law enforcement agent in the case, (2) the indirect admission of the third co-defendant's out-of-court statement implicating appellants, and (3) the district court's refusal to allow the jury to hear an audiotape recorded on the day of their arrests.<sup>[3]</sup> Reyes-Guerrero further asserts that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> As we shall explain, the overview testimony at issue here was improper and, to its credit, the district court acknowledged the error when it considered appellants' post-trial motions for acquittal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Reyes-Guerrero,</i> 638 F.Supp.2d 177, 185-90 (D.P.R.2009). We also conclude that the district court erred in allowing testimony revealing the co-defendant's inculpatory statement. Those two significant errors entitle appellants to a new trial, and we therefore vacate their convictions and remand for such new proceedings.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>The facts underlying appellants' convictions, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Poulin,</i> 631 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir.2011), are as follows.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico Police Sergeant Roberto Cruz, a member of a federal drug task force,<sup>[5]</sup> worked undercover in 2007 in an investigation targeting Genito Toribio-Custodio (\"Custodio\"), an alleged trafficker who operated in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Also participating in the undercover investigation was Marcos Antonio Torres, a longtime drug trafficker who had been a paid government informant since 2005.<sup>[6]</sup> The undercover operation ended prematurely when Custodio detected surveillance units and fled from Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p>Seeking to reactivate the investigation the next year, Cruz instructed Torres to solicit Custodio for a cocaine deal in Puerto Rico. On June 19, 2008, in the first of a series of recorded phone calls, Torres informed Custodio that he had 220 kilograms to sell. Initially cautious, Custodio asked Torres if he still communicated with Cruz, whom Custodio did not trust. Torres said they were not in touch. Although Custodio originally said he would travel to Puerto Rico within a few days, he instead arranged for his \"partner\"Dario Pereyra-Rubis (\"Rubis\")to carry out the deal. A few days later, during a meeting in San Juan that Torres recorded, Rubis expressed interest in buying 150 kilograms of cocaine and proposed paying for them after his clients paid him. Torres told Rubis that he could deal only in twenty-five kilogram amounts, and he would provide the drugs only if Rubis brought $100,000. Rubis contacted a client by phone to advise that a deal was in the works, and he then left to consult with the client face-to-face.</p>\n<p>In a follow-up phone call with Custodio, who had already spoken with Rubis, Torres repeated his refusal to defer payment for the drugs and offered to accept a $100,000 deposit. In another phone call the same evening, when Rubis insisted on getting the drugs without cash down, Torres told Rubis that his buyers should come with the money \"so that they are present in the negotiation\" and they \"know where their money is.\" Rubis said he would continue to try to reach an agreement.</p>\n<p>Sensing continuing mistrust on the part of Rubis and Custodio, Cruz arranged for Torres to show Rubis sham kilograms of cocainepackages of wood wrapped with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> the type of tape commonly used by drug traffickers. Their meeting at a shopping center on June 26 was videotaped, and Cruz also was on the scene as part of the surveillance team. Rubis's concerns apparently were resolved when he saw the \"cocaine,\" and Torres testified that Rubis became \"in a hurry to make the deal.\"</p>\n<p>In a series of conversations between Rubis and Torres on the morning of June 27, the deal was confirmed for fifteen kilograms at $14,000 apiece, with $100,000 in cash to be paid on the spot and the balance due a day later. Torres testified that, in the first call, Rubis reported that he was \"with the people, the owners of the money with the money; and that he was desperate to ... make the deal, and he didn't want the people to get bored and leave.\" They agreed to meet at 2 p.m., and in a subsequent call Torres told Rubis to come to the shopping center where they had previously met.</p>\n<p>DEA Task Force members, including Cruz, set up surveillance with videotaping equipment near the shopping center. Agents saw Rubis arrive at the shopping center alone in a green Mazda that belonged to appellant Reyes-Guerrero, briefly leave the area, and then return with Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero in a Ford minivan. Mieses was driving, Reyes-Guerrero was in the front passenger seat, and Rubis was sitting in the back. Mieses dropped Rubis off near where Torres, equipped with a small audio recorder, was waiting, and then drove on a short distance before parking the van. When Torres asked why Rubis was late, Rubis replied that he had arrived earlier, but he needed to wait for \"the owners of the money\" to come with the cash. After Torres complained that he did not want to meet anyone else, Rubis explained that \"the people\" would not give the money to him (i.e., Rubis) because they did not trust him. Asked if the owners were there yet, Rubis said they were \"in their car,\" and he then escorted Torres to the minivan. Torres testified that, as they proceeded to the vehicle, Rubis assured him that these individuals were trustworthy and that he had previously carried out drug transactions with them.</p>\n<p>According to Torres, when he and Rubis arrived at the passenger side of the van, Reyes-Guerrero rolled down his window and Rubis briefly introduced the men. Reyes-Guerrero directed them to \"get in\" the car, but Torres refused because he feared being kidnapped. Torres then asked if they were ready; Mieses replied \"yes\" and Reyes-Guerrero nodded. Torres asked to see the money, prompting Mieses to reach behind his seat and, with Reyes-Guerrero's help, pull out a shoe box. Reyes-Guerrero passed the box to Torres, who opened it and asked how much money it contained. After responding \"$100,000,\" Mieses asked about \"the merchandise,\" and Torres told him that it was in his car. Mieses then asked, \"How are we going to do this?\" Torres responded that he would return to his car and drive off, and the others should follow. As Torres walked away from the minivan, he passed his hand over his head in a prearranged signal to let Cruz know that he had seen the money and the deal was underway.</p>\n<p>Significantly, although the conversation between Torres and Rubis in the parking lot was recorded by the device Torres carried, the exchange among the men at the minivan could not be heard on the tape. Cruz attributed the glitch to background traffic noise at that location, and Torres testified that a gap is not unusual when he carries a recording device. Cruz and the other Task Force members were too far away from the minivan to hear the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> men talking, and the jury thus heard only Torres's account of what was said there.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>After Torres signaled Cruz, Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero were quickly arrested, and Rubis, who had tried to flee, was apprehended several blocks away. A blue Reebok shoe box containing $100,000 was recovered from the van, and a subsequent inspection of the vehicle revealed a hidden compartment beneath the rear floor. Rubis indicated a willingness to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and he was interviewed at the DEA offices by Cruz and another Task Force agent. Cruz testified that, after the interview, the targets of his investigation changed, and he reported that Reyes-Guerrero and Mieses were immediately processed and detained. Rubis, Reyes-Guerrero, and Mieses were all charged with a single count of conspiracy to possess five or more kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute the drugs. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>During appellants' five-day trial in February 2009, the government presented the details of the reverse sting largely through the testimony of Cruz and Torres. The jury also heard the audio recordings of the preparatory telephone calls involving Rubis, Torres, and Custodio and saw the videotapes of the sham cocaine display and the attempted transaction. Despite defendants' objections, the court allowed the prosecutor to ask Cruz what role defendants played within the drug trafficking organization. Cruz identified Mieses as \"one of the buyers,\" and Reyes-Guerrero as \"the other buyer.\" Cruz also described them as the \"owners of the money.\" Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero defended by arguing \"mere presence,\" attempting to persuade the jury that they were merely bystanders to Rubis's drug deal.<sup>[8]</sup> The strategy was unsuccessful, and both men were found guilty.</p>\n<p>In post-trial motions for judgments of acquittal, appellants challenged the court's instruction on \"mere presence\" and asserted that the court erred in allowing Cruz to present overview testimony that was based on hearsay. They further argued that the evidence adduced by the government was insufficient as a matter of law to support the guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p>In a thorough and thoughtful opinion, the district court acknowledged that Cruz's testimony about appellants' roles in the drug transaction had been improperly admitted, <i>Reyes-Guerrero,</i> 638 F.Supp.2d at 190, and that the error \"may have constituted sufficient grounds for the granting of a new trial pursuant to a harmless error standard.\" <i>Id.</i> at 179 n. 1. Because the defendants had not moved for such relief, however, the court addressed only their request for acquittal. <i>Id.</i> It concluded that Torres's testimony alone provided ample support for findings of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, <i>id.</i> at 192-93, and it therefore denied the motions.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>On appeal, appellants raise four arguments. First, they jointly reiterate their contention that admission of Cruz's overview testimonyspecifically, his assertions that they played the role of buyerswas reversible error. Second, they challenge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> the admission of Cruz's testimony about his post-arrest interview with Rubis. They argue that Cruz's revelation that after the interview the targets of his investigation changed necessarily implied a statement by Rubis identifying Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero as co-conspirators in the drug deal. Admission of that implied out-of-court statement, they assert, violated their rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Third, Mieses challenges the court's refusal to allow the jury to hear a portion of the audio recording made by Torres on June 27. Mieses insists that the recording was relevant to the jurors' appraisal of Torres's testimony about the conversation at the minivan and why it was not captured on the tape. Finally, Reyes-Guerrero renews his sufficiency argument, which is where we begin our discussion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Reyes-Guerrero argues that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because a conspiracy charge requires proof of the defendant's \"own words or actions\" and the record in this case involves only \"the mouth of the government informant.\" He asserts that Torres's uncorroborated testimony is insufficient to support a finding that Reyes-Guerrero was a knowing and voluntary participant in a conspiracy, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Bristol-Martir,</i> 570 F.3d 29, 39 (1st Cir.2009), and he insists that the jury could properly conclude only that he happened to be present when Rubis transacted a drug deal.</p>\n<p>Reyes-Guerrero undervalues the evidence against him.<sup>[10]</sup> The testimony of a single witness can be enough to support the government's case, <i>United States v. De La Paz-Rentas,</i> 613 F.3d 18, 24-25 (1st Cir.2010), and even the uncorroborated testimony of an informant may suffice \"to establish the facts underlying a defendant's conviction,\" <i>United States v. Merlino,</i> 592 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir.2010). The jury assesses witness credibility, <i>United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 617 F.3d 581, 596 n. 6 (1st Cir.2010), and the jurors in this case were properly informed about Torres's drug-dealing past and cautioned about accepting his testimony.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, the government did not rest solely on informant testimony to rebut Reyes-Guerrero's mere presence defense. The government also introduced recordings of phone conversations, videotapes, and Cruz's testimony based on direct surveillance. The early phone conversations between Torres and Rubis indicated that Rubis was acting as a broker for buyers who were reluctant to part with their cash before obtaining drugs, and the events on the morning of the scheduled transaction permitted the jury to infer that appellants were those buyers. Moreover, Rubis reported in one call that he was with the \"owners of the money,\" and he later appeared for the deal with Mieses and Reyes-Guerreroand the money. Reyes-Guerrero's travel to the scene of the transaction, in a vehicle containing a hidden compartment suitable for transporting drugs, was his own conduct that has considerable significance in light of the other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> evidence. In addition, Rubis told Torres he originally had arrived early for the transaction but then was delayed because he had to wait for the buyers. That explanation as recounted by Torresi.e., Rubis's early arrival and subsequent returnmatched the observations of the Task Force agents on the scene.</p>\n<p>The informant testimony, if believed by the jury, was particularly damaging. Torres testified that Reyes-Guerrero nodded his head when asked if he was ready to proceed with the deal, signaling active participation. Although Torres's report that Reyes-Guerrero had helped to retrieve the box of money from behind the driver's seat was more ambiguous, it was nonetheless additional evidence that the jury could have viewed as proof of Reyes-Guerrero's complicity in the transaction. The jury thus had before it sufficient evidence pointing to Reyes-Guerrero's guilt.</p>\n<p>Although a guilty verdict was not inevitableas we explain belowour rejection of Reyes-Guerrero's sufficiency claim is not inconsistent with our decision to vacate appellants' convictions. Our concerns, and the stakes, are considerably different when we evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict than when we assess the impact of discrete evidentiary errors on that verdict. If even the properly admitted evidence would not permit a reasonable jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the government has failed to prove its case and the defendant is entitled to acquittal. If, instead, the properly admitted evidence is sufficient to prove guilt, but other, erroneously admitted evidence might have influenced the verdict, our concern is that the defendant was denied a fair trial. The remedy in such circumstances is a new trial, not acquittal.</p>\n<p>Here, taking into account only the evidence whose admission is not challenged, the record was sufficient for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Reyes-Guerrero was more than an innocent bystander to Rubis's transaction. Hence, we affirm the district court's denial of his motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellants assert three evidence-related errors. Two are claims of wrongful admission of testimony by Cruz: his overview testimony identifying appellants as the buyers in the drug deal and his report about his post-arrest interview with Rubis. The third claim, raised only by Mieses, is that the court erred in refusing to admit a portion of the audiotape recorded on the day of the attempted cocaine purchase. We discuss the merits of each of these contentions before turning to the question of harmless error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Cruz's Overview Testimony</h2>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.2009), we reviewed at length why the government must be wary of using a law enforcement agent in a multi-defendant drug trial to provide an \"overview\" of the prosecution's case, and we sharply criticized the U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico for its repeated improper use of the practice. <i>See id.</i> at 16-27; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 117-20 (1st Cir.2004). Both <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and our earlier decision in <i>Casas</i> particularly condemned testimony from an agent, not based on personal knowledge, describing the roles played in the drug conspiracy by individual defendants. <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 16, 24; <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 118-19. Such descriptions amount to impermissible testimony from the agent \"that each of the defendants was guilty of the conspiracy charged.\" <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 119 (<i>quoted in </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 24).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> In similar fashion to <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas,</i> the lead law enforcement officer in this case, Agent Cruz, was called as the first witness at trial. He testified to the step-by-step progression of the investigation, describing the phone calls and meetings that culminated in the arrests at the shopping center. At the end of the direct examination, after confirming that Cruz had listened to all of the phone calls and audio recordings, conversed with and supervised Torres, and watched the meetings between Rubis and Torres that were videotaped, the prosecutor asked Cruz what role each individual had played in the conspiracy. Cruz testified that Rubis was \"a broker within the drug trafficking organization,\" Mieses \"in this deal was one of the buyers,\" and Reyes-Guerrero was \"the other buyer.\"</p>\n<p><i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> was issued approximately four months after the trial in this case, between appellants' filing of post-trial motions for judgment of acquittal and the district court's ruling on the motions. In its decision on the motions, the district court observed that <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> had drawn \"clear boundaries between permissible and impermissible `overview testimony' at the beginning of trial.\" 638 F.Supp.2d at 188 (citing <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 19-20). It concluded that, although a case agent may describe the course of an investigation to provide background information, Cruz's pronouncement that the defendants were the buyers was plainly improper. <i>Id.</i> The testimony did not satisfy the requirements for lay witness testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 701, the court held, because it was \"not based squarely on personal knowledge.\" <i>Id.</i> at 189.<sup>[12]</sup> Cruz was not a participant in the attempted drug deal and, \"[i]mportantly, ... was unable to hear any of the words allegedly spoken by the defendants at the time the informant approached them to make the drug exchange.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On appeal, appellants argue that the impermissible role-in-the-offense testimony was reversible error entitling them to a new trial. The government insists that Cruz's testimony did not violate the principles outlined in <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas</i> because, unlike the agents in those cases, Cruz directly participated in every aspect of the investigation. The government recounts the evidence to which Cruz was directly exposedthe conversations and meetings between Rubis and Torres, and the encounter at the vanand argues that Cruz's \"testimony about [appellants'] roles as buyers was based on his perception of events that he participated in and was therefore proper lay opinion testimony under Rule 701.\"</p>\n<p>The government is correct that this case differs from <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas.</i> Those cases both involved wide-ranging overview testimony by law enforcement agents whose descriptions of the conspiracies at issue relied heavily on information told to them by othersi.e., on inadmissible hearsayrather than on their own personal knowledge. <i>See </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 24; <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 119.<sup>[13]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> By contrast, Cruz played a hands-on role in nearly every aspect of the investigation underlying this case, and most of his testimony consisted of describing the sequence of events that he had seen and heard. Such testimony is permissible and \"valuable to provide background information and to explain how and why the agents even came to be involved with th[e] particular defendant[s].\" <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original).<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>In the way that matters to us here, however, this case is equivalent to <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas.</i> Appellants challenge only Cruz's testimony announcing their roles in the conspiracy. In <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> we characterized the agent's role-in-the-offense conclusion as \"[t]he most troubling part\" of his testimony. <i>See</i> 569 F.3d at 24. We observed that, \"[w]hen a law enforcement witness `express[es] opinions as to defendants' culpability based on the totality of information gathered in the course of their investigation[],' these conclusory statements often involve impermissible lay opinion testimony, without any basis in personal knowledge, about the role of the defendant in the conspiracy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19 (quoting <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d 201, 211 (2d Cir.2005) (second and third alterations in original)).</p>\n<p>Cruz's opinion on the defendants' roles was flawed in part by just such a lack of personal knowledge. As the district court pointed out, Cruz did not see or hear the only explicitly inculpatory conduct attributed to appellantsthe interaction of Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero with Rubis and Torres at the minivan. Cruz admitted that his knowledge of appellants' interaction with Rubis and Torres came solely from Torres: \"The informant is the only one that can declare as to what happened there.\" Inevitably, Torres's report about what <i>he</i> had observed inside the vehiclethe most harmful evidence in the casewas part of Cruz's calculus in ascribing roles to the defendants in the conspiracy.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> Hence, we agree with the district court that Cruz's challenged testimony failed, at least in part, to satisfy the requirement that lay opinions be \"rationally based on the perception of the witness,\" Fed.R.Evid. 701(a). As the Second Circuit has noted, the \"`traditional objective'\" of Rule 701 is \"to afford the trier of fact `an accurate reproduction of the event' at issue.\" <i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 211 (quoting advisory committee note on 1972 Proposed Rules). Cruz neither saw nor heard the critical episode in the investigation, and his opinions as to defendants' roles in the conspiracy, based in part on <i>Torres's</i> perceptions of the interaction, were thus inadmissible under Rule 701(a).<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Even if the government could argue that Cruz was capable of inferring appellants' roles based only on what he had personally observed, his testimony would still be impermissible because it did not satisfy Rule 701's requirement that lay opinion evidence be \"helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\" Fed. R.Evid. 701(b). The nub of that requirement is to exclude testimony where \"`the witness is no better suited than the jury'\" to make the judgment at issue, <i>United States v. Kornegay,</i> 410 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>United States v. Jackman,</i> 48 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995)), providing \"`assurance[] against the admission of opinions which would merely tell the jury what result to reach,'\" <i>United States v. Kaplan,</i> 490 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Rea,</i> 958 F.2d 1206, 1215 (2d Cir.1992) (quoting Fed. R.Evid. 704 advisory committee's note on 1972 Proposed Rules)).</p>\n<p>Cruz had no insight to offer the jurors based on personal knowledge of the appellants' inculpatory conduct. Like them, he had to rely on Torres's account of what occurred in the vehicle. Like them, he heard the audio recordings of the phone calls. Although he was present at the scene when surveillance videotapes were recorded, the jurors watched the tapes of those encounters, allowing them to see what Cruz had seen. Indeed, when asked on cross-examination why he concluded that Mieses was a buyer, Cruz responded: \"Because Mr. Meises and Mr. [Reyes-]Guerrero were the two that were in custody of the money at the time of the intervention. They were the two that were protecting that money so nothing would happen to it.\" In other words, Cruz inferred appellants' roles not from any direct knowledge, but from the same circumstantial evidence that was before the juryeffectively usurping the jury's role as fact-finder.<sup>[17]</sup> Moreover, as used by the government, the testimony amounted to argumentative interpretation. It was perfectly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> appropriate for the prosecutor to argue in summation that the evidence of the defendants' actions and words supported the inference that they were the buyers. But having Cruz so testify amounted to simply dressing up argument as evidence.</p>\n<p>The difference between Cruz's information and the base of knowledge necessary to make a lay opinion helpful to the jury in a case such as this is apparent when the circumstances here are contrasted with a scenario described by the Second Circuit in <i>Garcia:</i></p>\n<blockquote>[W]hen an undercover agent participates in a hand-to-hand drug exchange with a number of persons, the agent may well testify that, in his opinion, a particular participant, \"X,\" was the person directing the transaction. Such an opinion is based on his personal perception of such subjective factors as the respect various participants showed \"X,\" their deference to \"X\" when he spoke, and their consummation of the deal only upon a subtly signaled approval by \"X.\" By allowing the agent to state his opinion as to a person's role in such circumstances, Rule 701 affords the jury an insight into an event that was uniquely available to an eyewitness.</blockquote>\n<p>413 F.3d at 211-12. Cruz, as he admitted himself, was not an eyewitness with unique access to appellants' conduct; his testimony could only have replaced, rather than aided, the jury's assessment of the evidence.<sup>[18]</sup> It was thus not admissible lay opinion testimony. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 213-14 (explaining that jurors are not \"`helped' within the meaning of Rule 701 by opinion testimony that, in addition to telling them `what was in the evidence,' also told them `what inferences to draw from it'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Grinage,</i> 390 F.3d 746, 750 (2d Cir.2004)); <i>see also</i> 4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence</i> § 701.05 (Joseph M. McLaughlin, ed., 2d ed.2011) (noting that, to protect the jury's role as fact-finder, courts must be wary of lay opinion testimony whose \"sole function is to answer the same question that the trier of fact is to consider in its deliberations\"); <i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 210-11.</p>\n<p>The usurpation problem that arises when a witness testifies to opinions based on evidence that was also available to the jurors is compounded when the witness is a government agent whose testimonyas hereis effectively a judgment on the question of guilt or innocence. This is one variant of the imprimatur problem we described in <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas.</i> There, we focused primarily on our concern that the government agent's preview of other witnesses' testimony would endorse their testimony \"in what can only be viewed as an attempt by the government to bolster the credibility of those later witnesses.\" <i>See </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 26; <i>see also id.</i> at 17-19; <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 120.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the vouching concern also exists here to the extent that Cruz's role-in-the-offense opinion implicitly endorsed Torres's later testimony describing appellants' conduct in the minivan, the problem <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> with Cruz's testimony extends beyond vouching for what the jury may perceive as a less credible witness. The jurors were told that, based on the same evidence before them, an experienced government agent had rejected appellants' mere presence defense and concluded that they were participants in the conspiracy. Given the effect on juries of the government's imprimatur, <i>see </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 18; <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 120, it was patently unfair for Cruz to present his view of appellants' culpability. \"It is ... the jury's singular responsibility to decide from the evidence admitted at trial whether the government has carried its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 215; <i>see also </i><i>Grinage,</i> 390 F.3d at 751 (\"[T]he agent was presented to the jury with an aura of expertise and authority which increased the risk that the jury would be swayed by his testimony, rather than rely on its own interpretation....\").<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, Cruz's testimony about appellants' roles in the June 27 transaction lacked a foundation of personal knowledge of facts essential to his opinion, usurped the jury's fact-finding function, and improperly endorsed the government's theory of the case. Hence, it is beyond debate that the testimony was wrongly admitted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Cruz's Testimony about the Post-Arrest Interview of Rubis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Background</h2>\n<p>During cross-examination of Agent Cruz, Reyes-Guerrero's counsel elicited the fact that Reyes-Guerrero was not a target of the Task Force investigation until the day of the arrests. Cruz specifically acknowledged that Reyes-Guerrero's name did not appear in the four or five official investigative reportsknown as \"DEA-6 reports\"that were prepared before that day. On redirect examination by the government, Cruz confirmed that Reyes-Guerrero's name did appear in the last such report, \"the arrest report.\" When the prosecutor followed up by asking about the contents of that report, defense counsel objected and the court convened a bench conference.</p>\n<p>The final DEA report described the post-arrest interview of Rubis by Cruz and another Task Force agent. In the bench conference, the prosecutor explained that he would not try to \"elicit the actual statements\" uttered by Rubis in the interview, apparently recognizing that such testimony would trigger hearsay and Confrontation Clause problems. Rather, he would ask about Rubis's offer to cooperate, whether he was interviewed outside the presence of the others, \"[a]nd what did [Cruz] do after the meeting was over.\" Reyes-Guerrero's counsel protested that evidence about the interview would be hearsay because the prosecutor was \"trying to establish the truth of the matter asserted,\" and he emphasized that \"Rubis is not here.\"</p>\n<p>The district court, after suggesting that any statement from Rubis would be admissible as a statement by a co-conspirator,<sup>[21]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> allowed the prosecutor to proceed. The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: Agent Cruz, the DEA-6 that I just asked you about, without saying what is in that DEA-6, specifically, the whole report, what's it about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: That report is an interview that was made to Mr. Rubis Dario after the arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: After all three were arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Yes, after all three were arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Okay. Where were these two individuals while you were interviewing him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: These two individuals were in the cell at the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Why were they not in the interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Because the interview was being carried out with Mr. Rubis only and with us because he had the intention of cooperating with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: After this interview, did the targets of your investigation at this point change?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Okay. After this interview, what did you decide to do with Defendant [Reyes-Guerrero]?</blockquote>\n<p>Cruz then testified that the defendants were processed and taken to a federal detention facility.</p>\n<p>On appeal, appellants argue that Cruz implicitly testified that Rubis had identified them as co-conspirators, and they assert that the indirect admission of Rubis's statement violated their rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as described in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Under <i>Crawford,</i> the admission of testimonial hearsay against a defendant is prohibited unless the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. <i>Id.</i> at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <i>United States v. Castro-Davis,</i> 612 F.3d 53, 64 (1st Cir.2010). Although Rubis was unavailable, having become a fugitive, appellants had no prior opportunity to question him about his interview statements.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>We begin our assessment of this claim with the government's contention that the <i>Crawford</i> issue was not preserved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Forfeiture</h2>\n<p>The government argues that neither appellant may pursue a Confrontation Clause challenge on appeal because Reyes-Guerrero objected at trial on hearsay grounds, without referencing the Confrontation Clause or <i>Crawford,</i> and Mieses did not object at all.</p>\n<p>We can easily dispatch the argument as to Reyes-Guerrero. Although the government accurately recites our precedent holding that an objection on hearsay grounds will not preserve a Confrontation Clause claim, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 617 F.3d 581, 594 (1st Cir. 2010), we have in the past looked to the full context of counsel's colloquy with the court in determining whether a <i>Crawford</i> challenge was preserved. In <i>Cabrera-Rivera,</i> for example, we found it \"obvious that counsel was objecting to [defendant's] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> inability to confront the declarant\" where counsel had pointed to the declarant's unavailability at trial. <i>See</i> 583 F.3d at 36 (citing counsel's statement that the declarant \"is not here to\"). We therefore concluded that the defendant had preserved his Confrontation Clause claim. Here, too, counsel plainly raised both hearsay and Confrontation Clause concerns. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Tr. Transcript (Feb. 19, 2009), at 10 (\"Because Rubis is not here, <i>and</i> ... the attorney is trying to establish the truth of the matter asserted because of this.\") (emphasis added); <i>id.</i> at 10-11 (\"There's a... thin line, your Honor, and it might ... this hearsay information, your Honor, we don't know which context it happens; <i>and,</i> also, Mr. Rubis, again, is not here.\") (emphasis added).<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>Mieses's counsel, by contrast, was largely silent throughout the exchange on this issue. He participated in the sidebar conference discussing the proposed testimony, however, and voiced his agreement that the prejudice from the line of questioning outweighed its probative value. In context, where the interests of both defendants were identical, we are satisfied that Mieses's counsel incorporated Reyes-Guerrero's more fully stated objection into his brief comment.</p>\n<p>We thus afford plenary review to both appellants' claims. We generally review preserved evidentiary errors for abuse of discretion, but \"[w]e review <i>de novo</i> whether the strictures of the Confrontation Clause have been met.\" <i>Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 617 F.3d at 590 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Out-of-court statements excluded from evidence under <i>Crawford</i> must be both testimoniali.e., statements an objectively reasonable declarant could have anticipated would be used at trialand offered for their truth, thus constituting hearsay. <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <i>id.</i> at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <i>Castro-Davis,</i> 612 F.3d at 65. It is not disputed that Rubis's assertions in his post-arrest interview were testimonial. The government also appears to accept that testimony revealing an \"actual statement[]\" by Rubis about appellants' complicity in the drug deal would be inadmissible hearsay. It seeks to defeat appellants' <i>Crawford</i> claim on two other grounds: (1) no actual statement, and thus no improper hearsay, was introduced into evidence, and (2) Reyes-Guerrero's counsel opened the door to the challenged testimony.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> a. No Statement</h2>\n<p>In the pertinent portion of the challenged exchange, Cruz was asked, in essence, if Rubis had said anything during his interview that changed the targets of the investigation and prompted the defendants' arrests. Cruz answered affirmatively. The government maintains that the prosecutor's examination was \"adroitly focused ... on the actions that Agent Cruz took after speaking to Rubis,\" while appellants argue that \"[n]o juror of normal intelligence, hearing this exchange, could have failed to get the prosecutor's point that Rubis, in his statement to the agents, had implicated [him] as a co-conspirator.\" Reyes-Guerrero Brief at 21; <i>see also</i> Mieses Brief at 32. Appellants assert that \"the import of this testimony is no less clear than if Rubis had been directly quoted.\" Reyes-Guerrero Reply Brief at 5.</p>\n<p>We agree with appellants that a reasonable jury could only have understood Cruz to have communicated that Rubis had identified appellants as participants in the drug deal. It makes no difference that the government took care not to introduce Rubis's \"actual statements.\" Although the government could properly seek to rebut Reyes-Guerrero's suggestion that the appellants were innocent bystanders, it did so with testimony that plainly told the jurors that Rubis <i>said</i> they were co-conspirators rather than with the available evidence circumstantially pointing to their culpability.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Maher,</i> 454 F.3d 13 (1st Cir.2006), we declined to discuss <i>Crawford</i>'s applicability to \"testimony from which ... the jury would necessarily infer that the declarant had said <i>X,</i> but which did not itself quote or paraphrase the declarant's statements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20-21. We observed that the defendant in that case had made \"no effort to explain why <i>Crawford</i> should be read to extend\" to such statements. <i>Id.</i> at 21. Here, the issue is addressed head-on by both appellants. We conclude that the right to cross-examine an out-of-court accuser applies with full force in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to cross-examine the declarant \"to tease out the truth,\" <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 67, 124 S.Ct. 1354, is no less vital when a witness indirectly, but still unmistakably, recounts a co-defendant's out-of-court accusation. The concerns animating the right to confrontation are especially acute when the statement at issue originates from an ex parte examination by a law enforcement officer. <i>See </i><i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <i>id.</i> at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (\"An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.\"). Hence, if what the jury hears is, in substance, an untested, out-of-court accusation against the defendant, particularly if the inculpatory statement is made to law enforcement authorities, the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront the declarant is triggered. <i>Accord </i><i>Ryan v. Miller,</i> 303 F.3d 231, 249 (2d Cir.2002) (\"If the substance of the prohibited testimony is evident even though it was not introduced in the prohibited form, the testimony is still inadmissible.\"); <i>United States v. Reyes,</i> 18 F.3d 65, 69 (2d Cir.1994) (\"[A]lthough the jury was not told exactly what words [the co-defendants] had spoken, [the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> witness's] testimony clearly conveyed the substance of what they had said.\").</p>\n<p>Indeed, any other conclusion would permit the government to evade the limitations of the Sixth Amendment and the Rules of Evidence by weaving an unavailable declarant's statements into another witness's testimony by implication.<sup>[25]</sup> The government cannot be permitted to \"circumvent the Confrontation Clause by introducing the same substantive testimony in a different form.\" <i>Ryan,</i> 303 F.3d at 248; <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Mason v. Scully,</i> 16 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir.1994) (\"The fact that the content of [the co-conspirator's] statement to [the detective] was not revealed in detail was immaterial, for the plain implication that the prosecutor sought to elicit... was that the conversation ... led the police to focus on [the defendant].\"); <i>People v. Cruz,</i> 100 A.D.2d 882. 474 N.Y.S.2d 142, 144 (N.Y.App.Div.1984) (\"The prosecutor's questioning of [the witness] concerning a conversation with [a non-testifying witness], which directly preceded [the witness's] testimony that he made two arrests in the case was improper inasmuch as it was designed to create the impression in the jurors' minds that [the non-testifying witness] had implicated the defendant....\"); <i>People v. Felder,</i> 108 A.D.2d 869, 485 N.Y.S.2d 576, 577 (N.Y.App.Div. 1985) (finding error where witness testified that \"the complainant made a response following which `we patted down both subjects, placed them in handcuffs, and removed them from the bar,'\" because \"[e]ven though [the complainant's] response was not admitted into evidence, the testimony left the jurors with the clear impression that ... the arrests were made as a result of this response\").</p>\n<p>We therefore reject the government's argument that Cruz's testimony was proper because it omitted \"the actual statements\" made by Rubis. <i>See </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 23 (\"[W]e are on firm ground in warning prosecutors of the risks they face in backdoor attempts to get statements by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> non-testifying confidential informants before a jury.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. The Opened Door</h2>\n<p>The government suggests that, even if Cruz's testimony about the interview indirectly resulted in the introduction of an out-of-court statement, the testimony was nonetheless proper to rebut Reyes-Guerrero's cross-examination eliciting the fact that the two defendants were never mentioned in the investigative reports prior to the incident at the van. In the sidebar discussion following Reyes-Guerrero's objection at trial, the prosecutor stated that he had avoided referring to the interview in his direct questioning but defense counsel's focus on Reyes-Guerrero's absence from the DEA reports had triggered a need for the testimony.</p>\n<p>The government's argument on this issue borders on the frivolous. The testimony elicited by Reyes-Guerrero's counsel about the early DEA reports was proper evidence in support of appellants' mere presence defense, showing that appellants had not previously been known to law enforcement authorities. The government does not explain in its brief how that testimony opened the door to evidence on the content of Rubis's interview. At trial, the prosecutor asserted that the evidence was necessary rebuttal because, in context, the questioning on the early reports was \"diminishing [appellants'] culpability.\" That may be. Defendants are entitled to cross-examine government witnesses in an effort to diminish their own culpability, and the government is entitled to counter with appropriate rebuttal evidence. The evidence of appellants' absence from the earlier reports was neither inaccurate nor misleading, and the government did not contend otherwise. The government could properly have countered by showing, for example, that appellants did appear in the final report, which was prepared after the incident at the van and described the transaction. By no means, however, did the cross-examination testimony require or justify rebuttal that violated the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the government's rationale essentially acknowledges that the evidence of Rubis's accusation of complicity was offered to establish the truth of the accusationi.e., that appellants <i>were</i> participants in the drug transaction, notwithstanding the silence of the early reports. Hence, admission of Cruz's testimony about the interview was improper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Harmless Error</h2>\n<p>Both appellants argue that the errors described above entitle them to a new trial. Reyes-Guerrero asserts that admission of Cruz's overview testimony and the indirect admission of Rubis's out-of-court statements each is reversible error on its own, and Mieses additionally argues that the multiple errors require the grant of a new trial under the cumulative error doctrine. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d 314, 331-32 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>The inquiry to determine whether cumulative errors are harmless is the same as for individual error, <i>Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d at 332, and we therefore think it most efficient to move beyond individual analyses of harmlessness to consider the combined effect of the two erroneously admitted portions of Cruz's testimony. \"The admission of improper testimony is harmless if it is `highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.'\" <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 27 (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 121).<sup>[26]</sup> The government bears the burden to establish harmlessness, <i>id.,</i> and the inquiry requires a case-specific examination of factors that include \"the centrality of the tainted material,\" its prejudicial impact, and any other indications that \"the error affected the factfinder's resolution of a material issue.\" <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1182 (quoted in <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 27); <i>see also </i><i>Cabrera-Rivera,</i> 583 F.3d at 36.</p>\n<p>Without question, as we described in addressing Reyes-Guerrero's sufficiency claim, there was ample evidence aside from Cruz's improper testimony from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that appellants played the roles that Cruz and Rubis attributed to them. We strongly doubt, however, that the jury was unaffected by Cruz's improper testimony, which communicated to the jurors that Cruz, an experienced drug investigator, and Rubis, who admitted his guilt, had both identified appellants as participants in the conspiracy. We have recognized the \"`devastating'\" impact of a co-defendant's extrajudicial statements, <i>Cabrera-Rivera,</i> 583 F.3d at 37 (quoting <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 136, 88 S.Ct. 1620), and an essential premise of our warnings about overview evidence is that jurors view the testimony of law enforcement officers as especially authoritative, <i>see </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 17-18.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the prosecution depended heavily on the believability of Torres, a paid government informant. In evaluating harmless error, we cannot presume the jury would have accepted his testimony as readily without the corroboration provided by Cruz's testimony. Indeed, consistent with standard practice for informant witnesses, the court instructed the jurors to consider Torres's testimony with caution. <i>See </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 26 (noting the \"often problematic testimony of confidential informants with unsavory pasts\").</p>\n<p>The other evidence of appellants' knowing involvement was suggestive, but not overwhelming. In recorded calls on the day of the arrests, Rubis said he was with the buyers, but he did not identify them by name. Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero were seated in the front of the minivan, while the known conspiratorand the moneywere in the back. That vehicle, with its hidden compartment, was not registered to either appellant, and the compartment was not visible to the driver or passengers.<sup>[27]</sup> Cruz testified that the video taken of the attempted drug deal does not show Mieses talking at alldespite Torres's testimony that Mieses made several incriminating statements. The jury in fact heard none of the recorded conversations among the men that dayincluding Rubis's statement, reported by Torres, that the owners of the money were in the carbecause the audio recording was not introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p>The government's heavy reliance on the informant's credibility made the overview <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> evidence particularly damaging in this case. In effect, the jurors were told it was unnecessary to make their own assessment of Torres's credibility because Cruz did it for them when he announced unequivocally that appellants were \"the owners\" of the money. Rubis's accusation validated Cruz's assessment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gomez,</i> 617 F.3d 88, 97 (2d Cir.2010) (\"The improperly admitted evidence had substantial weight precisely because it went to the core of the government's case against [the defendant], placing an unimpeachable accusation before the jury.\").</p>\n<p>In sum, the tainted evidence was central to the prosecution's case and potentially disastrous to the appellants' defense of mere presence. The contested statements were not \"`cumulative of other compelling proof'\" that the defendants \"`committed the charged [crime],'\" <i>United States v. Earle,</i> 488 F.3d 537, 546 (1st Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (quoting <i>United States v. Bartelho,</i> 129 F.3d 663, 670 (1st Cir.1997)); rather, Cruz's testimony sealed any gap the jury may have perceived between the circumstantial evidence and a finding of guilt. Hence, we cannot say that it is \"highly probable\" that the errors did not affect the jury's resolution of the case and, accordingly, we conclude that appellants are entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Exclusion of the Audiotape</h2>\n<p>Our conclusion that appellants' convictions must be vacated based on the overview and Sixth Amendment errors makes it unnecessary to rule on Mieses's contention that the district court erred in excluding the audio recording made by informant Torres on the day of the arrests. Because the issue is likely to arise again in the new trial, however, we see value in examining this claim.</p>\n<p>Torres testified that Mieses made several incriminating statements during their encounter at the van,<sup>[28]</sup> and Mieses's counsel sought to cross-examine Torres with the recording, which all parties agreed did not contain either defendant's voice. When counsel asked for a ten-minute break during cross-examination to find the relevant portion of the one-hour recording, the government objected that the tape was incomplete and therefore both misleading and prejudicial. The prosecutor also protested that the recording was inadmissible without an English translation. The court rejected admission of the recording, stating: \"I don't see any reason why I should admit this tape.... [T]his is too little, too late.\"</p>\n<p>Mieses's counsel again urged admission of the recording following the government's redirect examination of Torres. Counsel emphasized that \"[t]he most important factor in this case is what was said inside that van,\" and \"the most important thing is that the voice[s] of the Defendants are not heard there.\" The court listened to the recording at counsel's request, but then reaffirmed its initial decision, noting that it was \"clear from all the testimony\" that the defendants' voices were \"not heard in any tape.\"</p>\n<p>Mieses presses an argument on appeal that was implicit in the objections raised at trial, but not fully articulated there. He argues that the crucial aspect of the recording is not that the defendants' voices are absenta fact that no one disputes. Rather, he asserts that the jurors needed to hear the recording so they could decide whetheras Torres claimedthe audio was faulty, or whether Torres had fabricated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> the exchange in the minivan. Stressing the plausibility of the latter view during oral argument on appeal, defense counsel noted that, at a minimum, the recorder should have picked up the statements that Torres claimed to have made to appellants.<sup>[29]</sup> Mieses insists that a translated transcript of the recording should not have been a prerequisite for its admission because the issue was not what was said on the tape, but why the conversation described by Torres was not therea question of recording quality, not content.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the government made much of the supposedly faulty equipment in its closing argument, emphasizing that the critical conversation was unavailable to be played for the jurors through no fault of its own:</p>\n<blockquote>Couldn't get an audio of it. Agent Cruz explained to you why. The wind was blowing. The equipment didn't half work.... Electronics are that way. This equipment is not perfect. People are not perfect. And how many times in this trial did our equipment not work? How many times does your cell phone drop a call? Think about your common experience as an individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We could not get what happened in that van on audio. Sure, I'd love to be able to play that to you. But that doesn't take away what the informantthe man that sat therewho was cross-examined for hours and hours and hours. He didn't want to be here. His family didn't want him here. You heard the testimony. But he testified to you what exactly went on in that van.</blockquote>\n<p>Mieses's claim of error, briefly stated, is that exclusion of the audio recording compromised his ability to respond to this argument.</p>\n<p>As noted, we need not decide whether the district court, which received an imperfect articulation of Mieses's claim, abused its discretion in excluding the audiotape. We observe, however, that the absence of defendants' voices on the recording was potentially significant evidence rebutting Torres's incriminating account of their behavior. The government and the defense argue different reasons for the recording device's failure to pick up Reyes-Guerrero's and Mieses's voices. We see little reason why the correct explanation should not be a jury question, as to which the sounds captured on the tape itself might be potent evidence. Assuming the lack of an English transcript of the recording was adequate reason for the exclusion, defendants can prepare a transcript before their retrial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the judgments of conviction and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The indictment and other court documents spell \"Mieses\" as \"Meises,\" and we do likewise in the official caption of this case. In the remainder of the opinion, however, we adopt the spelling used by Mieses in his brief.</p>\n<p>[2]  In a classic sting operation, an undercover agent attempts to purchase drugs from a suspect. In a reverse sting, agents offer to sell drugs to their targets. <i>United States v. Pinillos-Prieto,</i> 419 F.3d 61, 64 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>[3]  Only Mieses challenges the admission of the audiotape.</p>\n<p>[4]  We explain in Section II why we reject Reyes-Guerrero's sufficiency argument.</p>\n<p>[5]  At the time of the trial in this case, Cruz had been assigned to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Task Force for fourteen years.</p>\n<p>[6]  Torres testified that he began drug trafficking when he was sixteen and continued until he was arrested about two decades later.</p>\n<p>[7]  In fact, no transcript was made from any part of that day's audiotape, and the tape was not played for the jury. Torres's testimony was thus the only evidence on what was said throughout the June 27 episode, including during the exchange between Torres and Rubis before they approached the minivan.</p>\n<p>[8]  Rubis disappeared after posting bond and has not been tried.</p>\n<p>[9]  The court rejected the appellants' claim of instructional error.</p>\n<p>[10]  For purposes of our sufficiency analysis, we do not consider the testimony of Cruz to which appellants have objected.</p>\n<p>[11]  In its pre-deliberations charge to the jury, the court gave the following instruction:\n</p>\n<p>You have heard the testimony of Mark Anthony Torres. He provided evidence under contract agreements with the Government and received money from the Government in exchange for providing information. Some people in this position are truthful when testifying. Still, you should consider the testimony of Mark Anthony Torres with particular caution.</p>\n<p>[12]  Rule 701 provides:\n</p>\n<p>If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.</p>\n<p>Fed.R.Evid. 701.</p>\n<p>[13]  Overview evidence often provides an anticipatory summary of the prosecution's case by previewing the testimony of other witnesses. <i>See </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 16-17. In <i>Casas,</i> the circumstances were \"particularly problematic\" because the agent's testimony \"was likely based on the testimony of a cooperating co-conspirator whom the government chose not to call at trial,\" leaving the defendants unable to cross-examine the cooperator or \"`challenge a conclusion drawn from what he had said.'\" <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 24 n. 8 (quoting <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 119).</p>\n<p>[14]  Although testimony explaining why the investigation turned its focus to a particular defendant is rarely competent evidence on the principal question of whether the defendant is guilty, it can be useful to avoid jury confusion and speculation as to why agents suddenly began to conduct surveillance on the defendant. It can therefore be acceptable despite its lack of relevance to the question of guilt or innocence, <i>so long as it does not involve communicating incompetent and prejudicial information to the jury.</i> As we shall explain, the problems associated with evidence offered to show the context of law enforcement actions can involve violations of the hearsay rule or the Sixth Amendment. <i>See infra</i> Part II.B.</p>\n<p>[15]  Before eliciting Cruz's opinion on Rubis's and appellants' roles, the prosecutor engaged in the following exchange with him:\n</p>\n<p>Q: Did you listen to all the calls in this case?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Q: Did you have conversations with the informant [Torres]?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q: Did you supervise the informant?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q: Did you listen to the audio recordings of any meetings the informant had with [Rubis]?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q: And did you watch the two meetings that we viewed here today?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor then asked what role each of the three men had played, \"[b]ased on everything you observed.\" In the context of the questioning, a jury would almost surely understand that Cruz's response to this question was informed not only by what he had \"observed,\" but also by what he had heard in the audio recordings and what he had learned from his conversations with Torres, including an account of what happened in the minivan. As we explain <i>infra,</i> even if that assumption is incorrect, the result here would be the same.</p>\n<p>[16]  Indeed, the government's attempt on appeal to justify Cruz's testimony as lay opinion within the scope of Rule 701 is inconsistent with its argument at trial. When the defense objected to the offer of Cruz's interpretation of the events, the government responded: \"This witness was supervising the informant. He told him exactly what to do. He was on surveillance many, many times. He heard the phone calls.... So he's a fact witness.\" Given Cruz's lack of personal knowledge and other problems discussed <i>infra,</i> his role-in-the-offense testimony did not qualify as either fact evidence or proper lay opinion.</p>\n<p>[17]  Notably, Cruz's explanation relied on two levels of inference beyond the undisputed fact that appellants arrived in the vehicle with the cash: first, that appellants were guarding the money and, second, that the money belonged to them. Neither inference was based on conduct observed by Cruz.</p>\n<p>[18]  We note that the opinion of the law enforcement agent described by the court in <i>Garcia</i> concerns an individual's observable role in relation to other participants at the scene of a drug transaction, not the individual's overall role in the conspiracy. The latter would be more likely to rest on evidence beyond the agent's perceptions at the scene.</p>\n<p>[19]  As we observed in <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> the government is particularly eager for such testimony in drug conspiracy cases \"where so much of the government's case relies on the often problematic testimony of confidential informants with unsavory pasts or cooperating co-defendants with myriad credibility problems.\" 569 F.3d at 26-27.</p>\n<p>[20]  Cruz's law enforcement experience, of course, was not an appropriate basis for his opinions as a lay witness. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 216-17. Nor would the opinion have been proper if Cruz had been qualified as an expert, which he was not. As we said about similar testimony in <i>Casas,</i> Cruz's \"testimony that particular persons were members of the conspiracy was not an appropriate subject for expert testimony.\" 356 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p>[21]  There is no question that the hearsay exception for co-conspirator statements made \"during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy,\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), does not apply to Rubis's post-arrest statements. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lombard,</i> 72 F.3d 170, 189 n. 25 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>[22]  Mieses mistakenly invokes <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), which addresses the admission of a non-testifying codefendant's out-of-court statements <i>in a joint trial.</i> Rubis was not tried with Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero, and \"a literal <i>Bruton</i> objection\" therefore \"ma[kes] no sense.\" <i>United States v. Cabrera-Rivera,</i> 583 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir.2009). We thus construe his Confrontation Clause claim as a <i>Crawford</i> challenge. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>[23]  As a practical matter, the same underlying concerns would be at play if we addressed the testimony at issue here solely as a hearsay problem, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Gomez,</i> 617 F.3d 88, 96-97 (2d Cir.2010), and we would reach the same outcome. <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Dukagjini,</i> 326 F.3d 45, 56 n. 6 (2d Cir.2003) (noting that the hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause \"`are generally designed to protect similar values,'\" though \"the Supreme Court has `been careful not to equate' them\") (quoting <i>Idaho v. Wright,</i> 497 U.S. 805, 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990)); <i>Ryan v. Miller,</i> 303 F.3d 231, 247 (2d Cir.2002) (\"[A]ccusatory assertions introduced without the testimony of the accuser not only violate the Confrontation Clause, but they also violate rules against hearsay.\").</p>\n<p>[24]  The government cites precedent for the proposition that \"[s]tatements offered for the limited purpose of showing what effect the statement had on the listener are not hearsay,\" but it makes no direct argument that we should view any statement by Rubis as nonhearsay. <i>See</i> Brief of the United States at 53 (citing <i>United States v. Cruz-Diaz,</i> 550 F.3d 169, 176 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 270 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir.2001)). Instead, in the sentence immediately following its citations to <i>Cruz-Diaz</i> and <i>Bailey,</i> the government asserts that \"[t]here was no violation here because Rubis's statement was not introduced.\" Even if we were to generously view the government to be arguing, alternatively, that admission of Rubis's statement was permissible because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, that argument would be unavailing. As we shall explain, the government offered the evidence about Cruz's interview of Rubis to rebut an inference that Reyes-Guerrero was not a participant in the crimei.e., for the truth of Rubis's implicit statement that Reyes-Guerrero and Mieses were involved.</p>\n<p>[25]  This risk of violation of the hearsay rule or the Confrontation Clause reinforces the importance of prosecutors understanding the limitations on so-called background or context evidence. If, for example, such evidence includes the fact that a known participant in the crime was observed conferring in suspicious circumstances with the defendant, it can be useful and acceptable for the investigating agent to explain that he began to watch the defendant because of this observed meeting. It does not follow, however, that the objective of explaining why the agent focused on the defendantor why the agent proceeded to arrest the defendantjustifies prejudicial hearsay testimony. <i>See </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 20 (\"[I]nvestigating officers ... should not... be allowed to relate historical aspects of the case, such as complaints and reports of others containing inadmissible hearsay. Such statements are sometimes erroneously admitted under the argument that the officers are entitled to give the information upon which they acted.\").\n</p>\n<p>We take it to be common ground that the government may not have an agent testify, \"X told us that the defendant was involved in the crime.\" Quoting X's out-of-court accusation remains impermissible if the agent's testimony is changed to say, \"We began to investigate the defendant because X told us that the defendant was involved in the crime,\" and the government seeks to justify it by arguing that X's out-of-court statement was offered not for its truth but only to explain why the agent focused on (or arrested) the defendant. Nor does the result change if, instead of <i>quoting</i> the out-of-court statement, the government communicates its content to the jury by implication. In such instances, the relatively minor \"probative value [of the evidence of why the agent began surveillance or made an arrest] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\" that results from communicating the accusatory hearsay to the jury. Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 20 (\"The need for this evidence is slight, and the likelihood of misuse great.\") (quoting 2 Broun, et al., <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 249, at 103 (5th ed. 1999)(emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p>[26]  Constitutional errors, such as a Confrontation Clause violation, require reversal unless shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>Cabrera-Rivera,</i> 583 F.3d at 36. In this case, we use the non-constitutional standard that is more favorable to the government because our harmless error analysis embraces both constitutional and non-constitutional errors. The government is unable to meet that easier test for showing harmlessness and, hence, it could not meet the more exacting constitutional standard.</p>\n<p>[27]  The minivan was inspected by DEA Task Force Agent Victor Javier Salgado-Betancourt, who was trained to find secret compartments in motor vehicles. He testified that the hidden compartment he discovered was designed to open only when several buttons or components inside the vehicle were activated at the same time.</p>\n<p>[28]  As described in Section I, Torres testified that Mieses reported that the shoe box in the van contained $100,000, and he asked Torres about \"the merchandise,\" as well as \"how are we going to do this.\"</p>\n<p>[29]  When asked what is audible on the tape, counsel stated that Torres and Rubis could be heard talking as they approached the van and as they walked away from the van.</p>\n\n</div>",

On appeal, the pair claim that their convictions must be vacated because of three significant errors at trial: (1) the government's use of improper overview testimony from the lead law enforcement agent in the case, (2) the indirect admission of the third co-defendant's out-of-court statement implicating appellants, and (3) the district court's refusal to allow the jury to hear an audiotape recorded on the day of their arrests.<sup>[3]</sup> Reyes-Guerrero further asserts that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> As we shall explain, the overview testimony at issue here was improper and, to its credit, the district court acknowledged the error when it considered appellants' post-trial motions for acquittal. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Factual Background</h2>\n<p>The facts underlying appellants' convictions, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Poulin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182471\"><a href=\"/opinion/182471/united-states-v-poulin/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2011), are as follows.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico Police Sergeant Roberto Cruz, a member of a federal drug task force,<sup>[5]</sup> worked undercover in 2007 in an investigation targeting Genito Toribio-Custodio (\"Custodio\"), an alleged trafficker who operated in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Also participating in the undercover investigation was Marcos Antonio Torres, a longtime drug trafficker who had been a paid government informant since 2005.<sup>[6]</sup> The undercover operation ended prematurely when Custodio detected surveillance units and fled from Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p>Seeking to reactivate the investigation the next year, Cruz instructed Torres to solicit Custodio for a cocaine deal in Puerto Rico. On June 19, 2008, in the first of a series of recorded phone calls, Torres informed Custodio that he had 220 kilograms to sell. Initially cautious, Custodio asked Torres if he still communicated with Cruz, whom Custodio did not trust. Torres said they were not in touch. Although Custodio originally said he would travel to Puerto Rico within a few days, he instead arranged for his \"partner\"Dario Pereyra-Rubis (\"Rubis\")to carry out the deal. A few days later, during a meeting in San Juan that Torres recorded, Rubis expressed interest in buying 150 kilograms of cocaine and proposed paying for them after his clients paid him. Torres told Rubis that he could deal only in twenty-five kilogram amounts, and he would provide the drugs only if Rubis brought $100,000. Rubis contacted a client by phone to advise that a deal was in the works, and he then left to consult with the client face-to-face.</p>\n<p>In a follow-up phone call with Custodio, who had already spoken with Rubis, Torres repeated his refusal to defer payment for the drugs and offered to accept a $100,000 deposit. In another phone call the same evening, when Rubis insisted on getting the drugs without cash down, Torres told Rubis that his buyers should come with the money \"so that they are present in the negotiation\" and they \"know where their money is.\" Rubis said he would continue to try to reach an agreement.</p>\n<p>Sensing continuing mistrust on the part of Rubis and Custodio, Cruz arranged for Torres to show Rubis sham kilograms of cocainepackages of wood wrapped with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> the type of tape commonly used by drug traffickers. Their meeting at a shopping center on June 26 was videotaped, and Cruz also was on the scene as part of the surveillance team. Rubis's concerns apparently were resolved when he saw the \"cocaine,\" and Torres testified that Rubis became \"in a hurry to make the deal.\"</p>\n<p>In a series of conversations between Rubis and Torres on the morning of June 27, the deal was confirmed for fifteen kilograms at $14,000 apiece, with $100,000 in cash to be paid on the spot and the balance due a day later. Torres testified that, in the first call, Rubis reported that he was \"with the people, the owners of the money with the money; and that he was desperate to ... make the deal, and he didn't want the people to get bored and leave.\" They agreed to meet at 2 p.m., and in a subsequent call Torres told Rubis to come to the shopping center where they had previously met.</p>\n<p>DEA Task Force members, including Cruz, set up surveillance with videotaping equipment near the shopping center. Agents saw Rubis arrive at the shopping center alone in a green Mazda that belonged to appellant Reyes-Guerrero, briefly leave the area, and then return with Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero in a Ford minivan. Mieses was driving, Reyes-Guerrero was in the front passenger seat, and Rubis was sitting in the back. Mieses dropped Rubis off near where Torres, equipped with a small audio recorder, was waiting, and then drove on a short distance before parking the van. When Torres asked why Rubis was late, Rubis replied that he had arrived earlier, but he needed to wait for \"the owners of the money\" to come with the cash. After Torres complained that he did not want to meet anyone else, Rubis explained that \"the people\" would not give the money to him (i.e., Rubis) because they did not trust him. Asked if the owners were there yet, Rubis said they were \"in their car,\" and he then escorted Torres to the minivan. Torres testified that, as they proceeded to the vehicle, Rubis assured him that these individuals were trustworthy and that he had previously carried out drug transactions with them.</p>\n<p>According to Torres, when he and Rubis arrived at the passenger side of the van, Reyes-Guerrero rolled down his window and Rubis briefly introduced the men. Reyes-Guerrero directed them to \"get in\" the car, but Torres refused because he feared being kidnapped. Torres then asked if they were ready; Mieses replied \"yes\" and Reyes-Guerrero nodded. Torres asked to see the money, prompting Mieses to reach behind his seat and, with Reyes-Guerrero's help, pull out a shoe box. Reyes-Guerrero passed the box to Torres, who opened it and asked how much money it contained. After responding \"$100,000,\" Mieses asked about \"the merchandise,\" and Torres told him that it was in his car. Mieses then asked, \"How are we going to do this?\" Torres responded that he would return to his car and drive off, and the others should follow. As Torres walked away from the minivan, he passed his hand over his head in a prearranged signal to let Cruz know that he had seen the money and the deal was underway.</p>\n<p>Significantly, although the conversation between Torres and Rubis in the parking lot was recorded by the device Torres carried, the exchange among the men at the minivan could not be heard on the tape. Cruz attributed the glitch to background traffic noise at that location, and Torres testified that a gap is not unusual when he carries a recording device. Cruz and the other Task Force members were too far away from the minivan to hear the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> men talking, and the jury thus heard only Torres's account of what was said there.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>After Torres signaled Cruz, Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero were quickly arrested, and Rubis, who had tried to flee, was apprehended several blocks away. A blue Reebok shoe box containing $100,000 was recovered from the van, and a subsequent inspection of the vehicle revealed a hidden compartment beneath the rear floor. Rubis indicated a willingness to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and he was interviewed at the DEA offices by Cruz and another Task Force agent. Cruz testified that, after the interview, the targets of his investigation changed, and he reported that Reyes-Guerrero and Mieses were immediately processed and detained. Rubis, Reyes-Guerrero, and Mieses were all charged with a single count of conspiracy to possess five or more kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute the drugs. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>During appellants' five-day trial in February 2009, the government presented the details of the reverse sting largely through the testimony of Cruz and Torres. The jury also heard the audio recordings of the preparatory telephone calls involving Rubis, Torres, and Custodio and saw the videotapes of the sham cocaine display and the attempted transaction. Despite defendants' objections, the court allowed the prosecutor to ask Cruz what role defendants played within the drug trafficking organization. Cruz identified Mieses as \"one of the buyers,\" and Reyes-Guerrero as \"the other buyer.\" Cruz also described them as the \"owners of the money.\" Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero defended by arguing \"mere presence,\" attempting to persuade the jury that they were merely bystanders to Rubis's drug deal.<sup>[8]</sup> The strategy was unsuccessful, and both men were found guilty.</p>\n<p>In post-trial motions for judgments of acquittal, appellants challenged the court's instruction on \"mere presence\" and asserted that the court erred in allowing Cruz to present overview testimony that was based on hearsay. They further argued that the evidence adduced by the government was insufficient as a matter of law to support the guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p>In a thorough and thoughtful opinion, the district court acknowledged that Cruz's testimony about appellants' roles in the drug transaction had been improperly admitted, <i>Reyes-Guerrero,</i> 638 F.Supp.2d at 190, and that the error \"may have constituted sufficient grounds for the granting of a new trial pursuant to a harmless error standard.\" <i>Id.</i> at 179 n. 1. Because the defendants had not moved for such relief, however, the court addressed only their request for acquittal. <i>Id.</i> It concluded that Torres's testimony alone provided ample support for findings of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, <i>id.</i> at 192-93, and it therefore denied the motions.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>On appeal, appellants raise four arguments. First, they jointly reiterate their contention that admission of Cruz's overview testimonyspecifically, his assertions that they played the role of buyerswas reversible error. Second, they challenge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> the admission of Cruz's testimony about his post-arrest interview with Rubis. They argue that Cruz's revelation that after the interview the targets of his investigation changed necessarily implied a statement by Rubis identifying Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero as co-conspirators in the drug deal. Admission of that implied out-of-court statement, they assert, violated their rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Third, Mieses challenges the court's refusal to allow the jury to hear a portion of the audio recording made by Torres on June 27. Mieses insists that the recording was relevant to the jurors' appraisal of Torres's testimony about the conversation at the minivan and why it was not captured on the tape. Finally, Reyes-Guerrero renews his sufficiency argument, which is where we begin our discussion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Reyes-Guerrero argues that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because a conspiracy charge requires proof of the defendant's \"own words or actions\" and the record in this case involves only \"the mouth of the government informant.\" He asserts that Torres's uncorroborated testimony is insufficient to support a finding that Reyes-Guerrero was a knowing and voluntary participant in a conspiracy, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Bristol-Martir,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203956\"><a href=\"/opinion/203956/united-states-v-bristol-martir/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2009), and he insists that the jury could properly conclude only that he happened to be present when Rubis transacted a drug deal.</p>\n<p>Reyes-Guerrero undervalues the evidence against him.<sup>[10]</sup> The testimony of a single witness can be enough to support the government's case, <i>United States v. De La Paz-Rentas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151092\"><a href=\"/opinion/151092/united-states-v-de-la-paz-rentas/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1st Cir.2010), and even the uncorroborated testimony of an informant may suffice \"to establish the facts underlying a defendant's conviction,\" <i>United States v. Merlino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204139\"><a href=\"/opinion/204139/united-states-v-merlino/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2010). The jury assesses witness credibility, <i>United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174049\"><a href=\"/opinion/174049/united-states-v-rivera-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 596 n. 6 (1st Cir.2010), and the jurors in this case were properly informed about Torres's drug-dealing past and cautioned about accepting his testimony.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, the government did not rest solely on informant testimony to rebut Reyes-Guerrero's mere presence defense. The government also introduced recordings of phone conversations, videotapes, and Cruz's testimony based on direct surveillance. The early phone conversations between Torres and Rubis indicated that Rubis was acting as a broker for buyers who were reluctant to part with their cash before obtaining drugs, and the events on the morning of the scheduled transaction permitted the jury to infer that appellants were those buyers. Moreover, Rubis reported in one call that he was with the \"owners of the money,\" and he later appeared for the deal with Mieses and Reyes-Guerreroand the money. Reyes-Guerrero's travel to the scene of the transaction, in a vehicle containing a hidden compartment suitable for transporting drugs, was his own conduct that has considerable significance in light of the other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> evidence. In addition, Rubis told Torres he originally had arrived early for the transaction but then was delayed because he had to wait for the buyers. That explanation as recounted by Torresi.e., Rubis's early arrival and subsequent returnmatched the observations of the Task Force agents on the scene.</p>\n<p>The informant testimony, if believed by the jury, was particularly damaging. Torres testified that Reyes-Guerrero nodded his head when asked if he was ready to proceed with the deal, signaling active participation. Although Torres's report that Reyes-Guerrero had helped to retrieve the box of money from behind the driver's seat was more ambiguous, it was nonetheless additional evidence that the jury could have viewed as proof of Reyes-Guerrero's complicity in the transaction. The jury thus had before it sufficient evidence pointing to Reyes-Guerrero's guilt.</p>\n<p>Although a guilty verdict was not inevitableas we explain belowour rejection of Reyes-Guerrero's sufficiency claim is not inconsistent with our decision to vacate appellants' convictions. Our concerns, and the stakes, are considerably different when we evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict than when we assess the impact of discrete evidentiary errors on that verdict. If even the properly admitted evidence would not permit a reasonable jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the government has failed to prove its case and the defendant is entitled to acquittal. If, instead, the properly admitted evidence is sufficient to prove guilt, but other, erroneously admitted evidence might have influenced the verdict, our concern is that the defendant was denied a fair trial. The remedy in such circumstances is a new trial, not acquittal.</p>\n<p>Here, taking into account only the evidence whose admission is not challenged, the record was sufficient for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Reyes-Guerrero was more than an innocent bystander to Rubis's transaction. Hence, we affirm the district court's denial of his motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellants assert three evidence-related errors. Two are claims of wrongful admission of testimony by Cruz: his overview testimony identifying appellants as the buyers in the drug deal and his report about his post-arrest interview with Rubis. The third claim, raised only by Mieses, is that the court erred in refusing to admit a portion of the audiotape recorded on the day of the attempted cocaine purchase. We discuss the merits of each of these contentions before turning to the question of harmless error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Cruz's Overview Testimony</h2>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Flores-de-Jesus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203873\"><a href=\"/opinion/203873/united-states-v-flores-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2009), we reviewed at length why the government must be wary of using a law enforcement agent in a multi-defendant drug trial to provide an \"overview\" of the prosecution's case, and we sharply criticized the U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico for its repeated improper use of the practice. <i>See id.</i> at 16-27; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200815\"><a href=\"/opinion/200815/united-states-v-casas/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 117-20 (1st Cir.2004). Both <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and our earlier decision in <i>Casas</i> particularly condemned testimony from an agent, not based on personal knowledge, describing the roles played in the drug conspiracy by individual defendants. <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 16, 24; <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 118-19. Such descriptions amount to impermissible testimony from the agent \"that each of the defendants was guilty of the conspiracy charged.\" <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 119 (<i>quoted in </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 24).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> In similar fashion to <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas,</i> the lead law enforcement officer in this case, Agent Cruz, was called as the first witness at trial. He testified to the step-by-step progression of the investigation, describing the phone calls and meetings that culminated in the arrests at the shopping center. At the end of the direct examination, after confirming that Cruz had listened to all of the phone calls and audio recordings, conversed with and supervised Torres, and watched the meetings between Rubis and Torres that were videotaped, the prosecutor asked Cruz what role each individual had played in the conspiracy. Cruz testified that Rubis was \"a broker within the drug trafficking organization,\" Mieses \"in this deal was one of the buyers,\" and Reyes-Guerrero was \"the other buyer.\"</p>\n<p><i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> was issued approximately four months after the trial in this case, between appellants' filing of post-trial motions for judgment of acquittal and the district court's ruling on the motions. In its decision on the motions, the district court observed that <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> had drawn \"clear boundaries between permissible and impermissible `overview testimony' at the beginning of trial.\" 638 F.Supp.2d at 188 (citing <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 19-20). It concluded that, although a case agent may describe the course of an investigation to provide background information, Cruz's pronouncement that the defendants were the buyers was plainly improper. <i>Id.</i> The testimony did not satisfy the requirements for lay witness testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 701, the court held, because it was \"not based squarely on personal knowledge.\" <i>Id.</i> at 189.<sup>[12]</sup> Cruz was not a participant in the attempted drug deal and, \"[i]mportantly, ... was unable to hear any of the words allegedly spoken by the defendants at the time the informant approached them to make the drug exchange.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On appeal, appellants argue that the impermissible role-in-the-offense testimony was reversible error entitling them to a new trial. The government insists that Cruz's testimony did not violate the principles outlined in <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas</i> because, unlike the agents in those cases, Cruz directly participated in every aspect of the investigation. The government recounts the evidence to which Cruz was directly exposedthe conversations and meetings between Rubis and Torres, and the encounter at the vanand argues that Cruz's \"testimony about [appellants'] roles as buyers was based on his perception of events that he participated in and was therefore proper lay opinion testimony under Rule 701.\"</p>\n<p>The government is correct that this case differs from <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas.</i> Those cases both involved wide-ranging overview testimony by law enforcement agents whose descriptions of the conspiracies at issue relied heavily on information told to them by othersi.e., on inadmissible hearsayrather than on their own personal knowledge. <i>See </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 24; <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 119.<sup>[13]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> By contrast, Cruz played a hands-on role in nearly every aspect of the investigation underlying this case, and most of his testimony consisted of describing the sequence of events that he had seen and heard. Such testimony is permissible and \"valuable to provide background information and to explain how and why the agents even came to be involved with th[e] particular defendant[s].\" <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original).<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>In the way that matters to us here, however, this case is equivalent to <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas.</i> Appellants challenge only Cruz's testimony announcing their roles in the conspiracy. In <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> we characterized the agent's role-in-the-offense conclusion as \"[t]he most troubling part\" of his testimony. <i>See</i> 569 F.3d at 24. We observed that, \"[w]hen a law enforcement witness `express[es] opinions as to defendants' culpability based on the totality of information gathered in the course of their investigation[],' these conclusory statements often involve impermissible lay opinion testimony, without any basis in personal knowledge, about the role of the defendant in the conspiracy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19 (quoting <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790797\"><a href=\"/opinion/790797/united-states-v-yuri-garcia-aka-bonitillo-and-francisco-valentin-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 211 (2d Cir.2005) (second and third alterations in original)).</p>\n<p>Cruz's opinion on the defendants' roles was flawed in part by just such a lack of personal knowledge. As the district court pointed out, Cruz did not see or hear the only explicitly inculpatory conduct attributed to appellantsthe interaction of Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero with Rubis and Torres at the minivan. Cruz admitted that his knowledge of appellants' interaction with Rubis and Torres came solely from Torres: \"The informant is the only one that can declare as to what happened there.\" Inevitably, Torres's report about what <i>he</i> had observed inside the vehiclethe most harmful evidence in the casewas part of Cruz's calculus in ascribing roles to the defendants in the conspiracy.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> Hence, we agree with the district court that Cruz's challenged testimony failed, at least in part, to satisfy the requirement that lay opinions be \"rationally based on the perception of the witness,\" Fed.R.Evid. 701(a). As the Second Circuit has noted, the \"`traditional objective'\" of Rule 701 is \"to afford the trier of fact `an accurate reproduction of the event' at issue.\" <i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 211 (quoting advisory committee note on 1972 Proposed Rules). Cruz neither saw nor heard the critical episode in the investigation, and his opinions as to defendants' roles in the conspiracy, based in part on <i>Torres's</i> perceptions of the interaction, were thus inadmissible under Rule 701(a).<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Even if the government could argue that Cruz was capable of inferring appellants' roles based only on what he had personally observed, his testimony would still be impermissible because it did not satisfy Rule 701's requirement that lay opinion evidence be \"helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\" Fed. R.Evid. 701(b). The nub of that requirement is to exclude testimony where \"`the witness is no better suited than the jury'\" to make the judgment at issue, <i>United States v. Kornegay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201633\"><a href=\"/opinion/201633/united-states-v-kornegay/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>United States v.

R.Evid. 704 advisory committee's note on 1972 Proposed Rules)).</p>\n<p>Cruz had no insight to offer the jurors based on personal knowledge of the appellants' inculpatory conduct. Like them, he had to rely on Torres's account of what occurred in the vehicle. Like them, he heard the audio recordings of the phone calls. Although he was present at the scene when surveillance videotapes were recorded, the jurors watched the tapes of those encounters, allowing them to see what Cruz had seen. Indeed, when asked on cross-examination why he concluded that Mieses was a buyer, Cruz responded: \"Because Mr. Meises and Mr. [Reyes-]Guerrero were the two that were in custody of the money at the time of the intervention. They were the two that were protecting that money so nothing would happen to it.\" In other words, Cruz inferred appellants' roles not from any direct knowledge, but from the same circumstantial evidence that was before the juryeffectively usurping the jury's role as fact-finder.<sup>[17]</sup> Moreover, as used by the government, the testimony amounted to argumentative interpretation. It was perfectly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> appropriate for the prosecutor to argue in summation that the evidence of the defendants' actions and words supported the inference that they were the buyers. But having Cruz so testify amounted to simply dressing up argument as evidence.</p>\n<p>The difference between Cruz's information and the base of knowledge necessary to make a lay opinion helpful to the jury in a case such as this is apparent when the circumstances here are contrasted with a scenario described by the Second Circuit in <i>Garcia:</i></p>\n<blockquote>[W]hen an undercover agent participates in a hand-to-hand drug exchange with a number of persons, the agent may well testify that, in his opinion, a particular participant, \"X,\" was the person directing the transaction. Such an opinion is based on his personal perception of such subjective factors as the respect various participants showed \"X,\" their deference to \"X\" when he spoke, and their consummation of the deal only upon a subtly signaled approval by \"X.\" By allowing the agent to state his opinion as to a person's role in such circumstances, Rule 701 affords the jury an insight into an event that was uniquely available to an eyewitness.</blockquote>\n<p>413 F.3d at 211-12. Cruz, as he admitted himself, was not an eyewitness with unique access to appellants' conduct; his testimony could only have replaced, rather than aided, the jury's assessment of the evidence.<sup>[18]</sup> It was thus not admissible lay opinion testimony. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 213-14 (explaining that jurors are not \"`helped' within the meaning of Rule 701 by opinion testimony that, in addition to telling them `what was in the evidence,' also told them `what inferences to draw from it'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Grinage,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788492\"><a href=\"/opinion/788492/united-states-v-raynard-grinage-also-known-as-boogee-also-known-as-hans/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>, 750 (2d Cir.2004)); <i>see also</i> 4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence</i> § 701.05 (Joseph M. McLaughlin, ed., 2d ed.2011) (noting that, to protect the jury's role as fact-finder, courts must be wary of lay opinion testimony whose \"sole function is to answer the same question that the trier of fact is to consider in its deliberations\"); <i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 210-11.</p>\n<p>The usurpation problem that arises when a witness testifies to opinions based on evidence that was also available to the jurors is compounded when the witness is a government agent whose testimonyas hereis effectively a judgment on the question of guilt or innocence. This is one variant of the imprimatur problem we described in <i>Flores-de-Jesus</i> and <i>Casas.</i> There, we focused primarily on our concern that the government agent's preview of other witnesses' testimony would endorse their testimony \"in what can only be viewed as an attempt by the government to bolster the credibility of those later witnesses.\" <i>See </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 26; <i>see also id.</i> at 17-19; <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 120.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the vouching concern also exists here to the extent that Cruz's role-in-the-offense opinion implicitly endorsed Torres's later testimony describing appellants' conduct in the minivan, the problem <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> with Cruz's testimony extends beyond vouching for what the jury may perceive as a less credible witness. The jurors were told that, based on the same evidence before them, an experienced government agent had rejected appellants' mere presence defense and concluded that they were participants in the conspiracy. Given the effect on juries of the government's imprimatur, <i>see </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 18; <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 120, it was patently unfair for Cruz to present his view of appellants' culpability. \"It is ... the jury's singular responsibility to decide from the evidence admitted at trial whether the government has carried its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 215; <i>see also </i><i>Grinage,</i> 390 F.3d at 751 (\"[T]he agent was presented to the jury with an aura of expertise and authority which increased the risk that the jury would be swayed by his testimony, rather than rely on its own interpretation....\").<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, Cruz's testimony about appellants' roles in the June 27 transaction lacked a foundation of personal knowledge of facts essential to his opinion, usurped the jury's fact-finding function, and improperly endorsed the government's theory of the case. Hence, it is beyond debate that the testimony was wrongly admitted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Cruz's Testimony about the Post-Arrest Interview of Rubis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Background</h2>\n<p>During cross-examination of Agent Cruz, Reyes-Guerrero's counsel elicited the fact that Reyes-Guerrero was not a target of the Task Force investigation until the day of the arrests. Cruz specifically acknowledged that Reyes-Guerrero's name did not appear in the four or five official investigative reportsknown as \"DEA-6 reports\"that were prepared before that day. On redirect examination by the government, Cruz confirmed that Reyes-Guerrero's name did appear in the last such report, \"the arrest report.\" When the prosecutor followed up by asking about the contents of that report, defense counsel objected and the court convened a bench conference.</p>\n<p>The final DEA report described the post-arrest interview of Rubis by Cruz and another Task Force agent. In the bench conference, the prosecutor explained that he would not try to \"elicit the actual statements\" uttered by Rubis in the interview, apparently recognizing that such testimony would trigger hearsay and Confrontation Clause problems. Rather, he would ask about Rubis's offer to cooperate, whether he was interviewed outside the presence of the others, \"[a]nd what did [Cruz] do after the meeting was over.\" Reyes-Guerrero's counsel protested that evidence about the interview would be hearsay because the prosecutor was \"trying to establish the truth of the matter asserted,\" and he emphasized that \"Rubis is not here.\"</p>\n<p>The district court, after suggesting that any statement from Rubis would be admissible as a statement by a co-conspirator,<sup>[21]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> allowed the prosecutor to proceed. The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: Agent Cruz, the DEA-6 that I just asked you about, without saying what is in that DEA-6, specifically, the whole report, what's it about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: That report is an interview that was made to Mr. Rubis Dario after the arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: After all three were arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Yes, after all three were arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Okay. Where were these two individuals while you were interviewing him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: These two individuals were in the cell at the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Why were they not in the interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Because the interview was being carried out with Mr. Rubis only and with us because he had the intention of cooperating with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: After this interview, did the targets of your investigation at this point change?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Okay. After this interview, what did you decide to do with Defendant [Reyes-Guerrero]?</blockquote>\n<p>Cruz then testified that the defendants were processed and taken to a federal detention facility.</p>\n<p>On appeal, appellants argue that Cruz implicitly testified that Rubis had identified them as co-conspirators, and they assert that the indirect admission of Rubis's statement violated their rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as described in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (2004). Under <i>Crawford,</i> the admission of testimonial hearsay against a defendant is prohibited unless the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. <i>Id.</i> at 68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although Rubis was unavailable, having become a fugitive, appellants had no prior opportunity to question him about his interview statements.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>We begin our assessment of this claim with the government's contention that the <i>Crawford</i> issue was not preserved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Forfeiture</h2>\n<p>The government argues that neither appellant may pursue a Confrontation Clause challenge on appeal because Reyes-Guerrero objected at trial on hearsay grounds, without referencing the Confrontation Clause or <i>Crawford,</i> and Mieses did not object at all.</p>\n<p>We can easily dispatch the argument as to Reyes-Guerrero. Although the government accurately recites our precedent holding that an objection on hearsay grounds will not preserve a Confrontation Clause claim, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174049\"><a href=\"/opinion/174049/united-states-v-rivera-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 594 (1st Cir. 2010), we have in the past looked to the full context of counsel's colloquy with the court in determining whether a <i>Crawford</i> challenge was preserved. In <i>Cabrera-Rivera,</i> for example, we found it \"obvious that counsel was objecting to [defendant's] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> inability to confront the declarant\" where counsel had pointed to the declarant's unavailability at trial. <i>See</i> 583 F.3d at 36 (citing counsel's statement that the declarant \"is not here to\"). We therefore concluded that the defendant had preserved his Confrontation Clause claim. Here, too, counsel plainly raised both hearsay and Confrontation Clause concerns. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Tr. Transcript (Feb. 19, 2009), at 10 (\"Because Rubis is not here, <i>and</i> ... the attorney is trying to establish the truth of the matter asserted because of this.\") (emphasis added); <i>id.</i> at 10-11 (\"There's a... thin line, your Honor, and it might ... this hearsay information, your Honor, we don't know which context it happens; <i>and,</i> also, Mr. Rubis, again, is not here.\") (emphasis added).<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>Mieses's counsel, by contrast, was largely silent throughout the exchange on this issue. He participated in the sidebar conference discussing the proposed testimony, however, and voiced his agreement that the prejudice from the line of questioning outweighed its probative value. In context, where the interests of both defendants were identical, we are satisfied that Mieses's counsel incorporated Reyes-Guerrero's more fully stated objection into his brief comment.</p>\n<p>We thus afford plenary review to both appellants' claims. We generally review preserved evidentiary errors for abuse of discretion, but \"[w]e review <i>de novo</i> whether the strictures of the Confrontation Clause have been met.\" <i>Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 617 F.3d at 590 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Out-of-court statements excluded from evidence under <i>Crawford</i> must be both testimoniali.e., statements an objectively reasonable declarant could have anticipated would be used at trialand offered for their truth, thus constituting hearsay. <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 51-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government also appears to accept that testimony revealing an \"actual statement[]\" by Rubis about appellants' complicity in the drug deal would be inadmissible hearsay. It seeks to defeat appellants' <i>Crawford</i> claim on two other grounds: (1) no actual statement, and thus no improper hearsay, was introduced into evidence, and (2) Reyes-Guerrero's counsel opened the door to the challenged testimony.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> a. No Statement</h2>\n<p>In the pertinent portion of the challenged exchange, Cruz was asked, in essence, if Rubis had said anything during his interview that changed the targets of the investigation and prompted the defendants' arrests. Cruz answered affirmatively. The government maintains that the prosecutor's examination was \"adroitly focused ... on the actions that Agent Cruz took after speaking to Rubis,\" while appellants argue that \"[n]o juror of normal intelligence, hearing this exchange, could have failed to get the prosecutor's point that Rubis, in his statement to the agents, had implicated [him] as a co-conspirator.\" Reyes-Guerrero Brief at 21; <i>see also</i> Mieses Brief at 32. Appellants assert that \"the import of this testimony is no less clear than if Rubis had been directly quoted.\" Reyes-Guerrero Reply Brief at 5.</p>\n<p>We agree with appellants that a reasonable jury could only have understood Cruz to have communicated that Rubis had identified appellants as participants in the drug deal. It makes no difference that the government took care not to introduce Rubis's \"actual statements.\" Although the government could properly seek to rebut Reyes-Guerrero's suggestion that the appellants were innocent bystanders, it did so with testimony that plainly told the jurors that Rubis <i>said</i> they were co-conspirators rather than with the available evidence circumstantially pointing to their culpability.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v.

Here, the issue is addressed head-on by both appellants.

The concerns animating the right to confrontation are especially acute when the statement at issue originates from an ex parte examination by a law enforcement officer. <i>See </i><i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 50-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Opened Door</h2>\n<p>The government suggests that, even if Cruz's testimony about the interview indirectly resulted in the introduction of an out-of-court statement, the testimony was nonetheless proper to rebut Reyes-Guerrero's cross-examination eliciting the fact that the two defendants were never mentioned in the investigative reports prior to the incident at the van. In the sidebar discussion following Reyes-Guerrero's objection at trial, the prosecutor stated that he had avoided referring to the interview in his direct questioning but defense counsel's focus on Reyes-Guerrero's absence from the DEA reports had triggered a need for the testimony.</p>\n<p>The government's argument on this issue borders on the frivolous. The testimony elicited by Reyes-Guerrero's counsel about the early DEA reports was proper evidence in support of appellants' mere presence defense, showing that appellants had not previously been known to law enforcement authorities. The government does not explain in its brief how that testimony opened the door to evidence on the content of Rubis's interview. At trial, the prosecutor asserted that the evidence was necessary rebuttal because, in context, the questioning on the early reports was \"diminishing [appellants'] culpability.\" That may be. Defendants are entitled to cross-examine government witnesses in an effort to diminish their own culpability, and the government is entitled to counter with appropriate rebuttal evidence. The evidence of appellants' absence from the earlier reports was neither inaccurate nor misleading, and the government did not contend otherwise. The government could properly have countered by showing, for example, that appellants did appear in the final report, which was prepared after the incident at the van and described the transaction. By no means, however, did the cross-examination testimony require or justify rebuttal that violated the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the government's rationale essentially acknowledges that the evidence of Rubis's accusation of complicity was offered to establish the truth of the accusationi.e., that appellants <i>were</i> participants in the drug transaction, notwithstanding the silence of the early reports. Hence, admission of Cruz's testimony about the interview was improper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Harmless Error</h2>\n<p>Both appellants argue that the errors described above entitle them to a new trial. Reyes-Guerrero asserts that admission of Cruz's overview testimony and the indirect admission of Rubis's out-of-court statements each is reversible error on its own, and Mieses additionally argues that the multiple errors require the grant of a new trial under the cumulative error doctrine. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Meserve,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199680\"><a href=\"/opinion/199680/united-states-v-meserve/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 331-32 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v.

We strongly doubt, however, that the jury was unaffected by Cruz's improper testimony, which communicated to the jurors that Cruz, an experienced drug investigator, and Rubis, who admitted his guilt, had both identified appellants as participants in the conspiracy. We have recognized the \"`devastating'\" impact of a co-defendant's extrajudicial statements, <i>Cabrera-Rivera,</i> 583 F.3d at 37 (quoting <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 136, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1620</span></a></span>), and an essential premise of our warnings about overview evidence is that jurors view the testimony of law enforcement officers as especially authoritative, <i>see </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 17-18.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the prosecution depended heavily on the believability of Torres, a paid government informant. In evaluating harmless error, we cannot presume the jury would have accepted his testimony as readily without the corroboration provided by Cruz's testimony. Indeed, consistent with standard practice for informant witnesses, the court instructed the jurors to consider Torres's testimony with caution. <i>See </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 26 (noting the \"often problematic testimony of confidential informants with unsavory pasts\").</p>\n<p>The other evidence of appellants' knowing involvement was suggestive, but not overwhelming. In recorded calls on the day of the arrests, Rubis said he was with the buyers, but he did not identify them by name. Mieses and Reyes-Guerrero were seated in the front of the minivan, while the known conspiratorand the moneywere in the back. That vehicle, with its hidden compartment, was not registered to either appellant, and the compartment was not visible to the driver or passengers.<sup>[27]</sup> Cruz testified that the video taken of the attempted drug deal does not show Mieses talking at alldespite Torres's testimony that Mieses made several incriminating statements. The jury in fact heard none of the recorded conversations among the men that dayincluding Rubis's statement, reported by Torres, that the owners of the money were in the carbecause the audio recording was not introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p>The government's heavy reliance on the informant's credibility made the overview <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> evidence particularly damaging in this case. In effect, the jurors were told it was unnecessary to make their own assessment of Torres's credibility because Cruz did it for them when he announced unequivocally that appellants were \"the owners\" of the money. Rubis's accusation validated Cruz's assessment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gomez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"152213\"><a href=\"/opinion/152213/united-states-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 97 (2d Cir.2010) (\"The improperly admitted evidence had substantial weight precisely because it went to the core of the government's case against [the defendant], placing an unimpeachable accusation before the jury.\").</p>\n<p>In sum, the tainted evidence was central to the prosecution's case and potentially disastrous to the appellants' defense of mere presence. The contested statements were not \"`cumulative of other compelling proof'\" that the defendants \"`committed the charged [crime],'\" <i>United States v. Earle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202779\"><a href=\"/opinion/202779/united-states-v-earle/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 546 (1st Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (quoting <i>United States v.

Hence, we cannot say that it is \"highly probable\" that the errors did not affect the jury's resolution of the case and, accordingly, we conclude that appellants are entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Exclusion of the Audiotape</h2>\n<p>Our conclusion that appellants' convictions must be vacated based on the overview and Sixth Amendment errors makes it unnecessary to rule on Mieses's contention that the district court erred in excluding the audio recording made by informant Torres on the day of the arrests. Because the issue is likely to arise again in the new trial, however, we see value in examining this claim.</p>\n<p>Torres testified that Mieses made several incriminating statements during their encounter at the van,<sup>[28]</sup> and Mieses's counsel sought to cross-examine Torres with the recording, which all parties agreed did not contain either defendant's voice. When counsel asked for a ten-minute break during cross-examination to find the relevant portion of the one-hour recording, the government objected that the tape was incomplete and therefore both misleading and prejudicial. The prosecutor also protested that the recording was inadmissible without an English translation. The court rejected admission of the recording, stating: \"I don't see any reason why I should admit this tape.... [T]his is too little, too late.\"</p>\n<p>Mieses's counsel again urged admission of the recording following the government's redirect examination of Torres. Counsel emphasized that \"[t]he most important factor in this case is what was said inside that van,\" and \"the most important thing is that the voice[s] of the Defendants are not heard there.\" The court listened to the recording at counsel's request, but then reaffirmed its initial decision, noting that it was \"clear from all the testimony\" that the defendants' voices were \"not heard in any tape.\"</p>\n<p>Mieses presses an argument on appeal that was implicit in the objections raised at trial, but not fully articulated there. He argues that the crucial aspect of the recording is not that the defendants' voices are absenta fact that no one disputes. Rather, he asserts that the jurors needed to hear the recording so they could decide whetheras Torres claimedthe audio was faulty, or whether Torres had fabricated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> the exchange in the minivan. Stressing the plausibility of the latter view during oral argument on appeal, defense counsel noted that, at a minimum, the recorder should have picked up the statements that Torres claimed to have made to appellants.<sup>[29]</sup> Mieses insists that a translated transcript of the recording should not have been a prerequisite for its admission because the issue was not what was said on the tape, but why the conversation described by Torres was not therea question of recording quality, not content.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the government made much of the supposedly faulty equipment in its closing argument, emphasizing that the critical conversation was unavailable to be played for the jurors through no fault of its own:</p>\n<blockquote>Couldn't get an audio of it. Agent Cruz explained to you why. The wind was blowing. The equipment didn't half work.... Electronics are that way. This equipment is not perfect. People are not perfect. And how many times in this trial did our equipment not work? How many times does your cell phone drop a call? Think about your common experience as an individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We could not get what happened in that van on audio. Sure, I'd love to be able to play that to you. But that doesn't take away what the informantthe man that sat therewho was cross-examined for hours and hours and hours. He didn't want to be here. His family didn't want him here. You heard the testimony. But he testified to you what exactly went on in that van.</blockquote>\n<p>Mieses's claim of error, briefly stated, is that exclusion of the audio recording compromised his ability to respond to this argument.</p>\n<p>As noted, we need not decide whether the district court, which received an imperfect articulation of Mieses's claim, abused its discretion in excluding the audiotape. We observe, however, that the absence of defendants' voices on the recording was potentially significant evidence rebutting Torres's incriminating account of their behavior. The government and the defense argue different reasons for the recording device's failure to pick up Reyes-Guerrero's and Mieses's voices. We see little reason why the correct explanation should not be a jury question, as to which the sounds captured on the tape itself might be potent evidence. Assuming the lack of an English transcript of the recording was adequate reason for the exclusion, defendants can prepare a transcript before their retrial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the judgments of conviction and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The indictment and other court documents spell \"Mieses\" as \"Meises,\" and we do likewise in the official caption of this case. In the remainder of the opinion, however, we adopt the spelling used by Mieses in his brief.</p>\n<p>[2]  In a classic sting operation, an undercover agent attempts to purchase drugs from a suspect. In a reverse sting, agents offer to sell drugs to their targets. <i>United States v. Pinillos-Prieto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201767\"><a href=\"/opinion/201767/united-states-v-pinillos/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>[3]  Only Mieses challenges the admission of the audiotape.</p>\n<p>[4]  We explain in Section II why we reject Reyes-Guerrero's sufficiency argument.</p>\n<p>[5]  At the time of the trial in this case, Cruz had been assigned to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Task Force for fourteen years.</p>\n<p>[6]  Torres testified that he began drug trafficking when he was sixteen and continued until he was arrested about two decades later.</p>\n<p>[7]  In fact, no transcript was made from any part of that day's audiotape, and the tape was not played for the jury. Torres's testimony was thus the only evidence on what was said throughout the June 27 episode, including during the exchange between Torres and Rubis before they approached the minivan.</p>\n<p>[8]  Rubis disappeared after posting bond and has not been tried.</p>\n<p>[9]  The court rejected the appellants' claim of instructional error.</p>\n<p>[10]  For purposes of our sufficiency analysis, we do not consider the testimony of Cruz to which appellants have objected.</p>\n<p>[11]  In its pre-deliberations charge to the jury, the court gave the following instruction:\n</p>\n<p>You have heard the testimony of Mark Anthony Torres. He provided evidence under contract agreements with the Government and received money from the Government in exchange for providing information. Some people in this position are truthful when testifying. Still, you should consider the testimony of Mark Anthony Torres with particular caution.</p>\n<p>[12]  Rule 701 provides:\n</p>\n<p>If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.</p>\n<p>Fed.R.Evid. 701.</p>\n<p>[13]  Overview evidence often provides an anticipatory summary of the prosecution's case by previewing the testimony of other witnesses. <i>See </i><i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 16-17. In <i>Casas,</i> the circumstances were \"particularly problematic\" because the agent's testimony \"was likely based on the testimony of a cooperating co-conspirator whom the government chose not to call at trial,\" leaving the defendants unable to cross-examine the cooperator or \"`challenge a conclusion drawn from what he had said.'\" <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> 569 F.3d at 24 n. 8 (quoting <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 119).</p>\n<p>[14]  Although testimony explaining why the investigation turned its focus to a particular defendant is rarely competent evidence on the principal question of whether the defendant is guilty, it can be useful to avoid jury confusion and speculation as to why agents suddenly began to conduct surveillance on the defendant. It can therefore be acceptable despite its lack of relevance to the question of guilt or innocence, <i>so long as it does not involve communicating incompetent and prejudicial information to the jury.</i> As we shall explain, the problems associated with evidence offered to show the context of law enforcement actions can involve violations of the hearsay rule or the Sixth Amendment. <i>See infra</i> Part II.B.</p>\n<p>[15]  Before eliciting Cruz's opinion on Rubis's and appellants' roles, the prosecutor engaged in the following exchange with him:\n</p>\n<p>Q: Did you listen to all the calls in this case?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Q: Did you have conversations with the informant [Torres]?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q: Did you supervise the informant?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q: Did you listen to the audio recordings of any meetings the informant had with [Rubis]?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q: And did you watch the two meetings that we viewed here today?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor then asked what role each of the three men had played, \"[b]ased on everything you observed.\" In the context of the questioning, a jury would almost surely understand that Cruz's response to this question was informed not only by what he had \"observed,\" but also by what he had heard in the audio recordings and what he had learned from his conversations with Torres, including an account of what happened in the minivan. As we explain <i>infra,</i> even if that assumption is incorrect, the result here would be the same.</p>\n<p>[16]  Indeed, the government's attempt on appeal to justify Cruz's testimony as lay opinion within the scope of Rule 701 is inconsistent with its argument at trial. When the defense objected to the offer of Cruz's interpretation of the events, the government responded: \"This witness was supervising the informant. He told him exactly what to do. He was on surveillance many, many times. He heard the phone calls.... So he's a fact witness.\" Given Cruz's lack of personal knowledge and other problems discussed <i>infra,</i> his role-in-the-offense testimony did not qualify as either fact evidence or proper lay opinion.</p>\n<p>[17]  Notably, Cruz's explanation relied on two levels of inference beyond the undisputed fact that appellants arrived in the vehicle with the cash: first, that appellants were guarding the money and, second, that the money belonged to them. Neither inference was based on conduct observed by Cruz.</p>\n<p>[18]  We note that the opinion of the law enforcement agent described by the court in <i>Garcia</i> concerns an individual's observable role in relation to other participants at the scene of a drug transaction, not the individual's overall role in the conspiracy. The latter would be more likely to rest on evidence beyond the agent's perceptions at the scene.</p>\n<p>[19]  As we observed in <i>Flores-de-Jesus,</i> the government is particularly eager for such testimony in drug conspiracy cases \"where so much of the government's case relies on the often problematic testimony of confidential informants with unsavory pasts or cooperating co-defendants with myriad credibility problems.\" 569 F.3d at 26-27.</p>\n<p>[20]  Cruz's law enforcement experience, of course, was not an appropriate basis for his opinions as a lay witness. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 413 F.3d at 216-17. Nor would the opinion have been proper if Cruz had been qualified as an expert, which he was not. As we said about similar testimony in <i>Casas,</i> Cruz's \"testimony that particular persons were members of the conspiracy was not an appropriate subject for expert testimony.\" 356 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p>[21]  There is no question that the hearsay exception for co-conspirator statements made \"during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy,\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), does not apply to Rubis's post-arrest statements. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Cruz-Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203598\"><a href=\"/opinion/203598/united-states-v-cruz-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 176 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199664\"><a href=\"/opinion/199664/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2001)). Instead, in the sentence immediately following its citations to <i>Cruz-Diaz</i> and <i>Bailey,</i> the government asserts that \"[t]here was no violation here because Rubis's statement was not introduced.\" Even if we were to generously view the government to be arguing, alternatively, that admission of Rubis's statement was permissible because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, that argument would be unavailing. As we shall explain, the government offered the evidence about Cruz's interview of Rubis to rebut an inference that Reyes-Guerrero was not a participant in the crimei.e., for the truth of Rubis's implicit statement that Reyes-Guerrero and Mieses were involved.</p>\n<p>[25]  This risk of violation of the hearsay rule or the Confrontation Clause reinforces the importance of prosecutors understanding the limitations on so-called background or context evidence. If, for example, such evidence includes the fact that a known participant in the crime was observed conferring in suspicious circumstances with the defendant, it can be useful and acceptable for the investigating agent to explain that he began to watch the defendant because of this observed meeting. It does not follow, however, that the objective of explaining why the agent focused on the defendantor why the agent proceeded to arrest the defendantjustifies prejudicial hearsay testimony. <i>See </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 20 (\"[I]nvestigating officers ... should not... be allowed to relate historical aspects of the case, such as complaints and reports of others containing inadmissible hearsay. Such statements are sometimes erroneously admitted under the argument that the officers are entitled to give the information upon which they acted.\").\n</p>\n<p>We take it to be common ground that the government may not have an agent testify, \"X told us that the defendant was involved in the crime.\" Quoting X's out-of-court accusation remains impermissible if the agent's testimony is changed to say, \"We began to investigate the defendant because X told us that the defendant was involved in the crime,\" and the government seeks to justify it by arguing that X's out-of-court statement was offered not for its truth but only to explain why the agent focused on (or arrested) the defendant. Nor does the result change if, instead of <i>quoting</i> the out-of-court statement, the government communicates its content to the jury by implication. In such instances, the relatively minor \"probative value [of the evidence of why the agent began surveillance or made an arrest] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\" that results from communicating the accusatory hearsay to the jury. Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 20 (\"The need for this evidence is slight, and the likelihood of misuse great.\") (quoting 2 Broun, et al., <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 249, at 103 (5th ed. 1999)(emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p>[26]  Constitutional errors, such as a Confrontation Clause violation, require reversal unless shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>Cabrera-Rivera,</i> 583 F.3d at 36. In this case, we use the non-constitutional standard that is more favorable to the government because our harmless error analysis embraces both constitutional and non-constitutional errors. The government is unable to meet that easier test for showing harmlessness and, hence, it could not meet the more exacting constitutional standard.</p>\n<p>[27]  The minivan was inspected by DEA Task Force Agent Victor Javier Salgado-Betancourt, who was trained to find secret compartments in motor vehicles. He testified that the hidden compartment he discovered was designed to open only when several buttons or components inside the vehicle were activated at the same time.</p>\n<p>[28]  As described in Section I, Torres testified that Mieses reported that the shoe box in the van contained $100,000, and he asked Torres about \"the merchandise,\" as well as \"how are we going to do this.\"</p>\n<p>[29]  When asked what is audible on the tape, counsel stated that Torres and Rubis could be heard talking as they approached the van and as they walked away from the van.</p>\n\n</div>",
