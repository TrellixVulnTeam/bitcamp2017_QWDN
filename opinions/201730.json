Farrell, Jr. was on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                             July 27, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n\f              BOUDIN, Chief Judge.           This appeal is brought by Atlantic\n\nFish Market, Inc. (“Atlantic”), a co-defendant in the district\n\ncourt, to review a judgment of the district court holding Atlantic\n\nliable for freight charges and attorneys’ fees.                   The plaintiff in\n\nthe district court was the carrier, EIMSKIP, The Iceland Steamship\n\nCompany, Ltd. (“EIMSKIP”), which transported the shipments in\n\nquestion--frozen herring--from Massachusetts to Estonia in July\n\n2001.    The story is swiftly told.\n\n              In June 2001, prior to the shipments now in dispute,\n\nAtlantic booked two shipments of frozen herring to be transported\n\nby EIMSKIP from Massachusetts to Estonia (\"the June shipments\").\n\nThe     bills     of   lading       listed     Mayflower    International,      Ltd.\n\n(\"Mayflower\") as the fish's shipper and consigned the fish \"to\n\norder of shipper\"; but Atlantic received the freight invoices and\n\npaid    the     charges.      Atlantic       also   purchased    the   fish,   paying\n\nMayflower half the purchase price upon loading of the cargo and the\n\nbalance upon its arrival in Estonia.\n\n              A month later, three more such shipments were made (\"the\n\nJuly shipments\"). The district court later found that Atlantic was\n\nresponsible (among other tasks) for booking two of these shipments\n\nwith EIMSKIP, negotiating the freight rates, and receiving the\n\ncargo in Estonia.          It also found that Atlantic represented to both\n\nEIMSKIP and Mayflower that it would pay the freight.                      Mayflower\n\ntook    responsibility        for    examining      the   fish   before   shipment,\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcoordinating the shipment dates, proofing and finalizing the bills\n\nof lading, and administering other shipping details.\n\n            As was the case with the June shipments, the bills of\n\nlading in July listed Mayflower as the shipper and the goods were\n\nconsigned \"to order of shipper.\" Mayflower's principal, William C.\n\nQuinby, testified at trial that this had been done to ensure that\n\ncontrol of the cargo would not pass to Atlantic until Atlantic had\n\npaid for the fish.    Quinby stated that Mayflower was seeking \"to\n\nmaintain control of the cargo for the owners of the cargo, H&L\n\nAxelsson, and not let the cargo be released until they had secure\n\npayment.\"   H&L Axelsson is not a party to this proceeding.1\n\n            When the herring arrived in Estonia in late July, the\n\nfreight–-totaling $91,840--remained unpaid.   EIMSKIP placed a hold\n\non the cargo, and Mayflower called EIMSKIP to say that Atlantic had\n\nnot yet paid the purchase price for the herring and that Mayflower\n\ndid not wish the cargo to be released to Atlantic.   Atlantic, the\n\ndistrict judge found, eventually promised again that it would pay\n\nfor the freight, and EIMSKIP then turned over the herring after\n\nMayflower agreed to the release.\n\n            Atlantic then failed to pay the freight charges, first\n\nsaying that it was having financial trouble and would pay as soon\n\n\n     1\n      The district court found that Mayflower and Atlantic were not\nacting as partners in a single venture--rather, the former was a\nsales agent for the producers of the herring, H&L Axelsson, while\nthe latter was either the buyer of the fish or an agent for or\njoint venturer with OU Watkins, the ultimate buyer.\n\n                                -3-\n\fas possible and later saying that it would not pay because there\n\nhad been problems with the cargo.         In July 2002, EIMSKIP brought\n\nsuit against Atlantic and Mayflower in the federal district court\n\nin Massachusetts, seeking to recover freight charges and also\n\nseeking related collection costs (including attorneys’ fees) under\n\na bill of lading provision purporting to make a variety of persons\n\nliable for collection costs.2\n\n           After a bench trial, the district court found that\n\nAtlantic   and   Mayflower   had   both   been   shippers   of   the    cargo.\n\nBecause Mayflower was listed as the shipper and consignee on the\n\nbills of lading, the court said that it was presumptively primarily\n\nliable for the freight charges.       But the court held that in this\n\ninstance   Atlantic   was    primarily    liable    (and    Mayflower    only\n\nsecondarily liable) because of\n\n           Atlantic's multiple representations to both\n           Mayflower and EIMSKIP that it would be liable\n           for the cargo; the course of dealings among\n           the parties prior to the shipments at issue\n           (in particular, Atlantic's payments of the two\n           prior invoices [for the June shipments]); and\n           EIMSKIP's decision to lift the hold on the\n           cargo after speaking to [Atlantic's president\n           Boris] Sorkin . . . .\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The bills of lading provided inter alia that any “Merchant”\nhad to indemnify the carrier for collection costs and defined\nmerchant to include the shipper, receiver, consignee, or bill of\nlading holder and anyone owning or entitled to possession of the\nshipment whether as agent or otherwise.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f              As to collection costs, the district court held that the\n\npertinent condition in the bill of lading making the “merchant”\n\nliable applied to both Atlantic and Mayflower and made each company\n\njointly and severally liable for specified costs and attorneys'\n\nfees (approximately $62,000).           It entered judgment      against the\n\ndefendants as to freight and collection costs in accordance with\n\nits liability findings.        Atlantic has now appealed, contesting its\n\nliability as to both freight and attorneys’ fees.\n\n              Atlantic’s claim on appeal as to freight charges is\n\nstraightforward. It says that it was neither shipper nor consignee\n\non the bill of lading and that under the federal Carriage of Goods\n\nby Sea Act (“COGSA”), 46 U.S.C. app. §§ 1300-1315 (2000), only a\n\nparty so named in the bill of lading can be held liable for freight\n\ncharges.   Whether Atlantic could be regarded as a party to the bill\n\nof   lading    despite   not    being    named   does   not   matter   because\n\nAtlantic's understanding of COGSA as the exclusive basis for\n\nliability is mistaken.\n\n              COGSA, which applies to specified classes of shipments\n\nincluding this one,      governs certain aspects of the relationship\n\nbetween carrier and shipper.            For example, it imposes specific\n\nduties and liabilities on the carrier, including an obligation to\n\nfurnish a bill of lading to the shipper, 46 U.S.C. app. § 1303; and\n\nit provides procedures and a statute of limitations for claims\n\nagainst the carrier for lost or damaged goods, id.              What it does\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fnot do is create a cause of action for, or regulate the collection\n\nof, freight charges.3\n\n            \"Absent a relevant statute, the general maritime law, as\n\ndeveloped by the judiciary, applies.\"             East River S.S. Corp. v.\n\nTransamerica Delaval, Inc., 476 U.S. 858, 864 (1986).                Anyone who\n\ncontracts to pay for ocean freight can be held liable in accordance\n\nwith ordinary contract law as applied in maritime matters. See\n\nNorfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Kirby, 125 S. Ct. 385, 397 (2004).               And oral\n\ncontracts are valid under general maritime law.              See Kossick v.\n\nUnited Fruit Co., 365 U.S. 731, 734 (1961); Fontneau v. Town of\n\nSandwich, 251 F. Supp. 2d 994, 1001 (D. Mass. 2003).           Under general\n\nmaritime law, this is a simple case.\n\n            The evidence adduced at trial supports the district\n\ncourt’s finding that Atlantic agreed with EIMSKIP to pay the\n\nfreight for the July shipments in return for EIMSKIP's services in\n\ntransporting      the   herring   to   Estonia.     This   finding    was   well\n\nsupported    by    subsidiary     findings   that   Atlantic    on     numerous\n\noccasions made oral promises to pay the freight on the July\n\nshipments; that Atlantic was invoiced by EIMSKIP for the freight on\n\nboth the June and July shipments (Mayflower was never invoiced for\n\n\n     3\n      Another set of federal statutory provisions, 49 U.S.C. §§\n80101-80116, applicable to any transportation of goods via common\ncarrier \"from a place in a State to a place in a foreign country,”\nid. § 80102, also imposes statutory duties on carriers and\nregulates bills of lading for such transportation; but, like COGSA,\nit does not create liability for freight charges or regulate\ncollection of such charges by the carrier.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthese shipments); that Atlantic did in fact pay the freight on the\n\nJune shipments; and that Atlantic's president failed to dispute the\n\ninvoices in numerous conversations with EIMSKIP between August 2001\n\nand July 2002.\n\n          The only subsidiary finding disputed by Atlantic on this\n\nappeal is the district court’s finding that Atlantic orally booked\n\nthe first two of the July shipments.    Atlantic's president, who\n\noffered the only contradictory testimony, was found by the district\n\ncourt to be \"uncooperative, evasive, non-responsive, and less than\n\ncredible.\" \"[C]redibility determinations are rather well insulated\n\nfrom appellate challenge.\" Pimentel v. Jacobson Fishing Co., 102\n\nF.3d 638, 640 (1st Cir. 1996).   The district court did not commit\n\n“clear error”–-the applicable standard on review, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n52(a); Rational Software Corp. v. Sterling Corp., 393 F.3d 276, 276\n\n(1st Cir. 2005)--in accepting the view that Atlantic booked the\n\nshipments.\n\n          This is ample to sustain Atlantic’s liability without\n\nregard to whether Atlantic was technically a party to the bill of\n\nlading.   Two parties may each make themselves liable to a third\n\nparty for payment of the same freight on a single shipment–-one by\n\na contract reflected in part by the bill of lading and the other by\n\nexplicit promises and course of conduct independent of the bill of\n\nlading.      On the district court’s findings Atlantic made such\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fpromises both before the voyage and to facilitate release of the\n\ncargo.\n\n           Whether Atlantic could be held liable on the bill of\n\nlading is a separate question. Conceivably someone might be liable\n\non a bill of lading without being named in it, either through\n\nagency doctrine or by separately agreeing to be subject to its\n\nterms.4   All that matters in this case is that there is nothing in\n\ngeneral maritime law or in the precedents concerning bills of\n\nlading that makes them the exclusive means of creating liability\n\nfor freight charges.\n\n           In Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Central Iron & Coal\n\nCo., 265 U.S. 59, 67 (1924), chiefly relied upon by Atlantic, the\n\nSupreme Court said that \"[t]o ascertain what contract was entered\n\ninto we look primarily to the bills of lading, bearing in mind that\n\nthe instrument serves both as a receipt and as a contract,\" and\n\nthat \"[o]rdinarily, the person from whom the goods are received for\n\nshipment assumes the obligation to pay the freight charges; and his\n\nobligation is ordinarily a primary one.\" This probably remains the\n\nusual situation.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Cf. Pacific Coast Fruit Distributors, Inc. v. Pa. R.R. Co.,\n217 F.2d 273, 274-75 (9th Cir. 1954) (holding that a defendant,\n\"though not named as a party in the original bill-of-lading became\nsuch by amendment, as it were,\" since the defendant was \"designated\nas consignee by the shipper\" after the bill of lading had been\nexecuted, \"took over control and direction of the shipment and made\nsuccessive reconsignments thereof\").\n\n                                -8-\n\f              Yet Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. itself, as well as\n\ncircuit courts in subsequent cases, have held that this pattern and\n\npresumption can be overcome by statute, by contractual provisions,\n\nor by the parties' course of conduct.             See Louisville & Nashville\n\nR.R.   Co.,    265   U.S.   at    67-68;   A/S   Dampskibsselskabet   Torm   v.\n\nBeaumont Oil Ltd., 927 F.2d 713, 716-22 (2d Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n502 U.S. 862 (1991); States Marine Int'l, Inc. v. Seattle-First\n\nNat'l Bank, 524 F.2d 245, 247-49 (9th Cir. 1975); see also Capitol\n\nTransp., Inc. v. United States, 612 F.2d 1312, 1319-21 & n.10 (1st\n\nCir. 1979) (holding that the bill of lading is not the only\n\nevidence as to the identity of the consignee).\n\n              The district court also ruled that as between Atlantic\n\nand Mayflower, the former was “primarily” liable.               In fact the\n\ndistrict court said further that Atlantic could not seek indemnity\n\nor contribution from Mayflower and that Mayflower would be liable\n\nonly if EIMSKIP could not collect from Atlantic.                Atlantic has\n\nfailed to challenge this determination on appeal, so we are spared\n\nany need for further discussion of the issue.\n\n              This brings us to the award of attorneys' fees.          In its\n\nopening brief, Atlantic offers an argument of three paragraphs\n\ncomprising two points.           The main claim is that the district judge\n\nerred in allegedly failing to give Atlantic the requisite time to\n\nrespond to EIMSKIP’s request for fees. The secondary claim is that\n\nthe district court should have reduced the amount because the fees\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fsought (so far) are about two-thirds the amount of the underlying\n\nfreight claim and therefore excessive.\n\n             Starting with chronology, the district court entered its\n\nmain order imposing liability for freight charges, costs and\n\nattorneys' fees on July 14, 2004.      On July 20, 2004, EIMSKIP filed\n\na declaration in support of attorneys’ fees setting forth counsel’s\n\ninvoices by date and providing a brief justification.           On July 27,\n\n2004,   at    Mayflower’s   request,   EIMSKIP     filed   a   supplemental\n\ndeclaration     providing   daily   time   sheet    summaries   and   other\n\ninformation.     On August 4, 2004, the district judge entered final\n\njudgment, including the requested attorneys’ fees.\n\n             Neither during this two week period, nor afterwards, is\n\nthere any filing in the district court reflecting an objection or\n\nopposition by Atlantic.       Now, on appeal--apparently dating from\n\nJuly 27 forward--Atlantic says that it was a violation of Local\n\nRule 7.1 for the district court to act on Atlantic’s request\n\nwithout waiting the 14 days provided by the rule for one party to\n\nrespond to a motion filed by another.       See D. Mass. R. 7.1(b)(2).\n\nEIMSKIP disputes that the local rule applied, but we need not\n\ndecide the issue.\n\n             If Atlantic actually intended to oppose the request for\n\nattorneys' fees and was surprised by a premature entry of judgment,\n\nit certainly had a duty to tell the district judge and request an\n\nopportunity to respond.       Of course, a litigant does not in all\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcircumstances have an obligation to return to the district judge\n\nand challenge every mistake before appealing. But it is impossible\n\nto believe that the judge would not have accepted an arguably\n\nbelated filing where, as here, the deadline was perhaps uncertain\n\nbecause of EIMSKIP's supplemental filing or the applicability of\n\nthe local rule.\n\n           In all events, we need not consider further whether the\n\nlocal rule was applicable or whether the objection should be deemed\n\nforfeit.   Instead, we deal directly with the single substantive\n\nobjection that Atlantic now makes to the bill for attorneys' fees.\n\nIn its opening brief, Atlantic argues that the fee award is\n\ninherently unreasonable because it is large and almost two thirds\n\nof the amount collected in freight charges.   Atlantic has now seen\n\nthe supporting material and does not suggest that it sees anything\n\nwrong with the documentation.\n\n           On the merits of the objection, we think it is hopeless.\n\nThere is no necessary relationship between the amount of the\n\nfreight owed and the cost of collection, the latter depending on\n\nthe complexity of the facts and legal issues, the number of\n\ndepositions and documents, and the length of trial.      Nor is the\n\nplaintiff carrier, in the face of recalcitrance, required to forgo\n\nsuit on amounts owed to it because the costs of collection-–to be\n\npaid by a defendant–-equal or exceed the initial debt.    So far as\n\nwe can tell, counsel’s fee was well earned.\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f           In its reply brief, Atlantic offers for the first time on\n\nappeal that whatever its liability for freight charges, liability\n\nfor attorneys’ fees depends (under the American rule) on a specific\n\nstatute or contract, and here the only contract providing for such\n\nliability is the bill of lading.         We add that the broad “merchant”\n\ndefinition in the bill of lading-–although it probably embraces\n\nAtlantic-–arguably is not binding on someone who was not (in some\n\nfashion) a party to the bill of lading or otherwise accepted the\n\nobligation.\n\n           Whether Atlantic is liable for counsel fees presents nice\n\nissues--for example, whether Atlantic is implicitly a party to the\n\nbill of lading or whether its separate promises to pay for the\n\nshipments incorporated counsel fees as well as freight.                    But\n\nAtlantic has forfeited any such argument against its liability for\n\ncounsel   fees    by   omitting   it   from   its   opening   brief,   thereby\n\ndepriving EIMSKIP of an opportunity to respond.          That is the end of\n\nthe matter.      See Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349,\n\n354 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           The judgment in this case, admirably handled by the\n\ndistrict court, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f",

(\"Atlantic\"), a co-defendant in the district court, to review a judgment of the district court holding Atlantic liable for freight charges and attorneys' fees. The plaintiff in the district court was the carrier, EIMSKIP, The Iceland Steamship Company, Ltd. (\"EIMSKIP\"), which transported the shipments in question&#8212;frozen herring&#8212;from Massachusetts to Estonia in July 2001. The story is swiftly told.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2001, prior to the shipments now in dispute, Atlantic booked two shipments of frozen herring to be transported by EIMSKIP from Massachusetts to Estonia (\"the June shipments\"). The bills of lading listed Mayflower International, Ltd. (\"Mayflower\") as the fish's shipper and consigned the fish \"to order of shipper\"; but Atlantic received the freight invoices and paid the charges.

Quinby stated that Mayflower was seeking \"to maintain control of the cargo for the owners of the cargo, H &amp; L Axelsson, and not let the cargo be released until they had secure payment.\" H &amp; L Axelsson is not a party to this proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the herring arrived in Estonia in late July, the freight&#8212;totaling $91,840&#8212;remained unpaid. EIMSKIP placed a hold on the cargo, and Mayflower called EIMSKIP to say that Atlantic had not yet paid the purchase price for the herring and that Mayflower did not wish the cargo to be released to Atlantic. Atlantic, the district judge found, eventually promised again that it would pay for the freight, and EIMSKIP then turned over the herring after Mayflower agreed to the release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Atlantic then failed to pay the freight charges, first saying that it was having financial trouble and would pay as soon as possible and later saying that it would not pay because there had been problems with the cargo. In July 2002, EIMSKIP brought suit against Atlantic and Mayflower in the federal district court in Massachusetts, seeking to recover freight charges and also seeking related collection costs (including attorneys' fees) under a bill of lading provision purporting to make a variety of persons liable for collection costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a bench trial, the district court found that Atlantic and Mayflower had both been shippers of the cargo. Because Mayflower was listed as the shipper and consignee on the bills of lading, the court said that it was presumptively primarily liable for the freight charges.

It entered judgment against the defendants as to freight and collection costs in accordance with its liability findings.

It says that it was neither shipper nor consignee on the bill of lading and that under the federal Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (\"COGSA\"), 46 U.S.C. app. &#167;&#167; 1300-1315 (2000), only a party so named in the bill of lading can be held liable for freight charges.

For example, it imposes specific duties and liabilities on the carrier, including an obligation to furnish a bill of lading to the shipper, 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1303; and it provides procedures and a statute of limitations for claims against the carrier for lost or damaged goods, <i>id.</i> What it does not do is create a cause of action for, or regulate the collection of, freight charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Absent a relevant statute, the general maritime law, as developed by the judiciary, applies.\" <i>East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc.,</i> 476 U.S. 858, 864, 106 S.Ct. 2295, 90 L.Ed.2d 865 (1986). Anyone who contracts to pay for ocean freight can be held liable in accordance with ordinary contract law as applied in maritime matters. <i>See Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Kirby,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 125 S.Ct. 385, 397, 160 L.Ed.2d 283 (2004). And oral contracts are valid under general maritime law. <i>See Kossick v.

This finding was well supported by subsidiary findings that Atlantic on numerous occasions made oral promises to pay the freight on the July shipments; that Atlantic was invoiced by EIMSKIP for the freight on both the June and July shipments (Mayflower was never invoiced for these shipments); that Atlantic did in fact pay the freight on the June shipments; and that Atlantic's president failed to dispute the invoices in numerous conversations with EIMSKIP between August 2001 and July 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only subsidiary finding disputed by Atlantic on this appeal is the district court's finding that Atlantic orally booked the first two of the July shipments. Atlantic's president, who offered the only contradictory testimony, was found by the district court to be \"uncooperative, evasive, non-responsive, and less than credible.\" \"[C]redibility determinations are rather well insulated from appellate challenge.\" <i>Pimentel v. Jacobsen Fishing Co.,</i> 102 F.3d 638, 640 (1st Cir.1996). The district court did not commit \"clear error\"&#8212;the applicable standard on review, Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a); <i>Rational Software Corp. v. Sterling Corp.,</i> 393 F.3d 276, 276 (1st Cir. 2005)&#8212;in accepting the view that Atlantic booked the shipments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is ample to sustain Atlantic's liability without regard to whether Atlantic was technically a party to the bill of lading. Two parties may each make themselves liable to a third party for payment of the same freight on a single shipment&#8212;one by a contract reflected in part by the bill of lading and the other by explicit promises and course of conduct independent of the bill of lading. On the district court's findings Atlantic made such promises both before the voyage and to facilitate release of the cargo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Atlantic could be held liable on the bill of lading is a separate question. Conceivably someone might be liable on a bill of lading without being named in it, either through agency doctrine or by separately agreeing to be subject to its terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> All that matters in this case is that there is nothing in general maritime law or in the precedents concerning bills of lading that makes them the exclusive means of creating liability for freight charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co. v. Central Iron &amp; Coal Co.,</i> 265 U.S. 59, 67, 44 S.Ct. 441, 68 L.Ed. 900 (1924), chiefly relied upon by Atlantic, the Supreme Court said that \"[t]o ascertain what contract was entered into we look primarily to the bills of lading, bearing in mind that the instrument serves both as a receipt and as a contract,\" and that \"[o]rdinarily, the person from whom the goods are received for shipment assumes the obligation to pay the freight charges; and his obligation is ordinarily a primary one.\" This probably remains the usual situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co.</i> itself, as well as circuit courts in subsequent cases, have held that this pattern and presumption can be overcome by statute, by contractual provisions, or by the parties' course of conduct. <i>See Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co.,</i> 265 U.S. at 67-68, 44 S.Ct. 441; <i>A/S Dampskibsselskabet Torm v. Beaumont Oil Ltd.,</i> 927 F.2d 713, 716-22 (2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 862, 112 S.Ct. 183, 116 L.Ed.2d 144 (1991); <i>States Marine Int'l, Inc. v.

United States,</i> 612 F.2d 1312, 1319-21 &amp; n. 10 (1st Cir.1979) (holding that the bill of lading is not the only evidence as to the identity of the consignee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also ruled that as between Atlantic and Mayflower, the former was \"primarily\" liable. In fact the district court said further that Atlantic could not seek indemnity or contribution from Mayflower and that Mayflower would be liable only if EIMSKIP could not collect from Atlantic. Atlantic has failed to challenge this determination on appeal, so we are spared any need for further discussion of the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the award of attorneys' fees. In its opening brief, Atlantic offers an argument of three paragraphs comprising two points. The main claim is that the district judge erred in allegedly failing to give Atlantic the requisite time to respond to EIMSKIP's request for fees. The secondary claim is that the district court should have reduced the amount because the fees sought (so far) are about two-thirds the amount of the underlying freight claim and therefore excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with chronology, the district court entered its main order imposing liability for freight charges, costs and attorneys' fees on July 14, 2004. On July 20, 2004, EIMSKIP filed a declaration in support of attorneys' fees setting forth counsel's invoices by date and providing a brief justification. On July 27, 2004, at Mayflower's request, EIMSKIP filed a supplemental declaration providing daily time sheet summaries and other information. On August 4, 2004, the district judge entered final judgment, including the requested attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither during this two week period, nor afterwards, is there any filing in the district court reflecting an objection or opposition by Atlantic. Now, on appeal&#8212;apparently dating from July 27 forward&#8212;Atlantic says that it was a violation of Local Rule 7.1 for the district court to act on Mayflower's request without waiting the 14 days provided by the rule for one party to respond to a motion filed by another <i>See</i> D. Mass. R. 7.1(b)(2). EIMSKIP disputes that the local rule applied, but we need not decide the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Atlantic actually intended to oppose the request for attorneys' fees and was surprised by a premature entry of judgment, it certainly had a duty to tell the district judge and request an opportunity to respond. Of course, a litigant does not in all circumstances have an obligation to return to the district judge and challenge every mistake before appealing. But it is impossible to believe that the judge would not have accepted an arguably belated filing where, as here, the deadline was perhaps uncertain because of EIMSKIP's supplemental filing or the applicability of the local rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we need not consider further whether the local rule was applicable or whether the objection should be deemed forfeit. Instead, we deal directly with the single substantive objection that Atlantic now makes to the bill for attorneys' fees. In its opening brief, Atlantic argues that the fee award is inherently unreasonable because it is large and almost two thirds of the amount collected in freight charges. Atlantic has now seen the supporting material and does not suggest that it sees anything wrong with the documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits of the objection, we think it is hopeless. There is no necessary relationship between the amount of the freight owed and the cost of collection, the latter depending on the complexity of the facts and legal issues, the number of depositions and documents, and the length of trial. Nor is the plaintiff carrier, in the face of recalcitrance, required to forgo suit on amounts owed to it because the costs of collection&#8212;to be paid by a defendant&#8212;equal or exceed the initial debt. So far as we can tell, counsel's fee was well earned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its <i>reply</i> brief, Atlantic offers for the first time on appeal that whatever its liability for freight charges, liability for attorneys' fees depends (under the American rule) on a specific statute or contract, and here the only contract providing for such liability is the bill of lading. We add that the broad \"merchant\" definition in the bill of lading&#8212;although it probably embraces Atlantic&#8212;arguably is not binding on someone who was not (in some fashion) a party to the bill of lading or otherwise accepted the obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Atlantic is liable for counsel fees presents nice issues&#8212;for example, whether Atlantic is implicitly a party to the bill of lading or whether its separate promises to pay for the shipments incorporated counsel fees as well as freight. But Atlantic has forfeited any such argument against its liability for counsel fees by omitting it from its opening brief, thereby depriving EIMSKIP of an opportunity to respond. That is the end of the matter. <i>See Rivera-Muriente v.

(\"Atlantic\"), a co-defendant in the district court, to review a judgment of the district court holding Atlantic liable for freight charges and attorneys' fees. The plaintiff in the district court was the carrier, EIMSKIP, The Iceland Steamship Company, Ltd. (\"EIMSKIP\"), which transported the shipments in question&#8212;frozen herring&#8212;from Massachusetts to Estonia in July 2001. The story is swiftly told.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2001, prior to the shipments now in dispute, Atlantic booked two shipments of frozen herring to be transported by EIMSKIP from Massachusetts to Estonia (\"the June shipments\"). The bills of lading listed Mayflower International, Ltd. (\"Mayflower\") as the fish's shipper and consigned the fish \"to order of shipper\"; but Atlantic received the freight invoices and paid the charges. Atlantic also purchased the fish, paying Mayflower half the purchase price upon loading of the cargo and the balance upon its arrival in Estonia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A month later, three more such shipments were made (\"the July shipments\"). The district court later found that Atlantic was responsible (among other tasks) for booking two of these shipments with EIMSKIP, negotiating the freight rates, and receiving the cargo in Estonia. It also found that Atlantic represented to both EIMSKIP and Mayflower that it would pay the freight. Mayflower took responsibility for examining the fish before shipment, coordinating the shipment dates, proofing and finalizing the bills of lading, and administering other shipping details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As was the case with the June shipments, the bills of lading in July listed Mayflower as the shipper and the goods were consigned \"to order of shipper.\" Mayflower's principal, William C.

Under general maritime law, this is a simple case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence adduced at trial supports the district court's finding that Atlantic agreed with EIMSKIP to pay the freight for the July shipments in return for EIMSKIP's services in transporting the herring to Estonia. This finding was well supported by subsidiary findings that Atlantic on numerous occasions made oral promises to pay the freight on the July shipments; that Atlantic was invoiced by EIMSKIP for the freight on both the June and July shipments (Mayflower was never invoiced for these shipments); that Atlantic did in fact pay the freight on the June shipments; and that Atlantic's president failed to dispute the invoices in numerous conversations with EIMSKIP between August 2001 and July 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only subsidiary finding disputed by Atlantic on this appeal is the district court's finding that Atlantic orally booked the first two of the July shipments. Atlantic's president, who offered the only contradictory testimony, was found by the district court to be \"uncooperative, evasive, non-responsive, and less than credible.\" \"[C]redibility determinations are rather well insulated from appellate challenge.\" <i>Pimentel v.

The district court did not commit \"clear error\"&#8212;the applicable standard on review, Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a); <i>Rational Software Corp. v.

Two parties may each make themselves liable to a third party for payment of the same freight on a single shipment&#8212;one by a contract reflected in part by the bill of lading and the other by explicit promises and course of conduct independent of the bill of lading. On the district court's findings Atlantic made such promises both before the voyage and to facilitate release of the cargo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Atlantic could be held liable on the bill of lading is a separate question. Conceivably someone might be liable on a bill of lading without being named in it, either through agency doctrine or by separately agreeing to be subject to its terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> All that matters in this case is that there is nothing in general maritime law or in the precedents concerning bills of lading that makes them the exclusive means of creating liability for freight charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R.

In fact the district court said further that Atlantic could not seek indemnity or contribution from Mayflower and that Mayflower would be liable only if EIMSKIP could not collect from Atlantic. Atlantic has failed to challenge this determination on appeal, so we are spared any need for further discussion of the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the award of attorneys' fees. In its opening brief, Atlantic offers an argument of three paragraphs comprising two points. The main claim is that the district judge erred in allegedly failing to give Atlantic the requisite time to respond to EIMSKIP's request for fees. The secondary claim is that the district court should have reduced the amount because the fees sought (so far) are about two-thirds the amount of the underlying freight claim and therefore excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with chronology, the district court entered its main order imposing liability for freight charges, costs and attorneys' fees on July 14, 2004. On July 20, 2004, EIMSKIP filed a declaration in support of attorneys' fees setting forth counsel's invoices by date and providing a brief justification. On July 27, 2004, at Mayflower's request, EIMSKIP filed a supplemental declaration providing daily time sheet summaries and other information. On August 4, 2004, the district judge entered final judgment, including the requested attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither during this two week period, nor afterwards, is there any filing in the district court reflecting an objection or opposition by Atlantic. Now, on appeal&#8212;apparently dating from July 27 forward&#8212;Atlantic says that it was a violation of Local Rule 7.1 for the district court to act on Mayflower's request without waiting the 14 days provided by the rule for one party to respond to a motion filed by another <i>See</i> D. Mass. R. 7.1(b)(2). EIMSKIP disputes that the local rule applied, but we need not decide the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Atlantic actually intended to oppose the request for attorneys' fees and was surprised by a premature entry of judgment, it certainly had a duty to tell the district judge and request an opportunity to respond. Of course, a litigant does not in all circumstances have an obligation to return to the district judge and challenge every mistake before appealing. But it is impossible to believe that the judge would not have accepted an arguably belated filing where, as here, the deadline was perhaps uncertain because of EIMSKIP's supplemental filing or the applicability of the local rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we need not consider further whether the local rule was applicable or whether the objection should be deemed forfeit. Instead, we deal directly with the single substantive objection that Atlantic now makes to the bill for attorneys' fees. In its opening brief, Atlantic argues that the fee award is inherently unreasonable because it is large and almost two thirds of the amount collected in freight charges. Atlantic has now seen the supporting material and does not suggest that it sees anything wrong with the documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits of the objection, we think it is hopeless. There is no necessary relationship between the amount of the freight owed and the cost of collection, the latter depending on the complexity of the facts and legal issues, the number of depositions and documents, and the length of trial. Nor is the plaintiff carrier, in the face of recalcitrance, required to forgo suit on amounts owed to it because the costs of collection&#8212;to be paid by a defendant&#8212;equal or exceed the initial debt. So far as we can tell, counsel's fee was well earned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its <i>reply</i> brief, Atlantic offers for the first time on appeal that whatever its liability for freight charges, liability for attorneys' fees depends (under the American rule) on a specific statute or contract, and here the only contract providing for such liability is the bill of lading. We add that the broad \"merchant\" definition in the bill of lading&#8212;although it probably embraces Atlantic&#8212;arguably is not binding on someone who was not (in some fashion) a party to the bill of lading or otherwise accepted the obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Atlantic is liable for counsel fees presents nice issues&#8212;for example, whether Atlantic is implicitly a party to the bill of lading or whether its separate promises to pay for the shipments incorporated counsel fees as well as freight. But Atlantic has forfeited any such argument against its liability for counsel fees by omitting it from its opening brief, thereby depriving EIMSKIP of an opportunity to respond. That is the end of the matter. <i>See Rivera-Muriente v.
