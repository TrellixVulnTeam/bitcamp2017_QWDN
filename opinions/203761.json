Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n                Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges,\n                   and Schwarzer,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Barry L.

Houlihan with whom Gail Elise Cornwall and Edwards\nAngell Palmer & Dodge LLP were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                            April 3, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the     Northern   District   of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.        James Yeomalakis, a resident of\n\nMassachusetts, has or had a credit card account with Washington\n\nMutual Bank1, which was a federally chartered savings association\n\nwith its principal place of business in Nevada.                 Credit card\n\nholders customarily pay an interest charge on unpaid balances.\n\nWashington   Mutual   increases   the    applicable    annual    percentage\n\ninterest rate (\"APR\") for cardholders who default on one of the\n\nobligations created under their account agreement (for example by\n\nmaking a required payment late).\n\n          Washington    Mutual,   assertedly   in     line   with   industry\n\ncustom, backdates its APR increase to the start of the existing\n\nmonth's billing cycle.    Thus, if Washington Mutual determines on\n\nthe last day of a billing cycle to increase a cardholder's APR\n\nbecause of a default on the prior day, the new rate is applied\n\nstarting with the first day of the existing cycle. To challenge\n\nthis practice, Yeomalakis brought suit against Washington Mutual in\n\nthe Massachusetts Superior Court,       but the case was removed by the\n\nlatter to the federal district court.          28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)\n\n(2006).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      On December 19, 2008 we granted the motion of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, as Receiver for Washington Mutual\nBank to be substituted as the party in interest and stayed the case\nfor 90 days. See 12 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(12)(A)(ii). In discussing\nthe facts and arguments, the opinion refers to Washington Mutual as\nit is their (now past) practices that are at issue.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            Yeomalakis' complaint had two counts:         the first accused\n\nWashington Mutual of \"Imposing and Enforcing an Illegal Penalty\"\n\nthrough \"retroactive\" rate increases, although it did not explain\n\nwhether federal or state law underlay the claim (or, if the latter,\n\nwhich state).       The second count alleged that Washington Mutual's\n\nactions were unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation\n\nof M.G.L. c. 93A, § 2--essentially, that the retroactive increases\n\nwere unfair and had not been adequately disclosed.\n\n            Washington Mutual moved to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6), alleging that both counts were preempted by the Home\n\nOwners' Loan Act of 1933 (\"HOLA\") 12 U.S.C. § 1461 et seq. (2006),\n\nand various regulations promulgated thereunder by the federal\n\nOffice of Thrift Supervision (\"OTS\").        Section 4(g)(1) of HOLA, 12\n\nU.S.C. § 1463(g)(1) (2000), preempts state usury laws and allows\n\ncredit card companies to charge an interest rate at:\n\n            not more than 1 percent in excess of the\n            discount rate on 90-day commercial paper in\n            effect at the Federal Reserve Bank in the\n            Federal Reserve district in which such savings\n            association is located or at the rate allowed\n            by the laws of the State in which such savings\n            association is located, whichever is greater.\n\n            Under OTS regulations, \"interest\" includes payments to a\n\ncredit card company for \"any default or breach by a borrower of a\n\ncondition    upon    which   credit    was   extended.\"      12   C.F.R.   §\n\n560.110(a)(2008).       OTS regulations also preempt state laws that\n\n\"impose requirements regarding . . . [d]isclosure and advertising,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fincluding laws requiring specific statements, information, or other\n\ncontent to be included in ... billing statements, credit contracts,\n\nor other credit-related documents.\"         Id. § 560.2(b)(9).\n\n              Following Yeomalakis' opposition, the district court\n\ngranted the motion to dismiss. It said that HOLA clearly preempted\n\nan attack under state law on the level of interest rates, even if\n\nlabeled \"a penalty\" by Yeomalakis.         As to his chapter 93A claim,\n\nthe court held that it was preempted to the extent it sought\n\nrecovery based on the notion that some different rate should have\n\nbeen charged; and, so far as it rested on the inadequacy of\n\ndisclosure, it fell under the OTS regulation forbidding states from\n\nregulating pertinent \"[disclosure and advertising.\"\n\n              Yeomalakis then filed a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e) to amend the judgment, requesting the opportunity to file an\n\namended complaint asserting a federal cause of action under the\n\nTruth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq. (2006).\n\nThe motion was denied by the district court.                Yeomalakis now\n\nappeals both the dismissal of his state law claims and the denial\n\nof his motion to amend.\n\n              Before turning to the merits, developments subsequent to\n\nthe district court proceedings have to be recounted.          On September\n\n25,   2008,    Washington   Mutual   was   closed,   the   Federal   Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") was appointed as receiver and many\n\nof WaMu's assets were sold to Chase Bank.            On December 18, 2008,\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe FDIC notified the court, and the next day we granted, the\n\nFDIC's motion to substitute for WaMu as the successor in interest\n\nand issued a 90-day stay of the above-captioned action.           See 12\n\nU.S.C. § 1821(d)(12)(B).\n\n            Yeomalakis then moved to substitute Chase Bank as the\n\nappropriate successor in interest to Washington Mutual and/or add\n\nChase Bank as a necessary party defendant.         The FDIC in turn, now\n\nseeks an additional 180-day stay and a ruling that we require\n\nYeomalakis to exhaust his claims through the FDIC Receiver's\n\nadministrative process mandated by 12 U.S.C. §§ 1821(d)(3)-(13),\n\nenacted by Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement\n\nAct of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (\"FIRREA\"). In\n\nsubsequent filings, Yeomalakis objected to the FDIC request for a\n\nfurther stay and Chase objected to being added or substituted for\n\nthe FDIC.\n\n            We deal first with the FDIC's motion.           FIRREA is a\n\nprocedural muddle. The statute both limits court jurisdiction over\n\nclaims against the FDIC, see 12 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(13)(D)(i), and\n\nalso contains of provisions that could arguably be read to create\n\na different regime for cases that were commenced in court before\n\nthe FDIC was named as a receiver.         See, e.g., § 1821(d)(6)(A).   We\n\nwrestled through the problem in Marquis v. FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148 (1st\n\nCir.   1992),   and   adopted   a   pragmatic   interpretation   that   is\n\ngoverning law in this circuit.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            Normally the FDIC argues for an expansive reading of\n\nFIRREA that would strip federal courts of all jurisdiction, and the\n\nopposing party argues for a narrow interpretation that preserves\n\nthe right to proceed in court without resorting to administrative\n\nexhaustion. In Marquis, we rejected the FDIC's most sweeping\n\nclaims, confirmed that federal courts retain jurisdiction of cases\n\nbrought before the receivership, but said that courts would usually\n\nstay pending cases to allow for administrative exhaustion of\n\nclaims.   965 F.2d at 1155.\n\n            Ordinarily, upon the FDIC's appearance as a receiver, a\n\ndistrict court would stay a claim it had not yet decided.   However,\n\nin this instance the district court has already issued a decision\n\nadverse to the claimant, the case had already been briefed and\n\nargued and we had already agreed to affirm the judgment below.   The\n\ndecision would have been issued months ago but for the belated\n\nnotice from the FDIC and our deferral of the decision pursuant to\n\nthe stay.    The stay has now expired and under Marquis the court\n\nretains discretion as to what to do.   965 F.2d at 1153-54.\n\n            In the present case, as will shortly become clear,\n\nYeomalakis' claims are either barred, un-preserved or unpersuasive.\n\nTo send the case back to the FDIC for administrative proceedings\n\nthat could take additional time, followed by review in federal\n\ncourt once again, 12 U.S.C. § 1821(7)(A), makes no sense and would\n\nhardly advance Congress' purpose in enacting FIRREA of promptly\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fdisposing of claims against failed financial institutions.         See\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 101-54(I), 101 Cong., 1st Sess., at 418-19, reprinted\n\nin 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 86, 214-15.\n\n            As for Yeomalakis' motion to substitute Chase Bank as a\n\nparty, it too fails.      When Washington Mutual failed, Chase Bank\n\nacquired many assets but its agreement with the FDIC retains for\n\nthe FDIC \"any liability associated with borrower claims for payment\n\nof or any liability to any borrower for monetary relief, or that\n\nprovide for any other form of relief to any borrower.\"2      Thus the\n\nFDIC was and remains the appropriate party in interest.       See 12\n\nU.S.C. § 1821(d)(2)(A)(i); see also In re Community Bank of N.\n\nVirginia,    418   F.3d   277,   293   n.6   (3d   Cir.   2005).\n\n            Turning to the merits, we begin with the count I penalty\n\nclaim. In the district court, Yeomalakis scarcely responded at all\n\nto Washington Mutual's contention that the penalty claim was\n\npreempted by HOLA.    The only discussion of the penalty claim was\n\nlocated under a header entitled \"Defendant Misstates What This Case\n\nIs About.\"     In that section, Yeomalakis argues that Washington\n\nMutual's interpretation of the illegal penalty claim is mistaken\n\nbecause his allegations are not about the legality of the interest\n\nrates or the manner they are calculated.\n\n\n\n     2\n      Purchase and Assumption Agreement Among Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation and JP Morgan Chase Bank, National\nAssociation, quoted by the FDIC in its motion and available at\nhttp://www.fdic.gov/about/freedom/Washington_Mutual P_and_A.pdf\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           Yet Yeomalakis never explained how his penalty claim\n\nshould be interpreted or why the penalty claim would not be\n\npreempted.   Even on appeal, no coherent explanation of this claim\n\nis provided.   At best, Yeomalakis suggests that Nevada law was\n\nviolated, depriving the interest rate of protection under section\n\n1463(g)(1). Whatever his theory, the claim, not seriously defended\n\nin the district court, cannot be resuscitated now. Daigle v. Maine\n\nMed. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           As to Yeomalakis' count II claim under chapter 93A, HOLA\n\ndoes not preempt ordinary contractual claims based on state law;\n\nYeomalakis could have argued that Washington Mutual's account\n\nagreement did not permit the \"retroactive\" increase.        Similarly,\n\nwhile the OTS regulation purports to preempt state regulation of\n\ndisclosure and advertising, it is debatable how far HOLA supersedes\n\nordinary fraud claims under state law.          See In re Ocwen Loan\n\nServicing, 491 F.3d 638 (7th Cir. 2007) (Posner, J.).\n\n           Yet neither in the district court nor on appeal does\n\nYeomalakis explain the gravamen of his chapter 93A claim or how it\n\navoids   preemption.    Yeomalakis'   summary    of   argument   refers\n\ncursorily to various bodies of law (Massachusetts law, common law,\n\nNevada law, TILA and a Federal Reserve Board regulation).           The\n\nbrief's argument section is a scatter-gun collection of assertions\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fsome sense of which is supplied by a sampling from among the\n\nsixteen headings in the argument section.3\n\n             It is possible that somewhere in this morass is a version\n\nof a claim under chapter 93A that might avoid preemption but there\n\nis no indication that it was presented to the district court and it\n\ncertainly is not illuminated for us.        It is not our job, especially\n\nin a counseled civil case, to create arguments for someone who has\n\nnot   made   them   or   to   assemble   them   from    assorted     hints     and\n\nreferences scattered throughout the brief.             See U.S. Healthcare,\n\nInc. v. Healthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 595 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             Yeomalakis' final claim is that the district court should\n\nhave given him the opportunity to amend his complaint to allege\n\nadditional claims under federal and Nevada law.                   Review is for\n\n\"manifest abuse of discretion.\"          Council of Ins. Agents & Brokers\n\nv. Juarbe-Jimenez, 443 F.3d 103, 111 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal\n\nquotation omitted).       A Rule 59(e) motion is not properly used to\n\n\"raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before\n\njudgment     issued.\"    Harley-Davidson     Motor     Co.   v.    Bank   of   New\n\nEngland, 897 F.2d 611, 616 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n      3\n      \"The District Court Concluded that the Wrongdoing Alleged Was\nSubject Only to the Control of Federal Law and Regulations Under 12\nU.S.C. § 1463(g)(1)\"; \"A Further Explanation of § 1463(g)(1), A\nStatute which Is Confusingly Labeled\"; \"The District Court Treated\n§ 1463(g)(1) as a Federal Preemption Defense to the Conduct\nAlleged\"; \"The Ninth Circuit Cases Cited by the Court Are Not\nAuthority for this Court\"; \"Massachusetts G.L. c. 93A Can Borrow\nfrom Federal and Nevada State Law\"; \"WaMu Fails to Cite any State\nLaw that Would Conflict with Applicable Federal Law.\"\n\n                                     -9-\n\f              In this instance, Yeomalakis' counsel, Barry Kramer, has\n\nextensive experience with challenges to the very practice at issue\n\nin this case, having brought a number of suits in other courts on\n\nthe same subject.      The claims he now wants to add could have been\n\nasserted in the original complaint or by amendment after the case\n\nhad been removed.        It was not an abuse of discretion for the\n\ndistrict court to deny Yeomalakis yet another bite at the apple.\n\n              In sum, Yeomalakis' merits claims are denied as is his\n\nmotion to substitute or add Chase Bank as a real party in interest.\n\nWe also deny the FDIC's request for an additional 180-day stay to\n\nallow   for    the   completion   of   any    administrative   claims.   The\n\ndistrict court decision is affirmed.\n\n              It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f",

James Yeomalakis, a resident of\n\nMassachusetts, has or had a credit card account with Washington\n\nMutual Bank1, which was a federally chartered savings association\n\nwith its principal place of business in Nevada.

As to his chapter 93A claim,\n\nthe court held that it was preempted to the extent it sought\n\nrecovery based on the notion that some different rate should have\n\nbeen charged; and, so far as it rested on the inadequacy of\n\ndisclosure, it fell under the OTS regulation forbidding states from\n\nregulating pertinent \"[disclosure and advertising.\"\n\n              Yeomalakis then filed a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e) to amend the judgment, requesting the opportunity to file an\n\namended complaint asserting a federal cause of action under the\n\nTruth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq. (2006).\n\nThe motion was denied by the district court.                Yeomalakis now\n\nappeals both the dismissal of his state law claims and the denial\n\nof his motion to amend.\n\n              Before turning to the merits, developments subsequent to\n\nthe district court proceedings have to be recounted.          On September\n\n25,   2008,    Washington   Mutual   was   closed,   the   Federal   Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") was appointed as receiver and many\n\nof WaMu's assets were sold to Chase Bank.            On December 18, 2008,\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe FDIC notified the court, and the next day we granted, the\n\nFDIC's motion to substitute for WaMu as the successor in interest\n\nand issued a 90-day stay of the above-captioned action.           See 12\n\nU.S.C. § 1821(d)(12)(B).\n\n            Yeomalakis then moved to substitute Chase Bank as the\n\nappropriate successor in interest to Washington Mutual and/or add\n\nChase Bank as a necessary party defendant.         The FDIC in turn, now\n\nseeks an additional 180-day stay and a ruling that we require\n\nYeomalakis to exhaust his claims through the FDIC Receiver's\n\nadministrative process mandated by 12 U.S.C. §§ 1821(d)(3)-(13),\n\nenacted by Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement\n\nAct of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (\"FIRREA\"). In\n\nsubsequent filings, Yeomalakis objected to the FDIC request for a\n\nfurther stay and Chase objected to being added or substituted for\n\nthe FDIC.\n\n            We deal first with the FDIC's motion.           FIRREA is a\n\nprocedural muddle. The statute both limits court jurisdiction over\n\nclaims against the FDIC, see 12 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(13)(D)(i), and\n\nalso contains of provisions that could arguably be read to create\n\na different regime for cases that were commenced in court before\n\nthe FDIC was named as a receiver.         See, e.g., § 1821(d)(6)(A).   We\n\nwrestled through the problem in Marquis v. FDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584142\"><a href=\"/opinion/584142/serge-marquis-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-liquidating/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\n\nCir.   1992),   and   adopted   a   pragmatic   interpretation   that   is\n\ngoverning law in this circuit.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            Normally the FDIC argues for an expansive reading of\n\nFIRREA that would strip federal courts of all jurisdiction, and the\n\nopposing party argues for a narrow interpretation that preserves\n\nthe right to proceed in court without resorting to administrative\n\nexhaustion. In Marquis, we rejected the FDIC's most sweeping\n\nclaims, confirmed that federal courts retain jurisdiction of cases\n\nbrought before the receivership, but said that courts would usually\n\nstay pending cases to allow for administrative exhaustion of\n\nclaims.   965 F.2d at 1155.\n\n            Ordinarily, upon the FDIC's appearance as a receiver, a\n\ndistrict court would stay a claim it had not yet decided.   However,\n\nin this instance the district court has already issued a decision\n\nadverse to the claimant, the case had already been briefed and\n\nargued and we had already agreed to affirm the judgment below.   The\n\ndecision would have been issued months ago but for the belated\n\nnotice from the FDIC and our deferral of the decision pursuant to\n\nthe stay.    The stay has now expired and under Marquis the court\n\nretains discretion as to what to do.   965 F.2d at 1153-54.\n\n            In the present case, as will shortly become clear,\n\nYeomalakis' claims are either barred, un-preserved or unpersuasive.\n\nTo send the case back to the FDIC for administrative proceedings\n\nthat could take additional time, followed by review in federal\n\ncourt once again, 12 U.S.C. § 1821(7)(A), makes no sense and would\n\nhardly advance Congress' purpose in enacting FIRREA of promptly\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fdisposing of claims against failed financial institutions.

No. 101-54(I), 101 Cong., 1st Sess., at 418-19, reprinted\n\nin 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 86, 214-15.\n\n            As for Yeomalakis' motion to substitute Chase Bank as a\n\nparty, it too fails.      When Washington Mutual failed, Chase Bank\n\nacquired many assets but its agreement with the FDIC retains for\n\nthe FDIC \"any liability associated with borrower claims for payment\n\nof or any liability to any borrower for monetary relief, or that\n\nprovide for any other form of relief to any borrower.\"2      Thus the\n\nFDIC was and remains the appropriate party in interest.

In the district court, Yeomalakis scarcely responded at all\n\nto Washington Mutual's contention that the penalty claim was\n\npreempted by HOLA.    The only discussion of the penalty claim was\n\nlocated under a header entitled \"Defendant Misstates What This Case\n\nIs About.\"     In that section, Yeomalakis argues that Washington\n\nMutual's interpretation of the illegal penalty claim is mistaken\n\nbecause his allegations are not about the legality of the interest\n\nrates or the manner they are calculated.\n\n\n\n     2\n      Purchase and Assumption Agreement Among Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation and JP Morgan Chase Bank, National\nAssociation, quoted by the FDIC in its motion and available at\nhttp://www.fdic.gov/about/freedom/Washington_Mutual P_and_A.pdf\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           Yet Yeomalakis never explained how his penalty claim\n\nshould be interpreted or why the penalty claim would not be\n\npreempted.   Even on appeal, no coherent explanation of this claim\n\nis provided.   At best, Yeomalakis suggests that Nevada law was\n\nviolated, depriving the interest rate of protection under section\n\n1463(g)(1). Whatever his theory, the claim, not seriously defended\n\nin the district court, cannot be resuscitated now. Daigle v. Maine\n\nMed. Ctr., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           As to Yeomalakis' count II claim under chapter 93A, HOLA\n\ndoes not preempt ordinary contractual claims based on state law;\n\nYeomalakis could have argued that Washington Mutual's account\n\nagreement did not permit the \"retroactive\" increase.        Similarly,\n\nwhile the OTS regulation purports to preempt state regulation of\n\ndisclosure and advertising, it is debatable how far HOLA supersedes\n\nordinary fraud claims under state law.          See In re Ocwen Loan\n\nServicing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798194\"><a href=\"/opinion/798194/in-re-ocwen-loan-servicing-llc-mortgage-servicing-litigation-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2007) (Posner, J.).\n\n           Yet neither in the district court nor on appeal does\n\nYeomalakis explain the gravamen of his chapter 93A claim or how it\n\navoids   preemption.    Yeomalakis'   summary    of   argument   refers\n\ncursorily to various bodies of law (Massachusetts law, common law,\n\nNevada law, TILA and a Federal Reserve Board regulation).           The\n\nbrief's argument section is a scatter-gun collection of assertions\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fsome sense of which is supplied by a sampling from among the\n\nsixteen headings in the argument section.3\n\n             It is possible that somewhere in this morass is a version\n\nof a claim under chapter 93A that might avoid preemption but there\n\nis no indication that it was presented to the district court and it\n\ncertainly is not illuminated for us.        It is not our job, especially\n\nin a counseled civil case, to create arguments for someone who has\n\nnot   made   them   or   to   assemble   them   from    assorted     hints     and\n\nreferences scattered throughout the brief.
