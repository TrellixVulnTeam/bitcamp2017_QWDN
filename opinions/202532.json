Joseph Vars, It's My\n\nLicense, Inc., Amy Vars and Michael Vars (the Varses) appeal the\n\nsummary judgment dismissing their 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against\n\nLaura Citrin, et al., for due process violations in connection with\n\nthe termination of a liquor license in which they held a security\n\ninterest.    Because the license expired by its terms, the Varses\n\nceased to have a protectable property interest.        We therefore\n\naffirm.\n\n            The Varses owned and operated a restaurant and pub in\n\nNewport, Rhode Island, which held a Class BV Alcoholic Beverage\n\nRetailer's Permit.   In 1999, they sold the business and equipment,\n\nleased the premises, and transferred the liquor license to Jake &\n\nElla's Corp.    As security for the unpaid balance due on the sale,\n\nthe Varses obtained a security agreement and an assignment of\n\nrights in the liquor license, along with a power of attorney.   They\n\nfiled a UCC lien with the Secretary of State.\n\n            The first episode underlying the Varses' due process\n\nclaim arose out of proceedings to revoke the license.    In January\n\n2001, the Board of License Commissioners, following an evidentiary\n\nhearing on police citations for after-hours drinking and disorderly\n\nconduct, ordered the license revoked.    The Department of Business\n\nRegulation affirmed the revocation.    On appeal, the Superior Court\n\nvacated the sanction imposed and remanded, and the license was\n\nreinstated in April 2002.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           The Varses make a vague claim that they were \"denied the\n\ncontractual agreement\" with the licensees and suffered damages.\n\nHowever that may be, in this action they have failed to show a due\n\nprocess violation inasmuch as they had been accorded full process\n\nin these proceedings.\n\n           The second episode arose out of the expiration of the\n\nlicense.   The Varses' security interest was in a Class BV Permit\n\nwhich remains valid for only one year, expiring on December 1 of\n\neach   year,   in   this   case   on    December   1,   2002.      R.I.   Gen.\n\nLaws § 3-5-8 (2005).         At the Varses' request, the Newport City\n\nClerk forwarded an application for renewal to the Varses' counsel\n\non December 20, 2002.        But neither the Varses nor Jake & Ella's\n\napplied for renewal.       Varses' counsel, aware of a January 8, 2003\n\nCity Council meeting at which the now unattached license faced\n\nretirement, faxed a letter to the Clerk on January 7, 2003.               The\n\nletter described efforts to renew Jake & Ella's corporate charter\n\n(revoked in 2001 for failure to pay corporate taxes) and asserted\n\nthat as soon as the Department of Taxation issued a letter of good\n\nstanding, counsel would attempt to renew the liquor license.              The\n\nletter asked that the Clerk read it into the City Council meeting's\n\nrecord, which was not done. After discussion the Council passed an\n\nordinance reducing the number of available permits from 59 to 58.\n\n           Rhode    Island    courts    have   recognized   that    a   liquor\n\nlicense, though not property in the traditional sense, is valuable\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fand the holder of such a license enjoys some protection.     Beacon\n\nRest., Inc. v. Adamo, 241 A.2d 291, 294 (R.I. 1968); Vitterito v.\n\nSportsman's Lodge & Rest., 228 A.2d 119, 122-23 (R.I. 1967).    The\n\nliquor business, however, is subject to the police power which\n\npermits the government to restrict sale or prohibit it entirely.\n\nVitterito, 228 A.2d at 122.   Rhode Island law limits the term of\n\nthe liquor license to one year.   The Varses' interest, moreover,\n\nwas derivative of that of Jake & Ella's who held the license.\n\n          While the Varses had a protectable interest during the\n\npendency of the 2001 revocation process, they had none when the\n\nCity Council reduced the number of liquor licenses.   At the time of\n\nthe Council meeting, almost two months after the license had\n\nexpired and with no application for renewal having been filed, the\n\nVarses were without a right or interest on which to base a due\n\nprocess claim.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
