This    case    presents   a    novel\n\nquestion: does the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have a nonstatutory\n\ncause of action, grounded in its sovereign authority under the\n\nConstitution, to obtain information from the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation (\"FBI\") in connection with a criminal investigation\n\ninto the activities of FBI employees?                 We conclude that it does\n\nnot.       Instead, under the circumstances of this case, Puerto Rico\n\nmust pursue the information it seeks under the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.                   Further, in keeping\n\nwith persuasive authority from other circuits, we hold that the FBI\n\nmay    assert    a     qualified   privilege    to     protect     sensitive     law\n\nenforcement techniques and procedures from disclosure.                        Having\n\nconsidered the application of that privilege in this case, we\n\naffirm the decision of the district court holding that the FBI did\n\nnot err in withholding the requested information.\n\n                                        I.\n\n              This appeal involves two consolidated district court\n\ncases, Nos. 06-1306 and 06-1305,1 arising from subpoenas for FBI\n\nrecords issued by the Puerto Rico Department of Justice (\"PRDOJ\").\n\nThe relevant facts are largely undisputed; where disputes exist, we\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       The events in No. 06-1306 occurred before those in No. 06-\n1305, so we will discuss No. 06-1306 first despite its higher\ndocket number.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fnote them but find that they are immaterial to our disposition of\n\nthe case.\n\nA. Case No. 06-1306: Ojeda Subpoena\n\n             In the 1970s, Filiberto Ojeda Ríos helped found the\n\nMacheteros, an organization that advocates independence for Puerto\n\nRico through armed struggle against the United States government.\n\nIn   1983,   the    Macheteros    stole      $7.1   million   from     a   bank    in\n\nConnecticut.       The FBI apprehended Ojeda in 1985, and, during his\n\narrest, Ojeda shot an FBI agent in the face, permanently blinding\n\nthe agent in one eye.       Ojeda was acquitted for assaulting the agent\n\nfollowing a trial in Puerto Rico.             He then skipped bail while on\n\ntrial for bank robbery and was sentenced in absentia in 1992.\n\nFifteen years later, in September 2005, the FBI attempted to\n\napprehend Ojeda at his residence in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico.\n\nDuring this intervention, Ojeda shot two FBI agents and was himself\n\nfatally wounded.\n\n             The    PRDOJ    commenced        an    investigation      into       the\n\nintervention.       On October 4, 2005, a PRDOJ prosecutor issued a\n\nsubpoena pursuant to title 34, section 1476 of the Puerto Rico Code\n\ncommanding then United States Attorney Humberto Garcia to produce\n\nmaterials    including:     (1)   a   copy    of    the   \"Operation   Order\"      (a\n\ndocument establishing the plan or rules of engagement for the FBI\n\nintervention at Ojeda's residence); (2) the name, rank, division,\n\naddress, and telephone numbers of every person who participated in\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\for   made   decisions   regarding   the   intervention,   as    well   as   an\n\norganizational diagram showing these individuals' rank on the line\n\nof command; (3) various equipment, including, but not limited to,\n\nall bullet-proof vests, helmets, weapons, and vehicles involved in\n\nthe intervention; (4) any inventory of the property occupied during\n\nthe intervention; (5) copies of any expert reports relating to the\n\nintervention or Ojeda's death; (6) copies of any audio or video\n\nrecordings of the events relating to the intervention; (7) copies\n\nof all photographs relating to the intervention; and (8) copies of\n\nany relevant general FBI protocols, including those relating to\n\nviolent interventions and potentially deadly force.            In subsequent\n\ncorrespondence, the PRDOJ explained that the requests related to a\n\n\"criminal investigation\" that it was conducting into Ojeda's death.\n\n            By letter dated October 17, the FBI declined to produce\n\nthe requested materials, explaining that its internal regulations\n\nprohibited disclosure of records compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes. The letter stated that the denial of the PRDOJ's request\n\nwas a \"final agency decision which may be reviewed by the United\n\nStates District Court.\"\n\n            After further communications among the PRDOJ, FBI, and\n\nUnited States Attorney's Office, the U.S. Attorney indicated by\n\nletter dated November 9 that the FBI would allow the PRDOJ to\n\nexamine some of the items listed in the subpoena, including the\n\nbulletproof vests, helmets, weapons, and vehicles used during the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fintervention and the photographs taken before, during, and after\n\nthe intervention. The FBI stipulated that it would retain official\n\ncustody of these items and that an FBI official would be present\n\nduring the inspection.\n\n           The    PRDOJ      initially     acceded   to   these   terms,    but\n\nsubsequently reiterated the substance of its original demand in a\n\nletter dated January 20, 2006.           The FBI refused this demand, again\n\nnoting that its refusal constituted “final agency action.”                  The\n\nPRDOJ   filed    suit   in   March   2006   to   compel   disclosure   of   the\n\nrequested materials.\n\nB. Case No. 06-1305: 444 de Diego Subpoena\n\n           Using information obtained from Ojeda's residence to\n\nestablish probable cause, the FBI obtained a search warrant for a\n\nresidential condominium located at 444 de Diego in San Juan, Puerto\n\nRico.   The FBI executed the warrant in February 2006, and a large\n\ngroup of protesters, reporters, and members of the general public\n\ngathered outside.       The United States asserts that some of these\n\nindividuals breached an established police line, and an FBI agent\n\nused pepper spray to keep people behind the line.\n\n           The PRDOJ issued subpoenas to U.S. Attorney Garcia and to\n\nLuis Fraticelli, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI San Juan Field\n\nOffice, requesting three categories of materials: (1) the name,\n\nrank, division, address, and telephone number of the two FBI agents\n\nwho allegedly used pepper spray and whose photos were attached to\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthe subpoena; (2) official photographs of these two FBI agents; and\n\n(3) internal FBI protocols relating to the use of force and pepper\n\nspray.   The PRDOJ explained that the subpoenas were \"part of the\n\ncriminal investigation\" of the PRDOJ into \"the conduct of FBI\n\nagents during the execution of a search warrant\" at 444 de Diego.\n\n           The FBI moved to quash the subpoenas in federal district\n\ncourt.   After the PRDOJ indicated, at a hearing on March 2, that\n\n\"it was actually evaluating other avenues through which to get the\n\ninformation about the federal agents, and that it had no serious\n\nintention of enforcing the challenged subpoenas,\" the district\n\ncourt concluded that the subpoenas were \"effectively mooted.\"                    The\n\ncourt thus withheld action on the motion to quash.                  Subsequently,\n\non March 23, the PRDOJ filed suit to compel the release of the\n\nrequested records.\n\nC. Proceedings Before the District Court\n\n           Puerto      Rico's     complaint    in     No.   06-1306     sought     a\n\ndeclaratory judgment recognizing its right \"to conduct a full\n\ninvestigation into the events leading to the death of Mr. Ojeda\n\nRios,\"   and    an    order     \"permanently    enjoining         Defendants   from\n\nwithholding     any        information   relevant     to    the     Commonwealth's\n\ninvestigation        and     ordering    Defendants    to    comply     with     the\n\nCommonwealth's requests and produce the subpoenaed information,\n\nobjects and documents[.]\"            The complaint in No. 06-1305 sought\n\nidentical relief with respect to Puerto Rico's \"investigation into\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthe events allegedly leading to the injury of members of the press\n\nand/or the public . . . on February 10, 2006, due to the alleged\n\nuse of excessive force (including the alleged use of pepper spray)\n\nby FBI agents[.]\"\n\n             In each complaint, Puerto Rico articulated five causes of\n\naction which entitled it to its requested relief. First, it stated\n\nthat   the   FBI's   decisions   were   not   premised   upon   any    federal\n\nregulation or statute.     Second, it stated that the FBI's decisions\n\nexceeded any authority granted by the Housekeeping Act, 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 301.       Third, it asserted a nonstatutory cause of action to\n\nvindicate its constitutional sovereign authority to enforce its\n\ncriminal laws by obtaining the requested information.            Fourth, it\n\ncontended that APA review was \"unwarranted\" because such review\n\n\"would impose an undue burden on the exercise of sovereign criminal\n\nauthority that would run afoul of the Tenth Amendment.\"               Finally,\n\nPuerto Rico claimed that, even if reviewed under the APA, the FBI's\n\ndecision to withhold the information was arbitrary, capricious, and\n\nan abuse of discretion.\n\n             The district court consolidated the cases, the United\n\nStates moved to dismiss, and Puerto Rico filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment.      After considering these motions, the district court\n\nconcluded that Puerto Rico had failed to establish a basis for its\n\nrequested relief.       The court rejected Puerto Rico’s first two\n\ncauses of action, explaining that, although the FBI's internal\n\n                                    -8-\n\fregulations did not create a substantive right to withhold the\n\ninformation,    the   regulations   incorporated   federal   common    law\n\nestablishing a privilege for law enforcement materials.        The court\n\nalso dismissed Puerto Rico's third cause of action, holding that\n\nPuerto Rico could not assert a nonstatutory cause of action, based\n\non its sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws, to obtain the\n\nrequested materials.     The court thus concluded that Puerto Rico’s\n\nrequest was subject to judicial review under the provisions of the\n\nAPA, thereby rejecting Puerto Rico’s fourth cause of action.\n\nFinally, on Puerto Rico’s fifth and final cause of action, the\n\ncourt applied the APA’s framework for review.          Noting the FBI's\n\ninterest   in   maintaining   the   confidentiality   of   sensitive   law\n\nenforcement techniques, it found that the FBI's decision with\n\nrespect to the Ojeda subpoena was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n\nWith respect to the 444 de Diego subpoena, the court concluded that\n\nthere had been no final agency action, and thus the FBI's failure\n\nto release the information was not subject to judicial review.          In\n\nsum, the court dismissed Puerto Rico's first through fourth causes\n\nof action, and, on the fifth cause of action, denied Puerto Rico’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           This appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f                                       II.\n\n            On appeal, Puerto Rico first contends that its sovereign\n\nright to enforce its criminal laws provides it with a nonstatutory\n\ncause of action to obtain the information it seeks from the FBI.\n\nIt explains that, under our federal constitutional system, a state\n\nhas a \"judicially cognizable interest in the preservation of [its]\n\nown sovereignty,\" which includes its \"ability to punish wrongdoers\n\nand   enforce    its   criminal      laws\"    and,   more   specifically,     \"to\n\nprosecute federal agents if they have acted unlawfully in carrying\n\nout their duties.\"2          Consequently, \"any impermissible federal\n\ninterference with such constitutional sovereignty is amenable to\n\nresolution by a federal district court under its equitable powers.\"\n\nPuerto    Rico   concludes    that    \"[a]    direct   cause   of   action    for\n\nequitable relief is the only avenue to properly vindicate a State’s\n\nconstitutional     claim   of   sovereign[]      authority     to   enforce   its\n\ncriminal laws.\"\n\n            Although Puerto Rico acknowledges that agency decisions\n\nare normally reviewed under the APA, it argues that such review is\n\ninappropriate because: (1) \"[i]t is unfounded to subject a State’s\n\nsovereign penal authority to an administrative process that will be\n\nfollowed by an extremely limited form of judicial review\"; (2) such\n\nreview will place Puerto Rico \"in a worse position to obtain\n\n\n      2\n       The parties agree that Puerto Rico is situated identically\nto a state for purposes of this appeal.\n\n                                       -10-\n\finformation   than     private    parties\"     who     can   sue     the   federal\n\ngovernment and request discovery under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 26; and (3) APA review would allow the federal government\n\nto   \"commandeer[]   state   prosecutorial          powers   by    deciding     what\n\ninformation the State should consider in its investigations.\"3\n\n           As in all suits against the federal government, we must\n\nfirst consider whether sovereign immunity bars this claim.                  \"It is\n\nlong settled law that, as an attribute of sovereign immunity, the\n\nUnited States and its agencies may not be subject to judicial\n\nproceedings   unless    there    has    been   an    express      waiver   of   that\n\nimmunity.\"    EPA v. Gen. Elec. Co., 197 F.3d 592, 597 (2d Cir.\n\n1999). The APA waives sovereign immunity under certain conditions:\n\n           A person suffering legal wrong because of\n           agency action . . . is entitled to judicial\n           review thereof. An action in a court of the\n           United States seeking relief other than money\n           damages and stating a claim that an agency or\n           an officer or employee thereof acted or failed\n           to act in an official capacity or under color\n           of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor\n           relief therein be denied on the ground that it\n\n\n\n      3\n       With respect to the \"commandeering\" issue, Puerto Rico does\nnot develop its argument other than to cite to New York v. United\nStates, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), and Printz v. United States, 521 U.S.\n898 (1997), which established that the federal government may not\n\"commandeer\" state governments by compelling state officials to\nenact or administer a federal regulatory program. In light of the\nlack of developed argumentation, we find it unnecessary to address\nthis claim. See Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am., 916 F.2d 731, 734\n(1st Cir. 1990)(explaining that issues \"adverted to on appeal in a\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation,\nare deemed to have been abandoned\").\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           is against the United States or that                 the\n           United States is an indispensable party.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 702.4      This waiver is for \"'all equitable actions for\n\nspecific relief against a Federal agency or officer acting in an\n\nofficial capacity,'\" Trudeau v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 456 F.3d 178,\n\n186 (D.C. Cir. 2006)(quoting Sea-Land Serv., Inc., v. Alaska R.R.,\n\n659 F.2d 243, 244 (D.C. Cir. 1981)), and thus \"'applies to any suit\n\nwhether   under    the   APA    or   not.'\"    Id.   at   186    (D.C.   Cir.\n\n2006)(quoting Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1328\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996)); see also Hostetter v. United States, 739 F.2d\n\n983, 985 (4th Cir. 1984)(\"In section 702 Congress has waived the\n\ndefense of sovereign immunity in such nonstatutory review cases in\n\nwhich nonmonetary relief is sought . . . .\"); Jaffee v. United\n\nStates, 592 F.2d 712, 719 (3d Cir. 1979)(\"By waiving sovereign\n\nimmunity in suits for 'relief other than money damages,' the\n\nCongress sought to 'facilitate nonstatutory judicial review of\n\nFederal administrative action . . . .'\" (citation omitted)).\n\n           Although      this   persuasive    authority   indicates      that\n\nsovereign immunity would pose no bar to Puerto Rico’s claim for\n\nnonmonetary relief, the question remains whether Puerto Rico has\n\nthe nonstatutory cause of action it invokes.               In prior cases\n\n\n\n     4\n       At least one court has held that a state qualifies as a\n\"person\" within the meaning of the APA, see Md. Dep't of Human Res.\nv. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 763 F.2d 1441, 1445 n.1 (D.C.\nCir. 1985), and the government does not argue otherwise here.\n\n                                     -12-\n\finvolving subpoenas issued by state entities, courts have held that\n\nthe party requesting the subpoena must proceed under the APA.\n\nHouston Bus. Journal, Inc. v. Office of the Comptroller of the\n\nCurrency, 86 F.3d 1208, 1212 (D.C. Cir. 1996)(\"[A] state-court\n\nlitigant    must   request        the   documents     from    the    federal      agency\n\npursuant to the agency's regulations . . . .                 If the agency refuses\n\nto produce the requested documents, the sole remedy for the state-\n\ncourt litigant is to file a collateral action in federal court\n\nunder the APA.\"); Edwards v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 43 F.3d 312,\n\n316 (7th Cir. 1994)(\"The subpoenas were in effect a request for\n\ninformation from an executive department . . . .                     The subpoena is\n\ntreated as an administrative demand.\" (citations omitted)).\n\n            Puerto    Rico    asserts,       however,    that       its   suit    is   an\n\nexception to this principle due to its constitutionally-based\n\nsovereign    authority       to    enforce      its   criminal       laws.       It    is\n\nuncontroverted that states may enact and enforce criminal laws, and\n\nthat this power is constitutional in nature.                  As the Supreme Court\n\nexplained    in    Heath    v.     Alabama,     474   U.S.    82     (1985),      \"[t]he\n\nConstitution leaves in the possession of each State 'certain\n\nexclusive    and     very    important       portions    of    sovereign         power.'\n\nForemost among the prerogatives of sovereignty is the power to\n\ncreate and enforce a criminal code.\" Id. at 93 (quoting Federalist\n\nNo. 9); see also Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 128 (1982)(\"The\n\nStates possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fcriminal law. . . .

Where, as here, a state has asserted a right that is\n\nconstitutional in nature, \"we are bound by a strong presumption in\n\nfavor of providing the state some vehicle for vindicating its\n\nrights.\"    R.I.

Dep't of Transp., 854 F.2d\n\n1438,    1439    (D.C.

Thus,\n\nif \"a plaintiff is unable to bring his case predicated on either a\n\nspecific or a general statutory review provision, he may still be\n\nable to institute a non-statutory review action.\"                   Reich, 74 F.3d\n\nat 1327 (citing Clark Byse & Joseph V. Fiocca, Section 1361 of the\n\nMandamus and Venue Act of 1962 and \"Nonstatutory\" Judicial Review\n\nof    Federal    Administrative       Action,   81   Harv.    L.   Rev.    308,   321\n\n(1967)).    Puerto Rico claims that the FBI acted outside the scope\n\nof its legal authority in withholding the requested materials, in\n\nviolation of the Constitution, and that the Constitution itself\n\nprovides a basis for nonstatutory review of that violation.\n\n            In RIDEM, we evaluated a similar claim for nonstatutory\n\nreview that was \"constitutional in scope.\"             304 F.3d at 41.        There,\n\nthe state of Rhode Island brought suit to assert that its sovereign\n\nimmunity    (a    \"constitutionally        protected    sovereign         interest\")\n\nentitled    it    to   enjoin    an   administrative     proceeding        that   the\n\nDepartment of Labor had initiated against it.                Id. at 36.      We noted\n\nthat the Supreme Court has established two \"critical factors [that]\n\nmust be present to invoke nonstatutory review.\" RIDEM, 304 F.3d at\n\n42.     First, such review may occur only if its absence would\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f\"'wholly deprive the party of a meaningful and adequate means of\n\nvindicating its . . . rights.'\"     Id. (quoting Bd. of Gov'rs of Fed.\n\nReserve Sys. v. McCorp. Fin., 502 U.S. 32, 43 (1991)).             Second,\n\n\"Congress must not have clearly intended to preclude review of the\n\nagency’s particular determination.\"       Id. at 42-43 (citing Bd. of\n\nGov'rs, 502 U.S. at 44).     We then applied these two factors and\n\nconcluded that Rhode Island had a direct, nonstatutory cause of\n\naction to enjoin an administrative proceeding on the ground of\n\nsovereign immunity, even though the APA requires that parties\n\nexhaust   their   administrative   remedies   before   seeking    judicial\n\nreview.   Id. at 43.    We explained that Rhode Island had no other\n\navenue for vindicating its right to immunity from suit and that\n\nCongress had not explicitly precluded its action.        Id.     Moreover,\n\nwe emphasized that \"general equitable considerations\" favored a\n\nnonstatutory action, including the fact that Rhode Island had\n\nclaimed the violation of \"a clear right that is constitutional in\n\nnature\" and that its \"immunity would be effectively lost absent\n\njudicial review.\"    Id.\n\n           Puerto Rico’s situation differs materially from that of\n\nRhode Island in RIDEM.      Critically, with respect to the first\n\nrequirement for nonstatutory review, Puerto Rico does have a means\n\nof vindicating its rights without nonstatutory review: the APA.5\n\n\n     5\n       Although RIDEM is the only case the parties have cited that\ninvolves   a   sovereign   entity   attempting   to   assert   its\nconstitutionally-based sovereign prerogatives, other cases support\n\n                                   -16-\n\fWithin that judicial review framework, Puerto Rico may assert its\n\nsovereign    interest   in   enforcing     its   criminal     laws    as     a\n\nconsideration in our review of the agency's decision.              Thus, we\n\ncannot conclude that Puerto Rico's rights \"would be effectively\n\nlost absent judicial review.\"     Id. at 43 (citing Morales v. Trans\n\nWorld Airlines, 504 U.S. 374, 381 (1992)).        Likewise, with respect\n\nto the second requirement, although Congress has not explicitly\n\nprohibited   nonstatutory    review   in   a   case   such   as   this,    the\n\nexistence of the APA as a means for reviewing the FBI's actions at\n\nleast implies that nonstatutory review is inappropriate.\n\n            We recognize that nonstatutory review might have allowed\n\nPuerto Rico to obtain a more favorable standard of review and to\n\ncircumvent certain of the APA’s procedural requirements.           However,\n\nin considering Puerto Rico's demand for a more favorable standard\n\nof judicial review on constitutional grounds, we must be mindful of\n\n\n\nthe notion that the absence of another avenue for the parties to\nvindicate their rights is a necessary condition for nonstatutory\nreview.   For example, in Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 190-91\n(1958), the Court held that the president of a union had a\nnonstatutory cause of action to file suit against the National\nLabor Relations Board to set aside the NLRB’s certification, in\nviolation of 29 U.S.C. § 159(b)(1), of a bargaining unit including\nboth professional and nonprofessional employees.         The Court\nexplained that a critical factor in allowing the union president to\nbring suit despite the lack of explicit statutory authorization was\nthat \"'absence of jurisdiction of the federal courts' would mean 'a\nsacrifice or obliteration of a right which Congress' has given\nprofessional employees, for there is no other means, within their\ncontrol to protect and enforce that right.\" Id. at 190 (quoting\nSwitchmen's Union of N. Am. v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 320 U.S. 297,\n300 (1943)).\n\n                                 -17-\n\fthe Supremacy Clause, which \"is designed to ensure that states do\n\nnot    'retard,   impede,    burden,    or    in   any   manner    control'    the\n\nexecution of federal law.\"       New York v. Tanella, 374 F.3d 141, 147\n\n(2d Cir. 2004)(quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.)\n\n316, 436 (1819)).     We are not suggesting that the Supremacy Clause\n\nalone provides the basis for rejecting Puerto Rico's theory of a\n\nnonstatutory cause of action to obtain law enforcement information\n\nfrom the FBI.       But Puerto Rico portrays its sovereign authority\n\nover law enforcement as paramount in the analysis.                That cannot be\n\nso.    The Supremacy Clause reminds us that the federal government\n\nalso    has   a   critical   interest    in    carrying    out     its   own   law\n\nenforcement responsibilities. In most instances, federal and state\n\nlaw enforcement interests are complementary.                 However, when a\n\nstate’s interest in investigating the agents of a federal law\n\nenforcement entity arguably conflicts with that federal entity’s\n\nneed to protect certain information relating to law enforcement\n\nactivities, Congress has provided a mechanism — the APA — for\n\nresolving these conflicts.       Puerto Rico has not convinced us that\n\nthis congressional choice was somehow constitutionally insufficient\n\nand hence Puerto Rico must have a nonstatutory cause of action to\n\nvindicate its law enforcement interests.            To the contrary, for the\n\nreasons we have expressed, we conclude that the judicial review\n\nprovided by the APA for the denial of information by a federal\n\nagency is compatible with Puerto Rico's sovereign authority under\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fthe Constitution for the enforcement of its criminal laws.\n\n                                          III.\n\n                 Under the APA, we will overturn the FBI’s decision not\n\nto release the requested information only if it was \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance\n\nwith law.\"       5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).           The fact that Puerto Rico made\n\nits request for information in the form of a subpoena from the\n\nPRDOJ does not affect the nature of our review under the APA.                      The\n\nsubpoenas    were    \"in   effect     a   request       for   information   from    an\n\nexecutive department,\" and, consequently, \"the subpoena[s] are\n\ntreated as an administrative demand.\"                   Edwards v. U.S. Dep't of\n\nJustice,    43    F.3d   312,   316   (7th       Cir.   1994)(explaining     that    a\n\nsubpoena initiates the administrative process); see also 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 16.21.6\n\n\n     6\n       We note that, where a subpoena is issued to a non-party\nfederal government agency in conjunction with litigation in state\ncourt, the state court may not enforce the subpoena against the\nfederal government due to federal sovereign immunity, and the\nfederal courts have consistently held that they lack jurisdiction\nto enforce the subpoena in cases where the government has removed\nthe subpoena proceedings to federal court. See Smith v. Cromer,\n159 F.3d 875, 879 (4th Cir. 1998); Houston Bus. Journal, 86 F.3d at\n1211-12; Louisiana v. Sparks, 978 F.2d 226, 235 (5th Cir. 1992).\nInstead, courts have explained that, to obtain federal judicial\nreview of a federal agency's refusal to release information, \"a\nstate-court litigant must request the documents from the federal\nagency pursuant to the agency’s regulations,\" and that if \"the\nagency refuses to produce the requested documents, the sole remedy\nfor the state-court litigant is to file a collateral action in\nfederal court under the APA.\"     Houston Bus. Journal, 86 F.3d at\n1212. Here, of course, the subpoena was not issued pursuant to any\nunderlying litigation. However, the same principle — that a party\n\n                                          -19-\n\f          In applying the arbitrary and capricious standard of\n\nreview, we are deferential to the agency's decision.    In general,\n\nan agency's \"choice of whether or not to comply with a third-party\n\nsubpoena is essentially a policy decision about the best use of the\n\nagency's resources.\"    COMSAT Corp. v. Nat'l Sci. Found., 190 F.3d\n\n269, 278 (4th Cir. 1999).    We review de novo the decision of the\n\ndistrict court because that court, \"'limited to the administrative\n\nrecord, is in no better position to review the agency than the\n\ncourt of appeals.'\"    Edwards, 43 F.3d at 314 (quoting Asarco, Inc.\n\nv. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 616 F.2d 1153, 1161 (9th Cir. 1980)).\n\n          In evaluating the FBI's decision, we take into account\n\nboth that agency's internal regulations governing the release of\n\nmaterial and the substantive law governing the law enforcement\n\nprivilege.\n\nA. Regulations\n\n          Under the Housekeeping Act, 5 U.S.C. § 301, federal\n\nagencies may promulgate regulations establishing conditions for the\n\ndisclosure of information.    The Supreme Court upheld the validity\n\nof such regulations in United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340\n\nU.S. 462, 468 (1951), explaining that it is appropriate for the\n\nhead of an agency “to prescribe regulations not inconsistent with\n\n\nwishing to obtain information from the federal government must file\na request pursuant to the agency's regulations, and may seek\njudicial review only under the APA — applies in the present case as\nwell.\n\n                                 -20-\n\flaw for ‘the custody, use, and preservation of the records, papers,\n\nand property appertaining to'\" the agency’s business.                 Within the\n\nadministrative review process, \"[t]he regulations 'provide guidance\n\nfor the internal operations of the [agency],'\" but do not create a\n\nsubstantive defense to disclosure.             Kwan Fai Mak v. FBI, 252 F.3d\n\n1089, 1092 (9th Cir. 2001)(quoting 28 C.F.R. § 16.21(d)). In other\n\nwords, \"the regulations do not 'create an independent privilege'\n\nauthorizing the Department of Justice to withhold information.\"\n\nId. (quoting Exxon Shipping Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 34 F.3d\n\n774,   780   (9th   Cir.   1994)).       Rather,    they    \"simply    set    forth\n\nadministrative      procedures     to    be    followed     when    demands     for\n\ninformation are received.\"        Id.\n\n             Here, pursuant to the Housekeeping Act, the FBI has\n\npromulgated regulations explaining that, in deciding whether to\n\nrelease    information,    its    officials     should     consider   \"[w]hether\n\ndisclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing\n\nthe case\" and \"[w]hether [the] disclosure is appropriate under the\n\nrelevant     substantive    law    concerning       privilege.\"       28     C.F.R.\n\n§ 16.26(a)(1), (2).        Situations in which disclosure will not be\n\nmade include those where \"[d]isclosure would reveal investigatory\n\nrecords compiled for law enforcement purposes, and would interfere\n\nwith enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques\n\nand    procedures   the    effectiveness       of   which   would     thereby   be\n\nimpaired.\"    Id. § 16.26(b)(5).\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\f           As we have explained, the Touhy regulations are only\n\nprocedural, and do not create a substantive entitlement to withhold\n\ninformation.    Thus, the FBI's compliance with the regulations\n\ncannot be a sufficient justification for withholding requested\n\nmaterials.     Instead, our review of the reasonableness of the\n\nagency's   decision   focuses   on   the   substantive    law   concerning\n\nprivilege, to which we now turn.\n\nB. Law Enforcement Privilege\n\n           The Supreme Court first recognized a qualified privilege\n\nfor certain information related to law enforcement activities in\n\nRoviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53 (1957).            There, the Court\n\nexplained that the government has a qualified privilege to withhold\n\nthe identities of confidential informants.         Id. at 59.      Such a\n\nprivilege \"further[s] and protect[s] [ ] the public interest in\n\neffective law enforcement,\" encouraging citizens to communicate\n\ntheir knowledge of crimes by preserving their anonymity.          Id.   The\n\nCourt also noted that \"[t]he scope of the privilege is limited by\n\nits underlying purpose. Thus, where the disclosure of the contents\n\nof a communication will not tend to reveal the identity of an\n\ninformer, the contents are not privileged.\"       Id. at 60.\n\n             Since Roviaro, we have recognized a privilege for law\n\nenforcement materials in other circumstances.       In United States v.\n\nCintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 983-84 (1st Cir. 1987), the FBI, with\n\njudicial authorization, had monitored conversations between the\n\n                                 -22-\n\fdefendant and various confederates via hidden microphones placed\n\nwithin an apartment.        The district court refused to allow the\n\ndefense to question witnesses \"concerning the precise location of\n\nthe electronic surveillance devices\" on the ground that such\n\nquestioning would \"jeopardize future criminal investigations.\" Id.\n\nat 1002.      In upholding the district court's decision, we first\n\nnoted that other circuits had found that the privilege could cover\n\n\"sensitive investigative techniques.\"             Id.   We then recognized a\n\nqualified privilege for the \"disclosure of confidential government\n\nsurveillance information,\" explaining that \"discoverability of this\n\nkind of information will enable criminals to frustrate future\n\ngovernment surveillance and perhaps unduly jeopardize the security\n\nof ongoing investigations.\"        Id.    We emphasized that the privilege\n\ncould be overcome by a sufficient showing of need, and thus\n\nconcluded that courts must determine on a case-by-case basis\n\nwhether a party has \"demonstrated an authentic 'necessity,' given\n\nthe circumstances, to overbear the qualified privilege.\"              Id.\n\n              Other circuits have explicitly acknowledged a broader\n\nprivilege for law enforcement materials.                The D.C. Circuit has\n\nexplained that the privilege for investigatory materials is \"rooted\n\nin   common    sense   as   well   as    common   law,\"    noting   that    \"law\n\nenforcement operations cannot be effective if conducted in full\n\npublic view\" and that the public has an interest in \"minimizing\n\ndisclosure of documents that would tend to reveal law enforcement\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\finvestigative techniques or sources.\"        Black v. Sheraton Corp. of\n\nAm., 564 F.2d 531, 542, 545 (D.C. Cir. 1977).         Similarly, in In re\n\nDepartment of Investigation of the City of New York, 856 F.2d 481\n\n(2d Cir. 1988), the Second Circuit explained:\n\n             [T]he law enforcement privilege [ ] has been\n             recognized in the absence of a statutory\n             foundation, and [ ] is largely incorporated\n             into the various state and federal freedom of\n             information acts.      The purpose of this\n             privilege is to prevent disclosure of law\n             enforcement techniques and procedures, to\n             preserve the confidentiality of sources, to\n             protect witness and law enforcement personnel,\n             to safeguard the privacy of individuals\n             involved in an investigation, and otherwise to\n             prevent interference with an investigation.\n\nId. at 483-84 (citations and footnotes omitted); see also United\n\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir. 1995)(citing In re\n\nDep't   of   Investigation).      Most    recently,   the   Fifth   Circuit\n\nacknowledged \"the existence of a law enforcement privilege beyond\n\nthat allowed for identities of confidential informants\" in a case\n\ninvolving documents containing \"information about ongoing criminal\n\ninvestigations — including investigative leads, law enforcement\n\nmethods   and   techniques,    internal   investigative     memoranda,   and\n\nidentifying information relating to witnesses and law enforcement\n\npersonnel, including undercover operatives.\"          In re U.S. Dep’t of\n\nHomeland Sec., 459 F.3d 565, 569, 568 (5th Cir. 2006).           The court\n\nremanded for the district court to make an in camera determination\n\nregarding the privilege, noting that the rationale for such a\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fprivilege is \"even more compelling now\" because \"in today’s times\n\nthe compelled production of government documents could impact\n\nhighly sensitive matters relating to national security.\"                   Id. at\n\n569.\n\n            Although      Puerto    Rico    has   not    made   a     request   for\n\ninformation under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552,7 the provisions of this statute also provide guidance\n\nin determining the appropriate scope of the privilege.                    The law\n\nenforcement exemption to FOIA shields from disclosure documents\n\nwhose production would, inter alia, \"interfere with enforcement\n\nproceedings\" or \"endanger the life or physical safety of any\n\nindividual.\" Id. § 552(b)(7); see also Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies\n\nv.   U.S.   Dep’t.   of   Justice,    331    F.3d     918,   925-26    (D.C.    Cir.\n\n2003)(explaining       that,   in    enacting     5    U.S.C.   §     552(b)(7)(A)\n\n\"'Congress recognized that law enforcement agencies had legitimate\n\nneeds to keep certain records confidential, lest the agencies be\n\nhindered in their investigations'\" (quoting NLRB v. Robbins Tire &\n\nRubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 232 (1978))).\n\n            Puerto Rico argues that the law enforcement privilege,\n\nwhatever its source and scope, must yield to a state’s sovereign\n\nauthority to investigate violations of its criminal laws. However,\n\n\n\n       7\n       The United States notes this omission but also acknowledged\nat oral argument that FOIA would not be an appropriate vehicle for\nall of the materials that Puerto Rico sought in its subpoena.\n\n                                      -25-\n\fit cites no case supporting such a sweeping proposition.8                  But the\n\nabsence         of   such   authority   does    not   minimize    the   legitimate\n\ninterests of Puerto Rico in securing information relevant to its\n\ncriminal investigations.             The important questions are how far the\n\nlaw enforcement privilege should extend and how, in the face of\n\nPuerto Rico's demand for information, the privilege should be\n\napplied in this case.\n\n                 Given the persuasive authority from other circuits, the\n\nlaw enforcement exemption set forth in FOIA, and \"the public\n\ninterest in effective law enforcement,\" Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 59, we\n\ndeem       it    appropriate    to    extend    the   privilege   we    previously\n\nrecognized for \"confidential government surveillance information,\"\n\nCintolo, 818 F.2d at 1002, to \"law enforcement techniques and\n\nprocedures,\" In re Dep’t of Investigation, 856 F.2d at 484.9\n\n\n       8\n       Puerto Rico offers one circuit court case involving an\n\"intergovernmental privilege dispute\" and suggests that the\nprivilege is less compelling in such a situation. In United States\nv. O’Neill, 619 F.2d 222 (3d Cir. 1980), the United States had\nmoved to enforce a subpoena duces tecum against the Philadelphia\nPolice Department. Although the court did comment that \"[t]here is\nan anomaly in the assertion of a public interest 'privilege' by the\nCity to justify withholding information from a federal Commission\ncharged by Congress to investigate in the public interest the\npossible denial of equal protection by, inter alia, local\ngovernment units,\" id. at 230, its decision focused primarily on\nthe fact that the Police Department had not properly asserted the\nprivilege and emphasized the lack of Supreme Court precedent\nsupporting a \"broad amorphous Government privilege\" to protect\n\"material relating to ongoing civil and criminal investigations,\"\nid. at 229.\n       9\n       Under Federal Rule of Evidence 501, federal courts retain\nthe power to develop common law privileges on a case-by-case basis.\n\n                                         -26-\n\fIndeed, the justification we cited in Cintolo — that disclosing the\n\nlocation    of    surveillance      information    would     jeopardize   future\n\nsurveillance operations — applies similarly to the information\n\nabout techniques and protocols that Puerto Rico has requested here.\n\nTheir     disclosure      would      also     jeopardize      future    criminal\n\ninvestigations.        We emphasize that this qualified privilege is\n\nsubject    to     balancing   the     federal     government’s      interest   in\n\npreserving       the   confidentiality      of   sensitive    law    enforcement\n\ntechniques against the requesting party’s interest in disclosure.10\n\nThat balancing must be done with particular care in situations,\n\nsuch as this one, involving conflicts between the federal and state\n\ngovernments.\n\n            Having recognized, in principle, a qualified privilege\n\nfor law enforcement techniques and procedures, we turn now to the\n\ntask of evaluating under the APA the FBI's response to the specific\n\ninformation requests of Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\nSee United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 367 (1980).\n     10\n        Certain procedures, such as in camera review of the\nrequested materials and particularized assertion of the relevant\ninterests, may aid in a court’s assessment of these interests. We\nwill discuss the applicability of such procedures in this case\ninfra at Section IV.A.\n\n                                       -27-\n\f                                     IV.\n\nA. Procedural Challenges\n\n           Before we address the substance of the FBI’s decision not\n\nto disclose the requested materials, we must resolve an array of\n\nprocedural objections that Puerto Rico has raised to the assertion\n\nof privilege in the proceedings below. Puerto Rico first complains\n\nthat the privilege was not properly invoked because the FBI did not\n\nsubmit an affidavit from the head of the agency, the district court\n\ndid not perform an in camera review of the materials that were the\n\nsubject of the subpoena, and the assertion of privilege was not\n\naccompanied by the FBI's item-by-item balancing of the harm to\n\nfederal   law    enforcement    interests     and   the   necessity    of   the\n\nmaterials to Puerto Rico’s investigation.                 The United States\n\nresponds that Puerto Rico did not raise these objections in the\n\ndistrict court and therefore has waived them.\n\n           Before the district court, Puerto Rico stated, in its\n\nopposition      to   the   United   States’    motion     to   dismiss,     that\n\n\"Defendants’ failure to properly assert, at the time they decided\n\nnot to disclose, the list of privileges that they now pretend to\n\nraise constitutes a waiver of all such privileges.\"                   In other\n\nwords, Puerto Rico insisted that the United States could not offer\n\nreasons to the district court for withholding the information that\n\nit had not given to Puerto Rico when it denied the Commonwealth's\n\ndemand for information. In its motion for summary judgment, Puerto\n\n                                     -28-\n\fRico    further   contended   that   the    decision   not   to   release   the\n\nmaterials was arbitrary and capricious\n\n            because it is premised exclusively on a\n            regulation that does not create a privilege.\n            Defendants’ wholly conclusory assertion that\n            disclosure of the information is not warranted\n            under the regulations simply lacks any valid\n            explanation for the denial. Defendants did not\n            assert a substantive privilege for the Court\n            to consider, or even offer a valid explanation\n            for the refusal to disclose. Defendants did\n            not even purport to substantiate or justify\n            their denial with an analysis of the pertinent\n            factors.\n\nPuerto Rico did not, however, identify for the district court's\n\nconsideration the specific procedures it now requests: an affidavit\n\nfrom the head of the FBI, an in camera review of the materials, and\n\nan item-by-item balancing of the interests at stake in disclosure\n\nof the materials.\n\n            We must also consider the manner in which the United\n\nStates asserted the privilege.         In its October 17, 2005 letter\n\ndenying the request for information with respect to the Ojeda\n\nsubpoena, the FBI explained that \"[a] determination has been made\n\nnot to disclose any of the information, objects and documents\n\nrequested by the PRDOJ\" because such disclosure \"would involve the\n\nconditions enumerated in [28 U.S.C.] § 16.26(b)(5).\"11 With respect\n\n\n       11\n       As noted, 28 U.S.C. § 16.26(b)(5) states that disclosure\nwill not be made when it \"would reveal investigatory records\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes, and would interfere with\nenforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and\nprocedures the effectiveness of which would thereby be impaired.\"\n\n                                     -29-\n\fto the 444 de Diego subpoena, the United States’ motion to quash\n\nexplained that disclosure of the internal protocols \"would reveal\n\ninvestigative and enforcement techniques\" and that disclosure of\n\nthe identities and official photographs of the FBI agents would\n\nviolate their privacy rights and \"pose a serious security threat.\"\n\n            After Puerto Rico filed its complaint, the United States'\n\nmotion to dismiss articulated further grounds for the assertion of\n\nthe   law   enforcement    privilege    with   respect   to   the   materials\n\nrequested in the Ojeda subpoena:\n\n            A person possessing these documents would\n            learn, inter alia, how the FBI goes about\n            capturing a fugitive who is believed to be\n            dangerous, the number and types of personnel\n            used by the FBI in such operations, the way\n            the FBI collects evidence, the FBI’s internal\n            operating procedures in a variety of sensitive\n            law enforcement settings, and the way in which\n            law enforcement information (such as the\n            location of Mr. Ojeda Rios) is gathered.\n\nThe United States further noted that most of the materials are also\n\nprotected    by   the   investigatory    files   privilege,     and    finally\n\nemphasized    that   the   privacy   interests    of   its    agents   favored\n\nnondisclosure of their names and other personal information.                It\n\nmade similar arguments with respect to the materials requested in\n\nthe 444 de Diego subpoena, explaining that \"the release of internal\n\nFBI protocols . . . would reveal law enforcement techniques\" and\n\nthat \"[t]he release of the identity, rank, and division of the FBI\n\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fagents could also reveal law enforcement techniques, by revealing\n\nthe manner in which the FBI staffs these types of operations.\"\n\n            We acknowledge that the procedures Puerto Rico references\n\nfor the first time on appeal may enhance the ability of a district\n\ncourt to evaluate fully and fairly the interests at stake in a case\n\nsuch as this.          Judging these interests in the abstract seems\n\nproblematic.      Here, however, Puerto Rico failed to request before\n\nthe district court the procedures it now specifies.                      This failure\n\nconstitutes a waiver of any objection premised on the absence of\n\nthose procedures.       See Persson v. Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd., 330\n\nF.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 2003).             Moreover, the circumstances here\n\nmitigate the risk that the absence of such procedures caused an\n\nunfair result.        The United States clearly and repeatedly asserted\n\nthe   law   enforcement     privilege    as    its    ground       for   refusing   to\n\ndisclose    the   requested    information,          and    it    articulated    more\n\nspecific    reasons     with   respect    to    the    various         categories   of\n\nmaterials.      There was no mistaking the basis for the FBI's refusal\n\nto    provide   the    information.      Finally,          as    the   United   States\n\nexplains, Puerto Rico requested broad categories of information\n\n(i.e., all internal FBI protocols relating to certain types of\n\noperations). Those generalities did not help Puerto Rico establish\n\nthe \"authentic 'necessity,'\" Cintolo, 812 F.2d at 1002, for the\n\ninformation it sought.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\f            Puerto Rico also contends that the United States has\n\nwaived any law enforcement privilege that may exist by disclosing\n\nsome of the requested information in a detailed, two hundred page\n\nreport.12   Again, Puerto Rico failed to raise this objection before\n\nthe district court, and again Puerto Rico has waived it.13   In any\n\nevent, the claim lacks merit.    Courts have held in the context of\n\nexecutive privilege that \"release of a document only waives these\n\nprivileges for the document or information specifically released,\n\nand not for related materials.\"    In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729,\n\n741 (D.C. Cir. 1997); see also Smith v. Cromer, 159 F.3d 875, 880\n\n(4th Cir. 1998)(explaining that \"disclosure of factual information\n\ndoes not effect a waiver of sovereign immunity as to other related\n\nmatters\").     This limited approach to waiver serves important\n\ninterests in open government by \"ensur[ing] that agencies do not\n\nforego voluntarily disclosing some privileged material out of the\n\nfear that by doing so they are exposing other, more sensitive\n\ndocuments.\"    In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d at 741.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n       See U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\nGeneral, A Review of the September 2005 Shooting Incident Involving\nthe FBI and Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, August 6, 2006, available at\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0608/full_report.pdf.\n     13\n        Although the report was released after the parties filed\ntheir motions, Puerto Rico still had ample time to raise this issue\nbefore the district court. The court did not issue a ruling until\nSeptember 26, 2006, nearly two months after the report was\nreleased. Indeed, the court cited the report in its opinion.\n\n                                -32-\n\f              The United States has been reasonably forthcoming in\n\nreleasing information related to the Ojeda intervention.                  The FBI\n\nallowed Puerto Rico to inspect bulletproof vests, helmets, weapons,\n\nand vehicles used during the intervention and the photographs taken\n\nbefore, during, and after the intervention.              Moreover, the Office\n\nof the Inspector General also released a report detailing the\n\nfindings of its investigation into the intervention.                    See supra\n\nnote 12.    It would be illogical to punish the United States for its\n\nvoluntary disclosure of these materials by also forcing it to\n\ndisclose other information that it has deemed privileged.\n\n              Having found that Puerto Rico's procedural claims lack\n\nmerit, we turn now to the substance of the FBI's decision to\n\nwithhold the requested materials.\n\nB. Ojeda Subpoena\n\n              The FBI refused to produce the materials specified in the\n\nOjeda subpoena, which included the \"Operation Order,\" identifying\n\ninformation for the agents involved in the intervention, reports\n\nand recordings related to the intervention, and a wide array of\n\ninformation regarding FBI protocols and operating procedures.                   As\n\nits   basis    for   asserting   the    privilege    with    respect      to   this\n\ninformation,      the   United   States       explains   that    the    requested\n\nmaterials     include   information     about    sensitive      law    enforcement\n\ntechniques that must remain confidential to allow the FBI to\n\noperate effectively.\n\n                                       -33-\n\f             As the district court explained, the disclosure of these\n\nmaterials would reveal\n\n             how the FBI goes about capturing a fugitive\n             who is believed to be dangerous, the number\n             and types of personnel used by the FBI in such\n             operations, the way the FBI collects evidence,\n             the FBI's internal operating procedures in a\n             variety of law enforcement settings, and the\n             way in which law enforcement information is\n             gathered.\n\nDisclosure of such information has the potential to thwart future\n\nFBI operations by publicizing the internal operations of that\n\nagency.\n\n             Given the qualified nature of the privilege, however, the\n\ncritical question is whether Puerto Rico has shown a necessity for\n\nthe information sufficient to overcome this qualified privilege.\n\nIn   favor   of   disclosure,    Puerto   Rico's   chief   argument   is   its\n\ninterest in asserting its sovereign authority to investigate and\n\nprosecute its criminal laws.         It explains that such authority is\n\nconstitutional in nature, and thus deserves greater weight in our\n\nbalancing calculus.         It also emphasizes that no alternative means\n\nexists to obtain the information it seeks.           Finally, Puerto Rico\n\ncontends that an overbroad reading of the privilege is tantamount\n\nto   granting     federal    officers   immunity   from    even   preliminary\n\ncriminal investigations.\n\n             In response, the United States first explains that the\n\nbalancing of interests typically takes place in the course of\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\funderlying criminal or civil litigation, in which the court must\n\nweigh the policy of the privilege against the particular litigation\n\nneed of a party. Here, however, there is no underlying litigation;\n\nthe \"need\" is Puerto Rico's assertion that the requested materials\n\nmight be of aid to a criminal investigation.          The United States\n\nalso notes that the Department of Justice has already undertaken an\n\ninvestigation of the intervention and published a detailed report\n\nof its findings.   Finally, in response to Puerto Rico's claim that\n\nfailure to release the information would foreclose investigation of\n\nthe officers, the United States emphasizes that federal officials\n\nare generally immune from state prosecution for actions performed\n\nwithin the scope of their official duties, and thus the privilege\n\nwould merely reflect an existing immunity.\n\n            With respect to this last point, the contentions of the\n\nparties deserve some elaboration.          Courts have explained that\n\n\"Supremacy Clause immunity governs the extent to which states may\n\nimpose civil or criminal liability on federal officials for alleged\n\nviolations of state law committed in the course of their federal\n\nduties.\"    Wyoming v. Livingston, 443 F.3d 1211, 1213 (10th Cir.\n\n2006).     Such disputes \"permit of no easy answers,\" but \"the\n\nsupremacy of federal law precludes the use of state prosecutorial\n\npower to frustrate the legitimate and reasonable exercise of\n\nfederal authority.\"      Id.    Thus, federal officials are generally\n\ngranted    Supremacy   Clause   immunity   from   state   prosecution   for\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\factions taken in the course of their official duties.                     See, e.g.,\n\nIn re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 75 (1890)(U.S. Marshal immune from state\n\nmurder     prosecution);      Livingston,      443    F.3d     1211   (10th      Cir.\n\n2006)(federal        officials    immune      from    state    prosecution        for\n\ntrespass);     New    York   v.   Tanella,    374    F.3d    141,   142    (2d   Cir.\n\n2004)(DEA agent who shot an unarmed suspect immune from state\n\nprosecution).        However, such immunity is limited to actions that\n\nwere \"reasonably necessary for the performance of [the officials']\n\nduties.\"       Livingston,     443   F.3d    at    1227-28.     In    the    present\n\nsituation, the privilege that the United States now asserts could\n\nconceivably extend beyond the scope of the immunity actually\n\navailable to the officers if the privilege was used to withhold\n\ninformation about acts not taken in the course of their official\n\nduties.\n\n            The sovereign interests at stake on both sides — Puerto\n\nRico's interest in enforcing its criminal laws and the United\n\nStates' interest in protecting the internal operations of the FBI\n\n— make our balancing of the interests particularly difficult in\n\nthis   case.     We    recognize     that    any    decision   will   necessarily\n\ncompromise one of these interests to some degree.                     On balance,\n\nhowever, we conclude that the FBI's decision not to release the\n\nrequested materials was reasonable under the deferential standard\n\nof review prescribed by the APA.            The FBI has a legitimate interest\n\nin maintaining the secrecy of sensitive law enforcement techniques.\n\n\n                                       -36-\n\f           We recognize that, in addition to general information\n\nabout FBI protocols and techniques, Puerto Rico also has requested\n\nnames and other personal information about individual FBI agents.\n\nSuperficially, this identifying information seems distinct from\n\ninformation about FBI protocols and techniques involved in the\n\nshooting death of Ojeda. However, the individuals at issue are not\n\nsuspected of criminal activity unrelated to the operation that\n\nimplicates those protocols and investigative techniques. Obtaining\n\nthis identifying information would allow Puerto Rico to interview\n\nthe individuals in question.         Inevitably, those interviews would\n\ninvolve inquiries relating to the FBI protocols and techniques that\n\nfall within the privilege.\n\n           Moreover, as the district court noted in its opinion,\n\ndisclosing certain information about the agents \"would reveal the\n\nnumber   and   types   of   personnel     used   by   the    FBI\"   to    conduct\n\noperations such as the Ojeda intervention.                  If agents’ names,\n\nofficial   photographs      and   other   personal    information        are   made\n\navailable, as requested by Puerto Rico, these agents will be less\n\nsuccessful at conducting covert operations.            Finally, courts have\n\nexplained that \"individuals, including government employees and\n\nofficials, have privacy interests in the dissemination of their\n\nnames.   Public disclosure of the names of FBI agents and other law\n\nenforcement personnel . . . could subject them to embarrassment and\n\nharassment in the conduct of their official duties and personal\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\faffairs.\"   Massey v. FBI, 3 F.3d 620, 624 (2d Cir. 1993)(citation\n\nomitted)(upholding the nondisclosure of FBI agents’ names under\n\nExemption 7 of FOIA); see also Jones v. FBI, 41 F.3d 238, 246-47\n\n(6th Cir. 1994)(holding that “federal law enforcement officials\n\n'have the right to be protected against public disclosure of their\n\nparticipation in law enforcement investigations'\" (quoting Ingle v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 698 F.2d 259, 269 (6th Cir. 1983))); Lesar\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 636 F.2d 472, 487 (D.C. Cir. 1980)(“As\n\nseveral courts have recognized, [FBI] agents have a legitimate\n\ninterest in preserving the secrecy of matters that conceivably\n\ncould subject them to annoyance or harassment in either their\n\nofficial or private lives.”).\n\n            We acknowledge Puerto Rico's argument that the FBI's\n\ndecision to withhold the information raises the possibility that a\n\nfederal agency may thwart state criminal proceedings against one of\n\nits own employees by refusing to disclose information that might\n\nlead to prosecution.   That is a troubling possibility.   As we have\n\nexplained, although federal officials generally receive immunity\n\nfrom prosecution, such immunity obtains only when they are acting\n\nwithin the scope of official duties.   The FBI's refusal to produce\n\nthe requested materials may preclude a determination of whether the\n\nactions at issue here were within that scope.\n\n            However, other circumstances present here minimize the\n\nlikelihood that wrongdoing was improperly concealed.      First, the\n\n                                -38-\n\fFBI acceded to some of Puerto Rico’s requests for information,\n\nagreeing to allow Puerto Rico to inspect most of the physical\n\nevidence from the intervention and photographs of the premises\n\ntaken before, during, and after the intervention.              Moreover, the\n\nOffice of the Inspector General (\"OIG\") — an entity entirely\n\nindependent from the FBI — conducted a searching investigation of\n\nthe events and made public a detailed two hundred page report of\n\nits findings.     See supra note 12.     In preparing the report, the OIG\n\ninterviewed over sixty individuals, including all of the agents who\n\nplanned, participated in, or had knowledge of the operation;\n\nreviewed thousands of pages of documents, including operation plans\n\nand orders, investigative files, intelligence reports, and FBI\n\npolicies and procedures; reviewed forensic reports; and consulted\n\nwith experts in tactical police operations. The report \"identified\n\na   number   of   deficiencies   in   the    FBI’s   conduct   of   the   Ojeda\n\nsurveillance and arrest operation\" and made \"ten recommendations\n\ndealing with these findings\"; however, it \"did not conclude that\n\nany of the actions of FBI officials constituted misconduct.\"                We\n\nacknowledge that these safeguards are an imperfect substitute for\n\nPuerto Rico’s ability to obtain information to conduct its own\n\ninvestigation;     however,   the     availability     of   this    substitute\n\nreinforces our conclusion that the FBI's decision to withhold the\n\nother materials was not arbitrary.\n\n             In sum, we find no error in the FBI’s refusal to release\n\n\n                                      -39-\n\fthe information Puerto Rico requested in the Ojeda subpoena.\n\nC. 444 de Diego Subpoena\n\n            Under the APA, a party must obtain a \"final agency\n\ndecision\" prior to seeking judicial review of an agency action.            5\n\nU.S.C. § 704; Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997).           Here,\n\nPuerto Rico served the 444 de Diego subpoena on the FBI on February\n\n20, 2006.      The FBI then filed a motion to quash the subpoena on\n\nFebruary 28.     Puerto Rico contends that this motion to quash the\n\n444 de Diego subpoena was the equivalent of a final agency action,\n\nwhile the United States asserts that it was not.\n\n            In its opinion ruling in favor of the United States, the\n\ndistrict court held that no final agency action had taken place.\n\nIt explained that, at the March 2 hearing on the United States'\n\nmotion to quash, Puerto Rico stated that \"right now there is no\n\nintention to file any contempt proceedings\" and that it \"currently\n\nwas going to be evaluating which is the next step in order to\n\ncontinue that investigation; if the step is administrative, if it\n\nis federal judicial or if it is state judicial.\"             The district\n\ncourt   then    advised   Puerto   Rico   that   it   must   exhaust     its\n\nadministrative remedies and obtain a final agency action in order\n\nto file suit.     Puerto Rico's next action, however, was to file the\n\ncomplaint in this action on March 23.       Consequently, the district\n\ncourt explained that Puerto Rico “has not submitted anything into\n\nthe record indicating that the government made a final decision,”\n\n                                   -40-\n\fimplicitly holding that the motion to quash could not itself\n\nconstitute a final agency action, and thus no final agency action\n\nhad taken place.\n\n            The issue of whether the United States’ motion to quash\n\nthe subpoena was final agency action is a thorny one.             Courts have\n\nheld   that    \"an    agency’s   refusal     to   comply   with   a    subpoena\n\nconstitutes 'final agency action . . . ripe for . . . review under\n\nthe APA.'\"         Yousuf v. Samantar, 451 F.3d 248, 251 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2006)(quoting COMSAT Corp. v. Nat'l Sci. Found., 190 F.3d 269, 275\n\n(4th Cir. 1999)).        Indeed, in United States v. Williams, 170 F.3d\n\n431, 434 n.4 (4th Cir. 1999), \"the government asserted and [the\n\nparty requesting information] did not dispute that the United\n\nStates Attorney's response to a subpoena constitutes final agency\n\naction for purposes of the APA.\"        No court has held, however, that\n\nfiling a motion to quash is the equivalent of a refusal to comply.\n\nMoreover, at the hearing on the motion to quash, Puerto Rico’s\n\nacknowledgment that it was exploring other avenues of obtaining the\n\nmaterials     it   had   requested,   including    administrative      avenues,\n\nsuggests that Puerto Rico itself did not believe that it had\n\nobtained final agency action.\n\n            The issue of whether there was final agency action\n\nimplicates the jurisdiction of the federal courts, and such final\n\naction is normally a prerequisite to judicial review.                 Cobell v.\n\nKempthorne, 455 F.3d 301, 304 (D.C. Cir. 2006).            However, we have\n\n                                      -41-\n\fheld that cases exist in which we may exercise \"hypothetical\n\njurisdiction\" — that is, cases \"in which we may — and should —\n\nbypass the jurisdictional question\" because the jurisdictional\n\nissue is complex but the outcome on the merits is straightforward.\n\nSee, e.g., Royal Siam Corp. v. Chertoff, 2007 WL 1228792 at *4 (1st\n\nCir. Apr. 27, 2007). In exercising such hypothetical jurisdiction,\n\n\"we have distinguished between Article III jurisdiction (which may\n\nnever   be     bypassed)      and   statutory     jurisdiction        (which    may\n\noccasionally be bypassed).\"            Id.    Here, the question of whether\n\nthere   has    been   final    agency    action    is    one   that    implicates\n\nstatutory, rather than constitutional, jurisdiction. See Air Brake\n\nSystems, Inc. v. Mineta, 357 F.3d 632, 638 (6th Cir. 2004)(\"[T]he\n\njurisdictional question here is one of statutory interpretation:\n\n[was there] 'final' agency action for which no other adequate\n\njudicial remedy exists?\"); Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. EPA, 801 F.2d 430,\n\n442 (D.C. Cir. 1986)(discussing \"the statutory jurisdictional issue\n\nof whether [there was] 'final agency action'\").                Thus, given the\n\ndifficulty of the jurisdictional issue here, we conclude that it is\n\nappropriate     to    bypass    that    issue   and     proceed   to    the    more\n\nstraightforward task of resolving the merits.\n\n              The materials requested by Puerto Rico in the 444 de\n\nDiego subpoena are substantially similar to the materials already\n\ndiscussed with respect to the Ojeda subpoena: (1) the name, rank,\n\ndivision, address, and telephone number of two FBI agents; (2) an\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\fofficial photograph of each of the two FBI agents; and (3) internal\n\nFBI protocols relating to the use of force and pepper spray.                      These\n\nmaterials fall within the scope of the law enforcement privilege\n\nfor the same reasons that the names and personal information of FBI\n\nagents and the internal FBI protocols requested in the Ojeda\n\nsubpoena fell within that privilege, and Puerto Rico has offered no\n\nmore compelling reasons for disclosure in the case of the materials\n\nrequested in the 444 de Diego subpoena. Thus, assuming that Puerto\n\nRico obtained final agency action with respect to its request for\n\nthese materials, the FBI was neither arbitrary nor capricious in\n\nwithholding such information.\n\n                                          V.\n\n               After careful review, we conclude that Puerto Rico cannot\n\nassert     a     nonstatutory     cause        of     action,   grounded     in     its\n\nconstitutional sovereign authority to enforce its criminal laws, to\n\nobtain the materials it seeks.                 Instead, we find Puerto Rico's\n\nrequest for these materials subject to review under the APA.\n\nMoreover, we hold that a qualified privilege applies to the law\n\nenforcement materials Puerto Rico has requested here: sensitive law\n\nenforcement protocols and techniques and the names and other\n\npersonal       information   of   the   FBI         agents   involved   in   the    two\n\noperations.       In light of this privilege and the applicable Touhy\n\nregulations, we conclude that the FBI's response to the Ojeda\n\nsubpoena and the 444 de Diego subpoena was neither arbitrary nor\n\n                                        -43-\n\fcapricious.   Thus, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n                   - Concurring Opinions Follow -\n\n\n\n\n                               -44-\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.           It has been long\n\nsettled that the United States cannot be sued, either in federal\n\ncourt or in any state forum, unless it has waived sovereign\n\nimmunity.    Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U.S. 156, 160 (1981).          States\n\nand comparable entities are treated no differently than any other\n\nlitigant.    Indeed, the lower courts have repeatedly held that,\n\nabsent a waiver, the United States cannot be forced to obey a\n\nsubpoena issued by a state court, state grand jury, or state\n\nlegislative committee.14\n\n            Puerto   Rico's   lawsuit   in   federal   court,   seeking   to\n\nenforce the state's demand for a turnover of documents and exhibits\n\nbelonging to or in the custody of the FBI, is itself barred by\n\nsovereign immunity unless it falls within an exception--which\n\nnormally must be created by Congress.         This is not an instance of\n\ndiscovery in aid of a federal lawsuit to which the United States\n\nhas otherwise consented (e.g., a Tucker Act suit against the United\n\nStates) or to which it is otherwise susceptible to discovery (e.g.,\n\na federal criminal prosecution).\n\n\n     14\n      See, e.g., United States v. Williams, 170 F.3d 431, 433 (4th\nCir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 854 (1999); In re Elko County Grand\nJury, 109 F.3d 554, 556 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1027\n(1997) (sovereign immunity bars enforcement of state grand jury\nsubpoena of federal official); Houston Bus. Journal, Inc. v. Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency, 86 F.3d 1208, 1212 (D.C. Cir.\n1996); State of La. v. Sparks, 978 F.2d 226, 234-35 (5th Cir.\n1992); Boron Oil Co. v. Downie, 873 F.2d 67, 71 (4th Cir. 1989);\nUnited States v. McLeod, 385 F.2d 734, 751 (5th Cir. 1967); United\nStates v. Owlett,, 15 F. Supp. 736, 742 (M.D. Pa. 1936).\n\n                                   -45-\n\f          So far as Puerto Rico is asserting an implied exception\n\nto federal sovereign immunity for state criminal investigations,\n\nthe proposition is without case support and is at odds with a\n\ncatalogue of cases.   See note 14, above.   Puerto Rico is free to\n\nconduct criminal investigations. It is not free to bring a federal\n\nor state lawsuit to obtain by court process, at the behest of a\n\nstate agency, documents and exhibits controlled by the United\n\nStates, unless Congress has so provided.\n\n          The United States has waived sovereign immunity in a\n\nnumber of different statutes, including the Federal Tort Claims\n\nAct, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b) (2000) (certain torts), the Tucker Act,\n\nid. § 1346(a) (contracts), and the Freedom of Information Act, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552 (2000) (access to many documents).   Puerto Rico does\n\nnot invoke the FOIA, presumably because one of its exceptions\n\nlimits requests for criminal investigative materials.15   5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n      The Freedom of Information Act excepts from disclosure\n\"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but\nonly to the extent that the production of such law enforcement\nrecords or information (A) could reasonably be expected to\ninterfere with enforcement proceedings, . . . (D) could reasonably\nbe expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source . .\n. , (E) would disclose techniques and procedures for law\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose\nguidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if\nsuch disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention\nof the law, or (F) could reasonably be expected to endanger the\nlife or physical safety of any individual.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7).\n\n\n                               -46-\n\f          This leaves Puerto Rico with the Administrative Procedure\n\nAct (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 702.     The APA can be viewed both as a\n\nresidual waiver of sovereign immunity permitting judicial review of\n\nfederal action--though not an award of damages--where there is no\n\nother prescribed remedy; and as a federal cause of action where an\n\nagency acts contrary to law or in a manner that is arbitrary or\n\nirrational (unless the matter is one committed to agency discretion\n\nby law, id. § 701(a)(2)).   See H.R. Rep. 94-1656, at 4-12 (1976).\n\n          Puerto Rico points to no law requiring the turnover of\n\nthe materials it seeks.     So far as Puerto Rico asserts its own\n\nsovereign interest in law enforcement, this interest creates no\n\ncause of action--state or federal--that permits Puerto Rico to\n\nconstrain the United States.     See U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2;\n\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 436 (1819) (\"the\n\nstates have no power . . . to retard, impede, burden, or . . .\n\ncontrol\" the execution of federal powers); cf. In re Neagle, 135\n\nU.S. 1, 75 (1890).\n\n          Congress   has    authorized   each   agency   to   create\n\nhousekeeping regulations governing the use of its \"records, papers,\n\nand property,\" 5 U.S.C. § 301, and the Department's pertinent\n\nregulations forbid disclosure of any information where\n\n          [d]isclosure would reveal investigatory records\n          compiled for law enforcement purposes, and would\n          interfere   with  enforcement   proceedings   or\n          disclose investigative techniques and procedures\n\n\n                                 -47-\n\f            the effectiveness        of   which     would    thereby    be\n            impaired,\n\nunless the \"administration of justice requires disclosure.\"                     28\n\nC.F.R. § 16.26(b)(5), (c).           Yet the Department's regulations, by\n\ntheir explicit terms, create no substantive rights in litigants,\n\n28 C.F.R. § 16.21(d), and so create no legal obligation enforceable\n\nunder the APA.\n\n            This leaves Puerto Rico, at best, with an APA suit to\n\nchallenge agency action as arbitrary and capricious.                   Some courts\n\nhave    recognized    an    action    under   the      APA   to   challenge     the\n\nreasonableness of the agency's action in withholding documents.16\n\nWhether this is a plausible claim--given the explicit treatment of\n\ndocument requests under the FOIA--might be debated.                       But the\n\npresent case would turn out the same way even if such an APA claim\n\nsurvived the precept lex specialis derogat legi generali.                    In re\n\nLazarus, 478 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            There    is    nothing   arbitrary    or    capricious      about   the\n\nDepartment's policy of refusing to reveal \"records compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes\" that would \"disclose investigative techniques\n\n\n       16\n      \"If the agency refuses to produce the requested documents,\nthe sole remedy for the state-court litigant is to file a\ncollateral action in federal court under the APA.\" Houston Bus.\nJournal, 86 F.3d at 1212.

The   Department's         legitimate\n\ninterest   is    self-evident       and    is    reflected       in   both     the   FOIA\n\ncategorical     exception,     see    note       16,    above,    and    in    judicial\n\nrecognition of a law enforcement privilege, Roviaro v. United\n\nStates, 353 U.S. 53, 59 (1957).\n\n           Nor did the Department act arbitrarily or capriciously in\n\napplying its general policy in this case.                  As the district court\n\nfound, the materials sought by Puerto Rico and withheld by the\n\nDepartment would reveal the identities of FBI agents, \"how the FBI\n\ngoes about capturing a fugitive who is believed to be dangerous,\n\nthe   number    and   types    of   personnel      used    by     the    FBI    in   such\n\noperations, the way the FBI collects evidence, the FBI's internal\n\noperating procedures in a variety of law enforcement settings, and\n\nthe way in which law enforcement information is gathered.\"17\n\n           That in this case the materials might be protected under\n\nthe federal law enforcement privilege is icing on the cake, but the\n\nDepartment's action would be reasonable even without the privilege.\n\nWhen the United States tries a defendant in its own courts, no\n\n\n\n      17\n      These materials included the \"operation order\" relating to\nthe FBI raid on Ojeda's residence; the identities and photographs\nof the agents involved in the raid and those responsible for using\npepper spray; information gathered during the FBI's occupation of\nOjeda's residence; copies of expert reports, photographs, and\nrecordings related to the raid; and internal protocols concerning\nviolent and arrest interventions and use of force.\n\n                                          -49-\n\fissue of sovereign immunity is presented: disclosure obligations\n\ndepend on federal criminal rules and precedents and, ordinarily,\n\nmaterial in government hands must be produced in response to such\n\nrequirements or a defense subpoena unless privileged.\n\n           By contrast, when Puerto Rico is seeking materials in an\n\naction not otherwise properly in federal court, the United States\n\nhas no independent obligation to turn over government materials\n\nregardless of whether they are privileged; at most, it must avoid\n\naction that is arbitrary and capricious and can do so on the basis\n\nof a reasonable general policy.           The Department's refusal to\n\nrelease   the   information   in   this   case   was   not   arbitrary   and\n\ncapricious and that is the end of the matter.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\f             SHADUR, District Judge, concurring. In this instance the\n\nthoughtful opinions by Judge Lipez and Chief Judge Boudin put me in\n\nmind    of   the   old     saw   about     the   politician    who   says   of    a\n\ncontroversial issue, “Some of my friends are in favor of X, and\n\nsome of my friends are in favor of Y, and I’m in favor of my\n\nfriends.”       Both opinions reach the same destination, albeit by\n\ndifferent routes, and at the end of the day I share their common\n\nconclusion that the Commonwealth’s legitimate interest in pursuing\n\na possible criminal prosecution cannot override the legitimate\n\npolicy concerns of the United States, as the ultimate sovereign, in\n\nnot    unduly    exposing    its     own   law   enforcement     techniques      and\n\npersonnel against its wishes.\n\n             In that respect Congress has permissibly acted to limit\n\njudicial     review   of     those    policy     concerns   to   the   standards\n\napplicable under the APA, and the Commonwealth has not surmounted\n\nthe high hurdle that statute prescribes.               Hence I concur in the\n\nconclusion reached in each of the two opinions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -51-\n\f",

Case No. 06-1306: Ojeda Subpoena</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1970s, Filiberto Ojeda R&#237;os helped found the Macheteros, an organization that advocates independence for Puerto Rico through armed struggle against the United States government. In 1983, the Macheteros stole $7.1 million from a bank in Connecticut. The FBI apprehended Ojeda in 1985, and, during his arrest, Ojeda shot an FBI agent in the face, permanently blinding the agent in one eye. Ojeda was acquitted for assaulting the agent following a trial in Puerto Rico. He then skipped bail while on trial for bank robbery and was sentenced in absentia in 1992. Fifteen years later, in September 2005, the FBI attempted to apprehend Ojeda at his residence in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico. During this intervention, Ojeda shot two FBI agents and was himself fatally wounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRDOJ commenced an investigation into the intervention. On October 4, 2005, a PRDOJ prosecutor issued a subpoena pursuant to title 34, section 1476 of the Puerto Rico Code commanding then United States Attorney Humberto Garcia to produce materials including: (1) a copy of the \"Operation Order\" (a document establishing the plan or rules of engagement for the FBI intervention at Ojeda's residence); (2) the name, rank, division, address, and telephone numbers of every person who participated in or made decisions regarding the intervention, as well as an organizational diagram showing these individuals' rank on the line of command; (3) various equipment, including, but not limited to, all bullet-proof vests, helmets, weapons, and vehicles involved in the intervention; (4) any inventory of the property occupied during the intervention; (5) copies of any expert reports relating to the intervention or Ojeda's death; (6) copies of any audio or video recordings of the events relating to the intervention; (7) copies of all photographs relating to the intervention; and (8) copies of any relevant general FBI protocols, including those relating to violent interventions and potentially deadly force. In subsequent correspondence, the PRDOJ explained that the requests related to a \"criminal investigation\" that it was conducting into Ojeda's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated October 17, the FBI declined to produce the requested materials, explaining that its internal regulations prohibited disclosure of records compiled for law enforcement purposes. The letter stated that the denial of the PRDOJ's request was a \"final agency decision which may be reviewed by the United States District Court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further communications among the PRDOJ, FBI, and United States Attorney's Office, the U.S. Attorney indicated by letter dated November 9 that the FBI would allow the PRDOJ to examine some of the items listed in the subpoena, including the bulletproof vests, helmets, weapons, and vehicles used during the intervention and the photographs taken before, during, and after the intervention. The FBI stipulated that it would retain official custody of these items and that an FBI official would be present during the inspection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRDOJ initially acceded to these terms, but subsequently reiterated the substance of its original demand in a letter dated January 20, 2006. The FBI refused this demand, again noting that its refusal constituted \"final agency action.\" The PRDOJ filed suit in March 2006 to compel disclosure of the requested materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Case No. 06-1305: 444 de Diego Subpoena</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using information obtained from Ojeda's residence to establish probable cause, the FBI obtained a search warrant for a residential condominium located at 444 de Diego in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The FBI executed the warrant in February 2006, and a large group of protesters, reporters, and members of the general public gathered outside. The United States asserts that some of these individuals breached an established police line, and an FBI agent used pepper spray to keep people behind the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRDOJ issued subpoenas to U.S. Attorney Garcia and to Luis Fraticelli, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI San Juan Field Office, requesting three categories of materials: (1) the name, rank, division, address, and telephone number of the two FBI agents who allegedly used pepper spray and whose photos were attached to the subpoena; (2) official photographs of these two FBI agents; and (3) internal FBI protocols relating to the use of force and pepper spray. The PRDOJ explained that the subpoenas were \"part of the criminal investigation\" of the PRDOJ into \"the conduct of FBI agents during the execution of a search warrant\" at 444 de Diego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FBI moved to quash the subpoenas in federal district court. After the PRDOJ indicated, at a hearing on March 2, that \"it was actually evaluating other avenues through which to get the information about the federal agents, and that it had no serious intention of enforcing the challenged subpoenas,\" the district court concluded that the subpoenas were \"effectively mooted.\" The court thus withheld action on the motion to quash. Subsequently, on March 23, the PRDOJ filed suit to compel the release of the requested records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Proceedings Before the District Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's complaint in No. 06-1306 sought a declaratory judgment recognizing its right \"to conduct a full investigation into the events leading to the death of Mr. Ojeda Rios,\" and an order \"permanently enjoining Defendants from withholding any information relevant to the Commonwealth's investigation and ordering Defendants to comply with the Commonwealth's requests and produce the subpoenaed information, objects and documents[.]\" The complaint in No. 06-1305 sought identical relief with respect to Puerto Rico's \"investigation into the events allegedly leading to the injury of members of the press and/or the public . . . on February 10, 2006, due to the alleged use of excessive force (including the alleged use of pepper spray) by FBI agents[.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each complaint, Puerto Rico articulated five causes of action which entitled it to its requested relief. First, it stated that the FBI's decisions were not premised upon any federal regulation or statute. Second, it stated that the FBI's decisions exceeded any authority granted by the Housekeeping Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 301. Third, it asserted a nonstatutory cause of action to vindicate its constitutional sovereign authority to enforce its criminal laws by obtaining the requested information. Fourth, it contended that APA review was \"unwarranted\" because such review \"would impose an undue burden on the exercise of sovereign criminal authority that would run afoul of the Tenth Amendment.\" Finally, Puerto Rico claimed that, even if reviewed under the APA, the FBI's decision to withhold the information was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court consolidated the cases, the United States moved to dismiss, and Puerto Rico filed a motion for summary judgment. After considering these motions, the district court concluded that Puerto Rico had failed to establish a basis for its requested relief. The court rejected Puerto Rico's first two causes of action, explaining that, although the FBI's internal regulations did not create a substantive right to withhold the information, the regulations incorporated federal common law establishing a privilege for law enforcement materials. The court also dismissed Puerto Rico's third cause of action, holding that Puerto Rico could not assert a nonstatutory cause of action, based on its sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws, to obtain the requested materials. The court thus concluded that Puerto Rico's request was subject to judicial review under the provisions of the APA, thereby rejecting Puerto Rico's fourth cause of action. Finally, on Puerto Rico's fifth and final cause of action, the court applied the APA's framework for review. Noting the FBI's interest in maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive law enforcement techniques, it found that the FBI's decision with respect to the Ojeda subpoena was neither arbitrary nor capricious. With respect to the 444 de Diego subpoena, the court concluded that there had been no final agency action, and thus the FBI's failure to release the information was not subject to judicial review. In sum, the court dismissed Puerto Rico's first through fourth causes of action, and, on the fifth cause of action, denied Puerto Rico's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Puerto Rico first contends that its sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws provides it with a nonstatutory cause of action to obtain the information it seeks from the FBI. It explains that, under our federal constitutional system, a state has a \"judicially cognizable interest in the preservation of [its] own sovereignty,\" which includes its \"ability to punish wrongdoers and enforce its criminal laws\" and, more specifically, \"to prosecute federal agents if they have acted unlawfully in carrying out their duties.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Consequently, \"any impermissible federal interference with such <i>constitutional</i> sovereignty is amenable to resolution by a federal district court under its equitable powers.\" Puerto Rico concludes that \"[a] direct cause of action for equitable relief is the only avenue to properly vindicate a State's constitutional claim of sovereign[] authority to enforce its criminal laws.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Puerto Rico acknowledges that agency decisions are normally reviewed under the APA, it argues that such review is inappropriate because: (1) \"[i]t is unfounded to subject a State's sovereign penal authority to an administrative process that will be followed by an extremely limited form of judicial review\"; (2) such review will place Puerto Rico \"in a worse position to obtain information than private parties\" who can sue the federal government and request discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26; and (3) APA review would allow the federal government to \"commandeer[] state prosecutorial powers by deciding what information the State should consider in its investigations.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in all suits against the federal government, we must first consider whether sovereign immunity bars this claim. \"It is long settled law that, as an attribute of sovereign immunity, the United States and its agencies may not be subject to judicial proceedings unless there has been an express waiver of that immunity.\" <i>EPA v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 197 F.3d 592, 597 (2d Cir. 1999). The APA waives sovereign immunity under certain conditions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action .. . is entitled to judicial review thereof. An action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5 U.S.C. &#167; 702.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This waiver is for \"`<i>all</i> equitable actions for specific relief against a Federal agency or officer acting in an official capacity,'\" <i>Trudeau v.

United States,</i> 592 F.2d 712, 719 (3d Cir. 1979)(\"By waiving sovereign immunity in suits for `relief other than money damages,' the Congress sought to `facilitate nonstatutory judicial review of Federal administrative action ....'\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this persuasive authority indicates that sovereign immunity would pose no bar to Puerto Rico's claim for nonmonetary relief, the question remains whether Puerto Rico has the nonstatutory cause of action it invokes. In prior cases involving subpoenas issued by state entities, courts have held that the party requesting the subpoena must proceed under the APA. <i>Houston Bus. Journal, Inc. v. Office of Comptroller of the Currency,</i> 86 F.3d 1208, 1212 (D.C.Cir.1996)(\"[A] state-court litigant must request the documents from the federal agency pursuant to the agency's regulations .... If the agency refuses to produce the requested documents, the sole remedy for the state-court litigant is to file a collateral action in federal court under the APA.\"); <i>Edwards v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 43 F.3d 312, 316 (7th Cir. 1994)(\"The subpoenas were in effect a request for information from an executive department....

It is uncontroverted that states may enact and enforce criminal laws, and that this power is constitutional in nature. As the Supreme Court explained in <i>Heath v. Alabama,</i> 474 U.S. 82, 106 S.Ct. 433, 88 L.Ed.2d 387 (1985), \"[t]he Constitution leaves in the possession of each State `certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power.' Foremost among the prerogatives of sovereignty is the power to create and enforce a criminal code.\" <i>Id.</i> at 93, 106 S.Ct. 433 (quoting Federalist No. 9); <i>see also Engle v. Isaac,</i> 456 U.S. 107, 128, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982)(\"The States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.... Federal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate ... the States' sovereign power to punish offenders....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party claims that a violation of its constitutional rights has occurred and it has \"no effective means other than the judiciary to enforce these rights, [that party] must be able to invoke the existing jurisdiction of the courts for the protection of [its] justiciable constitutional rights.\" <i>Davis v. Passman,</i> 442 U.S. 228, 242, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979); <i>see also Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 389, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)(holding that a \"cause of action for damages\" arises under the Constitution when federal officers violate Fourth Amendment rights). Where, as here, a state has asserted a right that is constitutional in nature, \"we are bound by a strong presumption in favor of providing the state some vehicle for vindicating its rights.\" <i>R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States</i> (\"<i>RIDEM</i>\"), 304 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of agency action, parties occasionally invoke the principles of \"nonstatutory review.\" Nonstatutory review is available pursuant to the general \"federal question\" jurisdiction of the federal courts under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 in situations where \"Congress makes no specific choice of [the court in which judicial review is to occur] in the statute pursuant to which the agency action is taken, or in another statute applicable to it.\" <i>Five Flags Pipe Line Co. v. Dep't of Transp.,</i> 854 F.2d 1438, 1439 (D.C.Cir.1988). \"The basic premise behind nonstatutory review is that, even after the passage of the APA, some residuum of power remains with the district court to review agency action that is <i>ultra vires.\" RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 42. Thus, if \"a plaintiff is unable to bring his case predicated on either a specific or a general statutory review provision, he may still be able to institute a non-statutory review action.\" <i>Reich,</i> 74 F.3d at 1327 (citing Clark Byse &amp; Joseph V. Fiocca, Section 1361 of the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962 and \"Nonstatutory\" Judicial Review of Federal Administrative Action, 81 Harv. L.Rev. 308, 321 (1967)). Puerto Rico claims that the FBI acted outside the scope of its legal authority in withholding the requested materials, in violation of the Constitution, and that the Constitution itself provides a basis for nonstatutory review of that violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>RIDEM,</i> we evaluated a similar claim for nonstatutory review that was \"constitutional in scope.\" 304 F.3d at 41. There, the state of Rhode Island brought suit to assert that its sovereign immunity (a \"constitutionally protected sovereign interest\") entitled it to enjoin an administrative proceeding that the Department of Labor had initiated against it. <i>Id.</i> at 36. We noted that the Supreme Court has established two \"critical factors [that] must be present to invoke nonstatutory review.\" <i>RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 42. First, such review may occur only if its absence would \"`wholly deprive the party of a meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its ... rights.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Bd. of Gov'rs of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp. Fin.,</i> 502 U.S. 32, 43, 112 S.Ct. 459, 116 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991)). Second, \"Congress must not have clearly intended to preclude review of the agency's particular determination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 42-43 (citing <i>Bd. of Gov'rs,</i> 502 U.S. at 44, 112 S.Ct. 459). We then applied these two factors and concluded that Rhode Island had a direct, nonstatutory cause of action to enjoin an administrative proceeding on the ground of sovereign immunity, even though the APA requires that parties exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. <i>Id.</i> at 43. We explained that Rhode Island had no other avenue for vindicating its right to immunity from suit and that Congress had not explicitly precluded its action. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, we emphasized that \"general equitable considerations\" favored a nonstatutory action, including the fact that Rhode Island had claimed the violation of \"a clear right that is constitutional in nature\" and that its \"immunity would be effectively lost absent judicial review.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's situation differs materially from that of Rhode Island in <i>RIDEM.</i> Critically, with respect to the first requirement for nonstatutory review, Puerto Rico does have a means of vindicating its rights without nonstatutory review: the APA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Within that judicial review framework, Puerto Rico may assert its sovereign interest in enforcing its criminal laws as a consideration in our review of the agency's decision. Thus, we cannot conclude that Puerto Rico's rights \"would be effectively lost absent judicial review.\" <i>Id.</i> at 43 (citing <i>Morales v. Trans World Airlines,</i> 504 U.S. 374, 381, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992)). Likewise, with respect to the second requirement, although Congress has not explicitly prohibited nonstatutory review in a case such as this, the existence of the APA as a means for reviewing the FBI's actions at least implies that nonstatutory review is inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that nonstatutory review might have allowed Puerto Rico to obtain a more favorable standard of review and to circumvent certain of the APA's procedural requirements. However, in considering Puerto Rico's demand for a more favorable standard of judicial review on constitutional grounds, we must be mindful of the Supremacy Clause, which \"is designed to ensure that states do not `retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control' the execution of federal law.\" <i>New York v. Tanella,</i> 374 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir.2004)(quoting <i>McCulloch v. Maryland,</i> 17 U.S.(4 Wheat.) 316, 436, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819)). We are not suggesting that the Supremacy Clause alone provides the basis for rejecting Puerto Rico's theory of a nonstatutory cause of action to obtain law enforcement information from the FBI. But Puerto Rico portrays its sovereign authority over law enforcement as paramount in the analysis. That cannot be so. The Supremacy Clause reminds us that the federal government also has a critical interest in carrying out its own law enforcement responsibilities. In most instances, federal and state law enforcement interests are complementary. However, when a state's interest in investigating the agents of a federal law enforcement entity arguably conflicts with that federal entity's need to protect certain information relating to law enforcement activities, Congress has provided a mechanism&#8212;the APA&#8212;for resolving these conflicts. Puerto Rico has not convinced us that this congressional choice was somehow constitutionally insufficient and hence Puerto Rico must have a nonstatutory cause of action to vindicate its law enforcement interests. To the contrary, for the reasons we have expressed, we conclude that the judicial review provided by the APA for the denial of information by a federal agency is compatible with Puerto Rico's sovereign authority under the Constitution for the enforcement of its criminal laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the APA, we will overturn the FBI's decision not to release the requested information only if it was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A). The fact that Puerto Rico made its request for information in the form of a subpoena from the PRDOJ does not affect the nature of our review under the APA. The subpoenas were \"in effect a request for information from an executive department,\" and, consequently, \"the subpoena[s] are treated as an administrative demand.\" <i>Edwards v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 43 F.3d 312, 316 (7th Cir.1994)(explaining that a subpoena initiates the administrative process); <i>see also</i> 28 C.F.R. &#167; 16.21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, we are deferential to the agency's decision.

Law Enforcement Privilege</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court first recognized a qualified privilege for certain information related to law enforcement activities in <i>Roviaro v. United States,</i> 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). There, the Court explained that the government has a qualified privilege to withhold the identities of confidential informants. <i>Id.</i> at 59, 77 S.Ct. 623. Such a privilege \"further[s] and protect[s][] the public interest in effective law enforcement,\" encouraging citizens to communicate their knowledge of crimes by preserving their anonymity. <i>Id.</i> The Court also noted that \"[t]he scope of the privilege is limited by its underlying purpose. Thus, where the disclosure of the contents of a communication will not tend to reveal the identity of an informer, the contents are not privileged.\" <i>Id.</i> at 60, 77 S.Ct. 623.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Roviaro,</i> we have recognized a privilege for law enforcement materials in other circumstances. In <i>United States v. Cintolo,</i> 818 F.2d 980, 983-84 (1st Cir. 1987), the FBI, with judicial authorization, had monitored conversations between the defendant and various confederates via hidden microphones placed within an apartment. The district court refused to allow the defense to question witnesses \"concerning the precise location of the electronic surveillance devices\" on the ground that such questioning would \"jeopardize future criminal investigations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1002. In upholding the district court's decision, we first noted that other circuits had found that the privilege could cover \"sensitive investigative techniques.\" <i>Id.</i> We then recognized a qualified privilege for the \"disclosure of confidential government surveillance information,\" explaining that \"discoverability of this kind of information will enable criminals to frustrate future government surveillance and perhaps unduly jeopardize the security of ongoing investigations.\" <i>Id.</i> We emphasized that the privilege could be overcome by a sufficient showing of need, and thus concluded that courts must determine on a case-by-case basis whether a party has \"demonstrated an authentic `necessity,' given the circumstances, to overbear the qualified privilege.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have explicitly acknowledged a broader privilege for law enforcement materials. The D.C. Circuit has explained that the privilege for investigatory materials is \"rooted in common sense as well as common law,\" noting that \"law enforcement operations cannot be effective if conducted in full public view\" and that the public has an interest in \"minimizing disclosure of documents that would tend to reveal law enforcement investigative techniques or sources.\" <i>Black v. Sheraton Corp. of Am.,</i> 564 F.2d 531, 542, 545 (D.C.Cir.1977). Similarly, in <i>In re Department of Investigation of the City of New York,</i> 856 F.2d 481 (2d Cir.1988), the Second Circuit explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he law enforcement privilege [] has been recognized in the absence of a statutory foundation, and [] is largely incorporated into the various state and federal freedom of information acts. The purpose of this privilege is to prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures, to preserve the confidentiality of sources, to protect witness and law enforcement personnel, to safeguard the privacy of individuals involved in an investigation, and otherwise to prevent interference with an investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 483-84 (citations and footnotes omitted); <i>see also United States v. Amodeo,</i> 44 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir.1995)(citing <i>In re Dep't of Investigation</i>). Most recently, the Fifth Circuit acknowledged \"the existence of a law enforcement privilege beyond that allowed for identities of confidential informants\" in a case involving documents containing \"information about ongoing criminal investigations&#8212;including investigative leads, law enforcement methods and techniques, internal investigative memoranda, and identifying information relating to witnesses and law enforcement personnel, including undercover operatives.\" <i>In re U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> 459 F.3d 565, 569, 568 (5th Cir.2006). The court remanded for the district court to make an in camera determination regarding the privilege, noting that the rationale for such a privilege is \"even more compelling now\" because \"in today's times the compelled production of government documents could impact highly sensitive matters relating to national security.\" <i>Id.</i> at 569.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Puerto Rico has not made a request for information under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the provisions of this statute also provide guidance in determining the appropriate scope of the privilege. The law enforcement exemption to FOIA shields from disclosure documents whose production would, inter alia, \"interfere with enforcement proceedings\" or \"endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 552(b)(7); <i>see also Ctr. for Nat'l Sec. Studies v. U.S. Dep't. of Justice,</i> 331 F.3d 918, 925-26 (D.C.Cir.2003)(explaining that, in enacting 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(7)(A) \"`Congress recognized that law enforcement agencies had legitimate needs to keep certain records confidential, lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations'\" (quoting <i>NLRB v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</i> 437 U.S. 214, 232, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico argues that the law enforcement privilege, whatever its source and scope, must yield to a state's sovereign authority to investigate violations of its criminal laws. However, it cites no case supporting such a sweeping proposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> But the absence of such authority does not minimize the legitimate interests of Puerto Rico in securing information relevant to its criminal investigations. The important questions are how far the law enforcement privilege should extend and how, in the face of Puerto Rico's demand for information, the privilege should be applied in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the persuasive authority from other circuits, the law enforcement exemption set forth in FOIA, and \"the public interest in effective law enforcement,\" <i>Roviaro,</i> 353 U.S. at 59, 77 S.Ct. 623, we deem it appropriate to extend the privilege we previously recognized for \"confidential government surveillance information,\" <i>Cintolo,</i> 818 F.2d at 1002, to \"law enforcement techniques and procedures,\" <i>In re Dep't of Investigation,</i> 856 F.2d at 484.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Indeed, the justification we cited in <i>Cintolo</i>&#8212;that disclosing the location of surveillance information would jeopardize future surveillance operations&#8212; applies similarly to the information about techniques and protocols that Puerto Rico has requested here. Their disclosure would also jeopardize future criminal investigations. We emphasize that this qualified privilege is subject to balancing the federal government's interest in preserving the confidentiality of sensitive law enforcement techniques against the requesting party's interest in disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> That balancing must be done with particular care in situations, such as this one, involving conflicts between the federal and state governments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having recognized, in principle, a qualified privilege for law enforcement techniques and procedures, we turn now to the task of evaluating under the APA the FBI's response to the specific information requests of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Procedural Challenges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we address the substance of the FBI's decision not to disclose the requested materials, we must resolve an array of procedural objections that Puerto Rico has raised to the assertion of privilege in the proceedings below. Puerto Rico first complains that the privilege was not properly invoked because the FBI did not submit an affidavit from the head of the agency, the district court did not perform an in camera review of the materials that were the subject of the subpoena, and the assertion of privilege was not accompanied by the FBI's item-by-item balancing of the harm to federal law enforcement interests and the necessity of the materials to Puerto Rico's investigation. The United States responds that Puerto Rico did not raise these objections in the district court and therefore has waived them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court, Puerto Rico stated, in its opposition to the United States' motion to dismiss, that \"Defendants' failure to properly assert, at the time they decided not to disclose, the list of privileges that they now pretend to raise constitutes a waiver of all such privileges.\" In other words, Puerto Rico insisted that the United States could not offer reasons to the district court for withholding the information that it had not given to Puerto Rico when it denied the Commonwealth's demand for information. In its motion for summary judgment, Puerto Rico further contended that the decision not to release the materials was arbitrary and capricious</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">because it is premised exclusively on a regulation that does not create a privilege. Defendants' wholly conclusory assertion that disclosure of the information is not warranted under the regulations simply lacks any valid explanation for the denial. Defendants did not assert a substantive privilege for the Court to consider, or even offer a valid explanation for the refusal to disclose. Defendants did not even purport to substantiate or justify their denial with an analysis of the pertinent factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico did not, however, identify for the district court's consideration the specific procedures it now requests: an affidavit from the head of the FBI, an in camera review of the materials, and an item-by-item balancing of the interests at stake in disclosure of the materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must also consider the manner in which the United States asserted the privilege. In its October 17, 2005 letter denying the request for information with respect to the Ojeda subpoena, the FBI explained that \"[a] determination has been made not to disclose any of the information, objects and documents requested by the PRDOJ\" because such disclosure \"would involve the conditions enumerated in [28 C.F.R.] &#167; 16.26(b)(5).\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> With respect to the 444 de Diego subpoena, the United States' motion to quash explained that disclosure of the internal protocols \"would reveal investigative and enforcement techniques\" and that disclosure of the identities and official photographs of the FBI agents would violate their privacy rights and \"pose a serious security threat.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Puerto Rico filed its complaint, the United States' motion to dismiss articulated further grounds for the assertion of the law enforcement privilege with respect to the materials requested in the Ojeda subpoena:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person possessing these documents would learn, <i>inter alia,</i> how the FBI goes about capturing a fugitive who is believed to be dangerous, the number and types of personnel used by the FBI in such operations, the way the FBI collects evidence, the FBI's internal operating procedures in a variety of sensitive law enforcement settings, and the way in which law enforcement information (such as the location of Mr. Ojeda Rios) is gathered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States further noted that most of the materials are also protected by the investigatory files privilege, and finally emphasized that the privacy interests of its agents favored nondisclosure of their names and other personal information. It made similar arguments with respect to the materials requested in the 444 de Diego subpoena, explaining that \"the release of internal FBI protocols . . . would reveal law enforcement techniques\" and that \"[t]he release of the identity, rank, and division of the FBI agents could also reveal law enforcement techniques, by revealing the manner in which the FBI staffs these types of operations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the procedures Puerto Rico references for the first time on appeal may enhance the ability of a district court to evaluate fully and fairly the interests at stake in a case such as this. Judging these interests in the abstract seems problematic. Here, however, Puerto Rico failed to request before the district court the procedures it now specifies. This failure constitutes a waiver of any objection premised on the absence of those procedures. <i>See Persson v. Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd.,</i> 330 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.2003). Moreover, the circumstances here mitigate the risk that the absence of such procedures caused an unfair result. The United States clearly and repeatedly asserted the law enforcement privilege as its ground for refusing to disclose the requested information, and it articulated more specific reasons with respect to the various categories of materials. There was no mistaking the basis for the FBI's refusal to provide the information. Finally, as the United States explains, Puerto Rico requested broad categories of information (i.e., all internal FBI protocols relating to certain types of operations). Those generalities did not help Puerto Rico establish the \"authentic `necessity,'\" <i>Cintolo,</i> 818 F.2d at 1002, for the information it sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico also contends that the United States has waived any law enforcement privilege that may exist by disclosing some of the requested information in a detailed, two hundred page report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Again, Puerto Rico failed to raise this objection before the district court, and again Puerto Rico has waived it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> In any event, the claim lacks merit. Courts have held in the context of executive privilege that \"release of a document only waives these privileges for the document or information specifically released, and not for related materials.\" <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> 121 F.3d 729, 741 (D.C.Cir.1997); <i>see also Smith v. Cromer,</i> 159 F.3d 875, 880 (4th Cir.1998)(explaining that \"disclosure of factual information does not effect a waiver of sovereign immunity as to other related matters\"). This limited approach to waiver serves important interests in open government by \"ensur[ing] that agencies do not forego voluntarily disclosing some privileged material out of the fear that by doing so they are exposing other, more sensitive documents.\" <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> 121 F.3d at 741.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States has been reasonably forthcoming in releasing information related to the Ojeda intervention. The FBI allowed Puerto Rico to inspect bulletproof vests, helmets, weapons, and vehicles used during the intervention and the photographs taken before, during, and after the intervention. Moreover, the Office of the Inspector General also released a report detailing the findings of its investigation into the intervention. <i>See supra</i> note 12. It would be illogical to punish the United States for its voluntary disclosure of these materials by also forcing it to disclose other information that it has deemed privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that Puerto Rico's procedural claims lack merit, we turn now to the substance of the FBI's decision to withhold the requested materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ojeda Subpoena</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FBI refused to produce the materials specified in the Ojeda subpoena, which included the \"Operation Order,\" identifying information for the agents involved in the intervention, reports and recordings related to the intervention, and a wide array of information regarding FBI protocols and operating procedures. As its basis for asserting the privilege with respect to this information, the United States explains that the requested materials include information about sensitive law enforcement techniques that must remain confidential to allow the FBI to operate effectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court explained, the disclosure of these materials would reveal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">how the FBI goes about capturing a fugitive who is believed to be dangerous, the number and types of personnel used by the FBI in such operations, the way the FBI collects evidence, the FBI's internal operating procedures in a variety of law enforcement settings, and the way in which law enforcement information is gathered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disclosure of such information has the potential to thwart future FBI operations by publicizing the internal operations of that agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the qualified nature of the privilege, however, the critical question is whether Puerto Rico has shown a necessity for the information sufficient to overcome this qualified privilege. In favor of disclosure, Puerto Rico's chief argument is its interest in asserting its sovereign authority to investigate and prosecute its criminal laws. It explains that such authority is constitutional in nature, and thus deserves greater weight in our balancing calculus. It also emphasizes that no alternative means exists to obtain the information it seeks. Finally, Puerto Rico contends that an overbroad reading of the privilege is tantamount to granting federal officers immunity from even preliminary criminal investigations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the United States first explains that the balancing of interests typically takes place in the course of underlying criminal or civil litigation, in which the court must weigh the policy of the privilege against the particular litigation need of a party. Here, however, there is no underlying litigation; the \"need\" is Puerto Rico's assertion that the requested materials might be of aid to a criminal investigation. The United States also notes that the Department of Justice has already undertaken an investigation of the intervention and published a detailed report of its findings. Finally, in response to Puerto Rico's claim that failure to release the information would foreclose investigation of the officers, the United States emphasizes that federal officials are generally immune from state prosecution for actions performed within the scope of their official duties, and thus the privilege would merely reflect an existing immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to this last point, the contentions of the parties deserve some elaboration. Courts have explained that \"Supremacy Clause immunity governs the extent to which states may impose civil or criminal liability on federal officials for alleged violations of state law committed in the course of their federal duties.\" <i>Wyoming</i> <i>v. Livingston,</i> 443 F.3d 1211, 1213 (10th Cir.2006). Such disputes \"permit of no easy answers,\" but \"the supremacy of federal law precludes the use of state prosecutorial power to frustrate the legitimate and reasonable exercise of federal authority.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, federal officials are generally granted Supremacy Clause immunity from state prosecution for actions taken in the course of their official duties. <i>See, e.g., In re Neagle,</i> 135 U.S. 1, 75, 10 S.Ct. 658, 34 L.Ed. 55 (1890)(U.S. Marshal immune from state murder prosecution); <i>Livingston,</i> 443 F.3d 1211 (10th Cir.2006)(federal officials immune from state prosecution for trespass); <i>New York v. Tanella,</i> 374 F.3d 141, 142 (2d Cir.2004)(DEA agent who shot an unarmed suspect immune from state prosecution). However, such immunity is limited to actions that were \"reasonably necessary for the performance of [the officials'] duties.\" <i>Livingston,</i> 443 F.3d at 1227-28. In the present situation, the privilege that the United States now asserts could conceivably extend beyond the scope of the immunity actually available to the officers if the privilege was used to withhold information about acts not taken in the course of their official duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sovereign interests at stake on both sides&#8212;Puerto Rico's interest in enforcing its criminal laws and the United States' interest in protecting the internal operations of the FBI&#8212;make our balancing of the interests particularly difficult in this case. We recognize that any decision will necessarily compromise one of these interests to some degree. On balance, however, we conclude that the FBI's decision not to release the requested materials was reasonable under the deferential standard of review prescribed by the APA. The FBI has a legitimate interest in maintaining the secrecy of sensitive law enforcement techniques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that, in addition to general information about FBI protocols and techniques, Puerto Rico also has requested names and other personal information about individual FBI agents. Superficially, this identifying information seems distinct from information about FBI protocols and techniques involved in the shooting death of Ojeda. However, the individuals at issue are not suspected of criminal activity unrelated to the operation that implicates those protocols and investigative techniques. Obtaining this identifying information would allow Puerto Rico to interview the individuals in question. Inevitably, those interviews would involve inquiries relating to the FBI protocols and techniques that fall within the privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as the district court noted in its opinion, disclosing certain information about the agents \"would reveal the number and types of personnel used by the FBI\" to conduct operations such as the Ojeda intervention. If agents' names, official photographs and other personal information are made available, as requested by Puerto Rico, these agents will be less successful at conducting covert operations. Finally, courts have explained that \"individuals, including government employees and officials, have privacy interests in the dissemination of their names. Public disclosure of the names of FBI agents and other law enforcement personnel . . . could subject them to embarrassment and harassment in the conduct of their official duties and personal affairs.\" <i>Massey v. FBI,</i> 3 F.3d 620, 624 (2d Cir.1993) (citation omitted)(upholding the nondisclosure of FBI agents' names under Exemption 7 of FOIA); <i>see also Jones v. FBI,</i> 41 F.3d 238, 246-47 (6th Cir.1994)(holding that \"federal law enforcement officials `have the right to be protected against public disclosure of their participation in law enforcement investigations'\" (quoting <i>Ingle v. Dep't of</i> <i>Justice,</i> 698 F.2d 259, 269 (6th Cir.1983))); <i>Lesar v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 636 F.2d 472, 487 (D.C.Cir.1980)(\"As several courts have recognized, [FBI] agents have a legitimate interest in preserving the secrecy of matters that conceivably could subject them to annoyance or harassment in either their official or private lives.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge Puerto Rico's argument that the FBI's decision to withhold the information raises the possibility that a federal agency may thwart state criminal proceedings against one of its own employees by refusing to disclose information that might lead to prosecution. That is a troubling possibility. As we have explained, although federal officials generally receive immunity from prosecution, such immunity obtains only when they are acting within the scope of official duties. The FBI's refusal to produce the requested materials may preclude a determination of whether the actions at issue here were within that scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, other circumstances present here minimize the likelihood that wrongdoing was improperly concealed. First, the FBI acceded to some of Puerto Rico's requests for information, agreeing to allow Puerto Rico to inspect most of the physical evidence from the intervention and photographs of the premises taken before, during, and after the intervention. Moreover, the Office of the Inspector General (\"OIG\")&#8212;an entity entirely independent from the FBI&#8212;conducted a searching investigation of the events and made public a detailed two hundred page report of its findings. <i>See supra</i> note 12. In preparing the report, the OIG interviewed over sixty individuals, including all of the agents who planned, participated in, or had knowledge of the operation; reviewed thousands of pages of documents, including operation plans and orders, investigative files, intelligence reports, and FBI policies and procedures; reviewed forensic reports; and consulted with experts in tactical police operations. The report \"identified a number of deficiencies in the FBI's conduct of the Ojeda surveillance and arrest operation\" and made \"ten recommendations dealing with these findings\"; however, it \"did not conclude that any of the actions of FBI officials constituted misconduct.\" We acknowledge that these safeguards are an imperfect substitute for Puerto Rico's ability to obtain information to conduct its own investigation; however, the availability of this substitute reinforces our conclusion that the FBI's decision to withhold the other materials was not arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find no error in the FBI's refusal to release the information Puerto Rico requested in the Ojeda subpoena.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. 444 de Diego Subpoena</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the APA, a party must obtain a \"final agency decision\" prior to seeking judicial review of an agency action. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 704; <i>Bennett v. Spear,</i> 520 U.S. 154, 177-78, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997). Here, Puerto Rico served the 444 de Diego subpoena on the FBI on February 20, 2006. The FBI then filed a motion to quash the subpoena on February 28. Puerto Rico contends that this motion to quash the 444 de Diego subpoena was the equivalent of a final agency action, while the United States asserts that it was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opinion ruling in favor of the United States, the district court held that no final agency action had taken place. It explained that, at the March 2 hearing on the United States' motion to quash, Puerto Rico stated that \"right now there is no intention to file any contempt proceedings\" and that it \"currently was going to be evaluating which is the next step in order to continue that investigation; if the step is administrative, if it is federal judicial or if it is state judicial.\" The district court then advised Puerto Rico that it must exhaust its administrative remedies and obtain a final agency action in order to file suit. Puerto Rico's next action, however, was to file the complaint in this action on March 23. Consequently, the district court explained that Puerto Rico \"has not submitted anything into the record indicating that the government made a final decision,\" implicitly holding that the motion to quash could not itself constitute a final agency action, and thus no final agency action had taken place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether the United States' motion to quash the subpoena was final agency action is a thorny one. Courts have held that \"an agency's refusal to comply with a subpoena constitutes `final agency action . . . ripe for . . . review under the APA.'\" <i>Yousuf v. Samantar,</i> 451 F.3d 248, 251 (D.C.Cir.2006)(quoting <i>COMSAT Corp. v. Nat'l Sci. Found.,</i> 190 F.3d 269, 275 (4th Cir.1999)). Indeed, in <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 170 F.3d 431, 434 n. 4 (4th Cir. 1999), \"the government asserted and [the party requesting information] did not dispute that the United States Attorney's response to a subpoena constitutes final agency action for purposes of the APA.\" No court has held, however, that filing a motion to quash is the equivalent of a refusal to comply. Moreover, at the hearing on the motion to quash, Puerto Rico's acknowledgment that it was exploring other avenues of obtaining the materials it had requested, including administrative avenues, suggests that Puerto Rico itself did not believe that it had obtained final agency action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether there was final agency action implicates the jurisdiction of the federal courts, and such final action is normally a prerequisite to judicial review. <i>Cobell v. Kempthorne,</i> 455 F.3d 301, 304 (D.C.Cir.2006). However, we have held that cases exist in which we may exercise \"hypothetical jurisdiction\"&#8212;that is, cases \"in which we may&#8212;and should&#8212;bypass the jurisdictional question\" because the jurisdictional issue is complex but the outcome on the merits is straightforward. <i>See, e.g., Royal Siam Corp. v. Chertoff,</i> 484 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir.2007). In exercising such hypothetical jurisdiction, \"we have distinguished between Article III jurisdiction (which may never be bypassed) and statutory jurisdiction (which may occasionally be bypassed).\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the question of whether there has been final agency action is one that implicates statutory, rather than constitutional, jurisdiction. <i>See Air Brake Systems, Inc. v. Mineta,</i> 357 F.3d 632, 638 (6th Cir.2004)(\"[T]he jurisdictional question here is one of statutory interpretation: [was there] `final' agency action for which no other adequate judicial remedy exists?\"); <i>Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. EPA,</i> 801 F.2d 430, 442 (D.C.Cir.1986)(discussing \"the statutory jurisdictional issue of whether [there was] `final agency action'\"). Thus, given the difficulty of the jurisdictional issue here, we conclude that it is appropriate to bypass that issue and proceed to the more straightforward task of resolving the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The materials requested by Puerto Rico in the 444 de Diego subpoena are substantially similar to the materials already discussed with respect to the Ojeda subpoena: (1) the name, rank, division, address, and telephone number of two FBI agents; (2) an official photograph of each of the two FBI agents; and (3) internal FBI protocols relating to the use of force and pepper spray. These materials fall within the scope of the law enforcement privilege for the same reasons that the names and personal information of FBI agents and the internal FBI protocols requested in the Ojeda subpoena fell within that privilege, and Puerto Rico has offered no more compelling reasons for disclosure in the case of the materials requested in the 444 de Diego subpoena. Thus, assuming that Puerto Rico obtained final agency action with respect to its request for these materials, the FBI was neither arbitrary nor capricious in withholding such information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful review, we conclude that Puerto Rico cannot assert a nonstatutory cause of action, grounded in its constitutional sovereign authority to enforce its criminal laws, to obtain the materials it seeks. Instead, we find Puerto Rico's request for these materials subject to review under the APA. Moreover, we hold that a qualified privilege applies to the law enforcement materials Puerto Rico has requested here: sensitive law enforcement protocols and techniques and the names and other personal information of the FBI agents involved in the two operations. In light of this privilege and the applicable <i>Touhy</i> regulations, we conclude that the FBI's response to the Ojeda subpoena and the 444 de Diego subpoena was neither arbitrary nor capricious.

The Court explained that a critical factor in allowing the union president to bring suit despite the lack of explicit statutory authorization was that \"`absence of jurisdiction of the federal courts' would mean `a sacrifice or obliteration of a right which Congress' has given professional employees, for there is no other means, within their control to protect and enforce that right.\" <i>Id.</i> at 190, 79 S.Ct. 180 (quoting <i>Switchmen's Union of N.

We conclude that it does not. Instead, under the circumstances of this case, Puerto Rico must pursue the information it seeks under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-706. Further, in keeping with persuasive authority from other circuits, we hold that the FBI may assert a qualified privilege to protect sensitive law enforcement techniques and procedures from disclosure. Having considered the application of that privilege in this case, we affirm the decision of the district court holding that the FBI did not err in withholding the requested information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal involves two consolidated district court cases, Nos. 06-1306 and 06-1305,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> arising from subpoenas for FBI records issued by the Puerto Rico Department of Justice (\"PRDOJ\"). The relevant facts are largely undisputed; where disputes exist, we note them but find that they are immaterial to our disposition of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Case No. 06-1306: Ojeda Subpoena</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1970s, Filiberto Ojeda R&#237;os helped found the Macheteros, an organization that advocates independence for Puerto Rico through armed struggle against the United States government. In 1983, the Macheteros stole $7.1 million from a bank in Connecticut. The FBI apprehended Ojeda in 1985, and, during his arrest, Ojeda shot an FBI agent in the face, permanently blinding the agent in one eye. Ojeda was acquitted for assaulting the agent following a trial in Puerto Rico. He then skipped bail while on trial for bank robbery and was sentenced in absentia in 1992. Fifteen years later, in September 2005, the FBI attempted to apprehend Ojeda at his residence in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico. During this intervention, Ojeda shot two FBI agents and was himself fatally wounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRDOJ commenced an investigation into the intervention. On October 4, 2005, a PRDOJ prosecutor issued a subpoena pursuant to title 34, section 1476 of the Puerto Rico Code commanding then United States Attorney Humberto Garcia to produce materials including: (1) a copy of the \"Operation Order\" (a document establishing the plan or rules of engagement for the FBI intervention at Ojeda's residence); (2) the name, rank, division, address, and telephone numbers of every person who participated in or made decisions regarding the intervention, as well as an organizational diagram showing these individuals' rank on the line of command; (3) various equipment, including, but not limited to, all bullet-proof vests, helmets, weapons, and vehicles involved in the intervention; (4) any inventory of the property occupied during the intervention; (5) copies of any expert reports relating to the intervention or Ojeda's death; (6) copies of any audio or video recordings of the events relating to the intervention; (7) copies of all photographs relating to the intervention; and (8) copies of any relevant general FBI protocols, including those relating to violent interventions and potentially deadly force. In subsequent correspondence, the PRDOJ explained that the requests related to a \"criminal investigation\" that it was conducting into Ojeda's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated October 17, the FBI declined to produce the requested materials, explaining that its internal regulations prohibited disclosure of records compiled for law enforcement purposes. The letter stated that the denial of the PRDOJ's request was a \"final agency decision which may be reviewed by the United States District Court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further communications among the PRDOJ, FBI, and United States Attorney's Office, the U.S. Attorney indicated by letter dated November 9 that the FBI would allow the PRDOJ to examine some of the items listed in the subpoena, including the bulletproof vests, helmets, weapons, and vehicles used during the intervention and the photographs taken before, during, and after the intervention. The FBI stipulated that it would retain official custody of these items and that an FBI official would be present during the inspection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRDOJ initially acceded to these terms, but subsequently reiterated the substance of its original demand in a letter dated January 20, 2006. The FBI refused this demand, again noting that its refusal constituted \"final agency action.\" The PRDOJ filed suit in March 2006 to compel disclosure of the requested materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Case No. 06-1305: 444 de Diego Subpoena</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using information obtained from Ojeda's residence to establish probable cause, the FBI obtained a search warrant for a residential condominium located at 444 de Diego in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The FBI executed the warrant in February 2006, and a large group of protesters, reporters, and members of the general public gathered outside. The United States asserts that some of these individuals breached an established police line, and an FBI agent used pepper spray to keep people behind the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRDOJ issued subpoenas to U.S. Attorney Garcia and to Luis Fraticelli, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI San Juan Field Office, requesting three categories of materials: (1) the name, rank, division, address, and telephone number of the two FBI agents who allegedly used pepper spray and whose photos were attached to the subpoena; (2) official photographs of these two FBI agents; and (3) internal FBI protocols relating to the use of force and pepper spray. The PRDOJ explained that the subpoenas were \"part of the criminal investigation\" of the PRDOJ into \"the conduct of FBI agents during the execution of a search warrant\" at 444 de Diego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FBI moved to quash the subpoenas in federal district court. After the PRDOJ indicated, at a hearing on March 2, that \"it was actually evaluating other avenues through which to get the information about the federal agents, and that it had no serious intention of enforcing the challenged subpoenas,\" the district court concluded that the subpoenas were \"effectively mooted.\" The court thus withheld action on the motion to quash. Subsequently, on March 23, the PRDOJ filed suit to compel the release of the requested records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Proceedings Before the District Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's complaint in No. 06-1306 sought a declaratory judgment recognizing its right \"to conduct a full investigation into the events leading to the death of Mr. Ojeda Rios,\" and an order \"permanently enjoining Defendants from withholding any information relevant to the Commonwealth's investigation and ordering Defendants to comply with the Commonwealth's requests and produce the subpoenaed information, objects and documents[.]\" The complaint in No. 06-1305 sought identical relief with respect to Puerto Rico's \"investigation into the events allegedly leading to the injury of members of the press and/or the public . . . on February 10, 2006, due to the alleged use of excessive force (including the alleged use of pepper spray) by FBI agents[.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each complaint, Puerto Rico articulated five causes of action which entitled it to its requested relief. First, it stated that the FBI's decisions were not premised upon any federal regulation or statute. Second, it stated that the FBI's decisions exceeded any authority granted by the Housekeeping Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 301. Third, it asserted a nonstatutory cause of action to vindicate its constitutional sovereign authority to enforce its criminal laws by obtaining the requested information. Fourth, it contended that APA review was \"unwarranted\" because such review \"would impose an undue burden on the exercise of sovereign criminal authority that would run afoul of the Tenth Amendment.\" Finally, Puerto Rico claimed that, even if reviewed under the APA, the FBI's decision to withhold the information was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court consolidated the cases, the United States moved to dismiss, and Puerto Rico filed a motion for summary judgment. After considering these motions, the district court concluded that Puerto Rico had failed to establish a basis for its requested relief. The court rejected Puerto Rico's first two causes of action, explaining that, although the FBI's internal regulations did not create a substantive right to withhold the information, the regulations incorporated federal common law establishing a privilege for law enforcement materials. The court also dismissed Puerto Rico's third cause of action, holding that Puerto Rico could not assert a nonstatutory cause of action, based on its sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws, to obtain the requested materials. The court thus concluded that Puerto Rico's request was subject to judicial review under the provisions of the APA, thereby rejecting Puerto Rico's fourth cause of action. Finally, on Puerto Rico's fifth and final cause of action, the court applied the APA's framework for review. Noting the FBI's interest in maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive law enforcement techniques, it found that the FBI's decision with respect to the Ojeda subpoena was neither arbitrary nor capricious. With respect to the 444 de Diego subpoena, the court concluded that there had been no final agency action, and thus the FBI's failure to release the information was not subject to judicial review. In sum, the court dismissed Puerto Rico's first through fourth causes of action, and, on the fifth cause of action, denied Puerto Rico's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Puerto Rico first contends that its sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws provides it with a nonstatutory cause of action to obtain the information it seeks from the FBI. It explains that, under our federal constitutional system, a state has a \"judicially cognizable interest in the preservation of [its] own sovereignty,\" which includes its \"ability to punish wrongdoers and enforce its criminal laws\" and, more specifically, \"to prosecute federal agents if they have acted unlawfully in carrying out their duties.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Consequently, \"any impermissible federal interference with such <i>constitutional</i> sovereignty is amenable to resolution by a federal district court under its equitable powers.\" Puerto Rico concludes that \"[a] direct cause of action for equitable relief is the only avenue to properly vindicate a State's constitutional claim of sovereign[] authority to enforce its criminal laws.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Puerto Rico acknowledges that agency decisions are normally reviewed under the APA, it argues that such review is inappropriate because: (1) \"[i]t is unfounded to subject a State's sovereign penal authority to an administrative process that will be followed by an extremely limited form of judicial review\"; (2) such review will place Puerto Rico \"in a worse position to obtain information than private parties\" who can sue the federal government and request discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26; and (3) APA review would allow the federal government to \"commandeer[] state prosecutorial powers by deciding what information the State should consider in its investigations.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in all suits against the federal government, we must first consider whether sovereign immunity bars this claim. \"It is long settled law that, as an attribute of sovereign immunity, the United States and its agencies may not be subject to judicial proceedings unless there has been an express waiver of that immunity.\" <i>EPA v.

We are not suggesting that the Supremacy Clause alone provides the basis for rejecting Puerto Rico's theory of a nonstatutory cause of action to obtain law enforcement information from the FBI. But Puerto Rico portrays its sovereign authority over law enforcement as paramount in the analysis. That cannot be so. The Supremacy Clause reminds us that the federal government also has a critical interest in carrying out its own law enforcement responsibilities. In most instances, federal and state law enforcement interests are complementary. However, when a state's interest in investigating the agents of a federal law enforcement entity arguably conflicts with that federal entity's need to protect certain information relating to law enforcement activities, Congress has provided a mechanism&#8212;the APA&#8212;for resolving these conflicts. Puerto Rico has not convinced us that this congressional choice was somehow constitutionally insufficient and hence Puerto Rico must have a nonstatutory cause of action to vindicate its law enforcement interests. To the contrary, for the reasons we have expressed, we conclude that the judicial review provided by the APA for the denial of information by a federal agency is compatible with Puerto Rico's sovereign authority under the Constitution for the enforcement of its criminal laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the APA, we will overturn the FBI's decision not to release the requested information only if it was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A).

We emphasize that this qualified privilege is subject to balancing the federal government's interest in preserving the confidentiality of sensitive law enforcement techniques against the requesting party's interest in disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> That balancing must be done with particular care in situations, such as this one, involving conflicts between the federal and state governments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having recognized, in principle, a qualified privilege for law enforcement techniques and procedures, we turn now to the task of evaluating under the APA the FBI's response to the specific information requests of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Procedural Challenges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we address the substance of the FBI's decision not to disclose the requested materials, we must resolve an array of procedural objections that Puerto Rico has raised to the assertion of privilege in the proceedings below. Puerto Rico first complains that the privilege was not properly invoked because the FBI did not submit an affidavit from the head of the agency, the district court did not perform an in camera review of the materials that were the subject of the subpoena, and the assertion of privilege was not accompanied by the FBI's item-by-item balancing of the harm to federal law enforcement interests and the necessity of the materials to Puerto Rico's investigation. The United States responds that Puerto Rico did not raise these objections in the district court and therefore has waived them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court, Puerto Rico stated, in its opposition to the United States' motion to dismiss, that \"Defendants' failure to properly assert, at the time they decided not to disclose, the list of privileges that they now pretend to raise constitutes a waiver of all such privileges.\" In other words, Puerto Rico insisted that the United States could not offer reasons to the district court for withholding the information that it had not given to Puerto Rico when it denied the Commonwealth's demand for information. In its motion for summary judgment, Puerto Rico further contended that the decision not to release the materials was arbitrary and capricious</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">because it is premised exclusively on a regulation that does not create a privilege. Defendants' wholly conclusory assertion that disclosure of the information is not warranted under the regulations simply lacks any valid explanation for the denial. Defendants did not assert a substantive privilege for the Court to consider, or even offer a valid explanation for the refusal to disclose. Defendants did not even purport to substantiate or justify their denial with an analysis of the pertinent factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico did not, however, identify for the district court's consideration the specific procedures it now requests: an affidavit from the head of the FBI, an in camera review of the materials, and an item-by-item balancing of the interests at stake in disclosure of the materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must also consider the manner in which the United States asserted the privilege. In its October 17, 2005 letter denying the request for information with respect to the Ojeda subpoena, the FBI explained that \"[a] determination has been made not to disclose any of the information, objects and documents requested by the PRDOJ\" because such disclosure \"would involve the conditions enumerated in [28 C.F.R.] &#167; 16.26(b)(5).\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> With respect to the 444 de Diego subpoena, the United States' motion to quash explained that disclosure of the internal protocols \"would reveal investigative and enforcement techniques\" and that disclosure of the identities and official photographs of the FBI agents would violate their privacy rights and \"pose a serious security threat.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Puerto Rico filed its complaint, the United States' motion to dismiss articulated further grounds for the assertion of the law enforcement privilege with respect to the materials requested in the Ojeda subpoena:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person possessing these documents would learn, <i>inter alia,</i> how the FBI goes about capturing a fugitive who is believed to be dangerous, the number and types of personnel used by the FBI in such operations, the way the FBI collects evidence, the FBI's internal operating procedures in a variety of sensitive law enforcement settings, and the way in which law enforcement information (such as the location of Mr. Ojeda Rios) is gathered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States further noted that most of the materials are also protected by the investigatory files privilege, and finally emphasized that the privacy interests of its agents favored nondisclosure of their names and other personal information. It made similar arguments with respect to the materials requested in the 444 de Diego subpoena, explaining that \"the release of internal FBI protocols . . . would reveal law enforcement techniques\" and that \"[t]he release of the identity, rank, and division of the FBI agents could also reveal law enforcement techniques, by revealing the manner in which the FBI staffs these types of operations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the procedures Puerto Rico references for the first time on appeal may enhance the ability of a district court to evaluate fully and fairly the interests at stake in a case such as this. Judging these interests in the abstract seems problematic. Here, however, Puerto Rico failed to request before the district court the procedures it now specifies. This failure constitutes a waiver of any objection premised on the absence of those procedures. <i>See Persson v. Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200478\"><a href=\"/opinion/200478/persson-v-scotia-prince-cruise/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2003). Moreover, the circumstances here mitigate the risk that the absence of such procedures caused an unfair result. The United States clearly and repeatedly asserted the law enforcement privilege as its ground for refusing to disclose the requested information, and it articulated more specific reasons with respect to the various categories of materials. There was no mistaking the basis for the FBI's refusal to provide the information. Finally, as the United States explains, Puerto Rico requested broad categories of information (i.e., all internal FBI protocols relating to certain types of operations). Those generalities did not help Puerto Rico establish the \"authentic `necessity,'\" <i>Cintolo,</i> 818 F.2d at 1002, for the information it sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico also contends that the United States has waived any law enforcement privilege that may exist by disclosing some of the requested information in a detailed, two hundred page report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Again, Puerto Rico failed to raise this objection before the district court, and again Puerto Rico has waived it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> In any event, the claim lacks merit.

This limited approach to waiver serves important interests in open government by \"ensur[ing] that agencies do not forego voluntarily disclosing some privileged material out of the fear that by doing so they are exposing other, more sensitive documents.\" <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> 121 F.3d at 741.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States has been reasonably forthcoming in releasing information related to the Ojeda intervention. The FBI allowed Puerto Rico to inspect bulletproof vests, helmets, weapons, and vehicles used during the intervention and the photographs taken before, during, and after the intervention. Moreover, the Office of the Inspector General also released a report detailing the findings of its investigation into the intervention. <i>See supra</i> note 12. It would be illogical to punish the United States for its voluntary disclosure of these materials by also forcing it to disclose other information that it has deemed privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that Puerto Rico's procedural claims lack merit, we turn now to the substance of the FBI's decision to withhold the requested materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ojeda Subpoena</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FBI refused to produce the materials specified in the Ojeda subpoena, which included the \"Operation Order,\" identifying information for the agents involved in the intervention, reports and recordings related to the intervention, and a wide array of information regarding FBI protocols and operating procedures. As its basis for asserting the privilege with respect to this information, the United States explains that the requested materials include information about sensitive law enforcement techniques that must remain confidential to allow the FBI to operate effectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court explained, the disclosure of these materials would reveal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">how the FBI goes about capturing a fugitive who is believed to be dangerous, the number and types of personnel used by the FBI in such operations, the way the FBI collects evidence, the FBI's internal operating procedures in a variety of law enforcement settings, and the way in which law enforcement information is gathered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disclosure of such information has the potential to thwart future FBI operations by publicizing the internal operations of that agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the qualified nature of the privilege, however, the critical question is whether Puerto Rico has shown a necessity for the information sufficient to overcome this qualified privilege. In favor of disclosure, Puerto Rico's chief argument is its interest in asserting its sovereign authority to investigate and prosecute its criminal laws. It explains that such authority is constitutional in nature, and thus deserves greater weight in our balancing calculus. It also emphasizes that no alternative means exists to obtain the information it seeks. Finally, Puerto Rico contends that an overbroad reading of the privilege is tantamount to granting federal officers immunity from even preliminary criminal investigations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the United States first explains that the balancing of interests typically takes place in the course of underlying criminal or civil litigation, in which the court must weigh the policy of the privilege against the particular litigation need of a party. Here, however, there is no underlying litigation; the \"need\" is Puerto Rico's assertion that the requested materials might be of aid to a criminal investigation. The United States also notes that the Department of Justice has already undertaken an investigation of the intervention and published a detailed report of its findings. Finally, in response to Puerto Rico's claim that failure to release the information would foreclose investigation of the officers, the United States emphasizes that federal officials are generally immune from state prosecution for actions performed within the scope of their official duties, and thus the privilege would merely reflect an existing immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to this last point, the contentions of the parties deserve some elaboration. Courts have explained that \"Supremacy Clause immunity governs the extent to which states may impose civil or criminal liability on federal officials for alleged violations of state law committed in the course of their federal duties.\" <i>Wyoming</i> <i>v. Livingston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167302\"><a href=\"/opinion/167302/state-of-wyoming-v-livingston/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></a></span>, 1213 (10th Cir.2006). Such disputes \"permit of no easy answers,\" but \"the supremacy of federal law precludes the use of state prosecutorial power to frustrate the legitimate and reasonable exercise of federal authority.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, federal officials are generally granted Supremacy Clause immunity from state prosecution for actions taken in the course of their official duties. <i>See, e.g., In re Neagle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92766\"><a href=\"/opinion/92766/in-re-neagle/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 75, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, such immunity is limited to actions that were \"reasonably necessary for the performance of [the officials'] duties.\" <i>Livingston,</i> 443 F.3d at 1227-28. In the present situation, the privilege that the United States now asserts could conceivably extend beyond the scope of the immunity actually available to the officers if the privilege was used to withhold information about acts not taken in the course of their official duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sovereign interests at stake on both sides&#8212;Puerto Rico's interest in enforcing its criminal laws and the United States' interest in protecting the internal operations of the FBI&#8212;make our balancing of the interests particularly difficult in this case. We recognize that any decision will necessarily compromise one of these interests to some degree. On balance, however, we conclude that the FBI's decision not to release the requested materials was reasonable under the deferential standard of review prescribed by the APA. The FBI has a legitimate interest in maintaining the secrecy of sensitive law enforcement techniques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that, in addition to general information about FBI protocols and techniques, Puerto Rico also has requested names and other personal information about individual FBI agents. Superficially, this identifying information seems distinct from information about FBI protocols and techniques involved in the shooting death of Ojeda. However, the individuals at issue are not suspected of criminal activity unrelated to the operation that implicates those protocols and investigative techniques. Obtaining this identifying information would allow Puerto Rico to interview the individuals in question. Inevitably, those interviews would involve inquiries relating to the FBI protocols and techniques that fall within the privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as the district court noted in its opinion, disclosing certain information about the agents \"would reveal the number and types of personnel used by the FBI\" to conduct operations such as the Ojeda intervention. If agents' names, official photographs and other personal information are made available, as requested by Puerto Rico, these agents will be less successful at conducting covert operations. Finally, courts have explained that \"individuals, including government employees and officials, have privacy interests in the dissemination of their names.

That is a troubling possibility. As we have explained, although federal officials generally receive immunity from prosecution, such immunity obtains only when they are acting within the scope of official duties.

First, the FBI acceded to some of Puerto Rico's requests for information, agreeing to allow Puerto Rico to inspect most of the physical evidence from the intervention and photographs of the premises taken before, during, and after the intervention. Moreover, the Office of the Inspector General (\"OIG\")&#8212;an entity entirely independent from the FBI&#8212;conducted a searching investigation of the events and made public a detailed two hundred page report of its findings. <i>See supra</i> note 12. In preparing the report, the OIG interviewed over sixty individuals, including all of the agents who planned, participated in, or had knowledge of the operation; reviewed thousands of pages of documents, including operation plans and orders, investigative files, intelligence reports, and FBI policies and procedures; reviewed forensic reports; and consulted with experts in tactical police operations. The report \"identified a number of deficiencies in the FBI's conduct of the Ojeda surveillance and arrest operation\" and made \"ten recommendations dealing with these findings\"; however, it \"did not conclude that any of the actions of FBI officials constituted misconduct.\" We acknowledge that these safeguards are an imperfect substitute for Puerto Rico's ability to obtain information to conduct its own investigation; however, the availability of this substitute reinforces our conclusion that the FBI's decision to withhold the other materials was not arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find no error in the FBI's refusal to release the information Puerto Rico requested in the Ojeda subpoena.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. 444 de Diego Subpoena</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the APA, a party must obtain a \"final agency decision\" prior to seeking judicial review of an agency action. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 704; <i>Bennett v.

Puerto Rico's next action, however, was to file the complaint in this action on March 23. Consequently, the district court explained that Puerto Rico \"has not submitted anything into the record indicating that the government made a final decision,\" implicitly holding that the motion to quash could not itself constitute a final agency action, and thus no final agency action had taken place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether the United States' motion to quash the subpoena was final agency action is a thorny one.

These materials fall within the scope of the law enforcement privilege for the same reasons that the names and personal information of FBI agents and the internal FBI protocols requested in the Ojeda subpoena fell within that privilege, and Puerto Rico has offered no more compelling reasons for disclosure in the case of the materials requested in the 444 de Diego subpoena.

In light of this privilege and the applicable <i>Touhy</i> regulations, we conclude that the FBI's response to the Ojeda subpoena and the 444 de Diego subpoena was neither arbitrary nor capricious.

As the district court found, the materials sought by Puerto Rico and withheld by the Department would reveal the identities of FBI agents, \"how the FBI goes about capturing a fugitive who is believed to be dangerous, the number and types of personnel used by the FBI in such operations, the way the FBI collects evidence, the FBI's internal operating procedures in a variety of law enforcement settings, and the way in which law enforcement information is gathered.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That in this case the materials might be protected under the federal law enforcement privilege is icing on the cake, but the Department's action would be reasonable even without the privilege. When the United States tries a defendant in its own courts, no issue of sovereign immunity is presented: disclosure obligations depend on federal criminal rules and precedents and, ordinarily, material in government hands must be produced in response to such requirements or a defense subpoena <i>unless</i> privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, when Puerto Rico is seeking materials in an action not otherwise properly in federal court, the United States has no independent obligation to turn over government materials regardless of whether they are privileged; at most, it must avoid action that is arbitrary and capricious and can do so on the basis of a reasonable general policy. The Department's refusal to release the information in this case was not arbitrary and capricious and that is the end of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> <i>See, e.g., United States v.
