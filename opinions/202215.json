John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Hug,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Christopher K. MacLean, for appellant.\n     William R. Fisher, Assistant Attorney General, with whom G.\nSteven Rowe, Attorney General of Maine, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 15, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n     Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              HUG,    Circuit    Judge.         Michael    McConkie      appeals    the\n\nDistrict Court’s decision to grant summary judgment to Maine State\n\nPolice Detective Scott Nichols.             In his First Amended Complaint,\n\nMcConkie alleged that he was entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1983 and 1988 because Nichols violated his constitutional right\n\nto substantive due process in the course of questioning him about\n\nsuspected sexual abuse of a ten-year-old child.                          The District\n\nCourt granted Nichols summary judgment on the ground that no\n\nreasonable     factfinder       could    find     that    Nichols’s      conduct    was\n\nconscience-shocking.        We affirm.\n\n              McConkie’s claim arose out of a tape-recorded, non-\n\ncustodial interview with Detective Nichols on June 23, 1998.\n\nNichols had set up the interview after speaking to a boy who said\n\nthat McConkie had sexually abused him.                     The transcript of the\n\ninterview indicates that Nichols was aware of McConkie’s criminal\n\nhistory and that McConkie acknowledged to Nichols that he had been\n\nplaced   in    an     intense   therapy    program        because   of    his   sexual\n\nbehavior.\n\n              During the interview, Nichols told McConkie that \"this\n\nstuff    stays      confidential,       especially       because    a    juvenile   is\n\ninvolved.\"       Later in the interview, McConkie admitted to sexual\n\ncontact with the child.\n\n              These     admissions       were     introduced        at     McConkie’s\n\nsubsequent criminal trial, but McConkie does not base his claims\n\n                                          -2-\n\fon the use of the admissions; rather, he bases his claims on the\n\ntactics Nichols used in the interview.       In particular, in his\n\nFirst    Amended   Complaint,    McConkie   alleged   that   Nichols\n\nintentionally deceived him about his Fifth Amendment right against\n\nself-incrimination when he made the statement that the information\n\nwould stay confidential.     He further alleged that this violated\n\nhis substantive due process rights and that he therefore was\n\nentitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.\n\n           Nichols denied the material allegations of the complaint\n\nand asserted affirmative defenses, including that his conduct did\n\nnot shock the conscience.    On February 3, 2005, Nichols moved to\n\ndismiss the First Amended Complaint and, alternatively, moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that McConkie had not alleged\n\nconscience-shocking conduct, an essential element of a substantive\n\ndue process claim.     The judge ultimately denied Nichols’s motion\n\nto dismiss, but granted Nichols summary judgment on the ground\n\nthat, as a matter of law, Nichols’s conduct did not shock the\n\nconscience.\n\n           We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.    We\n\nreview a District Court’s grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\nviewing all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty and granting all reasonable inferences in that party’s\n\nfavor.   Torres v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).     Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fgenuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.          Id.\n\n            McConkie rests his claims solely on substantive due\n\nprocess grounds, not on the Fifth Amendment.            When a case, like\n\nthis one, involves an alleged abuse of power by the executive\n\nbranch, the claim is cognizable as a violation of substantive due\n\nprocess “only when it is so extreme and egregious as to shock the\n\ncontemporary conscience.”       DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 F.3d 112,\n\n118 (1st Cir. 2005).     “The ‘shock the conscience’ inquiry requires\n\na comprehensive analysis of the attendant circumstances before any\n\nabuse of official power is condemned as conscience-shocking.”            Id.\n\nat 119.     Examining all the attendant circumstances here, we hold\n\nthat no reasonable juror could find that Nichols’s conduct shocked\n\nthe conscience.\n\n            In order to shock the conscience, the conduct must be\n\n“truly outrageous, uncivilized, and intolerable.”            Hasenfus v.\n\nLaJeunesse, 175 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 1999).             The Due Process\n\nClause does not impose liability every time someone with state\n\nauthority    causes   harm;   otherwise,   “the   Constitution   would    be\n\ndowngraded to a ‘font of tort law.’”         DePoutot, 424 F.3d at 118\n\n(citation omitted).      In DePoutot, we summarized the meaning of\n\n“shocks the conscience” as follows:\n\n\n\n     While the “shock the conscience” standard is imprecise,\n     it is a helpful guide.      Conceptually, it does not\n\n                                   -4-\n\f      replicate, or even draw upon, negligence law. Rather,\n      this metric “points clearly away from liability, or\n      clearly toward it, only at the ends of the tort law’s\n      spectrum of culpability.”    It is, therefore, readily\n      apparent that negligent conduct, simpliciter, is\n      categorically insufficient to shock the conscience.\n      Executive branch action that sinks to the depths of\n      shocking the contemporary conscience is much more likely\n      to find its roots in “conduct intended to injure in some\n      way unjustifiable by any government interest.”\n\n      Consistent with these principles, we have stated that\n      “the requisite arbitrariness and caprice” for a\n      conscience-shocking executive action “must be stunning,\n      evidencing more than humdrum legal error.”\n\nId. at 119 (internal citations omitted).          Even violations of the\n\nlaw   resulting   from   bad   faith   do   not   necessarily   amount   to\n\nunconstitutional deprivations of substantive due process; conduct\n\nthat is “more egregious and more extreme” is required.           Id.\n\n           Conscience-shocking conduct usually entails physical or\n\npsychological abuse, or significant interference with a protected\n\nrelationship, such as the parent-child relationship.            See, e.g.,\n\nRochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952) (forcibly pumping\n\nsuspect’s stomach for drugs); Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37, 43-\n\n44 (1st Cir. 1992) (conditioning employment on taking highly\n\nintrusive physical test of sexual arousal); Grendell v. Gillway,\n\n974 F. Supp. 46, 51 (D. Me. 1997) (reasoning that it struck at the\n\nbasic fabric of the parent-child relationship for officer to tell\n\na girl that her parents would be arrested and she would be in\n\ntrouble if she did not tell officers about her parents’ drug use).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fNichols did not engage in physical or psychological abuse or\n\ninterfere with a protected relationship.\n\n            Even where an officer questions a suspect in an unlawful\n\nmanner,   this   does   not   necessarily   mean    that     the    questioning\n\nentitles the plaintiff to damages under section 1983; the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized that it would be inappropriate to impose tort\n\nliability every time an officer obtains an involuntary self-\n\nincriminating statement or the police fail to honor Miranda v.\n\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).        See Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S.\n\n760, 779-80 (2003).     As the Supreme Court has noted, exclusionary\n\nrules   rather   than   damages    often    can    provide    the    deterrent\n\nnecessary to deter unlawful questioning.           Id.\n\n            McConkie essentially argues that it is the fact that\n\nNichols lied in the course of the questioning that is conscience-\n\nshocking.     Even construing Nichols’s statements as lies, lies\n\nalone are not necessarily considered conscience-shocking.                 See,\n\ne.g., Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Motanez, 212 F.3d 617, 623 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (holding that it was not conscience-shocking for police\n\nofficers to deliberately lie in official documents and perjure\n\nthemselves in official court proceedings); United States v. Byram,\n\n145 F.3d 405, 408-09 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding that not all false\n\nstatements made by officers to elicit confessions are outrageous\n\nor uncivilized).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f             McConkie contends, however, that Nichols’s conduct was\n\nparticularly    egregious       because,     by   telling     McConkie     that   his\n\nstatement      would        remain   confidential,           Nichols       knowingly\n\nmisrepresented the nature of McConkie’s Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nAlthough     such   conduct     is   not   something         to    be   condoned,    a\n\nreasonable juror could not find that it is so egregious that it\n\nshocks the conscience.         We have deemed more offensive conduct not\n\nto be conscience-shocking.            See, e.g., Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-\n\nMotanez, 212 F.3d 617; Hasenfus, 175 F.3d at 74 (holding that\n\nschool’s failure to take action to prevent child from committing\n\nsuicide was not even close to meeting the standard for shocking\n\nthe conscience);       Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (holding that it may have been “despicable and wrongful” for\n\nofficer to tell young children that they would never again see the\n\nman   they   viewed    as    their   father,      but   it   did    not   shock     the\n\nconscience).\n\n             McConkie suggests that, because there was no legitimate\n\ninterest in Nichols lying about McConkie’s constitutional rights,\n\nthe lies are conscience-shocking.                 It is true that executive\n\nbranch action that is unjustified by any government interest is\n\nmore likely to shock the conscience.               DePoutot, 424 F.3d at 119.\n\nHowever, even if we assume that Nichols was not acting out of\n\nconcern that a pedophile was loose and could molest another child\n\nany day, the fact that an officer acts in a way that does not\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ffurther a government interest is not sufficient to show that the\n\nconduct is conscience-shocking.                  The First Circuit has, on more\n\nthan    one    occasion,      found       that     misconduct        that    furthered    no\n\ngovernment interest was not conscience-shocking.                          See, e.g., Cruz-\n\nErazo, 212 F.3d at 622-24; Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 427 (1st\n\nCir.    1995)(holding       that     it    did     not    shock     the     conscience    for\n\nprosecutors to hold press conference accusing suicidal man of\n\ncommitting serial murders); Pittsley, 927 F.2d at 6-7.\n\n               In some circumstances, it might be conscience-shocking\n\nfor an officer to elicit or provide knowingly false information\n\nabout a suspect.        See Limone v. Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (deliberately fabricating evidence to frame someone for a\n\ncrime    the     person     did    not     commit        and   to    protect     the     true\n\nperpetrators was a violation of due process); but see Cruz-Erazo,\n\n212    F.3d     at   623.         However,       even     assuming        that   McConkie’s\n\nadmissions were false, examining the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to McConkie, there is no evidence that Nichols was\n\ntrying to elicit a false confession.                           In fact, Nichols told\n\nMcConkie that he just wanted the truth.\n\n               Thus, as a matter of law, Nichols did not engage in\n\nconduct    that      shocks    the    conscience,          and      the    District    Court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment.\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\f",

Even construing Nichols's statements as lies, lies alone are not necessarily considered conscience-shocking. <i>See, e.g., Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez,</i> 212 F.3d 617, 623 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that it was not conscience-shocking for police officers to deliberately lie in official documents and perjure themselves in official court proceedings); <i>United States v.

Although such conduct is not something to be condoned, a reasonable juror could not find that it is so egregious that it shocks the conscience. We have deemed more offensive conduct not to be conscience-shocking. <i>See, e.g., Cruz-Erazo v.

It is true that executive branch action that is unjustified by any government interest is more likely to shock the conscience. <i>DePoutot,</i> 424 F.3d at 119. However, even if we assume that Nichols was not acting out of concern that a pedophile was loose and could molest another child any day, the fact that an officer acts in a way that does not further a government interest is not sufficient to show that the conduct is conscience-shocking. The First Circuit has, on more than one occasion, found that misconduct that furthered no government interest was not conscience-shocking. <i>See, e.g., Cruz-Erazo,</i> 212 F.3d at 622-24; <i>Souza v.

In his First Amended Complaint, McConkie alleged that he was entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1988 because Nichols violated his constitutional right to substantive due process in the course of questioning him about suspected sexual abuse of a ten-year-old child. The District Court granted Nichols summary judgment on the ground that no reasonable factfinder could find that Nichols's conduct was conscience-shocking. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McConkie's claim arose out of a tape-recorded, non-custodial interview with Detective Nichols on June 23, 1998. Nichols had set up the interview after speaking to a boy who said that McConkie had sexually abused him. The transcript of the interview indicates that Nichols was aware of McConkie's criminal history and that McConkie acknowledged to Nichols that he had been placed in an intense therapy program because of his sexual behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the interview, Nichols told McConkie that \"this stuff stays confidential, especially because a juvenile is involved.\" Later in the interview, McConkie admitted to sexual contact with the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These admissions were introduced at McConkie's subsequent criminal trial, but McConkie does not base his claims on the use of the admissions; rather, he bases his claims on the tactics Nichols used in the interview. In particular, in his First Amended Complaint, McConkie alleged that Nichols intentionally deceived him about his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he made the statement that the information would stay confidential. He further alleged that this violated his substantive due process rights and that he therefore was entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nichols denied the material allegations of the complaint and asserted affirmative defenses, including that his conduct did not shock the conscience. On February 3, 2005, Nichols moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint and, alternatively, moved for summary judgment on the ground that McConkie had not alleged conscience-shocking conduct, an essential element of a substantive due process claim. The judge ultimately denied Nichols's motion to dismiss, but granted Nichols summary judgment on the ground that, as a matter of law, Nichols's conduct did not shock the conscience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. We review a District Court's grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and granting all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>Torres v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199000\"><a href=\"/opinion/199000/torres-v-ei-dupont/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McConkie rests his claims solely on substantive due process grounds, not on the Fifth Amendment. When a case, like this one, involves an alleged abuse of power by the executive branch, the claim is cognizable as a violation of substantive due process \"only when it is so extreme and egregious as to shock the contemporary conscience.\" <i>DePoutot v. Raffaelly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201841\"><a href=\"/opinion/201841/depoutot-v-raffaelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 118 (1st Cir.2005). \"The `shock the conscience' inquiry requires a comprehensive analysis of the attendant circumstances before any abuse of official power is condemned as conscience-shocking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 119. Examining all the attendant circumstances here, we hold that no reasonable juror could find that Nichols's conduct shocked the conscience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to shock the conscience, the conduct must be \"truly outrageous, uncivilized, and intolerable.\" <i>Hasenfus v. LaJeunesse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198449\"><a href=\"/opinion/198449/hasenfus-v-lajeunesse/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.1999). The Due Process Clause does not impose liability every time someone with state authority causes harm; otherwise, \"the Constitution would be downgraded to a `font of tort law.'\" <i>DePoutot,</i> 424 F.3d at 118 (citation omitted). In <i>DePoutot,</i> we summarized the meaning of \"shocks the conscience\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the \"shock the conscience\" standard is imprecise, it is a helpful guide. Conceptually, it does not replicate, or even draw upon, negligence law. Rather, this metric \"points clearly away from liability, or clearly toward it, only at the ends of the tort law's spectrum of culpability.\" It is, therefore, readily apparent that negligent conduct, simpliciter, is categorically insufficient to shock the conscience. Executive branch action that sinks to the depths of shocking the contemporary conscience is much more likely to find its roots in \"conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with these principles, we have stated that \"the requisite arbitrariness and caprice\" for a conscience-shocking executive action \"must be stunning, evidencing more than humdrum legal error.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 119 (internal citations omitted). Even violations of the law resulting from bad faith do not necessarily amount to unconstitutional deprivations of substantive due process; conduct that is \"more egregious and more extreme\" is required. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conscience-shocking conduct usually entails physical or psychological abuse, or significant interference with a protected relationship, such as the parent-child relationship. <i>See, e.g., Rochin v.
