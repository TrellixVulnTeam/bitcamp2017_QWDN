D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Holly T.

The defendant appeals\n\nfrom his sentence, arguing, inter alia, that the sentencing court\n\nerroneously relied on police reports in determining whether he pled\n\nguilty to a prior \"crime of violence\" qualifying for sentencing\n\nenhancement under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. ยง 4B1.1.\n\nThis appeal was briefed and argued shortly before the Supreme Court\n\nhanded down its decision in Shepard v. United States, 125 S. Ct.\n\n1254 (2005), holding that a sentencing court may not look to police\n\nreports for this purpose.1    Recognizing that a decision in Shepard\n\nwas imminent   and   would   be   relevant,   this   court   withheld   any\n\ndisposition pending the issuance of Shepard.          Now that that case\n\nhas been decided, we vacate the district court's sentence and\n\nremand to it for resentencing in light of Shepard.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In Shepard, the Supreme Court considered whether the\ndefendant's prior burglary conviction constituted a \"violent\nfelony\" under 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(1), a provision of the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA). The ยง 924(e)(1) definition of \"violent\nfelony\" is \"the same in all material respects\" as the U.S.S.G. ยง\n4B1.1 definition of a \"crime of violence.\" United States v. Bell,\n966 F.2d 703, 704 (1st Cir. 1992). Given the similarity, \"we look\ngenerally to cases pertaining to either provision 'to elucidate the\nnature of the categorical inquiry.'\" United States v. Delgado, 288\nF.3d 49, 53 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                   -2-\n\f",
