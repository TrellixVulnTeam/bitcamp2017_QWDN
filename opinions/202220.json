Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Thomas A.

Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, Robert\nClark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Kenneth P. Madden,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            May 18, 2006\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.      This case presents the issue of\n\nwhether a federal court may require a defendant convicted of\n\ncriminal   contempt   and   perjury   to    pay   for   the   costs   of   the\n\ninvestigation of his crimes, when a special prosecutor is appointed\n\nunder Rule 42, Fed. R. Crim. P.          The district court purported to\n\nfind the authority to award such costs in the statutes permitting\n\ntaxation of and defining allowable costs, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1918(b) and\n\n1920.   We disagree, reverse, and remand to the district court.             On\n\nremand, the district court may consider whether to impose a fine,\n\nwhich it did not do earlier in light of its taxation of costs.\n\n           Joseph Bevilacqua was counsel for a defendant in a major\n\nfederal corruption investigation of the Mayor of Providence and\n\nothers.    See generally United States v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (describing the investigation).              As counsel for the\n\nindicted defendant, Bevilacqua was provided with a videotape (the\n\nCorrente    tape)   under   a   strict     protective    order   precluding\n\ndissemination of the tape.       The tape showed Frank Corrente, the\n\nmayor's administrative director, allegedly taking a cash bribe. On\n\nFebruary 1, 2001, while the grand jury was still proceeding in its\n\ninvestigation of other individuals (who were later also named as\n\ndefendants), the embargoed Corrente tape was aired on television by\n\nreporter James Taricani and Channel 10 in Rhode Island.                    The\n\ntargets of the grand jury investigation asked the district court to\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\finvestigate the leak.      See In re Special Proceedings, 373 F.3d 37,\n\n40 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             On May 31, 2001, the district court (Torres, J.) issued\n\nan   order   initiating    a    criminal    contempt    investigation,    which\n\ninitially focused on reporter Taricani.             Id. at 40-41.     The order\n\nexplained that under Fed. R. Crim. P. 42(a)(2), the matter would\n\nnormally be referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution,\n\nbut because government prosecutors were involved in the ongoing\n\ncriminal     prosecution   of    Corrente,    the    \"interest   of    justice\"\n\nrequired appointment of outside counsel.               Id. at 41.     The court\n\npicked a private attorney, Marc DeSisto, who had previously been a\n\nprosecutor, to investigate and act as special counsel; he was\n\nassisted by a law firm, Ropes & Gray.                Id. at 39, 41.      On an\n\nearlier appeal by Taricani of a civil contempt sanction, this court\n\naffirmed the court's appointment of the special prosecutor.                 See\n\nid. at 40-44.\n\n             In November 2004, Bevilacqua confessed to having given\n\nthe tape to Taricani in violation of the court order, and having\n\nrepeatedly and untruthfully denied doing so during the course of\n\nthe special prosecutor's investigation.             In May 2005, Bevilacqua\n\npled guilty to perjury, 18 U.S.C. § 1623, and contempt of court,\n\nid. § 401(3).     In the meantime, the $152,247.39 in bills incurred\n\nby the special prosecutor and the firm during the investigation was\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fpaid by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO),\n\nas is usual in Rule 42(a) appointments.\n\n              Bevilacqua was sentenced by a different judge (Lisi, J.).\n\nBefore the sentencing hearing, the government papers asked for an\n\norder that Bevilacqua repay the AO the $152,247.39 that it had paid\n\nto the special prosecutor for the investigation, on a theory of\n\nrestitution.      The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) did not\n\ncontain such a recommendation.\n\n              At the sentencing hearing, the government abandoned the\n\nrestitution theory for the proposed order. The court asked by what\n\nauthority, then, it could order defendant to pay the costs of\n\ninvestigation.       For the first time, the government cited to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1918(b) (permitting the taxing of \"costs of prosecution\"\n\nof non-capital offenses).\n\n              The government also referred to the court's inherent\n\nauthority, an argument which is plainly wrong.                   There is no\n\ninherent   authority     \"to   shift    litigation   costs   absent     express\n\nstatutory authority.\" W. Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S.\n\n83, 86 (1991); see also id. at 87 (requiring explicit statutory\n\nauthority to shift costs of nontestimonial expert fees).\n\n              The court directed defense counsel to read § 1918 then\n\nand there (since the argument had not been made earlier) and to\n\nrespond to the new argument.           Defense counsel replied that these\n\nwere   \"not    the   cost[s]   of   prosecution\"     under   §   1918   but   of\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f\"investigation,\" and that defendant could not agree these were\n\nappropriate costs.   Defense counsel said this was really more like\n\na fine, and that the sum was not a permissible fine here because\n\nthe Guidelines range for a fine was only $4,000 to $40,000.     The\n\ngovernment did not argue that these \"costs\" of investigation were\n\nallowable costs as defined under 28 U.S.C. § 1920 and did not reply\n\nto the argument that the Guidelines limited a fine.     Rather, the\n\ngovernment argued that the real victim here was the system of\n\njustice and so the requested order was somehow appropriate.\n\n          Bevilacqua was sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment,\n\nfollowed by supervised release, and a special assessment of $200.\n\nHe was also ordered to pay to the AO the \"costs associated with the\n\ninvestigation and prosecution\" in the amount of $152,247.39, under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1918.    The district court said it was not imposing a\n\ncriminal fine because it was ordering the payment of costs.\n\n          The district court clearly had the power to impose a\n\nfine, but that would have presented two practical problems. First,\n\nthe money would have had to go to the U.S. Treasury and not the AO,\n\nwhich had actually paid the sum.   Second, the court would have had\n\nto address the question of the Guidelines limitation.\n\n          There are several distinctions important to our analysis.\n\nThe imposition on a defendant of the costs of a special prosecutor\n\nis different from ordering a defendant to pay criminal fines.\n\nCosts are paid to the entity incurring the costs; criminal fines\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fare generally paid to a special fund for victims' compensation and\n\nassistance in the U.S. Treasury.      See 42 U.S.C. § 10601(a), (b);\n\nUnited States v. Sun Growers of Cal., 212 F.3d 603, 606 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2000).   Another distinction is that criminal fines, assuming they\n\nare subject to the rule of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005), must still be evaluated in light of the Guidelines range.\n\nSee United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc).   According to Bevilacqua's PSR, the Guidelines\n\nfine range was $4,000 to $40,000.\n\n          On appeal, Bevilacqua attacks the award of costs of the\n\nspecial prosecutor as not being authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 1920,\n\nwhich sets forth the costs a court or clerk \"may tax as costs.\"1\n\nThe government argues that Bevilacqua has forfeited the argument\n\nthat § 1920 does not include these sums as allowable costs by not\n\nspecifically raising it during the sentencing hearing.     It is an\n\nodd position for the government, since it was the government which\n\nadvanced the idea that these sums were allowable costs under § 1918\n\nfor the first time at the sentencing hearing. Given this sequence,\n\nit is clear that Bevilacqua has preserved the issue.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Bevilacqua also challenges the process by which the costs\nwere proven to the district court, arguing that the government's\nschedule of the amount of money paid by the AO to the special\nprosecutor did not meet the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1924. See\nid. (verification of bill of costs).        Since we reverse the\nimposition of costs on different grounds, we do not address whether\nthe schedule submitted by the government was proper.\n\n                                -6-\n\f           The government also suggests that we need not bother with\n\nthis appeal because the statutory maximum fine is $250,000, and\n\nsince the Guidelines are only advisory (the sentence was imposed\n\nafter Booker), \"[i]t is likely that if the case were remanded, the\n\ncourt would assess a comparable financial sanction but in the form\n\nof a fine.\"      This is not a response to the legal argument that the\n\ndistrict court lacked authority to do what it did.\n\n           The American legal tradition does not, absent specific\n\nstatutory authority, require defendants to reimburse the government\n\nfor the costs of their criminal investigations or their criminal\n\nprosecutions.       As sanctions, courts order defendants to go to\n\nprison. Defendants are required to pay restitution. See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3663A (requiring an order of restitution for certain crimes).\n\nThey pay fines and special assessments.         See id. §§ 3571, 3013.\n\nThey   forfeit    ill-gotten   gains.    See,   e.g.,   21   U.S.C.   §   853\n\n(forfeiture for drug trafficking); 18 U.S.C. § 982 (forfeiture for\n\nmoney laundering and other crimes).\n\n           It is commonplace both that a district court's taxation\n\nof costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion, Garcia-Goyco v. Law\n\nEnvtl. Consultants, Inc., 428 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2005), and that\n\nan error of law is an abuse of discretion, Rivera-Feliciano v.\n\nAcevedo-Vilá, 438 F.3d 50, 63 (1st Cir. 2006).                 It is also\n\ncommonplace that there is no discretion to award costs in a\n\ncriminal case other than as authorized by statute.            See Fairmont\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fCreamery Co. v. Minnesota, 275 U.S. 70, 76 (1927) (\"Costs in\n\ncriminal proceedings are a creature of statute, and a court has no\n\npower   to   award    them    unless    some    statute      has   conferred     it.\"\n\n(internal      quotation     marks   omitted)       (quoting    United    States   ex\n\nrel. Phillips v. Gaines, 25 L. Ed. 733 (U.S. 1880))); see also\n\nCrawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 441-42\n\n(1987) (holding that district court authority to tax expert witness\n\nfees as costs in civil cases under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d) is limited\n\nby 28 U.S.C. §§ 1920 and 1821).\n\n             There is authorization to award costs against a criminal\n\ndefendant in § 1918(b), which states: \"Whenever any conviction for\n\nany offense not capital is obtained in a district court, the court\n\nmay order that the defendant pay the costs of prosecution.\"                        28\n\nU.S.C. § 1918(b); see also United States v. Banks-Giombetti, 245\n\nF.3d 949, 952 (7th Cir. 2001) (per curiam); United States v.\n\nHiland, 909 F.2d 1114, 1141-42 (8th Cir. 1990); United States v.\n\nGering, 716 F.2d 615, 626 (9th Cir. 1983); United States v. Glover,\n\n588 F.2d 876, 878-79 (2d Cir. 1978) (per curiam); United States v.\n\nPommerening, 500 F.2d 92, 100-02 (10th Cir. 1974).\n\n             We hold, and the government does not dispute, that the\n\ndefinition      of   the   items     which   may    be   taxed     as   costs   under\n\n§   1918(b),    unless     provided    by    some    other     explicit   statutory\n\nauthority, is found in 28 U.S.C. § 1920.                 Accord Banks-Giombetti,\n\n245 F.3d at 952; Hiland, 909 F.2d at 1142; Gering, 716 F.2d at 626;\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fcf. In re Two Appeals Arising out of the San Juan Dupont Plaza\n\nHotel Fire Litigation, 994 F.2d 956, 962 (1st Cir. 1993) (stating\n\nthat in a civil case \"a district court lacks the ability to assess\n\n'costs' under [Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)] above and beyond those that\n\ncome within the statutory litany,\" including 28 U.S.C. § 1920).\n\n          The government's argument is that § 1920 does authorize\n\nthis award.   The statute provides:\n\n          A judge or clerk of any court of the United\n          States may tax as costs the following:\n\n          (1) Fees of the clerk and marshal;\n          (2) Fees of the court reporter for all or any\n          part    of   the    stenographic   transcript\n          necessarily obtained for use in the case;\n          (3) Fees and disbursements for printing and\n          witnesses;\n          (4) Fees for exemplification and copies of\n          papers necessarily obtained for use in the\n          case;\n          (5) Docket fees under section 1923 of this\n          title;\n          (6) Compensation of court appointed experts,\n          compensation of interpreters, and salaries,\n          fees,   expenses,   and   costs  of   special\n          interpretation services under section 1828 of\n          this title.\n\n          A bill of costs shall be filed in the case\n          and, upon allowance, included in the judgment\n          or decree.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1920. The government argues that these costs are\n\nallowable under the clause in § 1920(6), which allows for taxation\n\nof the costs of \"[c]ompensation of court appointed experts.\"     It\n\nnotes the phrase is not \"expert witnesses\" and cites Gaddis v.\n\nUnited States, 381 F.3d 444, 455-57 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc).    It\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fthen argues that \"the special prosecution team hired by the court\"\n\nshould be regarded as \"court appointed experts.\"        We hold such\n\nspecial prosecutors are surely \"court appointed,\" but they are not\n\n\"court appointed experts\" within the meaning of § 1920(6).\n\n            The government's citations do not help its position. The\n\nGaddis case concerned whether court appointed guardian ad litem\n\nfees were taxable as costs.      The court held that district courts\n\nhad the authority to tax such fees under Rule 17(c), Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. (authorizing the district court to appoint a guardian ad litem\n\nin certain cases).     Id. at 453-55.    As an alternate holding, the\n\ncourt held that the phrase \"[c]ompensation of court appointed\n\nexperts\" in § 1920(6) could reasonably be read to include such\n\nfees.    Id. at 455.   That was because a guardian was like an expert\n\nassisting the court with the protection of the best interests of\n\nminors and incompetents.     Id. at 456.   The court noted that such\n\nexperts partake of quasi-judicial immunity.      Id.   It pointed out\n\nthat historically, many federal courts had routinely taxed such\n\ncosts.    Id. at 458 n.17.\n\n            This court has not addressed the Gaddis issue.    Whether\n\nthe majority or the strong dissent in Gaddis is correct is not of\n\nconcern to us here.     We think it is entirely unreasonable to read\n\nthe court appointed expert clause in § 1920(6) to include the costs\n\nof special prosecutors appointed under Fed. R. Crim. P. 42.    No one\n\nconsiders prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys' offices, or the agents\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fin the investigative agencies, to be experts to the court.            Their\n\njob is not to advise the court but to represent one of two sides in\n\nan adversarial system.     The fact that the investigator/prosecutor\n\nof criminal contempt is appointed by the court under Rule 42, Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P, does not turn that person into a court appointed\n\nexpert.    Such a reading runs against history and is unsupported by\n\nprecedent.    We hold that costs consisting of fees paid to special\n\nprosecutors appointed under Rule 42 are not allowable as court\n\nappointed expert fees under 28 U.S.C. § 1920(6).\n\n            The government points to no other statutory authority to\n\njustify such an award.     The award is contrary to related precedent\n\nas well.    See United States v. Stefonek, 179 F.3d 1030, 1037 (7th\n\nCir. 1999) (finding error in district court's ordering defendant to\n\npay jury fees).     In fact, there is a line of cases, which the\n\ngovernment failed to provide to the district court, prohibiting, in\n\nany event, the imposition of costs of investigation as costs under\n\n§ 1918 and § 1920.         See Hiland, 909 F.2d at 1142 (costs of\n\ninvestigation    leading   to   indictment   are   not   authorized   under\n\n§ 1920); United States v. Vaughn, 636 F.2d 921, 922 (4th Cir. 1980)\n\n(same).    That is exactly what is involved here.\n\n            The government's position raises serious issues about\n\nconfusion of the roles of two independent branches of government --\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe courts and the prosecutors.2                See In re United States, 441 F.3d\n\n44, 58, 63 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Reilly v. United States, 863\n\nF.2d       149,    156   (1st    Cir.   1988)    (technical    advisors    should   be\n\nappointed         only   where    there   would    be   no   \"dislodging    [of]    the\n\ndelicate balance of the juristic role\").                     Further, such a result\n\nshould not be upheld when Congress has not authorized it.\n\n                  We reverse.     We also remand because the district court\n\nsaid it did not impose a fine because it was taxing these costs.\n\nNothing in this opinion should be read as bearing on the issue of\n\na fine, or a fine of a particular sum.\n\n                  Reversed and remanded.         So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       Indeed, most individuals employed by the United States may\nnot receive a fee as a witness on behalf of the United States.

The district court purported to find the authority to award such costs in the statutes permitting taxation of and defining allowable costs, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1918(b) and 1920. We disagree, reverse, and remand to the district court. On remand, the district court may consider whether to impose a fine, which it did not do earlier in light of its taxation of costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph Bevilacqua was counsel for a defendant in a major federal corruption investigation of the Mayor of Providence and others. <i>See generally United States v. Cianci,</i> 378 F.3d 71 (1st Cir.2004) (describing the investigation). As counsel for the indicted defendant, Bevilacqua was provided with a videotape (the Corrente tape) under a strict protective order precluding dissemination of the tape. The tape showed Frank Corrente, the mayor's administrative director, allegedly taking a cash bribe. On February 1, 2001, while the grand jury was still proceeding in its investigation of other individuals (who were later also named as defendants), the embargoed Corrente tape was aired on television by reporter James Taricani and Channel 10 in Rhode Island. The targets of the grand jury investigation asked the district court to investigate the leak. <i>See In re Special Proceedings,</i> 373 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 31, 2001, the district court (Torres, J.) issued an order initiating a criminal contempt investigation, which initially focused on reporter Taricani. <i>Id.</i> at 40-41. The order explained that under Fed. R.Crim.P. 42(a)(2), the matter would normally be referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution, but because government prosecutors were involved in the ongoing criminal prosecution of Corrente, the \"interest of justice\" required appointment of outside counsel. <i>Id.</i> at 41. The court picked a private attorney, Marc DeSisto, who had previously been a prosecutor, to investigate and act as special counsel; he was assisted by a law firm, Ropes &amp; Gray. <i>Id.</i> at 39, 41. On an earlier appeal by Taricani of a civil contempt sanction, this court affirmed the court's appointment of the special prosecutor. <i>See id.</i> at 40-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2004, Bevilacqua confessed to having given the tape to Taricani in violation of the court order, and having repeatedly and untruthfully denied doing so during the course of the special prosecutor's investigation. In May 2005, Bevilacqua pled guilty to perjury, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623, and contempt of court, <i>id.</i> &#167; 401(3). In the meantime, the $152,247.39 in bills incurred by the special prosecutor and the firm during the investigation was paid by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO), as is usual in Rule 42(a) appointments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bevilacqua was sentenced by a different judge (Lisi, J.). Before the sentencing hearing, the government papers asked for an order that Bevilacqua repay the AO the $152,247.39 that it had paid to the special prosecutor for the investigation, on a theory of restitution. The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) did not contain such a recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the government abandoned the restitution theory for the proposed order. The court asked by what authority, then, it could order defendant to pay the costs of investigation. For the first time, the government cited to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1918(b) (permitting the taxing of \"costs of prosecution\" of non-capital offenses).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also referred to the court's inherent authority, an argument which is plainly wrong. There is no inherent authority \"to shift litigation costs absent express statutory authority.\" <i>W. Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey,</i> 499 U.S. 83, 86, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991); <i>see also id.</i> at 87, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (requiring explicit statutory authority to shift costs of nontestimonial expert fees).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court directed defense counsel to read &#167; 1918 then and there (since the argument had not been made earlier) and to respond to the new argument. Defense counsel replied that these were \"not the cost[s] of prosecution\" under &#167; 1918 but of \"investigation,\" and that defendant could not agree these were appropriate costs. Defense counsel said this was really more like a fine, and that the sum was not a permissible fine here because the Guidelines range for a fine was only $4,000 to $40,000. The government did not argue that these \"costs\" of investigation were allowable costs as defined under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920 and did not reply to the argument that the Guidelines limited a fine. Rather, the government argued that the real victim here was the system of justice and so the requested order was somehow appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bevilacqua was sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment, followed by supervised release, and a special assessment of $200. He was also ordered to pay to the AO the \"costs associated with the investigation and prosecution\" in the amount of $152,247.39, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1918. The district court said it was not imposing a criminal fine because it was ordering the payment of costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court clearly had the power to impose a fine, but that would have presented two practical problems. First, the money would have had to go to the U.S. Treasury and not the AO, which had actually paid the sum. Second, the court would have had to address the question of the Guidelines limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several distinctions important to our analysis. The imposition on a defendant of the costs of a special prosecutor is different from ordering a defendant to pay criminal fines. Costs are paid to the entity incurring the costs; criminal fines are generally paid to a special fund for victims' compensation and assistance in the U.S. Treasury. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 10601(a), (b); <i>United States v. Sun Growers of Cal.,</i> 212 F.3d 603, 606 (D.C.Cir.2000). Another distinction is that criminal fines, assuming they are subject to the rule of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), must still be evaluated in light of the Guidelines range. <i>See United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). According to Bevilacqua's PSR, the Guidelines fine range was $4,000 to $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Bevilacqua attacks the award of costs of the special prosecutor as not being authorized by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920, which sets forth the costs a court or clerk \"may tax as costs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The government argues that Bevilacqua has forfeited the argument that &#167; 1920 does not include these sums as allowable costs by not specifically raising it during the sentencing hearing. It is an odd position for the government, since it was the government which advanced the idea that these sums were allowable costs under &#167; 1918 for the first time at the sentencing hearing. Given this sequence, it is clear that Bevilacqua has preserved the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also suggests that we need not bother with this appeal because the statutory maximum fine is $250,000, and since the Guidelines are only advisory (the sentence was imposed after <i>Booker</i>), \"[i]t is likely that if the case were remanded, the court would assess a comparable financial sanction but in the form of a fine.\" This is not a response to the legal argument that the district court lacked authority to do what it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The American legal tradition does not, absent specific statutory authority, require defendants to reimburse the government for the costs of their criminal investigations or their criminal prosecutions. As sanctions, courts order defendants to go to prison. Defendants are required to pay restitution. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A (requiring an order of restitution for certain crimes). They pay fines and special assessments. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 3571, 3013. They forfeit ill-gotten gains. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853 (forfeiture for drug trafficking); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982 (forfeiture for money laundering and other crimes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is commonplace both that a district court's taxation of costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion, <i>Garcia-Goyco v. Law Envtl. Consultants, Inc.,</i> 428 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.2005), and that an error of law is an abuse of discretion, <i>Rivera-Feliciano v. Acevedo-Vil&#225;,</i> 438 F.3d 50, 63 (1st Cir.2006). It is also commonplace that there is no discretion to award costs in a criminal case other than as authorized by statute. <i>See Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota,</i> 275 U.S. 70, 76, 48 S.Ct. 97, 72 L.Ed. 168 (1927) (\"Costs in criminal proceedings are a creature of statute, and a court has no power to award them unless some statute has conferred it.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>United States ex rel. Phillips v. Gaines,</i> 25 L.Ed. 733, 1880 WL 18566 (U.S.1880))); <i>see also Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T.

The government argues that these costs are allowable under the clause in &#167; 1920(6), which allows for taxation of the costs of \"[c]ompensation of court appointed experts.\" It notes the phrase is not \"expert <i>witnesses</i>\" and cites <i>Gaddis v. United States,</i> 381 F.3d 444, 455-57 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). It then argues that \"the special prosecution team hired by the court\" should be regarded as \"court appointed experts.\" We hold such special prosecutors are surely \"court appointed,\" but they are not \"court appointed experts\" within the meaning of &#167; 1920(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's citations do not help its position. The <i>Gaddis</i> case concerned whether court appointed guardian ad litem fees were taxable as costs. The court held that district courts had the authority to tax such fees under Rule 17(c), Fed.R.Civ.P. (authorizing the district court to appoint a guardian ad litem in certain cases). <i>Id.</i> at 453-55. As an alternate holding, the court held that the phrase \"[c]ompensation of court appointed experts\" in &#167; 1920(6) could reasonably be read to include such fees. <i>Id.</i> at 455. That was because a guardian was like an expert assisting the court with the protection of the best interests of minors and incompetents. <i>Id.</i> at 456. The court noted that such experts partake of quasi-judicial immunity. <i>Id.</i> It pointed out that historically, many federal courts had routinely taxed such costs. <i>Id.</i> at 458 n. 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not addressed the <i>Gaddis</i> issue. Whether the majority or the strong dissent in <i>Gaddis</i> is correct is not of concern to us here. We think it is entirely unreasonable to read the court appointed expert clause in &#167; 1920(6) to include the costs of special prosecutors appointed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 42. No one considers prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys' offices, or the agents in the investigative agencies, to be experts to the court. Their job is not to advise the court but to represent one of two sides in an adversarial system. The fact that the investigator/prosecutor of criminal contempt is appointed by the court under Rule 42, Fed. R.Crim. P, does not turn that person into a court appointed expert. Such a reading runs against history and is unsupported by precedent. We hold that costs consisting of fees paid to special prosecutors appointed under Rule 42 are not allowable as court appointed expert fees under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points to no other statutory authority to justify such an award. The award is contrary to related precedent as well. <i>See United States v. Stefonek,</i> 179 F.3d 1030, 1037 (7th Cir.1999) (finding error in district court's ordering defendant to pay jury fees). In fact, there is a line of cases, which the government failed to provide to the district court, prohibiting, in any event, the imposition of costs of investigation as costs under &#167; 1918 and &#167; 1920. <i>See Hiland,</i> 909 F.2d at 1142 (costs of investigation leading to indictment are not authorized under &#167; 1920); <i>United States v.

On an earlier appeal by Taricani of a civil contempt sanction, this court affirmed the court's appointment of the special prosecutor. <i>See id.</i> at 40-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2004, Bevilacqua confessed to having given the tape to Taricani in violation of the court order, and having repeatedly and untruthfully denied doing so during the course of the special prosecutor's investigation. In May 2005, Bevilacqua pled guilty to perjury, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623, and contempt of court, <i>id.</i> &#167; 401(3). In the meantime, the $152,247.39 in bills incurred by the special prosecutor and the firm during the investigation was paid by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO), as is usual in Rule 42(a) appointments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bevilacqua was sentenced by a different judge (Lisi, J.). Before the sentencing hearing, the government papers asked for an order that Bevilacqua repay the AO the $152,247.39 that it had paid to the special prosecutor for the investigation, on a theory of restitution. The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) did not contain such a recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the government abandoned the restitution theory for the proposed order. The court asked by what authority, then, it could order defendant to pay the costs of investigation. For the first time, the government cited to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1918(b) (permitting the taxing of \"costs of prosecution\" of non-capital offenses).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also referred to the court's inherent authority, an argument which is plainly wrong.

Defense counsel replied that these were \"not the cost[s] of prosecution\" under &#167; 1918 but of \"investigation,\" and that defendant could not agree these were appropriate costs. Defense counsel said this was really more like a fine, and that the sum was not a permissible fine here because the Guidelines range for a fine was only $4,000 to $40,000. The government did not argue that these \"costs\" of investigation were allowable costs as defined under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920 and did not reply to the argument that the Guidelines limited a fine. Rather, the government argued that the real victim here was the system of justice and so the requested order was somehow appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bevilacqua was sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment, followed by supervised release, and a special assessment of $200. He was also ordered to pay to the AO the \"costs associated with the investigation and prosecution\" in the amount of $152,247.39, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1918. The district court said it was not imposing a criminal fine because it was ordering the payment of costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court clearly had the power to impose a fine, but that would have presented two practical problems. First, the money would have had to go to the U.S. Treasury and not the AO, which had actually paid the sum. Second, the court would have had to address the question of the Guidelines limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several distinctions important to our analysis. The imposition on a defendant of the costs of a special prosecutor is different from ordering a defendant to pay criminal fines. Costs are paid to the entity incurring the costs; criminal fines are generally paid to a special fund for victims' compensation and assistance in the U.S. Treasury. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 10601(a), (b); <i>United States v. Sun Growers of Cal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185145\"><a href=\"/opinion/185145/united-states-v-sun-growers-of-ca/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 606 (D.C.Cir.2000). Another distinction is that criminal fines, assuming they are subject to the rule of <i>United States v.

According to Bevilacqua's PSR, the Guidelines fine range was $4,000 to $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Bevilacqua attacks the award of costs of the special prosecutor as not being authorized by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920, which sets forth the costs a court or clerk \"may tax as costs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The government argues that Bevilacqua has forfeited the argument that &#167; 1920 does not include these sums as allowable costs by not specifically raising it during the sentencing hearing. It is an odd position for the government, since it was the government which advanced the idea that these sums were allowable costs under &#167; 1918 for the first time at the sentencing hearing. Given this sequence, it is clear that Bevilacqua has preserved the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also suggests that we need not bother with this appeal because the statutory maximum fine is $250,000, and since the Guidelines are only advisory (the sentence was imposed after <i>Booker</i>), \"[i]t is likely that if the case were remanded, the court would assess a comparable financial sanction but in the form of a fine.\" This is not a response to the legal argument that the district court lacked authority to do what it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The American legal tradition does not, absent specific statutory authority, require defendants to reimburse the government for the costs of their criminal investigations or their criminal prosecutions. As sanctions, courts order defendants to go to prison. Defendants are required to pay restitution. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A (requiring an order of restitution for certain crimes). They pay fines and special assessments. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 3571, 3013.

It then argues that \"the special prosecution team hired by the court\" should be regarded as \"court appointed experts.\" We hold such special prosecutors are surely \"court appointed,\" but they are not \"court appointed experts\" within the meaning of &#167; 1920(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's citations do not help its position. The <i>Gaddis</i> case concerned whether court appointed guardian ad litem fees were taxable as costs. The court held that district courts had the authority to tax such fees under Rule 17(c), Fed.R.Civ.P. (authorizing the district court to appoint a guardian ad litem in certain cases). <i>Id.</i> at 453-55. As an alternate holding, the court held that the phrase \"[c]ompensation of court appointed experts\" in &#167; 1920(6) could reasonably be read to include such fees. <i>Id.</i> at 455. That was because a guardian was like an expert assisting the court with the protection of the best interests of minors and incompetents. <i>Id.</i> at 456. The court noted that such experts partake of quasi-judicial immunity. <i>Id.</i> It pointed out that historically, many federal courts had routinely taxed such costs. <i>Id.</i> at 458 n. 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not addressed the <i>Gaddis</i> issue. Whether the majority or the strong dissent in <i>Gaddis</i> is correct is not of concern to us here. We think it is entirely unreasonable to read the court appointed expert clause in &#167; 1920(6) to include the costs of special prosecutors appointed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 42. No one considers prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys' offices, or the agents in the investigative agencies, to be experts to the court. Their job is not to advise the court but to represent one of two sides in an adversarial system. The fact that the investigator/prosecutor of criminal contempt is appointed by the court under Rule 42, Fed. R.Crim. P, does not turn that person into a court appointed expert. Such a reading runs against history and is unsupported by precedent. We hold that costs consisting of fees paid to special prosecutors appointed under Rule 42 are not allowable as court appointed expert fees under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points to no other statutory authority to justify such an award.
