The  complaint  in  this case\r                                        \n\ncharged that a  number of entities, public  and private, were\n\nseeking  to  monopolize  the  waste  disposal   business  and\n\notherwise acting in violation of  federal and state law.  The\n\ndistrict court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a\n\nclaim.  We affirm the district court with one  exception:  as\n\nto the predation claims against the private defendants, we do\n\nnot think  that state  action immunity has  been made  out on\n\nthis  record, and therefore  remand those claims  for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                      I.  THE BACKGROUND\n\n     This case  is one  of several in  which state  and local\n\ncommunities  have taken  measures to  cope  with their  waste\n\ncollection responsibilities,  and private  haulers have  been\n\nadversely affected and  responded with antitrust suits.   The\n\ncases vary,  and in this one  the history is tangled  and the\n\nclaims  numerous.    In describing  the  facts,  we  take the\n\nallegations  of  the complaint  as true,  as is  customary in\n\nreviewing dismissals  for  failure to  state  a claim.    See\r                                                                         \n\nWatterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                             \n\n     Maine  has in force statutes that give local communities\n\nsubstantial  authority   over  local  waste   collection  and\n\ndisposal.    Under  this legislative  umbrella,  the  City of\n\nAuburn and eleven  other municipalities formed in 1986 a non-\n\nprofit, non-stock  corporation to assist  in waste  disposal.\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\n\nThe entity--Mid-Maine Waste Action Corporation (\"MMWAC\")--was\n\nthen mandated to construct a facility to burn municipal waste\n\nand derive electricity from the process.  Maine law expressly\n\nauthorizes  municipalities to  cooperate  in   waste disposal\n\nprojects, Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit. 38,    2201, and provides\n\nfor interlocal agreements to  organize public waste  disposal\n\ncorporations to own or operate facilities.  Id.   1304-B(5).\r                                                          \n\n     MMWAC issued  over $42 million  in bonds to  construct a\n\nwaste-to-energy  facility.   The  bonds  were  to  be  funded\n\nthrough  so-called  \"tipping  fees,\" customarily  charged  to\n\nthose who  dispose of waste  at a landfill or  other disposal\n\nfacility,  and  through the  revenues  from the  sale  of the\n\nelectricity.   To  secure  the quantity  of  waste needed  to\n\noperate  the  facility  economically--that   is,  at  a  high\n\npercentage of its capacity--the  MMWAC municipalities enacted\n\nflow control ordinances.  These local laws, authorized by Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit.  38,   1304-B(2), required the  delivery\n\nof  all solid  waste generated  within  each municipality  to\n\nMMWAC.    Each  municipality also  contracted  with  MMWAC to\n\ndeliver to  it the  solid waste  generated in  the community,\n\npaying MMWAC  whatever tipping  fee was  required to  produce\n\nrevenues to service its debt. \n\n     Because the  MMWAC incinerator-generator  facility would\n\nnot be ready before 1992,  MMWAC provided in the meantime for\n\nan alternative method of disposing of the  waste it received.\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\n\nFor  this interim period,  MMWAC contracted with  two related\n\nentities, Consolidated Waste Services and Consolidated  Waste\n\nTransportation (collectively,  \"the Consolidated  companies\")\n\nto operate  a transfer  station near  the MMWAC  construction\n\nsite.   A  transfer station  is a  collection point  at which\n\nwaste may be processed or repackaged before being sent to its\n\nfinal  destination.   MMWAC agreed  to  pay the  Consolidated\n\ncompanies $66 per  ton to receive the waste  delivered and to\n\ndispose of the waste until the MMWAC incinerator was ready to\n\noperate.  \n\n     MMWAC's initial tipping fee was set at  $75 per ton.  It\n\nis common in  waste collection for municipalities  to collect\n\nresidential trash themselves or to contract out this function\n\nbut  to require  commercial businesses  to contract  directly\n\nwith  private haulers  for  their  trash removal  facilities.\n\nUnder the municipalities' agreements with MMWAC and under the\n\nlocal flow control  ordinances, private trash haulers  in the\n\ntwelve municipalities and the  municipalities themselves were\n\neffectively required to  deliver their trash to  the transfer\n\nstation and pay the $75 per ton tipping fee to MMWAC.\n\n     Waste  Management   of  Maine,  Inc.  is   an  operating\n\nsubsidiary  of Waste  Management, Inc.,  one  of the  largest\n\nwaste  collection and  disposal  firms in  the  nation.   The\n\noperating  subsidiary  provides trash  collection  in various\n\nMaine  towns.    In  July 1990,  after  the  transfer station\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\n\nagreement between  MMWAC and the two  Consolidated companies,\n\nWaste  Management,   Inc.  acquired   the  two   Consolidated\n\ncompanies; and one of the two may thereafter have been merged\n\ninto  Waste  Management of  Maine.    We  refer to  all  four\n\ncompanies, collectively, as \"Waste Management.\"\n\n     Tri-State   Rubbish,   Inc.,  a   competitor   of  Waste\n\nManagement  of Maine, is  also in the  business of collecting\n\nand disposing of commercial  trash, including waste generated\n\nby various  customers in  Auburn.   Its affiliate,  Recycling\n\nUnlimited Services Corp., Inc., processes waste  and recovers\n\nfrom it recyclable  commodities.  Gary Hart  is the principal\n\nin both  businesses.  In 1990, Tri-State  Rubbish declined to\n\ndeliver to the Consolidated transfer station all of the waste\n\ncollected  by   Tri-State  Rubbish  in  Auburn.     Tri-State\n\nRubbish's  position was that waste capable of having recycled\n\ncommodities  extracted from it  was not covered  by the local\n\nflow control ordinance.\n\n     Auburn brought suit against Tri-State Rubbish in a Maine\n\nstate trial court in December 1990 to enjoin it from refusing\n\nto deliver all  of its Auburn waste to  the transfer station.\n\nIn  July   1992,  the  court  rejected   Tri-State  Rubbish's\n\ninterpretation  of Maine  law and  granted  an injunction  in\n\nfavor of Auburn.  City  of Auburn v. Tri-State Rubbish, Inc.,\r                                                                       \n\nNo.  CV-90-561 (Me. Sup.  Ct., Androscoggin County,  July 20,\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\n\n1992).  That case, we are told, is now on appeal to the Maine\n\nSupreme Judicial Court.\n\n     MMWAC's incinerator-generator  began operating  in early\n\n1992 and almost  at once MMWAC found that  the waste produced\n\nin the twelve  municipalities was not enough to  keep the new\n\nfacility operating  at an optimal  level.  This led  MMWAC to\n\nseek additional waste from outside  the member towns; it  did\n\nso  by  offering  a reduced  tipping  fee,  allegedly  $45 to\n\nmunicipalities who  were not members  of MMWAC and as  low as\n\n$28 to Waste Management of Maine for its delivery to MMWAC of\n\nwaste  collected  outside  the  twelve  communities.    These\n\nreduced fees were not made available to Tri-State Rubbish.\n\n     In   September   1992,  Tri-State   Rubbish,   Recycling\n\nUnlimited, and  Hart  (collectively  \"Tri-State\")  began  the\n\npresent suit in  federal district court.  The defendants were\n\nAuburn, MMWAC, and the four Waste Management companies: Waste\n\nManagement,  Inc., Waste  Management of  Maine,  and the  two\n\nConsolidated companies.  Based on the events described above,\n\nthe  complaint asserted federal and state antitrust claims, a\n\nclaim  of tortious  interference (by  Waste  Management) with\n\nTri-State's contractual relations, and claimed violations (by\n\nAuburn)  of 42  U.S.C.     1983 and  provisions  of the  U.S.\n\nConstitution.  \n\n     The defendants in  this federal action moved  to dismiss\n\nthe complaint under  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)  for failure to\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\n\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted.  The district\n\ncourt  granted  the motions,  concluding  that  the antitrust\n\nclaims  were barred by so-called \"state action\" immunity; the\n\nbases for dismissing  the other claims are  more conveniently\n\ndescribed  below as the separate claims  are discussed.  Tri-\r                                                                         \n\nState  Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste  Management, Inc., 803 F. Supp.\r                                                           \n\n451 (D. Me. 1992).  This appeal followed.1\n\n              II.  THE FEDERAL ANTITRUST CLAIMS\n\n     A  half century  ago the  Supreme  Court determined,  in\n\nParker v. Brown,  317 U.S. 341 (1943), that  Congress had not\r                           \n\nintended  the  federal  antitrust  laws  to  apply  to  trade\n\nrestraints  or  monopolies  imposed   by  state  governments.\n\nAlthough the antitrust  laws aim at competitive  markets, the\n\nCourt in  Parker recognized  that governments  often restrict\r                            \n\ncompetition  for public  purposes.    The  actions  of  state\n\ngovernments, no  less than  those of  the federal  government\n\nitself, were deemed not to fall within the constraints of the\n\nantitrust laws.\n\n     After  a certain  amount  of  wobbling,  it  has  become\n\nsettled  that municipalities  enjoy  the  protection  of  the\n\nParker doctrine if,  but only if, the conduct  in question is\r                  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n     1Although both sides have captioned their briefs to show\n\"Tri-State  Rubbish,   Inc.,  et  al.\"  as   the  plaintiffs-\nappellants,   the  notice  of  appeal  names  only  Tri-State\nRubbish,  Inc.  as the  appellant.    Our  caption and  other\nreferences  to  Hart  and  Recycling  Unlimited  are  without\nprejudice to  any consequences that  may flow on  remand from\nthe way the notice of appeal was framed.\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\n\nof  a kind  authorized or  directed  by state  law.   Town of\r                                                                         \n\nHallie v. City of Eau  Claire, 471 U.S. 34 (1985); Fisichelli\r                                                                         \n\nv. Town of Methuen, 956 F.2d 12  (1st Cir. 1992).  In general\r                              \n\nthis immunity is not defeated by claims that the municipality\n\n\"conspired\" with  a private party,  City of Columbia  v. Omni\r                                                                         \n\nOutdoor Advertising, Inc.,  111 S. Ct.  1344 (1991), or  that\r                                    \n\nthe   municipality  made   some   error   under  local   law.\n\nFisichelli, 956 F.2d at 14.\r                      \n\n     Count  I.    In  count  I of  its  complaint,  Tri-State\r                         \n\ncontends that in  violation of the Sherman Act,  15 U.S.C.   \n\n1-2, Auburn and MMWAC have  sought to monopolize and restrain\n\ntrade in the waste disposal  business in Auburn and the other\n\neleven municipalities.  The gist  of the claim, as elaborated\n\nin  Tri-State's brief, is simple: under the local ordinances,\n\nall solid waste  generated in the twelve  municipalities must\n\nbe turned  over to  MMWAC or  its designee.   Thus  the waste\n\ndisposal business  in these  locations, including  recyclable\n\nmaterials, is within the sway of one entity, MMWAC.\n\n     With  a couple of caveats, Tri-State concedes that state\n\naction  immunity is  available as  to  count I  if the  Maine\n\nlegislature  empowered  municipalities to  engross  all solid\n\nwaste including waste that might  be recycled.  But it argues\n\nthat Maine's policy is to promote the recovery  of recyclable\n\ncommodities  from  waste  before the  residue  is  burned for\n\nelectricity.  It derives this priority from  a declaration of\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\n\npolicy  in the Maine statute preceding the specific grants of\n\nauthority.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38,   1302, para. 2.  It\n\nurges  us to  read  the  Maine  legislation to  exclude  such\n\nrecyclable   waste  from   the   authorization  that   allows\n\nmunicipalities to control the disposition of solid waste.\n\n     The Maine statute explicitly  permits a municipality  to\n\nrequire that \"solid waste\" generated within its boundaries be\n\ndelivered to \"a designated disposal or reclamation facility,\"\n\nid.     1304-B(2),  reclamation  includes the  generation  of\r               \n\nelectricity,  id.,  and  solid waste  is  defined  to include\r                             \n\n\"useless, unwanted or discarded solid material.\"  Id.   1303-\r                                                                \n\nC(29).   The statutory definition  of solid waste goes  on to\n\nsay that \"[t]he fact that a solid waste or constituent of the\n\nwaste may have value or other use or may be sold or exchanged\n\ndoes not exclude it from this definition.\"   Id.   This final\r                                                            \n\nclause pretty much disposes of Tri-State's argument.\n\n     Statutes or ordinances similar to those involved in this\n\ncase exist elsewhere.   Tri-State  cites us  to several  that\n\nhave  been construed not to reach waste from which recyclable\n\ncommodities could  be extracted.   Yet the  case on  which it\n\nprincipally  relies  concerned  an  authorizing statute  that\n\nexcluded recyclables.2  By  contrast, the definitional phrase\r                    \n\n                    \r                                \n\n     2In Waste Management of the Desert, Inc. v.

The  district  court's\n\nreading of the Maine statute  follows its plain language, 803\n\nF.

By  statute MMWAC's directors  must be\n\nelected by  municipal officers and  are themselves  municipal\n\nofficers. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38,   1304-B(5).

Massachusetts  Port Authority,  816\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1987).3\n\n     Counts II, III  and III-A.  These  counts, which include\r                                          \n\nTri-State's  remaining  federal antitrust  claims,  present a\n\ndifferent  set  of  issues.   In  count  II  Tri-State  first\n\nchallenged   as   a   restraint  of   trade   and   attempted\n\nmonopolization   the   agreement   between   MMWAC  and   the\n\nConsolidated  companies.   As a  consequence  of the  interim\n\narrangements,   Tri-State  argues that  Waste  Management  of\n\nMaine was able  to offer \"predatory\"  prices to customers  in\n\nAuburn  and other MMWAC municipalities.  In Tri-State's view,\n\nthe  $66  per  ton  payment  by  MMWAC  to  the  Consolidated\n\ncompanies  for disposing of the waste allowed their affiliate\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     3The   only  participants  named  in  count  I  are  the\nmunicipalities  and MMWAC.  Since their conduct is authorized\nby  statute, the state action doctrine  applies.  Contrary to\nTri-State's     claim,      municipalities     (or      their\ninstrumentalities)  engaged in  state-authorized conduct  are\nnot  themselves  required  to be  further  supervised  by the\nstate.  See Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. at 47.\r                                      \n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\n\nWaste Management of  Maine effectively to reduce its  $75 per\n\nton tipping fee to $9 ($75 less $66) and thus steal away Tri-\n\nState's customers.4\n\n     Counts III  and III-A  concern the  activities of  Waste\n\nManagement of  Maine in  other non-MMWAC  communities.   This\n\ncompetitor, says Tri-State,  has been favored by MMWAC with a\n\nlow  tipping fee ($24  per ton), not  available to Tri-State,\n\nfor  \"foreign\"   waste  delivered  from  outside   the  MMWAC\n\nmunicipalities  to  the  new  incinerator-generator.5   As  a\n\nresult,  Tri-State  has  lost  customers  outside the  twelve\n\nmunicipalities  to \"low ball\" prices.  Further, the customers\n\nare \"lock[ed] up\" by exclusive dealing contracts and supplied\n\nwith  trash  containers  that  can be  used  only  for  Waste\n\nManagement trash.\n\n     In   analyzing   these   claims,   the  district   court\n\ndistinguished   between  MMWAC   and  the   Waste  Management\n\ncompanies.  As to the former, the court pointed  out that the\n\nparticipating  municipalities  were  empowered  by the  Maine\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     4Tri-State's assertion of a $9 per ton \"net\" tipping fee\nappears to be faulty  economics.  The $66 per ton  payment to\nthe Consolidated companies was to cover the cost of receiving\nand disposing of the  waste.  Whether or not the  cost to the\r                                                                  \nConsolidated companies  was actually $66  per ton, it  is not\nlikely to have been zero.\n\n     5The record does not explain why, given MMWAC's need for\nfuel, it would make sense for MMWAC to offer the  $24 tipping\nfee  exclusively  to Waste  Management  of Maine.    While we\naccept the allegation as true for purposes of this appeal, we\nnote that MMWAC's brief denies that this is what happened.\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\n\nstatute to control completely  the collection and disposition\n\nof  waste generated within their communities, dealing if they\n\nchose to do so  with a single entity.   803 F. Supp. at  458;\n\nMe. Rev.  Stat. Ann.  tit. 38,    1304-B(4).   Thus, assuming\n\nthat  MMWAC's  interim  arrangements  with  the  Consolidated\n\ncompanies favored  the Waste  Management companies over  Tri-\n\nState, MMWAC was protected by the state action doctrine.  \n\n     As to the conduct in  Counts III and III-A, the district\n\ncourt noted that  the Maine legislature clearly  contemplated\n\nthat municipalities could buy waste from other municipalities\n\nto  make up  any shortfall.   803 F.  Supp. at 459;  Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 38,    1304-B(4-A)(B).  A reduced tipping fee\n\nis merely one  way of  \"buying\" such waste.   Nothing in  the\n\nauthorizing statute says that the same price must  be offered\n\nto  everyone; on  the contrary  the need  for  long-term fuel\n\ncommitments,  recognized  elsewhere in  the statute,  see Me.\r                                                                     \n\nRev.  Stat.  Ann.   tit.  38,     1304-B(4),   suggests  that\n\narrangements  with one  or  a  few  suppliers  were  entirely\n\nforeseeable.  We  agree with the district court  that MMWAC's\n\nalleged  exclusive offer  of  the $24  tipping  fee to  Waste\n\nManagement  of  Maine  for foreign  waste  was  authorized by\n\nstatute and is protected by the state action doctrine.\n\n     A different, and  more difficult, issue is  presented by\n\nWaste  Management's claim  that it  too is  protected  by the\n\nstate  action   doctrine.    Tri-State   objects  that  Waste\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\n\nManagement,   at  least,  is  fully  subject  to  the  Midcal\r                                                                         \n\nrequirement that it  be supervised before any  of its actions\n\ncan be protected.  The district court agreed that supervision\n\nis  required.   But it  found that  municipal, as  opposed to\n\nstate, supervision is sufficient.  It further held  that this\n\nobligation was satisfied by MMWAC's obligation, undertaken in\n\nits contracts with  its municipality members, to  comply with\n\nall pertinent laws.  803 F. Supp. at 461.\n\n     We  agree with the  district court's view,  supported by\n\nthe  greater weight of  authority, that municipal supervision\n\nof private actors is adequate where authorized by or implicit\n\nin the  state legislation.  Although there  is some precedent\n\nto  the contrary,6 we share the view  of the Eighth and Ninth\n\nCircuits, endorsed  by the  leading antitrust  treatise, that\n\nmunicipal  supervision is  adequate.7   As Professors  Areeda\n\nand Hovenkamp note,  \"it would be implausible to  rule that a\n\ncity may regulate, say, taxi rates but only if a state agency\n\nalso  supervises the private taxi operators.\"  Antitrust Law,\r                                                                        \n\nsupra n.7, at 197.\r                 \n\n                    \r                                \n\n     6See,  e.g.,  Riverview   Investments,  Inc.  v.

To treat the mere receipt of such\n\nauthorized payments as  wrongful would  undermine the  Parker\r                                                                         \n\nprotection  afforded MMWAC  and mistake  the  purpose of  the\n\nsupervision requirement, which is to prevent the  unregulated\n\nlicensing of private anticompetitive conduct.\r                                \n\n     This analysis disposes of the claims under counts II and\n\nIII  against  all  parties  including  the  Waste  Management\n\ndefendants,  so far  as  those  claims  attack  the  official\n\nactions  of  MMWAC:    the  contract  between MMWAC  and  the\n\nConsolidated companies,  the  payments  to  the  Consolidated\n\ncompanies by  MMWAC, and  the tipping fees  set by  MMWAC for\n\nWaste  Management  of  Maine, whether  for  local  or foreign\n\nwaste.  It does not,  however, resolve the attacks, scattered\n\nthroughout counts  II, III, and III-A against  the conduct of\n\nWaste Management of Maine vis-a-vis its own customers.  These\n\nattacks  charge  Waste  Management  of Maine  with  predatory\n\npricing of its waste collection services,  wrongful exclusive\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\n\ndealing by long-term  contracts, and unreasonably restricting\n\nthe use of the containers it furnished.8\n\n     The Predation Claims.  The district court held that  the\r                                     \n\nWaste  Management  defendants  were  protected  as  to  their\n\ncustomer-related  conduct under  the  state action  doctrine.\n\nThe   court  reasoned  that   by  its  agreements   with  the\n\nmunicipalities, MMWAC had  committed itself to obey  the law;\n\nthat Waste  Management of Maine had  contractual arrangements\n\nwith  MMWAC;  and that  this  contractual  authority provided\n\nsufficient  municipal  supervision  to  cast  the garment  of\n\nParker  protection  over  Waste  Management  of  Maine's  own\r                  \n\nconduct.   803 F.  Supp. at 461.   The district  court noted,\n\nhowever, that the contracts had not been made available to it\n\nfor inspection.  Id.  We are not persuaded that the rates and\r                               \n\ncontract terms  Waste Management  set for  its own  customers\n\nhave been brought within Parker.\r                                           \n\n     There is simply nothing to which we have been pointed to\n\nshow that MMWAC has claimed or exercised any control whatever\n\nover the rates that Waste  Management of Maine charges to its\n\ncustomers or the other terms  (such as length of contract) on\n\nwhich it  deals.   While it is  conceivable (but  not proved)\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     8MMWAC is also  charged in these counts  but, apart from\nbare  references to  conspiracy,  there  is  nothing  in  the\ncomplaint  to connect  MMWAC with Waste  Management's actions\nvis-a-vis  its  own customers  except  the  favorable tipping\nfees.   Since the fee  payments are state  action, we do  not\nthink that any  claim has been stated against  MMWAC based on\nWaste Management's alleged predation.\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\n\nthat MMWAC  claims such  authority with  respect to  customer\n\ncontracts  in the  MMWAC communities,  it  is certainly  less\n\nlikely that it does so in the non-MMWAC communities which are\n\nthe locales for the predation  alleged in counts III and III-\n\nA.    Absent  a  showing  of  control,  questions   of  state\n\nauthorization and the adequacy  of official supervision  need\n\nnot even be reached.\n\n     It is a close question whether the judgment of dismissal\n\nshould  nevertheless  be affirmed  on an  alternative ground,\n\nnamely, that the allegations of the complaint fail to state a\n\npredation claim even if the state action doctrine is ignored.\n\nThis alternative course is urged by Waste Management, and  we\n\nhave  given it  serious consideration.    The requisites  for\n\nproving  predatory   pricing  are   demanding,  because   the\n\nconditions under which  it is plausible  are not common,  and\n\nbecause it  can  easily be  confused with  merely low  prices\n\nwhich  benefit customers.    See Barry  Wright  Corp. v.  ITT\r                                                                         \n\nGrinnell  Corp.,  724 F.2d  227 (1st  Cir. 1983).

The present complaint is, in a sense, both\n\nbetter and worse.  It is somewhat more specific, asserting at\n\none point  that the  prices  offered by  Waste Management  of\n\nMaine were as much as 50 percent below market rates, at other\n\nplaces that the rates were sometimes below variable cost, and\n\nthat the exclusive dealing contracts were for three years.  \n\n     At  the  same  time, the  complaint  goes  some distance\n\ntoward undermining  its own  predatory pricing  claim.   Tri-\n\nState implies that the low prices offered by Waste Management\n\nof Maine were,  in some instances at least, the result of the\n\nfavorable tipping fees  that MMWAC made available to  it.  If\n\nthis is the  whole of the charge, then  there is no predatory\n\npricing claim at  all.  A company that  rationally prices its\n\nown  product or service  at or above  its own  costs does not\n\nviolate the Sherman  Act merely because  its costs, and  thus\n\nits prices, are lower than a  rival's costs; and this is true\n\neven though its lower costs may be due to  the generosity, or\n\nfoolishness,  of another supplier who has charged the company\n\ntoo little for an input.   See generally Brooke Group Ltd. v.\r                                                                     \n\nBrown &amp; Williamson  Tobacco Corp., 61 U.S.L.W.  4699, 4702-03\r                                            \n\n(June 21, 1993).\n\n     Even  apart from  this  possible  explanation for  lower\n\nprices, Tri-State's predatory pricing claim is on the edge of\n\ninadequacy.    Although  the  complaint  asserts  that  Waste\n\nManagement is pricing below variable cost--the normal test of\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\n\npredation,  see Barry Wright--it  is not clear  what basis if\r                                        \n\nany  Tri-State has  for  this assertion.    The reference  to\n\nprices  50 percent below  customary prices might  invite some\n\nsuspicion, but in an industry like waste collection, in which\n\ncustomers  are scattered along  routes, the variable  cost of\n\nserving  additional customers  to piece  out a  route  may be\n\nextremely low.  \n\n     The claim that  the duration of the  exclusive contracts\n\nis unlawful is, if anything, an even thinner case on the face\n\nof  the complaint.   That  some  of the  contracts are  three\n\nyears,  the  only  specific in  the  complaint,  might invite\n\ncuriosity,   but  it  does   not  even  begin   to  establish\n\nillegality.  Under Tampa Electric  Co., it is the totality of\r                                                 \n\nreasons  for   such  a  term,   and  its  actual   impact  on\n\ncompetition, that are  decisive.  Here, we know nothing about\n\nthe  number   of  customers   affected,  the   size  of   any\n\ncancellation  penalty,  the  practice  in  the  industry,  or\n\nanything  else that  might help  to  paint a  picture of  the\n\ncompetitive scene.   Of course, a plaintiff is  required only\n\nto plead a claim, not to recite evidence, but the  essence of\n\na claim like this one lies in the details.\n\n     A final concern is that predatory pricing is a section 2\n\nclaim and is condemned only where it is part of an attempt to\n\nmonopolize or is used to secure or retain an actual monopoly.\n\nE.g.,  C.A.T. Industrial  Disposal,  Inc. v.  Browning-Ferris\r                                                                         \n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\n\nIndustries,  884  F.2d  209  (5th  Cir.  1989).9    Tri-State\r                      \n\ncertainly  does  allege both  the  aim  of monopoly  and  the\n\nactuality, but its complaint supplies very little information\n\n(e.g., market shares in a properly defined market) from which\r                 \n\none can frame a judgment whether this claim is plausible. The\n\ncomplaint  does say  that  Waste  Management,  Inc.  and  its\n\nsubsidiaries  are the  largest  waste  handling and  disposal\n\nbusiness in Maine and in the nation; but the primary issue is\n\ndominance  or  prospective dominance  in  a  properly defined\n\neconomic market.\n\n     One's first instinct  is that monopoly would  be hard to\n\nsustain in a business in which the basic equipment is a truck\n\nand entry is apparently easy.  See generally United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nWaste Management,  Inc., 743  F.2d 976 (2d  Cir. 1984).   But\r                                  \n\nwaste collection might in theory be subject to local monopoly\n\nin  some circumstances.  Thus, the efficiencies of collecting\n\nfrom a  number of closely  located customer sites  could make\n\nnew entry difficult,  especially if the community  were small\n\nand many customers  were tied to an existing  dominant hauler\n\nby long-term contracts; and environmental restrictions on new\n\nlandfills in some areas could  give a decisive advantage to a\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     9Exclusive  dealing, which  can be  attacked inter  alia\r                                                                         \nunder section  1 of the  Sherman Act, 15  U.S.C.   1,  can be\ncondemned without a showing that monopoly power is present or\nwithin reach.  But  the impact on competition is  part of the\nequation and, absent  a potential monopoly or  oligopoly, the\ncompetitive impact may be hard to establish.\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\n\nhauler that controlled  the only available facility.    There\n\nare some hints,  but only hints, in the  complaint that Waste\n\nManagement  of Maine  may enjoy an  advantage of  this latter\n\nsort.\n\n     Taking everything  together, we  think it  wiser not  to\n\naffirm  the  dismissal   of  the  predation  claims   on  the\n\nalternative ground.  Thin and doubtful though they may be, we\n\ncannot  say at  this stage  that these claims  are hopelessly\n\ninadequate if Parker's shield is removed.  The district court\r                                \n\ndid not rest its decision on that ground, and it has been the\n\nsubject of only a small portion of the briefs on this appeal.\n\nThe  old prejudice  against summary disposition  of antitrust\n\nclaims has diminished, First National Bank v. Cities Services\r                                                                         \n\nCo.,  391 U.S. 253  (1968), but the grant  of a Rule 12(b)(6)\r              \n\nmotion on the predation claims  would, at least at this time,\n\nbe a shade too summary.\n\n     We underscore the limited  nature of our remand.   These\n\nclaims  can be  stated, if  at  all, only  against the  Waste\n\nManagement  defendants.  The district court is fully entitled\n\nto demand more specific explanations from Tri-State as to the\n\ngray areas  in its predation claims, including  the basis for\n\nthe charge of pricing below  variable cost, the basis for the\n\nmarket definitions  urged, and the  basis for any  claim that\n\nmonopoly  power exists  or could  plausibly be  secured  in a\n\nproperly defined economic market.  Nothing in this opinion is\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\n\nintended  to preclude summary  disposition at a  later stage,\n\nand this need not  mean much later if  these claims prove  to\n\nhave little substance.10\n\n              III.  TRI-STATE'S REMAINING CLAIMS\n\n     Count IV  of the  complaint reasserts,  under the  Maine\n\nantitrust statute, the  federal antitrust claims made  in the\n\nearlier  counts.  The  Maine antitrust statutes  parallel the\n\nSherman Act,  see Me.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit.  10,     1101 et\r                                                                         \n\nseq., and Tri-State offers no separate argument for liability\r               \n\nunder state law.  In point  of fact, the Maine statute  under\n\nwhich MMWAC is organized also  has an explicit exemption from\n\nstate antitrust  laws for  specified  municipal contracts  or\n\nordinances.  Me.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  tit.  38,     1304-B(6).\n\nAccordingly,  the dismissal of  the state antitrust  claim is\n\nsustained except as to the predation claims against the Waste\n\nManagement defendants.\n\n     In  count V, Tri-State  claims that the  solicitation of\n\nTri-State  customers by  Waste  Management  of  Maine  was  a\n\nviolation of Maine law against interference with advantageous\n\ncontractual   relations.      The  gravamen   is   that  this\n\nsolicitation   was   unlawful    because   achieved   through\n\ndiscriminatory  tipping fees,  predatory  pricing, and  other\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     10The Waste  Management  defendants  are  also  free  to\npursue their Parker defense as  to the predation claims.  Our\r                               \nholding is that on this record there is an insufficient basis\nfor determining that  Parker immunity exists as  to the terms\r                                        \non which Waste Management of Maine deals with its customers.\n\n                             -22-\r                                         -22-\r\n\nwrongs.  The district court dismissed the count on the ground\n\nthat the  actions in  question were within  the ambit  of the\n\nstate  legislation  and  therefore  could  not  be  \"wrongful\n\ninterference.\"   803 F. Supp. at 463-64.  In this court, Tri-\n\nState  does not argue the claim  at length, asserting instead\n\nthat its tortious interference claim is \"contingent\" upon our\n\nfinding that  the alleged  anticompetitive conduct  enjoys no\n\nimmunity. \n\n     We   think   the   fixing  of   tipping   fees   by  the\n\nmunicipalities and MMWAC  is embraced by the  Maine statute--\n\nTri-State  makes  no  effort to  show  the  contrary--but, as\n\nearlier stated, we cannot find  on this record that the terms\n\non  which  Waste  Management  of Maine  dealt  with  its  own\n\ncustomers has been  the subject of regulation.   Accordingly,\n\ncount V, so  far as it makes allegations  against the private\n\ndefendants based on Waste Management of Maine's dealings with\n\nits own  customers,  is remanded  for consideration  together\n\nwith the predation claims.  Nothing in the complaint explains\n\nwhy  MMWAC is responsible for such contracts, however, and as\n\nto it the  dismissal of count  V is sustained for  failure to\n\nstate a claim.\n\n     Count  VI of  the  complaint asserts  a  claim under  42\n\nU.S.C.   1983 against Auburn.  In part, this count says  that\n\nthe  City  of  Auburn  injunction  action  against  Tri-State\r                                 \n\nrepresented  discriminatory prosecution  in violation  of due\n\n                             -23-\r                                         -23-\r\n\nprocess principles.  Count VII makes the same complaint based\n\non equal protection principles.   Count VIII, the final count\n\nof the complaint, re-asserts the allegations of counts VI and\n\nVII as violations of Maine's  own civil rights statutes.  Me.\n\nRev. Stat.  Ann., tit. 5,     4682-83.  On  appeal, Tri-State\n\nadvises that it elects not to press the selective prosecution\n\nissue in this court, reserving it for its state court appeal.\n\n     This leaves only Tri-State's final contention--the other\n\nsubject of its count  VI claim--that the Auburn  flow control\n\nordinance  is \"an  unconstitutional  taking of  [Tri-State's]\n\nproperty without compensation.\"  Tri-State's theory seems  to\n\nbe that  the Auburn flow control ordinance  has crippled Tri-\n\nState's waste disposal business.   This, says Tri-State, is a\n\nbusiness  in which  it has  engaged  for many  years and  its\n\ninterests in  continuing without  undue interference  deserve\n\nprotection as \"investment-backed expectations.\"  Penn Central\r                                                                         \n\nTransp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978).\r                                        \n\n     While the Supreme  Court did  use the  quoted phrase  to\n\ndescribe a pertinent consideration in takings cases, the Penn\r                                                                         \n\nCentral opinion actually reaffirms that government for public\r                   \n\npurposes   can,   without    compensation,   impose   general\n\nregulations that may  severely limit the value  of an ongoing\n\nbusiness.    The  Supreme  Court  has  in  fact twice  upheld\n\nmunicipal  ordinances  granting   one  waste  collector   the\n\nexclusive  right to collect  and dispose of  waste within the\n\n                             -24-\r                                         -24-\r\n\ncommunity,  putting  existing   haulers  out  of  business.11\n\nDespite  Tri-State's  claims that  these cases  are outdated,\n\nnothing in the  Supreme Court's more recent  decisions raises\n\nserious doubts about  their validity.  The  Sixth Circuit has\n\nrejected  an argument almost identical to Tri-State's.  Hybud\r                                                                         \n\nEquipment  Corp.  v.

This\n\ndoes not mean that there is no basis for Tri-State's concerns\n\nabout  the competitive impact  of the MMWAC  arrangements, or\n\nfor its assertion  that the plan is  unfair to it or  bad for\n\nrecycling.  But  government  action  may be  anticompetitive,\n\nunfair or unwise  without being illegal.   Absent illegality,\n\nthe solution lies with the legislature and not in the courts.\n\n     The  judgment of the  district court is  affirmed except\r                                                                  \n\nfor the dismissal  of the federal and state  antitrust claims\n\nin  counts II-V  and the tort  claim in  count VI  insofar as\n\nthose  counts charge  the  Waste  Management defendants  with\n\npredation   or   related   anticompetitive   conduct   toward\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     11See  California  Reduction Co.  v.

The  complaint  in  this case\r                                        \n\ncharged that a  number of entities, public  and private, were\n\nseeking  to  monopolize  the  waste  disposal   business  and\n\notherwise acting in violation of  federal and state law.  The\n\ndistrict court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a\n\nclaim.  We affirm the district court with one  exception:  as\n\nto the predation claims against the private defendants, we do\n\nnot think  that state  action immunity has  been made  out on\n\nthis  record, and therefore  remand those claims  for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                      I.  THE BACKGROUND\n\n     This case  is one  of several in  which state  and local\n\ncommunities  have taken  measures to  cope  with their  waste\n\ncollection responsibilities,  and private  haulers have  been\n\nadversely affected and  responded with antitrust suits.   The\n\ncases vary,  and in this one  the history is tangled  and the\n\nclaims  numerous.    In describing  the  facts,  we  take the\n\nallegations  of  the complaint  as true,  as is  customary in\n\nreviewing dismissals  for  failure to  state  a claim.    See\r                                                                         \n\nWatterson v.

Under  this legislative  umbrella,  the  City of\n\nAuburn and eleven  other municipalities formed in 1986 a non-\n\nprofit, non-stock  corporation to assist  in waste  disposal.\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\n\nThe entity--Mid-Maine Waste Action Corporation (\"MMWAC\")--was\n\nthen mandated to construct a facility to burn municipal waste\n\nand derive electricity from the process.  Maine law expressly\n\nauthorizes  municipalities to  cooperate  in   waste disposal\n\nprojects, Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit. 38,    2201, and provides\n\nfor interlocal agreements to  organize public waste  disposal\n\ncorporations to own or operate facilities.  Id.   1304-B(5).\r                                                          \n\n     MMWAC issued  over $42 million  in bonds to  construct a\n\nwaste-to-energy  facility.   The  bonds  were  to  be  funded\n\nthrough  so-called  \"tipping  fees,\" customarily  charged  to\n\nthose who  dispose of waste  at a landfill or  other disposal\n\nfacility,  and  through the  revenues  from the  sale  of the\n\nelectricity.   To  secure  the quantity  of  waste needed  to\n\noperate  the  facility  economically--that   is,  at  a  high\n\npercentage of its capacity--the  MMWAC municipalities enacted\n\nflow control ordinances.  These local laws, authorized by Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit.  38,   1304-B(2), required the  delivery\n\nof  all solid  waste generated  within  each municipality  to\n\nMMWAC.    Each  municipality also  contracted  with  MMWAC to\n\ndeliver to  it the  solid waste  generated in  the community,\n\npaying MMWAC  whatever tipping  fee was  required to  produce\n\nrevenues to service its debt. \n\n     Because the  MMWAC incinerator-generator  facility would\n\nnot be ready before 1992,  MMWAC provided in the meantime for\n\nan alternative method of disposing of the  waste it received.\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\n\nFor  this interim period,  MMWAC contracted with  two related\n\nentities, Consolidated Waste Services and Consolidated  Waste\n\nTransportation (collectively,  \"the Consolidated  companies\")\n\nto operate  a transfer  station near  the MMWAC  construction\n\nsite.   A  transfer station  is a  collection point  at which\n\nwaste may be processed or repackaged before being sent to its\n\nfinal  destination.   MMWAC agreed  to  pay the  Consolidated\n\ncompanies $66 per  ton to receive the waste  delivered and to\n\ndispose of the waste until the MMWAC incinerator was ready to\n\noperate.  \n\n     MMWAC's initial tipping fee was set at  $75 per ton.  It\n\nis common in  waste collection for municipalities  to collect\n\nresidential trash themselves or to contract out this function\n\nbut  to require  commercial businesses  to contract  directly\n\nwith  private haulers  for  their  trash removal  facilities.\n\nUnder the municipalities' agreements with MMWAC and under the\n\nlocal flow control  ordinances, private trash haulers  in the\n\ntwelve municipalities and the  municipalities themselves were\n\neffectively required to  deliver their trash to  the transfer\n\nstation and pay the $75 per ton tipping fee to MMWAC.\n\n     Waste  Management   of  Maine,  Inc.  is   an  operating\n\nsubsidiary  of Waste  Management, Inc.,  one  of the  largest\n\nwaste  collection and  disposal  firms in  the  nation.   The\n\noperating  subsidiary  provides trash  collection  in various\n\nMaine  towns.    In  July 1990,  after  the  transfer station\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\n\nagreement between  MMWAC and the two  Consolidated companies,\n\nWaste  Management,   Inc.  acquired   the  two   Consolidated\n\ncompanies; and one of the two may thereafter have been merged\n\ninto  Waste  Management of  Maine.    We  refer to  all  four\n\ncompanies, collectively, as \"Waste Management.\"\n\n     Tri-State   Rubbish,   Inc.,  a   competitor   of  Waste\n\nManagement  of Maine, is  also in the  business of collecting\n\nand disposing of commercial  trash, including waste generated\n\nby various  customers in  Auburn.   Its affiliate,  Recycling\n\nUnlimited Services Corp., Inc., processes waste  and recovers\n\nfrom it recyclable  commodities.  Gary Hart  is the principal\n\nin both  businesses.  In 1990, Tri-State  Rubbish declined to\n\ndeliver to the Consolidated transfer station all of the waste\n\ncollected  by   Tri-State  Rubbish  in  Auburn.     Tri-State\n\nRubbish's  position was that waste capable of having recycled\n\ncommodities  extracted from it  was not covered  by the local\n\nflow control ordinance.\n\n     Auburn brought suit against Tri-State Rubbish in a Maine\n\nstate trial court in December 1990 to enjoin it from refusing\n\nto deliver all  of its Auburn waste to  the transfer station.\n\nIn  July   1992,  the  court  rejected   Tri-State  Rubbish's\n\ninterpretation  of Maine  law and  granted  an injunction  in\n\nfavor of Auburn.  City  of Auburn v. Tri-State Rubbish, Inc.,\r                                                                       \n\nNo.  CV-90-561 (Me. Sup.

That case, we are told, is now on appeal to the Maine\n\nSupreme Judicial Court.\n\n     MMWAC's incinerator-generator  began operating  in early\n\n1992 and almost  at once MMWAC found that  the waste produced\n\nin the twelve  municipalities was not enough to  keep the new\n\nfacility operating  at an optimal  level.  This led  MMWAC to\n\nseek additional waste from outside  the member towns; it  did\n\nso  by  offering  a reduced  tipping  fee,  allegedly  $45 to\n\nmunicipalities who  were not members  of MMWAC and as  low as\n\n$28 to Waste Management of Maine for its delivery to MMWAC of\n\nwaste  collected  outside  the  twelve  communities.    These\n\nreduced fees were not made available to Tri-State Rubbish.\n\n     In   September   1992,  Tri-State   Rubbish,   Recycling\n\nUnlimited, and  Hart  (collectively  \"Tri-State\")  began  the\n\npresent suit in  federal district court.  The defendants were\n\nAuburn, MMWAC, and the four Waste Management companies: Waste\n\nManagement,  Inc., Waste  Management of  Maine,  and the  two\n\nConsolidated companies.  Based on the events described above,\n\nthe  complaint asserted federal and state antitrust claims, a\n\nclaim  of tortious  interference (by  Waste  Management) with\n\nTri-State's contractual relations, and claimed violations (by\n\nAuburn)  of 42  U.S.C.     1983 and  provisions  of the  U.S.\n\nConstitution.  \n\n     The defendants in  this federal action moved  to dismiss\n\nthe complaint under  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)  for failure to\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\n\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted.  The district\n\ncourt  granted  the motions,  concluding  that  the antitrust\n\nclaims  were barred by so-called \"state action\" immunity; the\n\nbases for dismissing  the other claims are  more conveniently\n\ndescribed  below as the separate claims  are discussed.

In  count  I of  its  complaint,  Tri-State\r                         \n\ncontends that in  violation of the Sherman Act,  15 U.S.C.   \n\n1-2, Auburn and MMWAC have  sought to monopolize and restrain\n\ntrade in the waste disposal  business in Auburn and the other\n\neleven municipalities.  The gist  of the claim, as elaborated\n\nin  Tri-State's brief, is simple: under the local ordinances,\n\nall solid waste  generated in the twelve  municipalities must\n\nbe turned  over to  MMWAC or  its designee.   Thus  the waste\n\ndisposal business  in these  locations, including  recyclable\n\nmaterials, is within the sway of one entity, MMWAC.\n\n     With  a couple of caveats, Tri-State concedes that state\n\naction  immunity is  available as  to  count I  if the  Maine\n\nlegislature  empowered  municipalities to  engross  all solid\n\nwaste including waste that might  be recycled.  But it argues\n\nthat Maine's policy is to promote the recovery  of recyclable\n\ncommodities  from  waste  before the  residue  is  burned for\n\nelectricity.  It derives this priority from  a declaration of\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\n\npolicy  in the Maine statute preceding the specific grants of\n\nauthority.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38,   1302, para. 2.  It\n\nurges  us to  read  the  Maine  legislation to  exclude  such\n\nrecyclable   waste  from   the   authorization  that   allows\n\nmunicipalities to control the disposition of solid waste.\n\n     The Maine statute explicitly  permits a municipality  to\n\nrequire that \"solid waste\" generated within its boundaries be\n\ndelivered to \"a designated disposal or reclamation facility,\"\n\nid.     1304-B(2),  reclamation  includes the  generation  of\r               \n\nelectricity,  id.,  and  solid waste  is  defined  to include\r                             \n\n\"useless, unwanted or discarded solid material.\"  Id.   1303-\r                                                                \n\nC(29).   The statutory definition  of solid waste goes  on to\n\nsay that \"[t]he fact that a solid waste or constituent of the\n\nwaste may have value or other use or may be sold or exchanged\n\ndoes not exclude it from this definition.\"   Id.

As to the former, the court pointed  out that the\n\nparticipating  municipalities  were  empowered  by the  Maine\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     4Tri-State's assertion of a $9 per ton \"net\" tipping fee\nappears to be faulty  economics.  The $66 per ton  payment to\nthe Consolidated companies was to cover the cost of receiving\nand disposing of the  waste.  Whether or not the  cost to the\r                                                                  \nConsolidated companies  was actually $66  per ton, it  is not\nlikely to have been zero.\n\n     5The record does not explain why, given MMWAC's need for\nfuel, it would make sense for MMWAC to offer the  $24 tipping\nfee  exclusively  to Waste  Management  of Maine.    While we\naccept the allegation as true for purposes of this appeal, we\nnote that MMWAC's brief denies that this is what happened.\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\n\nstatute to control completely  the collection and disposition\n\nof  waste generated within their communities, dealing if they\n\nchose to do so  with a single entity.   803 F. Supp. at  458;\n\nMe. Rev.  Stat. Ann.  tit. 38,    1304-B(4).   Thus, assuming\n\nthat  MMWAC's  interim  arrangements  with  the  Consolidated\n\ncompanies favored  the Waste  Management companies over  Tri-\n\nState, MMWAC was protected by the state action doctrine.  \n\n     As to the conduct in  Counts III and III-A, the district\n\ncourt noted that  the Maine legislature clearly  contemplated\n\nthat municipalities could buy waste from other municipalities\n\nto  make up  any shortfall.   803 F.  Supp. at 459;  Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 38,    1304-B(4-A)(B).  A reduced tipping fee\n\nis merely one  way of  \"buying\" such waste.   Nothing in  the\n\nauthorizing statute says that the same price must  be offered\n\nto  everyone; on  the contrary  the need  for  long-term fuel\n\ncommitments,  recognized  elsewhere in  the statute,  see Me.\r                                                                     \n\nRev.  Stat.  Ann.   tit.  38,     1304-B(4),   suggests  that\n\narrangements  with one  or  a  few  suppliers  were  entirely\n\nforeseeable.  We  agree with the district court  that MMWAC's\n\nalleged  exclusive offer  of  the $24  tipping  fee to  Waste\n\nManagement  of  Maine  for foreign  waste  was  authorized by\n\nstatute and is protected by the state action doctrine.\n\n     A different, and  more difficult, issue is  presented by\n\nWaste  Management's claim  that it  too is  protected  by the\n\nstate  action   doctrine.    Tri-State   objects  that  Waste\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\n\nManagement,   at  least,  is  fully  subject  to  the  Midcal\r                                                                         \n\nrequirement that it  be supervised before any  of its actions\n\ncan be protected.  The district court agreed that supervision\n\nis  required.   But it  found that  municipal, as  opposed to\n\nstate, supervision is sufficient.  It further held  that this\n\nobligation was satisfied by MMWAC's obligation, undertaken in\n\nits contracts with  its municipality members, to  comply with\n\nall pertinent laws.  803 F. Supp. at 461.\n\n     We  agree with the  district court's view,  supported by\n\nthe  greater weight of  authority, that municipal supervision\n\nof private actors is adequate where authorized by or implicit\n\nin the  state legislation.  Although there  is some precedent\n\nto  the contrary,6 we share the view  of the Eighth and Ninth\n\nCircuits, endorsed  by the  leading antitrust  treatise, that\n\nmunicipal  supervision is  adequate.7   As Professors  Areeda\n\nand Hovenkamp note,  \"it would be implausible to  rule that a\n\ncity may regulate, say, taxi rates but only if a state agency\n\nalso  supervises the private taxi operators.\"  Antitrust Law,\r                                                                        \n\nsupra n.7, at 197.\r                 \n\n                    \r                                \n\n     6See,  e.g.,  Riverview   Investments,  Inc.  v.

To treat the mere receipt of such\n\nauthorized payments as  wrongful would  undermine the  Parker\r                                                                         \n\nprotection  afforded MMWAC  and mistake  the  purpose of  the\n\nsupervision requirement, which is to prevent the  unregulated\n\nlicensing of private anticompetitive conduct.\r                                \n\n     This analysis disposes of the claims under counts II and\n\nIII  against  all  parties  including  the  Waste  Management\n\ndefendants,  so far  as  those  claims  attack  the  official\n\nactions  of  MMWAC:    the  contract  between MMWAC  and  the\n\nConsolidated companies,  the  payments  to  the  Consolidated\n\ncompanies by  MMWAC, and  the tipping fees  set by  MMWAC for\n\nWaste  Management  of  Maine, whether  for  local  or foreign\n\nwaste.  It does not,  however, resolve the attacks, scattered\n\nthroughout counts  II, III, and III-A against  the conduct of\n\nWaste Management of Maine vis-a-vis its own customers.  These\n\nattacks  charge  Waste  Management  of Maine  with  predatory\n\npricing of its waste collection services,  wrongful exclusive\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\n\ndealing by long-term  contracts, and unreasonably restricting\n\nthe use of the containers it furnished.8\n\n     The Predation Claims.  The district court held that  the\r                                     \n\nWaste  Management  defendants  were  protected  as  to  their\n\ncustomer-related  conduct under  the  state action  doctrine.\n\nThe   court  reasoned  that   by  its  agreements   with  the\n\nmunicipalities, MMWAC had  committed itself to obey  the law;\n\nthat Waste  Management of Maine had  contractual arrangements\n\nwith  MMWAC;  and that  this  contractual  authority provided\n\nsufficient  municipal  supervision  to  cast  the garment  of\n\nParker  protection  over  Waste  Management  of  Maine's  own\r                  \n\nconduct.   803 F.  Supp. at 461.   The district  court noted,\n\nhowever, that the contracts had not been made available to it\n\nfor inspection.  Id.  We are not persuaded that the rates and\r                               \n\ncontract terms  Waste Management  set for  its own  customers\n\nhave been brought within Parker.\r                                           \n\n     There is simply nothing to which we have been pointed to\n\nshow that MMWAC has claimed or exercised any control whatever\n\nover the rates that Waste  Management of Maine charges to its\n\ncustomers or the other terms  (such as length of contract) on\n\nwhich it  deals.   While it is  conceivable (but  not proved)\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     8MMWAC is also  charged in these counts  but, apart from\nbare  references to  conspiracy,  there  is  nothing  in  the\ncomplaint  to connect  MMWAC with Waste  Management's actions\nvis-a-vis  its  own customers  except  the  favorable tipping\nfees.   Since the fee  payments are state  action, we do  not\nthink that any  claim has been stated against  MMWAC based on\nWaste Management's alleged predation.\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\n\nthat MMWAC  claims such  authority with  respect to  customer\n\ncontracts  in the  MMWAC communities,  it  is certainly  less\n\nlikely that it does so in the non-MMWAC communities which are\n\nthe locales for the predation  alleged in counts III and III-\n\nA.    Absent  a  showing  of  control,  questions   of  state\n\nauthorization and the adequacy  of official supervision  need\n\nnot even be reached.\n\n     It is a close question whether the judgment of dismissal\n\nshould  nevertheless  be affirmed  on an  alternative ground,\n\nnamely, that the allegations of the complaint fail to state a\n\npredation claim even if the state action doctrine is ignored.\n\nThis alternative course is urged by Waste Management, and  we\n\nhave  given it  serious consideration.    The requisites  for\n\nproving  predatory   pricing  are   demanding,  because   the\n\nconditions under which  it is plausible  are not common,  and\n\nbecause it  can  easily be  confused with  merely low  prices\n\nwhich  benefit customers.

The present complaint is, in a sense, both\n\nbetter and worse.  It is somewhat more specific, asserting at\n\none point  that the  prices  offered by  Waste Management  of\n\nMaine were as much as 50 percent below market rates, at other\n\nplaces that the rates were sometimes below variable cost, and\n\nthat the exclusive dealing contracts were for three years.  \n\n     At  the  same  time, the  complaint  goes  some distance\n\ntoward undermining  its own  predatory pricing  claim.   Tri-\n\nState implies that the low prices offered by Waste Management\n\nof Maine were,  in some instances at least, the result of the\n\nfavorable tipping fees  that MMWAC made available to  it.  If\n\nthis is the  whole of the charge, then  there is no predatory\n\npricing claim at  all.  A company that  rationally prices its\n\nown  product or service  at or above  its own  costs does not\n\nviolate the Sherman  Act merely because  its costs, and  thus\n\nits prices, are lower than a  rival's costs; and this is true\n\neven though its lower costs may be due to  the generosity, or\n\nfoolishness,  of another supplier who has charged the company\n\ntoo little for an input.   See generally Brooke Group Ltd. v.\r                                                                     \n\nBrown &amp; Williamson  Tobacco Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.L.W.</span>  <span class=\"page\">4699</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4702-03\r                                            \n\n(June 21, 1993).\n\n     Even  apart from  this  possible  explanation for  lower\n\nprices, Tri-State's predatory pricing claim is on the edge of\n\ninadequacy.    Although  the  complaint  asserts  that  Waste\n\nManagement is pricing below variable cost--the normal test of\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\n\npredation,  see Barry Wright--it  is not clear  what basis if\r                                        \n\nany  Tri-State has  for  this assertion.    The reference  to\n\nprices  50 percent below  customary prices might  invite some\n\nsuspicion, but in an industry like waste collection, in which\n\ncustomers  are scattered along  routes, the variable  cost of\n\nserving  additional customers  to piece  out a  route  may be\n\nextremely low.  \n\n     The claim that  the duration of the  exclusive contracts\n\nis unlawful is, if anything, an even thinner case on the face\n\nof  the complaint.   That  some  of the  contracts are  three\n\nyears,  the  only  specific in  the  complaint,  might invite\n\ncuriosity,   but  it  does   not  even  begin   to  establish\n\nillegality.  Under Tampa Electric  Co., it is the totality of\r                                                 \n\nreasons  for   such  a  term,   and  its  actual   impact  on\n\ncompetition, that are  decisive.  Here, we know nothing about\n\nthe  number   of  customers   affected,  the   size  of   any\n\ncancellation  penalty,  the  practice  in  the  industry,  or\n\nanything  else that  might help  to  paint a  picture of  the\n\ncompetitive scene.   Of course, a plaintiff is  required only\n\nto plead a claim, not to recite evidence, but the  essence of\n\na claim like this one lies in the details.\n\n     A final concern is that predatory pricing is a section 2\n\nclaim and is condemned only where it is part of an attempt to\n\nmonopolize or is used to secure or retain an actual monopoly.\n\nE.g.,  C.A.T.

There\n\nare some hints,  but only hints, in the  complaint that Waste\n\nManagement  of Maine  may enjoy an  advantage of  this latter\n\nsort.\n\n     Taking everything  together, we  think it  wiser not  to\n\naffirm  the  dismissal   of  the  predation  claims   on  the\n\nalternative ground.  Thin and doubtful though they may be, we\n\ncannot  say at  this stage  that these claims  are hopelessly\n\ninadequate if Parker's shield is removed.  The district court\r                                \n\ndid not rest its decision on that ground, and it has been the\n\nsubject of only a small portion of the briefs on this appeal.\n\nThe  old prejudice  against summary disposition  of antitrust\n\nclaims has diminished, First National Bank v.

These\n\nclaims  can be  stated, if  at  all, only  against the  Waste\n\nManagement  defendants.  The district court is fully entitled\n\nto demand more specific explanations from Tri-State as to the\n\ngray areas  in its predation claims, including  the basis for\n\nthe charge of pricing below  variable cost, the basis for the\n\nmarket definitions  urged, and the  basis for any  claim that\n\nmonopoly  power exists  or could  plausibly be  secured  in a\n\nproperly defined economic market.  Nothing in this opinion is\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\n\nintended  to preclude summary  disposition at a  later stage,\n\nand this need not  mean much later if  these claims prove  to\n\nhave little substance.10\n\n              III.  TRI-STATE'S REMAINING CLAIMS\n\n     Count IV  of the  complaint reasserts,  under the  Maine\n\nantitrust statute, the  federal antitrust claims made  in the\n\nearlier  counts.  The  Maine antitrust statutes  parallel the\n\nSherman Act,  see Me.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit.  10,     1101 et\r                                                                         \n\nseq., and Tri-State offers no separate argument for liability\r               \n\nunder state law.  In point  of fact, the Maine statute  under\n\nwhich MMWAC is organized also  has an explicit exemption from\n\nstate antitrust  laws for  specified  municipal contracts  or\n\nordinances.  Me.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  tit.  38,     1304-B(6).\n\nAccordingly,  the dismissal of  the state antitrust  claim is\n\nsustained except as to the predation claims against the Waste\n\nManagement defendants.\n\n     In  count V, Tri-State  claims that the  solicitation of\n\nTri-State  customers by  Waste  Management  of  Maine  was  a\n\nviolation of Maine law against interference with advantageous\n\ncontractual   relations.      The  gravamen   is   that  this\n\nsolicitation   was   unlawful    because   achieved   through\n\ndiscriminatory  tipping fees,  predatory  pricing, and  other\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     10The Waste  Management  defendants  are  also  free  to\npursue their Parker defense as  to the predation claims.  Our\r                               \nholding is that on this record there is an insufficient basis\nfor determining that  Parker immunity exists as  to the terms\r                                        \non which Waste Management of Maine deals with its customers.\n\n                             -22-\r                                         -22-\r\n\nwrongs.  The district court dismissed the count on the ground\n\nthat the  actions in  question were within  the ambit  of the\n\nstate  legislation  and  therefore  could  not  be  \"wrongful\n\ninterference.\"   803 F. Supp. at 463-64.  In this court, Tri-\n\nState  does not argue the claim  at length, asserting instead\n\nthat its tortious interference claim is \"contingent\" upon our\n\nfinding that  the alleged  anticompetitive conduct  enjoys no\n\nimmunity. \n\n     We   think   the   fixing  of   tipping   fees   by  the\n\nmunicipalities and MMWAC  is embraced by the  Maine statute--\n\nTri-State  makes  no  effort to  show  the  contrary--but, as\n\nearlier stated, we cannot find  on this record that the terms\n\non  which  Waste  Management  of Maine  dealt  with  its  own\n\ncustomers has been  the subject of regulation.   Accordingly,\n\ncount V, so  far as it makes allegations  against the private\n\ndefendants based on Waste Management of Maine's dealings with\n\nits own  customers,  is remanded  for consideration  together\n\nwith the predation claims.  Nothing in the complaint explains\n\nwhy  MMWAC is responsible for such contracts, however, and as\n\nto it the  dismissal of count  V is sustained for  failure to\n\nstate a claim.\n\n     Count  VI of  the  complaint asserts  a  claim under  42\n\nU.S.C.   1983 against Auburn.  In part, this count says  that\n\nthe  City  of  Auburn  injunction  action  against  Tri-State\r                                 \n\nrepresented  discriminatory prosecution  in violation  of due\n\n                             -23-\r                                         -23-\r\n\nprocess principles.  Count VII makes the same complaint based\n\non equal protection principles.   Count VIII, the final count\n\nof the complaint, re-asserts the allegations of counts VI and\n\nVII as violations of Maine's  own civil rights statutes.  Me.\n\nRev. Stat.  Ann., tit. 5,     4682-83.  On  appeal, Tri-State\n\nadvises that it elects not to press the selective prosecution\n\nissue in this court, reserving it for its state court appeal.\n\n     This leaves only Tri-State's final contention--the other\n\nsubject of its count  VI claim--that the Auburn  flow control\n\nordinance  is \"an  unconstitutional  taking of  [Tri-State's]\n\nproperty without compensation.\"  Tri-State's theory seems  to\n\nbe that  the Auburn flow control ordinance  has crippled Tri-\n\nState's waste disposal business.   This, says Tri-State, is a\n\nbusiness  in which  it has  engaged  for many  years and  its\n\ninterests in  continuing without  undue interference  deserve\n\nprotection as \"investment-backed expectations.\"  Penn Central\r                                                                         \n\nTransp.
