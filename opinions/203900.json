Plaintiff   Jorge    E.    Aponte-\n\nHernández appeals from the judgment of the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico in favor of Defendants Ana\n\nCruz-Vélez and Héctor Montañez-Reyes based upon the jury’s verdict\n\nafter trial, dismissing Plaintiff’s suit brought under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983. Plaintiff’s complaint alleged that the defendants engaged in\n\nmalicious and retaliatory prosecution of criminal charges related\n\nto his role as director of the Puerto Rico Office of Management and\n\nBudget (“OMB”).       He contends on appeal that the jury’s verdict was\n\nagainst the weight of the evidence and that the district court\n\nshould therefore have granted him a new trial.                    We find the\n\nevidence appropriately sustained the verdict and therefore affirm\n\nthe judgment.\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n            Aponte-Hernández was director of Puerto Rico’s OMB in the\n\n1990s.     In 1997 and 1998, his office was responsible for a real\n\nestate transaction in which the government purchased an office\n\nbuilding at four times the price at which it was originally\n\noffered.    The transaction was reviewed by a Blue Ribbon Commission\n\ncreated    by   the    then-governor    of   Puerto   Rico   to   investigate\n\ncorruption.     The Blue Ribbon Commission determined that Aponte-\n\nHernández’s     role    in   the     transaction   exhibited      a     lack   of\n\nprofessionalism and that his agency had acted in a “gross and\n\nunforgivably negligent manner.”              Accordingly, the Blue Ribbon\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCommission recommended that the Puerto Rico Department of Justice\n\nconsider    filing   a   civil   case    against   Aponte-Hernández.     The\n\nDepartment of Justice referred the matter to a Special Independent\n\nProsecutor (“SIP”) tasked with investigating public officials.\n\nUpon the expiration of the contract of the person initially acting\n\nas SIP on Plaintiff’s case, Defendant Cruz-Vélez took over the\n\nprosecution, with Defendant Montañez-Reyes acting as her deputy.\n\nCruz-Vélez recommended and ultimately brought criminal charges\n\nagainst Aponte-Hernández for violating 33 L.P.R.A. § 4391, which\n\nimposes criminal liability on a public official who “[n]eglects or\n\nfails to safekeep or disburse public funds as prescribed by law.”\n\nAt the eventual criminal trial of those charges, Aponte-Hernández\n\nwas “peremptorily” acquitted by the trial judge for “total lack of\n\nevidence.”\n\n            Plaintiff then filed this action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court against Cruz-Vélez, Montañez-Reyes, and José Pérez-\n\nRodríguez, who worked with them on the prosecution of Plaintiff’s\n\ncase.1     The complaint asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983,\n\n1985, and 1986, alleging that the defendants engaged in malicious\n\nand   retaliatory    prosecution.         The   district   court   eventually\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      His complaint also named the governor of Puerto Rico, as well\nas various John Doe defendants who were never identified.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fdismissed all claims except the claims against Cruz-Vélez and\n\nMontañez-Reyes pursuant to § 1983.2\n\n          During trial Aponte-Hernández took the witness stand and\n\ncalled several witnesses, including his former OMB subordinate Juan\n\nEmmanuelli,    the    original      prosecutor        on   his    case,      his   former\n\nattorney, and the appraiser and original owner of the property at\n\nissue in the investigation, as well as Defendants Cruz-Vélez and\n\nPérez-Rodríguez.          The defendants presented direct testimony by\n\nCruz-Vélez    and    otherwise      relied       on   cross-examination            of   the\n\nplaintiff’s witnesses.\n\n          After a brief deliberation, the jury delivered a verdict\n\nin favor of the defendants.          Plaintiff moved, pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 59, for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was\n\nagainst the weight of the evidence.              Before sending the case to the\n\njury, the trial judge expressed his view (out of the earshot of the\n\njury) that “the prosecution of Mr. Aponte was a total abuse. . . .\n\nThere was no reason in law or in fact to proceed with that\n\nprosecution.    .     .    .   I   think    this      is   a     case   of    malicious\n\nprosecution.”       Nonetheless, the court denied the motion for a new\n\ntrial.   The trial court explained that the case was not for him,\n\nbut for the jury to decide.          The judge added:            “This record fully\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Aponte-Hernández does not appeal from the dismissal of the\nclaims against Cruz-Vélez and Montañez-Reyes under §§ 1985 and 1986\nor the dismissal of the claims against the other defendants.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fsupports the jury verdict.        The jury could have easily” found for\n\nthe defendants.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n              On appeal, Plaintiff contends that the jury’s verdict in\n\nfavor of Cruz-Vélez and Montañez-Reyes regarding his claim under §\n\n1983 was against the weight of the evidence, and that the district\n\ncourt erroneously denied his motion for a new trial.              In order to\n\nprevail in establishing such a claim on appeal, the appellant must\n\nshow that the district court’s ruling was “a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion,” Marcoux v. Shell Oil Prods. Co. LLC, 524 F.3d 33, 40\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. George, 448 F.3d 96, 101\n\n(1st   Cir.    2006)),   and    that   the   weight   of   the   evidence   is\n\n“grotequely lopsided” in his favor, Freeman v. Package Machinery\n\nCo., 865 F.2d 1331, 1334 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n              The only issue in significant dispute at trial was\n\nwhether the defendants acted with malice in the face of clear\n\nabsence of probable cause in prosecuting the criminal charges\n\nagainst the Plaintiff.         Because at the initiation of the criminal\n\ncase against him a Puerto Rico court had found probable cause to\n\ncharge him, Aponte-Hernández attempted to show that the defendants\n\nknowingly presented false or tainted evidence at the probable cause\n\nhearing to secure this finding.\n\n              The main evidence Plaintiff presented in support         of his\n\nclaim was as follows.      Plaintiff’s former attorney testified that\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fone   of   the   original    prosecutors      (who    was    replaced   by   the\n\ndefendants) told him that there was no evidence against Aponte-\n\nHernández, but to avoid prosecution, Aponte-Hernández would have to\n\nprovide evidence linking other officials to the real estate deal\n\nunder investigation. Plaintiff also asserted that the prosecutors’\n\nmalice was demonstrated by the fact that the charging document,\n\nprepared by the defendants, accused him of “unlawful, willful,\n\nmalicious, criminal and intentional” conduct, while, as Cruz-Vélez\n\nadmitted on cross-examination, the law required a showing of only\n\nnegligence on his part to sustain a criminal conviction. Plaintiff\n\nrelied also on Cruz-Vélez’s admission that she introduced a “draft”\n\nof an expert report at the probable cause hearing to support the\n\nargument that the real estate in question had been appraised at an\n\ninflated value, and that she introduced a document regarding the\n\ninitial offer to sell the real estate in question, three pages of\n\nwhich had not been faxed to the OMB at the time.                        Finally,\n\nPlaintiff   relied   on     the   testimony   of     his    former   subordinate\n\nEmmanuelli, to the effect that he felt threatened and harassed by\n\nthe prosecutors when they interviewed him, and that this caused him\n\nto sign an immunity agreement and alter his testimony.                Plaintiff\n\nsuggests that this evidence was uncontroverted at trial, and\n\noverwhelmingly demonstrated the defendants’ malice.\n\n            In fact, however, this evidence was controverted through\n\nthe direct testimony of Cruz-Vélez and through cross-examination of\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fPlaintiff’s      witnesses.     In    her    testimony,   Cruz-Vélez    offered\n\nalternative      explanations        for    the   actions      that   Plaintiff\n\ncharacterized as malicious and fraudulent. For example, Cruz-Vélez\n\ntestified that the phrase “unlawful, willful, malicious, criminal\n\nand intentional” in the charging document was pro forma language\n\nconventionally used for accusations filed in state court and did\n\nnot manifest a desire on her part to smear the plaintiff.               As for\n\nthe   prior    prosecutor’s    comments      to   Aponte-Hernández’s     former\n\ncounsel, she testified that she was unaware of them, and that, in\n\nany event, her predecessor had said nothing of the kind to her.              In\n\naddition she testified that if any of the evidence she introduced\n\nat the probable cause hearing was questionable, she had presented\n\nit innocently, and without malice or intent to deceive.                Finally,\n\nCruz-Vélez emphasized that the decision to prosecute was consistent\n\nwith the findings of the Blue Ribbon Commission and the Department\n\nof    Justice.      And   as   for    the    testimony    of   Emmanuelli,   he\n\nacknowledged on cross-examination by the defendants that the only\n\nalterations to his testimony suggested by the prosecutors were\n\nstylistic rather than substantive, and confirmed that the testimony\n\nhe gave in the criminal proceeding against Aponte-Hernández was\n\ntrue.\n\n              Accordingly, all of Plaintiff’s evidence of malice and\n\nfraud on the part of the defendants was controverted.                      With\n\nevidence on both sides of the crucial issue of the defendants’\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fmalice,   the    jury     could   properly   have    credited     Cruz-Vélez’s\n\ntestimony.      The jury could also have weighed the conflicting\n\nevidence and concluded that Aponte-Hernández, who had the burden of\n\nproof, failed to prove malice or a lack of probable cause by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\n\n           In    short,     the   evidence   was    disputed;     it   was   not\n\n“grotesquely lopsided” in favor of Aponte-Hernández.              Freeman, 865\n\nF.2d at 1334.        In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the\n\njury to find in favor of the defendants, and the trial judge acted\n\nwell within his discretion in denying Plaintiff’s motion for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n           In support of his claim that the district judge abused\n\nhis discretion in declining to grant a new trial, Plaintiff points\n\nto the trial judge’s own statements expressing his opinion that the\n\nprosecution was malicious.        The problem with Plaintiff’s reliance\n\non the trial judge’s remarks is that, in denying Plaintiff’s motion\n\nfor a new trial, the trial judge recognized that conflicting\n\nevidence, and observed that the jury’s verdict was reasonably\n\nsupported by the evidence.        In light of the disputed evidence, the\n\ntrial judge and the jury might well have credited, and discredited,\n\ndifferent versions of the contested facts and drawn different, but\n\nequally permissible, inferences from the facts.             See Freeman, 865\n\nF.2d at 1334.        After stating his view that the Plaintiff had been\n\nthe   victim    of    malicious   prosecution,      the   judge   added   that,\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fnotwithstanding his personal opinion, the case was for the jury to\n\ndecide.\n\n          There was evidence which, if credited by the jury,\n\nsupported a verdict in the defendants’ favor. The evidence was not\n\n“grotesquely lopsided.”   Id.   Accordingly, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in refusing to set aside the jury verdict and\n\ngrant a new trial.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

Because at the initiation of the criminal\n\ncase against him a Puerto Rico court had found probable cause to\n\ncharge him, Aponte-Hernández attempted to show that the defendants\n\nknowingly presented false or tainted evidence at the probable cause\n\nhearing to secure this finding.\n\n              The main evidence Plaintiff presented in support         of his\n\nclaim was as follows.      Plaintiff’s former attorney testified that\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fone   of   the   original    prosecutors      (who    was    replaced   by   the\n\ndefendants) told him that there was no evidence against Aponte-\n\nHernández, but to avoid prosecution, Aponte-Hernández would have to\n\nprovide evidence linking other officials to the real estate deal\n\nunder investigation. Plaintiff also asserted that the prosecutors’\n\nmalice was demonstrated by the fact that the charging document,\n\nprepared by the defendants, accused him of “unlawful, willful,\n\nmalicious, criminal and intentional” conduct, while, as Cruz-Vélez\n\nadmitted on cross-examination, the law required a showing of only\n\nnegligence on his part to sustain a criminal conviction. Plaintiff\n\nrelied also on Cruz-Vélez’s admission that she introduced a “draft”\n\nof an expert report at the probable cause hearing to support the\n\nargument that the real estate in question had been appraised at an\n\ninflated value, and that she introduced a document regarding the\n\ninitial offer to sell the real estate in question, three pages of\n\nwhich had not been faxed to the OMB at the time.                        Finally,\n\nPlaintiff   relied   on     the   testimony   of     his    former   subordinate\n\nEmmanuelli, to the effect that he felt threatened and harassed by\n\nthe prosecutors when they interviewed him, and that this caused him\n\nto sign an immunity agreement and alter his testimony.                Plaintiff\n\nsuggests that this evidence was uncontroverted at trial, and\n\noverwhelmingly demonstrated the defendants’ malice.\n\n            In fact, however, this evidence was controverted through\n\nthe direct testimony of Cruz-Vélez and through cross-examination of\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fPlaintiff’s      witnesses.     In    her    testimony,   Cruz-Vélez    offered\n\nalternative      explanations        for    the   actions      that   Plaintiff\n\ncharacterized as malicious and fraudulent. For example, Cruz-Vélez\n\ntestified that the phrase “unlawful, willful, malicious, criminal\n\nand intentional” in the charging document was pro forma language\n\nconventionally used for accusations filed in state court and did\n\nnot manifest a desire on her part to smear the plaintiff.               As for\n\nthe   prior    prosecutor’s    comments      to   Aponte-Hernández’s     former\n\ncounsel, she testified that she was unaware of them, and that, in\n\nany event, her predecessor had said nothing of the kind to her.              In\n\naddition she testified that if any of the evidence she introduced\n\nat the probable cause hearing was questionable, she had presented\n\nit innocently, and without malice or intent to deceive.                Finally,\n\nCruz-Vélez emphasized that the decision to prosecute was consistent\n\nwith the findings of the Blue Ribbon Commission and the Department\n\nof    Justice.      And   as   for    the    testimony    of   Emmanuelli,   he\n\nacknowledged on cross-examination by the defendants that the only\n\nalterations to his testimony suggested by the prosecutors were\n\nstylistic rather than substantive, and confirmed that the testimony\n\nhe gave in the criminal proceeding against Aponte-Hernández was\n\ntrue.\n\n              Accordingly, all of Plaintiff’s evidence of malice and\n\nfraud on the part of the defendants was controverted.                      With\n\nevidence on both sides of the crucial issue of the defendants’\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fmalice,   the    jury     could   properly   have    credited     Cruz-Vélez’s\n\ntestimony.      The jury could also have weighed the conflicting\n\nevidence and concluded that Aponte-Hernández, who had the burden of\n\nproof, failed to prove malice or a lack of probable cause by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\n\n           In    short,     the   evidence   was    disputed;     it   was   not\n\n“grotesquely lopsided” in favor of Aponte-Hernández.              Freeman, 865\n\nF.2d at 1334.        In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the\n\njury to find in favor of the defendants, and the trial judge acted\n\nwell within his discretion in denying Plaintiff’s motion for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n           In support of his claim that the district judge abused\n\nhis discretion in declining to grant a new trial, Plaintiff points\n\nto the trial judge’s own statements expressing his opinion that the\n\nprosecution was malicious.        The problem with Plaintiff’s reliance\n\non the trial judge’s remarks is that, in denying Plaintiff’s motion\n\nfor a new trial, the trial judge recognized that conflicting\n\nevidence, and observed that the jury’s verdict was reasonably\n\nsupported by the evidence.        In light of the disputed evidence, the\n\ntrial judge and the jury might well have credited, and discredited,\n\ndifferent versions of the contested facts and drawn different, but\n\nequally permissible, inferences from the facts.             See Freeman, 865\n\nF.2d at 1334.        After stating his view that the Plaintiff had been\n\nthe   victim    of    malicious   prosecution,      the   judge   added   that,\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fnotwithstanding his personal opinion, the case was for the jury to\n\ndecide.\n\n          There was evidence which, if credited by the jury,\n\nsupported a verdict in the defendants’ favor. The evidence was not\n\n“grotesquely lopsided.”   Id.   Accordingly, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in refusing to set aside the jury verdict and\n\ngrant a new trial.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f</pre>",
