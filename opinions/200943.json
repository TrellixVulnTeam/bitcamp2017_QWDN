Cicilline on brief for appellant Amaury González.\n    Amaury González on supplemental brief pro se.\n    John M. Cicilline on brief for appellant Julian Martínez.\n\f     Craig N. Moore, Acting United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, and Adi Goldstein,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on consolidated brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        March 30, 2004\n\f          Per   Curiam.        Defendants   Amaury   Gonzalez   and   Julian\n\nMartinez were indicted, along with Lenaur Hidalgo, on drug offenses\n\ninvolving cocaine distribution in Providence, Rhode Island.             All\n\nthree eventually pled guilty in the district court to conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2000), as well\n\nas   multiple   counts    of   substantive    cocaine-related    offenses.\n\nGonzalez and Martinez now appeal, each raising separate issues with\n\nrespect to the sentences imposed on them by the district court.\n\n           Gonzalez argues that the district court erred in finding\n\nhim a career offender under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 (2002), a finding that\n\nhad the effect of raising his base offense level from 26 to 34.\n\nSee § 4B1.1(b).   § 4B1.1(a) says:\n\n          A defendant is a career offender if (1) the\n          defendant was at least eighteen years old at\n          the time the defendant committed the instant\n          offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense\n          of conviction is a felony that is either a\n          crime of violence or a controlled substance\n          offense; and (3) the defendant has at least\n          two prior felony convictions of either a crime\n          of violence or a controlled substance offense.\n\nGonzalez's argument centers on the third requirement for career\n\noffender status: he claims that, although he did have two prior\n\nfelony convictions for crimes involving controlled substances, the\n\ndistrict court failed to treat those convictions as \"related,\" and\n\nso not counted separately, for purposes of applying the guideline.\n\n           U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(c) says, in relevant part:\n\n           The term \"two prior felony convictions\" means\n           (1) the defendant committed the instant\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          offense of conviction subsequent to sustaining\n          at least two felony convictions of either a\n          crime of violence or a controlled substance\n          offense . . . , and (2) the sentences for at\n          least two of the aforementioned felony\n          convictions are counted separately under the\n          provisions of §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c).\n\nTo determine whether sentences are counted separately under the\n\nprovisions of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(a), (b), or (c), it is necessary to\n\nlook to § 4A1.2(a)(2), which says: \"Prior sentences imposed in\n\nunrelated cases are to be counted separately.      Prior sentences\n\nimposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for\n\npurposes of § 4A1.1(a), (b), and (c).\"    Section 4A1.2(a)(2) does\n\nnot set forth any criteria for determining whether prior sentences\n\nare \"related\" or \"unrelated,\" but the accompanying commentary says:\n\n          Related Cases.     Prior sentences are not\n          considered related if they were for offenses\n          that were separated by an intervening arrest\n          (i.e., the defendant is arrested for the first\n          offense prior to committing the second\n          offense).    Otherwise, prior sentences are\n          considered related if they resulted from\n          offenses that (A) occurred on the same\n          occasion, (B) were part of a single common\n          scheme or plan, or (C) were consolidated for\n          trial or sentencing.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2, cmt. n.3.\n\n          Gonzalez indisputably has two prior felony convictions\n\nfor controlled substances offenses, one in August of 1998 and one\n\nin February of 1999.   He also concedes that the two offenses \"were\n\nseparated by an intervening arrest,\" which, according to the\n\ncommentary quoted above, would make the convictions unrelated\n\n\n                                -4-\n\funder      section    4A1.2.    Gonzalez's     only    argument    is   that   the\n\ncommentary should not be followed because it changes the meaning\n\nof section 4A1.2, which does not itself define \"related\" or\n\n\"unrelated\" sentences.\n\n                 The commentary contained in the Sentencing Guidelines is\n\nbinding unless there is a conflict between the commentary and the\n\ntext of the particular guideline at issue.                  Stinson v. United\n\nStates, 508 U.S. 36, 42-47 (1993).              Here, there is no conflict\n\nbetween          section   4A1.2,     which   contains      no    criteria     for\n\ndistinguishing between \"related\" and \"unrelated\" sentences, and\n\nthe commentary, which clarifies the meaning of these otherwise\n\nambiguous terms.           This conclusion accords with that of every\n\ncircuit to consider the issue.1               Since the intervening arrest\n\nresolves the question, we have no cause to consider Gonzalez's\n\nargument that his prior convictions are otherwise related.\n\n                 Gonzalez also argues, in a supplemental pro se brief,\n\nthat       the    career   offender    provision      of   the   guidelines     is\n\nunconstitutional because federal law cannot use state convictions\n\n\n       1\n      United States v. Duty, 302 F.3d 1240, 1241-42 (11th Cir.\n2002); United States v. Peltier, 276 F.3d 1003, 1006-07 (8th Cir.\n2002); United States v. Bradley, 218 F.3d 670, 672-74 (7th Cir.\n2000); United States v.

Wilson, 41 F.3d 1403, 1404-05\n(10th Cir. 1994) (same).\n\n                                        -5-\n\ffor career offender classification purposes.          Gonzalez contends\n\nthat to do so violates the presumption of innocence and principles\n\nof federalism.      Gonzalez concedes that he did not make this\n\nargument before the district court, and therefore, our review is\n\nfor plain error only.       United States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             There is no error, plain or otherwise, in the reliance\n\nupon state convictions.        \"Once a defendant has been afforded a\n\nfair trial and convicted of the offense for which he was charged,\n\nthe presumption of innocence disappears.\" Herrera v. Collins, 506\n\nU.S. 390, 399 (1993).       Nor do principles of federalism bar federal\n\nreliance on a state conviction.       Custis v. United States, 511 U.S.\n\n485, 496-97 (1994) (prior state convictions may constitutionally\n\nbe used for sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal\n\nAct); see generally United States v. Hornick, 214 F. Supp. 2d 6,\n\n9-10   (D.    Me.   2002)     (rejecting   an   argument   identical   to\n\nGonzalez's).\n\n             Martinez (the other defendant in this appeal) argues\n\nthat the district court erred in denying him a mitigating role\n\nadjustment under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 (2002).\n\n             Role-in-the-offense determinations are almost\n             always factbound.   With respect to downward\n             role-in-the-offense adjustments, the defendant\n             bears the burden of proof. United States v.\n             Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir. 1990).\n             Appellate review is highly deferential: the\n             sentencing   court's   determination    of   a\n             defendant's role is reviewed only for clear\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           error.

Graciani,\n           61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nUnited States v. Martinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d 245, 250 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n           Section 3B1.2 authorizes a district court to reduce a\n\ndefendant's base offense level if it finds that the defendant was\n\na \"minor participant\" or a \"minimal participant\" in \"any criminal\n\nactivity,\" with \"minimal participant\" status carrying the greater\n\nreduction.   \"To obtain a reduction for minor participant status,\n\na defendant must prove that he is both less culpable than most\n\nother persons involved in the offense of conviction and less\n\nculpable than most other persons convicted of comparable crimes.\"\n\nMartinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d at 250; see also United States v.\n\nMolina-Marrero, 320 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir. 2003).                 Martinez has\n\nfailed to make such a showing.\n\n           The    government's    case      against   the   three    defendants\n\nrested on nine undercover drug purchases.             For each purchase, the\n\ngovernment's undercover agent would negotiate the deal over the\n\nphone with either Gonzalez or Hidalgo.              Then, either Gonzalez or\n\nHidalgo   would   be   driven    to   meet    the   undercover      agent   at   a\n\npredetermined location.     In all of the transactions, Gonzalez or\n\nHidalgo would exit the car they arrived in, enter the agent's car,\n\nand then sell cocaine to the agent.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            In the first six transactions, the undercover agent was\n\nunable to identify who drove Gonzalez or Hidalgo to the meeting;\n\nbut in each of the last three, the agent identified Martinez as\n\nthe driver.     Martinez was also the driver for a proposed tenth\n\ntransaction, which was never completed because the defendants were\n\narrested before the deal could be completed.           Martinez claims that\n\nbecause his role in each of the transactions was limited to simply\n\ndriving Gonzalez or Hidalgo to and from the proposed meeting\n\nplace, he should be entitled to a mitigating role adjustment.\n\n            Even if Martinez's role were limited to that of driver,\n\nthat would not necessarily, without more, prove that he deserved\n\na role adjustment.          See United States v. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109\n\nF.3d 64, 73-74 (1st Cir. 1993).         In any event, Martinez admitted\n\nthat he had weighed and packaged cocaine and that he had used\n\nhidden compartments located in at least two different cars to\n\nconceal and transport drugs and money.          Martinez was paid $900 a\n\nweek for his services.\n\n            Based on these facts we cannot say that the district\n\ncourt    clearly    erred    in   denying   Martinez   a   mitigating      role\n\nadjustment for being a \"minor\" participant.              Because to qualify\n\nfor     \"minimal\"   participant     status    requires     a   defendant     to\n\ndemonstrate a level of culpability lower than that of a \"minor\"\n\nparticipant, Martinez's alternative claim to \"minimal\" participant\n\nstatus fails a fortiori.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -9-\n\f",

All three eventually pled guilty in the district court to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (2000), as well as multiple counts of substantive cocaine-related offenses. Gonzalez and Martinez now appeal, each raising separate issues with respect to the sentences imposed on them by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez argues that the district court erred in finding him a career offender under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1 (2002), a finding that had the effect of raising his base offense level from 26 to 34. <i>See</i> &#167; 4B1.1(b). &#167; 4B1.1(a) says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez's argument centers on the third requirement for career offender status: he claims that, although he did have two prior felony convictions for crimes involving controlled substances, the district court failed to treat those convictions as \"related,\" and so not counted separately, for purposes of applying the guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(c) says, in relevant part: The term \"two prior felony convictions\" means (1) the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense ..., and (2) the sentences for at least two of the aforementioned felony convictions are counted separately under the provisions of &#167; 4A1.1(a), (b), or (c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether sentences are counted separately under the provisions of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(a), (b), or (c), it is necessary to look to &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2), which says: \"Prior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted separately. Prior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for purposes of &#167; 4A1.1(a), (b), and (c).\" Section 4A1.2(a)(2) does not set forth any criteria for determining whether prior sentences are \"related\" or \"unrelated,\" but the accompanying commentary says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Related Cases.</i> Prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (<i>i.e.,</i> the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). Otherwise, prior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that (A) occurred on the same occasion, (B) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez indisputably has two prior felony convictions for controlled substances offenses, one in August of 1998 and one in February of 1999. He also concedes that the two offenses \"were separated by an intervening arrest,\" which, according to the commentary quoted above, would make the convictions unrelated under section 4A1.2. Gonzalez's only argument is that the commentary should not be followed because it changes the meaning of section 4A1.2, which does not itself define \"related\" or \"unrelated\" sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commentary contained in the Sentencing Guidelines is binding unless there is a conflict between the commentary and the text of the particular guideline at issue. <i>Stinson v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> (1993). Here, there is no conflict between section 4A1.2, which contains no criteria for distinguishing between \"related\" and \"unrelated\" sentences, and the commentary, which clarifies the meaning of these otherwise ambiguous terms. This conclusion accords with that of every circuit to consider the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Since the intervening arrest resolves the question, we have no cause to consider Gonzalez's argument that his prior convictions are otherwise related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez also argues, in a supplemental pro se brief, that the career offender provision of the guidelines is unconstitutional because federal law cannot use state convictions for career offender classification purposes. Gonzalez contends that to do so violates the presumption of innocence and principles of federalism. Gonzalez concedes that he did not make this argument before the district court, and therefore, our review is for plain error only. <i>United States v.
