Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                 Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                      and Fusté,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Melvin Norris, with whom Richard J.

Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Jennifer\nHay Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                           August 16, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f             FUSTÉ, District Judge. Sean Stark appeals his conviction\n\nand sentence for conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to\n\ndistribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2007).    For the reasons\n\nstated below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                  I.\n\n                              Background\n\n             At approximately 12:30 p.m. on October 22, 2003, while\n\ndriving from Arizona to Massachusetts in an RV, Stark and a\n\ncompanion, Christopher Sugar,1 were stopped in Missouri by Deputy\n\nSheriff Carmelo Crivello after their RV crossed the fog line and\n\nswerved onto the right shoulder.    The stop was based on an alleged\n\ntraffic violation of § 304.015.5 of the Missouri Code, which\n\nrequires vehicles to drive within a single lane “as nearly as\n\npracticable.”     See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 304.015.5 (2007).   During the\n\nstop, Crivello found that Stark and his companion were acting in a\n\nsuspicious manner and asked if they would consent to a search of\n\ntheir RV.    After they refused, he called a drug-sniffing dog to the\n\nscene.      Crivello told the men that they could go to a nearby\n\nrestaurant or hotel to wait for the canine but they chose to stay\n\nwith the RV.       Ten to fifteen minutes later, the canine unit\n\narrived.     After the dog alerted to the right rear of the RV, the\n\npolice conducted a warrantless search of the vehicle.      They found\n\n376.9 pounds of marijuana and a gun belonging to Stark.\n\n     1\n         The charges against Sugar were dismissed.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f           Stark and his companion were arrested and brought to a\n\ndetention facility in the Phelps County Sheriff’s Department, where\n\nStark was interrogated by Detective Richard Hope.         He confessed to\n\nthe crime after he received a Miranda warning (“first confession”),\n\nand agreed to cooperate with the police in making a controlled\n\ndelivery   of   the   marijuana.   A     few   hours   later,    Stark   was\n\ninterrogated by Agents Robert Hanson and Leslee Tate from the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration (“DEA”) in St. Louis.                After Stark\n\nreceived another Miranda warning, he confessed to the crime a\n\nsecond time (“second confession”), stating that he was hired to\n\ndeliver the 376.9 pounds of marijuana to Massachusetts. Stark also\n\nconfirmed his desire to cooperate.\n\n           The following day, on October 23, 2002, after a third\n\nMiranda warning, Stark signed a statement of rights, as well as a\n\nprompt presentation waiver form, by which he waived his right to be\n\nimmediately brought before a magistrate judge in the jurisdiction\n\nin which he was arrested.     Hanson and Tate then drove Stark from\n\nSt. Louis to Massachusetts.        The trip took twenty-three hours,\n\nduring which time Stark had a chance to rest in the RV and eat\n\nduring rest stops.     While he was in the RV, Stark was handcuffed\n\nwith his hands in front of him, but he was de-cuffed during rest\n\nstops.\n\n           When they arrived in Massachusetts at 10:30 a.m. on\n\nOctober 24, 2002, DEA Agent David O’Neill took custody of Stark.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fHe   gave    Stark   a   fourth   Miranda    warning   and   de-cuffed    him.\n\nAccording to Stark, O’Neill then asked him “to bring him up to\n\nspeed,” and had him sign a confidential source agreement.                After\n\nStark confessed to the crime a third time (“third confession”), he\n\nand O’Neill prepared for the controlled delivery of the marijuana.\n\nStark made suggestions as to how to best carry out the plan, and\n\nhelped prepare the RV.        As a result of the sting operation, the\n\ngovernment arrested three co-conspirators, Fabian Ruiz, Anibal\n\nTorres, and Trevor Teague.        Stark and the others were indicted for\n\nconspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.2\n\n             Before trial, the district court granted Stark’s motion\n\nto suppress the marijuana, finding that the initial traffic stop,\n\nthe detention of Stark and his companion while they waited for the\n\ncanine unit to arrive, and the search of the RV violated Stark’s\n\nFourth      Amendment    rights   (“the     unlawful   search”).   Although\n\n§ 304.015.5 of the Missouri Code does not explain what it means to\n\ndrive “as nearly as practicable” in a single lane, the district\n\ncourt concluded that an isolated incident of swerving was not a\n\nviolation of the statute because it is common for large vehicles,\n\nsuch as Stark’s RV, to weave into other lanes.               The court also\n\nfound that it was unreasonable to detain Stark and his companion\n\n\n      2\n       After the return of the indictment, Stark withdrew his\ncooperation bid. Torres, one of his codefendants, assumed the role\nof cooperator and testified as a government witness against Stark.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fand to search the RV because their stories were consistent, their\n\nlicenses   were    valid,   and     they   had   no   criminal     histories.\n\nAccordingly, the marijuana and the gun were suppressed.\n\n           Stark    also    moved    to    suppress    all    three   of    his\n\nconfessions,   asserting     that    they,    like    the    marijuana,    were\n\npoisonous fruits of the unlawful search of the RV.               The district\n\ncourt suppressed the first two confessions but found that Stark’s\n\nthird confession was admissible because it was made voluntarily and\n\nwas sufficiently attenuated from the illegal search.\n\n           Subsequently, the government filed a motion in limine to\n\nclarify whether the district court’s suppression order also applied\n\nto testimony relating to the illegally-seized marijuana. It sought\n\nto admit, inter alia, testimony from Torres describing how he\n\nunloaded the marijuana from Stark’s RV, and testimony regarding the\n\ndrug amount.   The district court ruled in favor of the government,\n\nbut stated that the testimony could not refer to the unlawful\n\nsearch and noted that it would provide the jury with limiting\n\ninstructions during the trial if necessary.\n\n           On December 14, 2005, after a three-day jury trial, Stark\n\nwas found guilty.    He was sentenced on April 13, 2006, to a term of\n\nsixty months of imprisonment, to be followed by forty-eight months\n\nof supervised release.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                                    II.\n\n                                Analysis\n\n          Stark argues that the district court: (1) should have\n\nsuppressed his third confession; (2) mistakenly admitted suppressed\n\nevidence at trial; (3) misled the jury in responding to a question\n\nregarding O’Neill’s testimony; (4) erroneously failed to enter a\n\njudgment of acquittal; and (5) improperly found that Stark did not\n\nqualify for a safety valve sentence reduction.            We address each\n\nargument in turn.\n\nA.        Stark’s Motion To Suppress His Third Confession\n\n          “We review a district court’s finding of fact for clear\n\nerror, but give de novo consideration to its legal conclusions.”\n\nUnited States v. Campa, 234 F.3d 733, 737 (1st Cir. 2000).                 “In\n\ndetermining   the   outcome   [of   a   motion   to   suppress]    under   the\n\nattenuation doctrine, the court of appeals does not defer to the\n\ndistrict court.”    United States v. Paradis, 351 F.3d 21, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 2003); accord United States v. Hughes, 279 F.3d 86, 89 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n          Stark contends that his third confession should have been\n\nsuppressed as fruit of the unlawful search of his RV.             However, it\n\nis well-settled that a court “need not hold that all evidence is\n\n‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ simply because it would not have come\n\nto light but for the illegal actions of the police.”              Wong Sun v.\n\nUnited States, 371 U.S. 471, 487-88 (1963).             A confession made\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fafter an illegal search may be admitted if it was obtained “by\n\nmeans sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary\n\ntaint.”     Id. at 488 (internal quotations omitted). To determine\n\nwhether the initial taint has been removed, we must balance the\n\nfollowing    factors:      (1)    the    voluntariness        of    the    statement;\n\n(2) “[t]he temporal proximity” of the illegal search and the\n\nconfession; (3) “the presence of intervening circumstances”; and\n\n(4) “the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct” (“Brown\n\nfactors”).    Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 603-04 (1975).\n\n            The district court found that the Brown factors counseled\n\nagainst suppressing Stark’s third confession because it was made\n\nvoluntarily two days after the illegal search; Stark was rested,\n\nfed, and de-cuffed; the confession was made to a new officer and in\n\na new location; and the initial search and seizure was not an\n\negregious violation of the Fourth Amendment.                  We agree.\n\n            There    are    numerous        indicators       that    Stark’s    third\n\nconfession was voluntary, thus meeting the first of the Brown\n\nfactors.     The first of these is the fact that Stark received a\n\nrenewed    Miranda   warning        before     making   his    third      confession.\n\nDunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 217 (1979) (stating that “a\n\nconfession     after       proper       Miranda    warnings         may    be   found\n\n‘voluntary’”). In addition, Stark’s proactive role in the planning\n\nof the controlled delivery demonstrated that he was “not acting\n\nfrom   compulsion,      but      in   the      spirit   of     self-interest      and\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fcooperation” in making his third confession.             See United States v.\n\nPatino,   862       F.2d   128,   133-34   (7th   Cir.   1988)    (finding     that\n\ndefendant’s decision to cooperate with the FBI and actively assist\n\nthem with their investigation indicated that her second confession\n\nwas voluntary).\n\n              The    second    Brown   factor,    temporal      proximity,     also\n\ncounsels against suppression.          Stark gave his third confession two\n\ndays after the illegal search, which was arguably a sufficient\n\namount of time for him to reflect on his predicament and determine\n\nwhether he wanted to speak with an attorney before making any\n\nfurther statements.           Compare Brown, 422 U.S. at 604-05 (stating\n\nthat two hours was insufficient), with United States v. Oliver, No.\n\n01-1108, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 26500, at *4-5 (10th Cir. Dec. 12,\n\n2001) (concluding that eleven hours was sufficient); United States\n\nv. Wesela, 223 F.3d 656, 662 (7th Cir. 2000) (finding that six days\n\nwas adequate).         Stark counters that two days was insufficient\n\nbecause he was in police custody the entire time.                 However, this\n\nfact is not dispositive in cases where, as here, the conditions of\n\ndetention were favorable, marked by rest and food.                Compare Taylor\n\nv. Alabama, 457 U.S. 687, 691 (1982) (concluding that six hours was\n\ntoo temporally proximate because defendant was in police custody\n\nthe entire time and was subjected to several interrogations,\n\nfingerprinting and a lineup); United States v. Webster, 750 F.2d\n\n307,   313,    325    (5th    Cir.   1984)    (finding   that    ten   hours    was\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\finsufficient because, inter alia, defendant was in police custody\n\nand was sleep deprived, having spent the previous night in the\n\nwoods hiding from police), with Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98,\n\n107-08 (1980) (finding that forty-five minutes was sufficient\n\nbecause, inter alia, defendants were detained in their home and\n\nable to move around freely); Oliver, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 26500, at\n\n*4-5 (stating that eleven hours was adequate because, although\n\ndefendant was in police custody, “he was apparently left alone by\n\nofficers” during that time).\n\n            We also find that a significant intervening event took\n\nplace, satisfying the third Brown factor.           Stark gave his third\n\nconfession to O’Neill, a new DEA agent in a new location, and at a\n\ntime when he was rested, fed, and de-cuffed.            United States v.\n\nAyres,    725   F.2d   806,   810   (1st    Cir.   1984)   (finding   that\n\ninterrogation by a new officer in a new location when defendant was\n\n“relaxed, composed and uncoerced” sufficiently dissipated “whatever\n\ntaint may have infected his prior statements”).\n\n            The final Brown factor, which analyzes the purpose and\n\nflagrancy of the official misconduct, weighs against suppression as\n\nwell.    This is the most important part of the analysis “because it\n\nis tied directly to the rationale underlying the exclusionary rule,\n\ndeterrence of police misconduct.”         United States v. Reed, 349 F.3d\n\n457, 464-65 (7th Cir. 2003). In analyzing this factor, courts look\n\nto see whether: (a) the police used threatening or abusive tactics;\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f(b) the “impropriety of the [initial misconduct] was obvious”; and\n\n(c) the initial search was a mere evidence expedition calculated to\n\nelicit a confession.      Brown, 422 U.S. at 605; see also Patino, 862\n\nF.2d at 134.\n\n            The type of misconduct that the Supreme Court has found\n\nto warrant suppression of evidence is readily distinguishable from\n\nthe facts of the instant case.                For example, in Brown, two\n\ndetectives   broke   into   and   searched     the   defendant’s    apartment\n\nwithout probable cause and, upon the defendant’s arrival at his\n\napartment, pointed a gun at his head and arrested him merely for\n\nfurther investigation and questioning.               422 U.S. at 592, 605.\n\nSimilarly, in Wong Sun, six or seven officers went to the business\n\nof a man who was thought to be a heroin dealer, forcibly opened his\n\ndoor,    followed   him   into   his    bedroom,   and   almost   immediately\n\nhandcuffed and arrested him without probable cause.               371 U.S. at\n\n474, 486.\n\n            The coercive tactics used by police officials in Brown\n\nand Wong Sun were certainly not at play here during the initial\n\ntraffic stop, continued detention, or search of the RV. Crivello’s\n\ndecision to effectuate the traffic stop was also not an obvious\n\nerror.    Brown, 422 U.S. at 605 (suppressing evidence after finding\n\nthat the “impropriety of the [initial misconduct] was obvious”).\n\nAlthough the district court found the stop was not justified\n\nbecause a single instance of swerving over the fog line did not\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fviolate the statute, this may not have been apparent to Crivello\n\nbecause the statute does not define what it means to drive “as\n\nnearly   as    practicable”   in   one   lane.   See    Mo.   Rev.   Stat.   §\n\n304.015.5.      The ambiguity of this statute is further supported by\n\nthe fact that several federal courts, in analyzing similarly-worded\n\nstatutes, have found that an isolated instance of crossing over the\n\nfog line was sufficient to violate the statute.          See United States\n\nv. Herrera-Gonzalez, 474 F.3d 1105, 1109-10 (8th Cir. 2007) (citing\n\nseveral examples of such cases).\n\n              Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s refusal to\n\nsuppress Stark’s third confession.\n\nB.            Evidence Admitted At Trial\n\n              Stark appeals the admission of O’Neill’s and Torres’\n\ntestimony regarding the marijuana delivery, and O’Neill’s testimony\n\nregarding Stark’s arrest.\n\n              Although Stark opposed the admission of these testimonies\n\nat the motion in limine hearing, he failed to properly preserve\n\nthese    issues    for   appellate    review.3   We    review   unpreserved\n\n\n\n     3\n       Stark’s objections to the motion in limine should have been\nrenewed at trial because the district court instructed Stark to do\nso, and because its ruling on the motion was not final and\nunconditional. See Fed. Ins. Co. v. HPSC, Inc., 480 F.3d 26, 33\n(1st Cir. 2007) (stating that a district court’s ruling on a motion\nin limine must be final and unconditional to preserve the issue for\nappeal); Jenkins v. Keating, 147 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir. 1998)\n(finding that the party that unsuccessfully opposes a motion in\nlimine must renew its objections at trial if the court invites or\ntells the party to do so).\n\n                                     -11-\n\fchallenges to a district court’s evidentiary rulings for plain\n\nerror pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b). United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733-34 (1993) (citing Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 52(b) (2007)).      Under this standard of review, the error must be\n\n“clear or, equivalently, obvious,” and it must “affect substantial\n\nrights.”     Id. at 734 (internal quotations omitted).                 To “affect\n\nsubstantial rights,” the plain error must have been prejudicial\n\nsuch that it “seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.”                   Id. at 734, 736.         The\n\ndefendant bears the burden of persuasion to show prejudice. Id. at\n\n734.\n\n           1.         Marijuana Testimony\n\n           Stark challenges O’Neill’s testimony stating that Stark\n\ntold him that he was “employed by a Fabian Ruiz to transport what\n\nhe   approximated     to    be   350   pounds     of   marijuana”   and   Torres’\n\ntestimony stating that he and others “unload[ed] marijuana into\n\n[his] trunk.”     Stark argues, without citing to any legal support,\n\nthat   these    statements       violated   the   court’s     suppression   order\n\nbecause they referenced the seized marijuana.\n\n           While the exclusionary rule equally applies to verbal\n\nstatements, such testimony may be admitted if it is sufficiently\n\nattenuated     from   the    illegal    search.         See   United   States    v.\n\nCeccolini, 435 U.S. 268, 273-76 (1978). We have already determined\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fthat O’Neill’s testimony, which merely reiterated Stark’s third\n\nconfession, was sufficiently attenuated.\n\n          Although Stark has failed to brief this issue with regard\n\nto Torres’ testimony, it is clear that Torres’ statement was not\n\nprejudicial,     given    that    it     merely    corroborated     Stark’s   own\n\nconfession     that      Torres    was     involved     in    the    conspiracy.\n\nAccordingly, the district court did not commit plain error in\n\nadmitting O’Neill’s and Torres’ statements regarding the marijuana.\n\n          2.          Arrest Testimony\n\n          Similarly, the district court did not commit plain error\n\nin   admitting    O’Neill’s       testimony       regarding   Stark’s   arrest.4\n\nContrary to Stark’s contention, O’Neill’s testimony did not reveal\n\nanything about the unlawful traffic stop or the seized marijuana.\n\nO’Neill merely stated that Stark was under arrest by the time they\n\nmet, without providing any details of the circumstances of the\n\narrest.   Therefore, we find that O’Neill’s mention of Stark’s\n\narrest does not rise to the level of plain error.                    See United\n\nStates v. McIntyre, 997 F.2d 687, 696 n.5 (10th Cir. 1993) (finding\n\nthat the officer’s testimony regarding defendant’s arrest did not\n\nviolate court’s order suppressing marijuana because it did not\n\nstate that the marijuana was the cause of the arrest).\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       O’Neill was asked “when you first met [Stark], was he under\narrest?” and he responded “yes, he was.”\n\n                                       -13-\n\fC.            Jury Instruction Regarding Stark’s Arrest\n\n              Stark challenges the district court’s response to the\n\njury’s question asking whether they could consider testimony by\n\nO’Neill stating that “he met Stark at his arrest and Mirandized\n\nhim.”       The district court answered: “Yes. However, you shall not\n\nconsider the evidence of the arrest in any way as proof of guilt.”\n\nA district court’s decision to give a particular instruction, over\n\na party’s objection, constitutes reversible error only if the\n\ninstruction was (1) “misleading, unduly complicating, or incorrect\n\nas a matter of law”; and (2) “adversely affected the objecting\n\nparty’s substantial rights.” Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).5 The district court’s response may have been misleading\n\nbecause O’Neill met Stark after his arrest, not “at” his arrest as\n\nstated in the jury’s question.       However, the court’s instruction\n\ndoes not rise to the level of reversible error because Stark has\n\nnot demonstrated that it affected his substantial rights. As such,\n\nhis claim fails.\n\nD.            Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n              Stark asserts that the district court should have granted\n\nhis motion for a judgment of acquittal because (1) the only\n\ntestimony regarding drug weight was O’Neill’s recitation of Stark’s\n\n\n\n        5\n        We disagree with the government’s contention that Stark is\nonly entitled to plain error review on this issue because we find\nthat Stark properly objected to the district court’s instruction to\nthe jury.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fconfession;6 and (2) the government failed to prove that Stark\n\nparticipated in the conspiracy before he started cooperating with\n\nthe government.\n\n           Pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n\nProcedure,      the court “must enter a judgment of acquittal of any\n\noffense   for    which   the   evidence     is   insufficient   to    sustain   a\n\nconviction.”     Fed. R. Crim. P. R. 29 (2007).          Generally, we review\n\nde novo a district court’s ruling on a Rule 29 motion.7                  United\n\nStates v. Diaz, 300 F.3d 66, 77 (1st Cir. 2002).                We view all of\n\nthe   evidence    in   the   light   most    favorable   to   the    verdict    in\n\ndetermining whether any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.               United\n\nStates v. Carroll, 105 F.3d 740, 742 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n      6\n        Stark also asserts, in a perfunctory manner, that the\ndistrict court failed to tell the jury to make a foreseeability\ndetermination in deciding the drug amount. See United States v.\nManjarrez, 306 F.3d 1175, 1181 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that a\nnarcotics conspirator is only responsible for the amount of drugs\nthat he “reasonably could have foreseen to be embraced by the\nconspiracy he joined”). Instead, the district court gave a more\ngeneral instruction, telling the jury to find “the amount of\nmarijuana that was involved in the conspiracy.”          A general\ninstruction of this kind is permitted as long as the foreseeability\ndetermination is made by the judge, as was the case here.       See\nUnited States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 37 (1st Cir. 2006).\n      7\n         The government asserts that Stark is not entitled to\nplenary review with respect to his drug weight argument because he\nfailed to raise it in his Rule 29 motion. Because the record is\nunclear on this point, we will err on the side of caution and\nconduct a de novo review.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f           O’Neill’s testimony regarding Stark’s third confession\n\nwas sufficient to support the jury’s finding that the drug amount\n\nwas 100 kilograms or more.      Stark told O’Neill that he was hired\n\n“to transport what he approximated to be 350 pounds of marijuana,”\n\nan amount that equals 159.1 kilograms.        Although Stark correctly\n\nasserts that “[t]he general rule [is] that an accused may not be\n\nconvicted on his own uncorroborated confession,” Smith v. United\n\nStates, 348 U.S. 147, 152 (1954), drug quantity is not an element\n\nof the offense under 21 U.S.C. § 841 unless the amount of drugs is\n\nused to increase the defendant’s sentence beyond the applicable\n\nmaximum penalty.     See United States v. Clay, 376 F.3d 1296, 1301\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).    Drug quantity was clearly not an element of the\n\noffense in Stark’s case since he was sentenced to sixty months of\n\nimprisonment, which is the statutory minimum under § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n           Similarly, we find that there was sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport   the    jury’s   finding   that   Stark   participated   in    the\n\nconspiracy before he started cooperating with the government.\n\nStark confessed to O’Neill his participation in a drug-trafficking\n\nconspiracy, expressly stating that he had been hired to transport\n\nmarijuana to Massachusetts by a man named Fabian Ruiz, who was not\n\na   government   official.     Moreover,    Torres   corroborated      this\n\ninformation at trial, stating that Ruiz had told him that Stark was\n\nsupposed to bring the marijuana to Massachusetts.           Viewing the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of Stark’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nE.          Sentencing\n\n            Stark challenges the district court’s refusal to apply a\n\nsafety valve reduction to his sentence.            Because the district\n\ncourt’s determination that Stark did not qualify for the safety\n\nvalve reduction rested on findings of fact, we review for clear\n\nerror.   United States v. Marquez, 280 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nPursuant to this highly deferential standard, “an appellate court\n\nought not to disturb either findings of fact or conclusions drawn\n\ntherefrom   unless   the   whole   of   the   record   compels   a   strong,\n\nunyielding belief that a mistake has been made.”         United States v.\n\nMatos, 328 F.3d 34, 39-40 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The safety valve provision of the Sentencing Reform Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) (2007), allows a district court to sentence a\n\nfirst-time offender below the mandatory minimum if, inter alia,\n\n“the defendant did not . . . possess a firearm or other dangerous\n\nweapon . . . in connection with the offense.”          Id. § 3553(f); see\n\nalso U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2 (2007).       The defendant bears the burden of\n\nproving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to\n\nrelief under the safety valve provision. United States v. Miranda-\n\nSantiago, 96 F.3d 517, 529 n.25 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            The district court determined that Stark was not eligible\n\nfor a safety valve reduction after finding, by a preponderance of\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fthe evidence, that the gun in Stark’s possession was connected to\n\nhis drug trafficking activity.        The court reasonably inferred that\n\nStark brought the gun to protect himself and the large quantity of\n\ndrugs that he was transporting in his RV.           Because Stark failed to\n\nprove otherwise, the district court’s findings were not clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n            Alternatively, Stark asserts that the gun was suppressed\n\nevidence and, therefore, should not have been taken into account\n\nduring sentencing.       Although he concedes that suppressed evidence\n\nmay generally be considered at sentencing, he argues that the\n\ndistrict court should have nonetheless excluded evidence of the gun\n\nbecause the police misconduct in this case was egregious.                    see\n\nUnited States v. Acosta, 303 F.3d 78, 86 (1st Cir. 2002) (“[W]e\n\nhold that the exclusionary rule does not bar the use of evidence\n\nseized in violation of a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights in\n\nsentencing. We leave open the question of whether the exclusionary\n\nrule would bar the use of evidence when police intentionally act in\n\nviolation    of   the    Fourth    Amendment   in    order   to   increase    a\n\ndefendant’s sentence.” (footnote omitted)).             We need not decide\n\nwhether to adopt such an exception at this time, however, because\n\nStark’s argument fails.           We have already established that the\n\nmisconduct    was       not   egregious.    See     supra    section   II(A).\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s consideration of the\n\ngun in determining Stark’s sentence.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f                              III.\n\n                           Conclusion\n\n          Based on the foregoing, Stark’s conviction and sentence\n\nare AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f",

For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Background</i></h2>\n<p>At approximately 12:30 p.m. on October 22, 2003, while driving from Arizona to Massachusetts in an RV, Stark and a companion, Christopher Sugar,<sup>[1]</sup> were stopped in Missouri by Deputy Sheriff Carmelo Crivello after their RV crossed the fog line and swerved onto the right shoulder. The stop was based on an alleged traffic violation of ß 304.015.5 of the Missouri Code, which requires vehicles to drive within a single lane \"as nearly as practicable.\" <i>See</i> Mo.Rev.Stat. ß 304.015.5 (2007). During the stop, Crivello found that Stark and his companion were acting in a suspicious manner and asked if they would consent to a search of their RV. After they refused, he called a drug-sniffing dog to the scene. Crivello told the men that they could go to a nearby restaurant or hotel to wait for the canine but they chose to stay with the RV. Ten to fifteen minutes later, the canine unit arrived. After the dog alerted to the right rear of the RV, the police conducted a warrantless search of the vehicle. They found 376.9 pounds of marijuana and a gun belonging to Stark.</p>\n<p>Stark and his companion were arrested and brought to a detention facility in the Phelps County Sheriff's Department, where Stark was interrogated by Detective Richard Hope. He confessed to the crime after he received a <i>Miranda</i> warning (\"first confession\"), and agreed to cooperate with the police in making a controlled delivery of the marijuana. A few hours later, Stark was interrogated by Agents Robert Hanson and Leslee Tate from the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") in St. Louis. After Stark received another <i>Miranda</i> warning, he confessed to the crime a second time (\"second confession\"), stating that he was hired to deliver the 376.9 pounds of marijuana to Massachusetts. Stark also confirmed his desire to cooperate.</p>\n<p>The following day, on October 23, 2002, after a third <i>Miranda</i> warning, Stark signed a statement of rights, as well as a prompt presentation waiver form, by which he waived his right to be immediately brought before a magistrate judge in the jurisdiction in which he was arrested. Hanson and Tate then drove Stark from St. Louis to Massachusetts. The trip took twenty-three hours, during which time Stark had a chance to rest in the RV and eat during rest stops. While he was in the RV, Stark was handcuffed with his hands in front of him, but he was de-cuffed during rest stops.</p>\n<p>When they arrived in Massachusetts at 10:30 a.m. on October 24, 2002, DEA Agent David O'Neill took custody of Stark. He gave Stark a fourth <i>Miranda</i> warning and de-cuffed him. According to Stark, O'Neill then asked him \"to bring him up to speed,\" and had him sign a confidential source agreement. After Stark confessed to the crime a third time (\"third confession\"), he and O'Neill prepared for the controlled delivery of the marijuana. Stark made suggestions as to how to best <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> carry out the plan, and helped prepare the RV. As a result of the sting operation, the government arrested three co-conspirators, Fabian Ruiz, Anibal Torres, and Trevor Teague. Stark and the others were indicted for conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. ß 846.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Before trial, the district court granted Stark's motion to suppress the marijuana, finding that the initial traffic stop, the detention of Stark and his companion while they waited for the canine unit to arrive, and the search of the RV violated Stark's Fourth Amendment rights (\"the unlawful search\"). Although ß 304.015.5 of the Missouri Code does not explain what it means to drive \"as nearly as practicable\" in a single lane, the district court concluded that an isolated incident of swerving was not a violation of the statute because it is common for large vehicles, such as Stark's RV, to weave into other lanes. The court also found that it was unreasonable to detain Stark and his companion and to search the RV because their stories were consistent, their licenses were valid, and they had no criminal histories. Accordingly, the marijuana and the gun were suppressed.</p>\n<p>Stark also moved to suppress all three of his confessions, asserting that they, like the marijuana, were poisonous fruits of the unlawful search of the RV. The district court suppressed the first two confessions but found that Stark's third confession was admissible because it was made voluntarily and was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal search.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the government filed a motion in limine to clarify whether the district court's suppression order also applied to testimony relating to the illegally-seized marijuana. It sought to admit, inter alia, testimony from Torres describing how he unloaded the marijuana from Stark's RV, and testimony regarding the drug amount. The district court ruled in favor of the government, but stated that the testimony could not refer to the unlawful search and noted that it would provide the jury with limiting instructions during the trial if necessary.</p>\n<p>On December 14, 2005, after a three-day jury trial, Stark was found guilty. He was sentenced on April 13, 2006, to a term of sixty months of imprisonment, to be followed by forty-eight months of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Analysis</i></h2>\n<p>Stark argues that the district court: (1) should have suppressed his third confession; (2) mistakenly admitted suppressed evidence at trial; (3) misled the jury in responding to a question regarding O'Neill's testimony; (4) erroneously failed to enter a judgment of acquittal; and (5) improperly found that Stark did not qualify for a safety valve sentence reduction. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Stark's Motion To Suppress His Third Confession</i></p>\n<p>\"We review a district court's finding of fact for clear error, but give de novo consideration to its legal conclusions.\" <i>United States v. Campa,</i> 234 F.3d 733, 737 (1st Cir.2000). \"In determining the outcome [of a motion to suppress] under the attenuation doctrine, the court of appeals does not defer to the district court.\" <i>United States v. Paradis,</i> 351 F.3d 21, 32 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> (1st Cir.2003); <i>accord </i><i>United States v. Hughes,</i> 279 F.3d 86, 89 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Stark contends that his third confession should have been suppressed as fruit of the unlawful search of his RV. However, it is well-settled that a court \"need not hold that all evidence is `fruit of the poisonous tree' simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.\" <i>Wong Sun v. United States,</i> 371 U.S. 471, 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). A confession made after an illegal search may be admitted if it was obtained \"by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\" <i>Id.</i> at 488, 83 S.Ct. 407 (internal quotations omitted). To determine whether the initial taint has been removed, we must balance the following factors: (1) the voluntariness of the statement; (2) \"[t]he temporal proximity\" of the illegal search and the confession; (3) \"the presence of intervening circumstances\"; and (4) \"the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct\" (\"<i>Brown</i> factors\"). <i>Brown v. Illinois,</i> 422 U.S. 590, 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975).</p>\n<p>The district court found that the <i>Brown</i> factors counseled against suppressing Stark's third confession because it was made voluntarily two days after the illegal search; Stark was rested, fed, and de-cuffed; the confession was made to a new officer and in a new location; and the initial search and seizure was not an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment. We agree.</p>\n<p>There are numerous indicators that Stark's third confession was voluntary, thus meeting the first of the <i>Brown</i> factors. The first of these is the fact that Stark received a renewed <i>Miranda</i> warning before making his third confession. <i>Dunaway v. New York,</i> 442 U.S. 200, 217, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979) (stating that \"a confession after proper <i>Miranda</i> warnings may be found `voluntary'\"). In addition, Stark's proactive role in the planning of the controlled delivery demonstrated that he was \"not acting from compulsion, but in the spirit of self-interest and cooperation\" in making his third confession. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Patino,</i> 862 F.2d 128, 133-34 (7th Cir.1988) (finding that defendant's decision to cooperate with the FBI and actively assist them with their investigation indicated that her second confession was voluntary).</p>\n<p>The second <i>Brown</i> factor, temporal proximity, also counsels against suppression. Stark gave his third confession two days after the illegal search, which was arguably a sufficient amount of time for him to reflect on his predicament and determine whether he wanted to speak with an attorney before making any further statements. <i>Compare </i><i>Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 604-05, 95 S.Ct. 2254 (stating that two hours was insufficient), <i>with United States v. Oliver,</i> 27 Fed.Appx. 927, 928-29 (10th Cir.2001) (concluding that eleven hours was sufficient); <i>United States v. Wesela,</i> 223 F.3d 656, 662 (7th Cir.2000) (finding that six days was adequate). Stark counters that two days was insufficient because he was in police custody the entire time. However, this fact is not dispositive in cases where, as here, the conditions of detention were favorable, marked by rest and food. <i>Compare </i><i>Taylor v. Alabama,</i> 457 U.S. 687, 691, 102 S.Ct. 2664, 73 L.Ed.2d 314 (1982) (concluding that six hours was too temporally proximate because defendant was in police custody the entire time and was subjected to several interrogations, fingerprinting and a lineup); <i>United States v. Webster,</i> 750 F.2d 307, 313, 325 (5th Cir.1984) (finding that ten hours was insufficient because, inter alia, defendant was in police custody and was sleep deprived, having spent the previous <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> night in the woods hiding from police), <i>with </i><i>Rawlings v. Kentucky,</i> 448 U.S. 98, 107-08, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980) (finding that forty-five minutes was sufficient because, inter alia, defendants were detained in their home and able to move around freely); <i>Oliver,</i> 27 Fed.Appx. at *928-29 (stating that eleven hours was adequate because, although defendant was in police custody, \"he was apparently left alone by officers\" during that time).</p>\n<p>We also find that a significant intervening event took place, satisfying the <i>third</i> Brown factor. Stark gave his third confession to O'Neill, a new DEA agent in a new location, and at a time when he was rested, fed, and de-cuffed. <i>United States v. Ayres,</i> 725 F.2d 806, 810 (1st Cir.1984) (finding that interrogation by a new officer in a new location when defendant was \"relaxed, composed and uncoerced\" sufficiently dissipated \"whatever taint may have infected his prior statements\").</p>\n<p>The final <i>Brown</i> factor, which analyzes the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct, weighs against suppression as well. This is the most important part of the analysis \"because it is tied directly to the rationale underlying the exclusionary rule, deterrence of police misconduct.\" <i>United States v. Reed,</i> 349 F.3d 457, 464-65 (7th Cir.2003). In analyzing this factor, courts look to see whether: (a) the police used threatening or abusive tactics; (b) the \"impropriety of the [initial misconduct] was obvious\"; and (c) the initial search was a mere evidence expedition calculated to elicit a confession. <i>Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 605, 95 S.Ct. 2254; <i>see also </i><i>Patino,</i> 862 F.2d at 134.</p>\n<p>The type of misconduct that the Supreme Court has found to warrant suppression of evidence is readily distinguishable from the facts of the instant case. For example, in <i>Brown,</i> two detectives broke into and searched the defendant's apartment without probable cause and, upon the defendant's arrival at his apartment, pointed a gun at his head and arrested him merely for further investigation and questioning. 422 U.S. at 592, 605, 95 S.Ct. 2254. Similarly, in <i>Wong Sun,</i> six or seven officers went to the business of a man who was thought to be a heroin dealer, forcibly opened his door, followed him into his bedroom, and almost immediately handcuffed and arrested him without probable cause. 371 U.S. at 474, 486, 83 S.Ct. 407.</p>\n<p>The coercive tactics used by police officials in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Wong Sun</i> were certainly not at play here during the initial traffic stop, continued detention, or search of the RV. Crivello's decision to effectuate the traffic stop was also not an obvious error. <i>Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 605, 95 S.Ct. 2254 (suppressing evidence after finding that the \"impropriety of the [initial misconduct] was obvious\"). Although the district court found the stop was not justified because a single instance of swerving over the fog line did not violate the statute, this may not have been apparent to Crivello because the statute does not define what it means to drive \"as nearly as practicable\" in one lane. <i>See</i> Mo.Rev.Stat. ß 304.015.5. The ambiguity of this statute is further supported by the fact that several federal courts, in analyzing similarly-worded statutes, have found that an isolated instance of crossing over the fog line was sufficient to violate the statute. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Herrera-Gonzalez,</i> 474 F.3d 1105, 1109-10 (8th Cir.2007) (citing several examples of such cases).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we affirm the district court's refusal to suppress Stark's third confession.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Evidence Admitted At Trial</i></p>\n<p>Stark appeals the admission of O'Neill's and Torres' testimony regarding the marijuana <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> delivery, and O'Neill's testimony regarding Stark's arrest.</p>\n<p>Although Stark opposed the admission of these testimonies at the motion in limine hearing, he failed to properly preserve these issues for appellate review.<sup>[3]</sup> We review unpreserved challenges to a district court's evidentiary rulings for plain error pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b). <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (citing Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b) (2007)). Under this standard of review, the error must be \"clear or, equivalently, obvious,\" and it must \"affect substantial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotations omitted). To \"affect substantial rights,\" the plain error must have been prejudicial such that it \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 734, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770. The defendant bears the burden of persuasion to show prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Marijuana Testimony</i></p>\n<p>Stark challenges O'Neill's testimony stating that Stark told him that he was \"employed by a Fabian Ruiz to transport what he approximated to be 350 pounds of marijuana\" and Torres' testimony stating that he and others \"unload[ed] marijuana into [his] trunk.\" Stark argues, without citing to any legal support, that these statements violated the court's suppression order because they referenced the seized marijuana.</p>\n<p>While the exclusionary rule equally applies to verbal statements, such testimony may be admitted if it is sufficiently attenuated from the illegal search. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ceccolini,</i> 435 U.S. 268, 273-76, 98 S.Ct. 1054, 55 L.Ed.2d 268 (1978). We have already determined that O'Neill's testimony, which merely reiterated Stark's third confession, was sufficiently attenuated.</p>\n<p>Although Stark has failed to brief this issue with regard to Torres' testimony, it is clear that Torres' statement was not prejudicial, given that it merely corroborated Stark's own confession that Torres was involved in the conspiracy. Accordingly, the district court did not commit plain error in admitting O'Neill's and Torres' statements regarding the marijuana.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Arrest Testimony</i></p>\n<p>Similarly, the district court did not commit plain error in admitting O'Neill's testimony regarding Stark's arrest.<sup>[4]</sup> Contrary to Stark's contention, O'Neill's testimony did not reveal anything about the unlawful traffic stop or the seized marijuana. O'Neill merely stated that Stark was under arrest by the time they met, without providing any details of the circumstances of the arrest. Therefore, we find that O'Neill's mention of Stark's arrest does not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McIntyre,</i> 997 F.2d 687, 696 n. 5 (10th Cir.1993) (finding that the officer's testimony regarding defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> arrest did not violate court's order suppressing marijuana because it did not state that the marijuana was the cause of the arrest).</p>\n<p>C. <i>Jury Instruction Regarding Stark's Arrest</i></p>\n<p>Stark challenges the district court's response to the jury's question asking whether they could consider testimony by O'Neill stating that \"he met Stark at his arrest and Mirandized him.\" The district court answered: \"Yes. However, you shall not consider the evidence of the arrest in any way as proof of guilt.\" A district court's decision to give a particular instruction, over a party's objection, constitutes reversible error only if the instruction was (1) \"misleading, unduly complicating, or incorrect as a matter of law\"; and (2) \"adversely affected the objecting party's substantial rights.\" <i>Faigin v. Kelly,</i> 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir.1999).<sup>[5]</sup> The district court's response may have been misleading because O'Neill met Stark after his arrest, not \"at\" his arrest as stated in the jury's question. However, the court's instruction does not rise to the level of reversible error because Stark has not demonstrated that it affected his substantial rights. As such, his claim fails.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n<p>Stark asserts that the district court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal because (1) the only testimony regarding drug weight was O'Neill's recitation of Stark's confession;<sup>[6]</sup> and (2) the government failed to prove that Stark participated in the conspiracy before he started cooperating with the government.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court \"must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\" Fed. R.Crim.P.R. 29 (2007). Generally, we review de novo a district court's ruling on a Rule 29 motion.<sup>[7]</sup><i>United States v. Diaz,</i> 300 F.3d 66, 77 (1st Cir.2002). We view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict in determining whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Carroll,</i> 105 F.3d 740, 742 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>O'Neill's testimony regarding Stark's third confession was sufficient to support the jury's finding that the drug amount was 100 kilograms or more. Stark told O'Neill that he was hired \"to transport what he approximated to be 350 pounds of marijuana,\" an amount that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> equals 159.1 kilograms. Although Stark correctly asserts that \"[t]he general rule [is] that an accused may not be convicted on his own uncorroborated confession,\" <i>Smith v. United States,</i> 348 U.S. 147, 152, 75 S.Ct. 194, 99 L.Ed. 192 (1954), drug quantity is not an element of the offense under 21 U.S.C. ß 841 unless the amount of drugs is used to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the applicable maximum penalty. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Clay,</i> 376 F.3d 1296, 1301 (11th Cir.2004). Drug quantity was clearly not an element of the offense in Stark's case since he was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment, which is the statutory minimum under ß 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>Similarly, we find that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Stark participated in the conspiracy before he started cooperating with the government. Stark confessed to O'Neill his participation in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, expressly stating that he had been hired to transport marijuana to Massachusetts by a man named Fabian Ruiz, who was not a government official. Moreover, Torres corroborated this information at trial, stating that Ruiz had told him that Stark was supposed to bring the marijuana to Massachusetts. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we affirm the district court's denial of Stark's Rule 29 motion.</p>\n<p>E. <i>Sentencing</i></p>\n<p>Stark challenges the district court's refusal to apply a safety valve reduction to his sentence. Because the district court's determination that Stark did not qualify for the safety valve reduction rested on findings of fact, we review for clear error. <i>United States v. Marquez,</i> 280 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.2002). Pursuant to this highly deferential standard, \"an appellate court ought not to disturb either findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom unless the whole of the record compels a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>United States v. Matos,</i> 328 F.3d 34, 39-40 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>The safety valve provision of the Sentencing Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. ß 3553(f) (2007), allows a district court to sentence a first-time offender below the mandatory minimum if, inter alia, \"the defendant did not . . . possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon . . . in connection with the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> ß 3553(f); <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. ß 5C1.2 (2007). The defendant bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to relief under the safety valve provision. <i>United States v. Miranda-Santiago,</i> 96 F.3d 517, 529 n. 25 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>The district court determined that Stark was not eligible for a safety valve reduction after finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the gun in Stark's possession was connected to his drug trafficking activity. The court reasonably inferred that Stark brought the gun to protect himself and the large quantity of drugs that he was transporting in his RV. Because Stark failed to prove otherwise, the district court's findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Stark asserts that the gun was suppressed evidence and, therefore, should not have been taken into account during sentencing. Although he concedes that suppressed evidence may generally be considered at sentencing, he argues that the district court should have nonetheless excluded evidence of the gun because the police misconduct in this case was egregious. <i>see </i><i>United States v. Acosta,</i> 303 F.3d 78, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[W]e hold that the exclusionary rule does not bar the use of evidence seized in violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> sentencing. We leave open the question of whether the exclusionary rule would bar the use of evidence when police intentionally act in violation of the Fourth Amendment in order to increase a defendant's sentence.\" (footnote omitted)). We need not decide whether to adopt such an exception at this time, however, because Stark's argument fails. We have already established that the misconduct was not egregious. <i>See supra</i> section II(A). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's consideration of the gun in determining Stark's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, Stark's conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The charges against Sugar were dismissed.</p>\n<p>[2]  After the return of the indictment, Stark withdrew his cooperation bid. Torres, one of his codefendants, assumed the role of cooperator and testified as a government witness against Stark.</p>\n<p>[3]  Stark's objections to the motion in limine should have been renewed at trial because the district court instructed Stark to do so, and because its ruling on the motion was not final and unconditional. <i>See </i><i>Fed. Ins. Co. v. HPSC, Inc.,</i> 480 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir.2007) (stating that a district court's ruling on a motion in limine must be final and unconditional to preserve the issue for appeal); <i>Jenkins v. Keating,</i> 147 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir.1998) (finding that the party that unsuccessfully opposes a motion in limine must renew its objections at trial if the court invites or tells the party to do so).</p>\n<p>[4]  O'Neill was asked \"when you first met [Stark], was he under arrest?\" and he responded \"yes, he was.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  We disagree with the government's contention that Stark is only entitled to plain error review on this issue because we find that Stark properly objected to the district court's instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p>[6]  Stark also asserts, in a perfunctory manner, that the district court failed to tell the jury to make a foreseeability determination in deciding the drug amount. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Manjarrez,</i> 306 F.3d 1175, 1181 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that a narcotics conspirator is only responsible for the amount of drugs that he \"reasonably could have foreseen to be embraced by the conspiracy he joined\"). Instead, the district court gave a more general instruction, telling the jury to find \"the amount of marijuana that was involved in the conspiracy.\" A general instruction of this kind is permitted as long as the foreseeability determination is made by the judge, as was the case here. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 447 F.3d 28, 37 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[7]  The government asserts that Stark is not entitled to plenary review with respect to his drug weight argument because he failed to raise it in his Rule 29 motion. Because the record is unclear on this point, we will err on the side of caution and conduct a de novo review.</p>\n\n</div>",

For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Background</i></h2>\n<p>At approximately 12:30 p.m. on October 22, 2003, while driving from Arizona to Massachusetts in an RV, Stark and a companion, Christopher Sugar,<sup>[1]</sup> were stopped in Missouri by Deputy Sheriff Carmelo Crivello after their RV crossed the fog line and swerved onto the right shoulder. The stop was based on an alleged traffic violation of ß 304.015.5 of the Missouri Code, which requires vehicles to drive within a single lane \"as nearly as practicable.\" <i>See</i> Mo.Rev.Stat. ß 304.015.5 (2007). During the stop, Crivello found that Stark and his companion were acting in a suspicious manner and asked if they would consent to a search of their RV. After they refused, he called a drug-sniffing dog to the scene. Crivello told the men that they could go to a nearby restaurant or hotel to wait for the canine but they chose to stay with the RV. Ten to fifteen minutes later, the canine unit arrived. After the dog alerted to the right rear of the RV, the police conducted a warrantless search of the vehicle. They found 376.9 pounds of marijuana and a gun belonging to Stark.</p>\n<p>Stark and his companion were arrested and brought to a detention facility in the Phelps County Sheriff's Department, where Stark was interrogated by Detective Richard Hope. He confessed to the crime after he received a <i>Miranda</i> warning (\"first confession\"), and agreed to cooperate with the police in making a controlled delivery of the marijuana. A few hours later, Stark was interrogated by Agents Robert Hanson and Leslee Tate from the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") in St. Louis. After Stark received another <i>Miranda</i> warning, he confessed to the crime a second time (\"second confession\"), stating that he was hired to deliver the 376.9 pounds of marijuana to Massachusetts. Stark also confirmed his desire to cooperate.</p>\n<p>The following day, on October 23, 2002, after a third <i>Miranda</i> warning, Stark signed a statement of rights, as well as a prompt presentation waiver form, by which he waived his right to be immediately brought before a magistrate judge in the jurisdiction in which he was arrested. Hanson and Tate then drove Stark from St. Louis to Massachusetts. The trip took twenty-three hours, during which time Stark had a chance to rest in the RV and eat during rest stops. While he was in the RV, Stark was handcuffed with his hands in front of him, but he was de-cuffed during rest stops.</p>\n<p>When they arrived in Massachusetts at 10:30 a.m. on October 24, 2002, DEA Agent David O'Neill took custody of Stark. He gave Stark a fourth <i>Miranda</i> warning and de-cuffed him. According to Stark, O'Neill then asked him \"to bring him up to speed,\" and had him sign a confidential source agreement. After Stark confessed to the crime a third time (\"third confession\"), he and O'Neill prepared for the controlled delivery of the marijuana. Stark made suggestions as to how to best <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> carry out the plan, and helped prepare the RV. As a result of the sting operation, the government arrested three co-conspirators, Fabian Ruiz, Anibal Torres, and Trevor Teague. Stark and the others were indicted for conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. ß 846.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Before trial, the district court granted Stark's motion to suppress the marijuana, finding that the initial traffic stop, the detention of Stark and his companion while they waited for the canine unit to arrive, and the search of the RV violated Stark's Fourth Amendment rights (\"the unlawful search\"). Although ß 304.015.5 of the Missouri Code does not explain what it means to drive \"as nearly as practicable\" in a single lane, the district court concluded that an isolated incident of swerving was not a violation of the statute because it is common for large vehicles, such as Stark's RV, to weave into other lanes. The court also found that it was unreasonable to detain Stark and his companion and to search the RV because their stories were consistent, their licenses were valid, and they had no criminal histories. Accordingly, the marijuana and the gun were suppressed.</p>\n<p>Stark also moved to suppress all three of his confessions, asserting that they, like the marijuana, were poisonous fruits of the unlawful search of the RV. The district court suppressed the first two confessions but found that Stark's third confession was admissible because it was made voluntarily and was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal search.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the government filed a motion in limine to clarify whether the district court's suppression order also applied to testimony relating to the illegally-seized marijuana. It sought to admit, inter alia, testimony from Torres describing how he unloaded the marijuana from Stark's RV, and testimony regarding the drug amount. The district court ruled in favor of the government, but stated that the testimony could not refer to the unlawful search and noted that it would provide the jury with limiting instructions during the trial if necessary.</p>\n<p>On December 14, 2005, after a three-day jury trial, Stark was found guilty. He was sentenced on April 13, 2006, to a term of sixty months of imprisonment, to be followed by forty-eight months of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Analysis</i></h2>\n<p>Stark argues that the district court: (1) should have suppressed his third confession; (2) mistakenly admitted suppressed evidence at trial; (3) misled the jury in responding to a question regarding O'Neill's testimony; (4) erroneously failed to enter a judgment of acquittal; and (5) improperly found that Stark did not qualify for a safety valve sentence reduction. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Stark's Motion To Suppress His Third Confession</i></p>\n<p>\"We review a district court's finding of fact for clear error, but give de novo consideration to its legal conclusions.\" <i>United States v.

However, it is well-settled that a court \"need not hold that all evidence is `fruit of the poisonous tree' simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.\" <i>Wong Sun v.

To determine whether the initial taint has been removed, we must balance the following factors: (1) the voluntariness of the statement; (2) \"[t]he temporal proximity\" of the illegal search and the confession; (3) \"the presence of intervening circumstances\"; and (4) \"the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct\" (\"<i>Brown</i> factors\"). <i>Brown v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109304\"><a href=\"/opinion/109304/brown-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span>, 603-04, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109304\"><a href=\"/opinion/109304/brown-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span> (1975).</p>\n<p>The district court found that the <i>Brown</i> factors counseled against suppressing Stark's third confession because it was made voluntarily two days after the illegal search; Stark was rested, fed, and de-cuffed; the confession was made to a new officer and in a new location; and the initial search and seizure was not an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment. We agree.</p>\n<p>There are numerous indicators that Stark's third confession was voluntary, thus meeting the first of the <i>Brown</i> factors. The first of these is the fact that Stark received a renewed <i>Miranda</i> warning before making his third confession. <i>Dunaway v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110096\"><a href=\"/opinion/110096/dunaway-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 217, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110096\"><a href=\"/opinion/110096/dunaway-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span> (1979) (stating that \"a confession after proper <i>Miranda</i> warnings may be found `voluntary'\"). In addition, Stark's proactive role in the planning of the controlled delivery demonstrated that he was \"not acting from compulsion, but in the spirit of self-interest and cooperation\" in making his third confession. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Patino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514823\"><a href=\"/opinion/514823/united-states-v-josan-wolf-patino/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 133-34 (7th Cir.1988) (finding that defendant's decision to cooperate with the FBI and actively assist them with their investigation indicated that her second confession was voluntary).</p>\n<p>The second <i>Brown</i> factor, temporal proximity, also counsels against suppression. Stark gave his third confession two days after the illegal search, which was arguably a sufficient amount of time for him to reflect on his predicament and determine whether he wanted to speak with an attorney before making any further statements. <i>Compare </i><i>Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 604-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109304\"><a href=\"/opinion/109304/brown-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Stark counters that two days was insufficient because he was in police custody the entire time. However, this fact is not dispositive in cases where, as here, the conditions of detention were favorable, marked by rest and food. <i>Compare </i><i>Taylor v.

This is the most important part of the analysis \"because it is tied directly to the rationale underlying the exclusionary rule, deterrence of police misconduct.\" <i>United States v. Reed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784163\"><a href=\"/opinion/784163/united-states-v-mark-a-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 464-65 (7th Cir.2003). In analyzing this factor, courts look to see whether: (a) the police used threatening or abusive tactics; (b) the \"impropriety of the [initial misconduct] was obvious\"; and (c) the initial search was a mere evidence expedition calculated to elicit a confession. <i>Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 605, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109304\"><a href=\"/opinion/109304/brown-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For example, in <i>Brown,</i> two detectives broke into and searched the defendant's apartment without probable cause and, upon the defendant's arrival at his apartment, pointed a gun at his head and arrested him merely for further investigation and questioning. 422 U.S. at 592, 605, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109304\"><a href=\"/opinion/109304/brown-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Similarly, in <i>Wong Sun,</i> six or seven officers went to the business of a man who was thought to be a heroin dealer, forcibly opened his door, followed him into his bedroom, and almost immediately handcuffed and arrested him without probable cause. 371 U.S. at 474, 486, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106515\"><a href=\"/opinion/106515/wong-sun-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Crivello's decision to effectuate the traffic stop was also not an obvious error. <i>Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 605, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109304\"><a href=\"/opinion/109304/brown-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the district court found the stop was not justified because a single instance of swerving over the fog line did not violate the statute, this may not have been apparent to Crivello because the statute does not define what it means to drive \"as nearly as practicable\" in one lane. <i>See</i> Mo.Rev.Stat. ß 304.015.5. The ambiguity of this statute is further supported by the fact that several federal courts, in analyzing similarly-worded statutes, have found that an isolated instance of crossing over the fog line was sufficient to violate the statute. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Ceccolini,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109816\"><a href=\"/opinion/109816/united-states-v-ceccolini/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 273-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109816\"><a href=\"/opinion/109816/united-states-v-ceccolini/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span> (1978). We have already determined that O'Neill's testimony, which merely reiterated Stark's third confession, was sufficiently attenuated.</p>\n<p>Although Stark has failed to brief this issue with regard to Torres' testimony, it is clear that Torres' statement was not prejudicial, given that it merely corroborated Stark's own confession that Torres was involved in the conspiracy. Accordingly, the district court did not commit plain error in admitting O'Neill's and Torres' statements regarding the marijuana.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Arrest Testimony</i></p>\n<p>Similarly, the district court did not commit plain error in admitting O'Neill's testimony regarding Stark's arrest.<sup>[4]</sup> Contrary to Stark's contention, O'Neill's testimony did not reveal anything about the unlawful traffic stop or the seized marijuana. O'Neill merely stated that Stark was under arrest by the time they met, without providing any details of the circumstances of the arrest. Therefore, we find that O'Neill's mention of Stark's arrest does not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McIntyre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610689\"><a href=\"/opinion/610689/united-states-v-charles-edward-mcintyre/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 696 n. 5 (10th Cir.1993) (finding that the officer's testimony regarding defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> arrest did not violate court's order suppressing marijuana because it did not state that the marijuana was the cause of the arrest).</p>\n<p>C. <i>Jury Instruction Regarding Stark's Arrest</i></p>\n<p>Stark challenges the district court's response to the jury's question asking whether they could consider testimony by O'Neill stating that \"he met Stark at his arrest and Mirandized him.\" The district court answered: \"Yes. However, you shall not consider the evidence of the arrest in any way as proof of guilt.\" A district court's decision to give a particular instruction, over a party's objection, constitutes reversible error only if the instruction was (1) \"misleading, unduly complicating, or incorrect as a matter of law\"; and (2) \"adversely affected the objecting party's substantial rights.\" <i>Faigin v. Kelly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.1999).<sup>[5]</sup> The district court's response may have been misleading because O'Neill met Stark after his arrest, not \"at\" his arrest as stated in the jury's question. However, the court's instruction does not rise to the level of reversible error because Stark has not demonstrated that it affected his substantial rights. As such, his claim fails.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n<p>Stark asserts that the district court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal because (1) the only testimony regarding drug weight was O'Neill's recitation of Stark's confession;<sup>[6]</sup> and (2) the government failed to prove that Stark participated in the conspiracy before he started cooperating with the government.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court \"must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\" Fed. R.Crim.P.R. 29 (2007). Generally, we review de novo a district court's ruling on a Rule 29 motion.<sup>[7]</sup><i>United States v. Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200085\"><a href=\"/opinion/200085/united-states-v-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2002). We view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict in determining whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Carroll,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"734111\"><a href=\"/opinion/734111/united-states-v-christopher-b-carroll/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 742 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>O'Neill's testimony regarding Stark's third confession was sufficient to support the jury's finding that the drug amount was 100 kilograms or more. Stark told O'Neill that he was hired \"to transport what he approximated to be 350 pounds of marijuana,\" an amount that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> equals 159.1 kilograms. Although Stark correctly asserts that \"[t]he general rule [is] that an accused may not be convicted on his own uncorroborated confession,\" <i>Smith v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105256\"><a href=\"/opinion/105256/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 152, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105256\"><a href=\"/opinion/105256/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span> (1954), drug quantity is not an element of the offense under 21 U.S.C. ß 841 unless the amount of drugs is used to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the applicable maximum penalty. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Clay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76675\"><a href=\"/opinion/76675/united-states-v-clarence-clay/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>, 1301 (11th Cir.2004). Drug quantity was clearly not an element of the offense in Stark's case since he was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment, which is the statutory minimum under ß 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>Similarly, we find that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Stark participated in the conspiracy before he started cooperating with the government. Stark confessed to O'Neill his participation in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, expressly stating that he had been hired to transport marijuana to Massachusetts by a man named Fabian Ruiz, who was not a government official. Moreover, Torres corroborated this information at trial, stating that Ruiz had told him that Stark was supposed to bring the marijuana to Massachusetts. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we affirm the district court's denial of Stark's Rule 29 motion.</p>\n<p>E. <i>Sentencing</i></p>\n<p>Stark challenges the district court's refusal to apply a safety valve reduction to his sentence. Because the district court's determination that Stark did not qualify for the safety valve reduction rested on findings of fact, we review for clear error. <i>United States v. Marquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199829\"><a href=\"/opinion/199829/united-states-v-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2002). Pursuant to this highly deferential standard, \"an appellate court ought not to disturb either findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom unless the whole of the record compels a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>United States v. Matos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200455\"><a href=\"/opinion/200455/united-states-v-mariel-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 39-40 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>The safety valve provision of the Sentencing Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. ß 3553(f) (2007), allows a district court to sentence a first-time offender below the mandatory minimum if, inter alia, \"the defendant did not . . . possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon . . . in connection with the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> ß 3553(f); <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. ß 5C1.2 (2007). The defendant bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to relief under the safety valve provision. <i>United States v. Miranda-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196984\"><a href=\"/opinion/196984/united-states-v-miranda-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 529 n. 25 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>The district court determined that Stark was not eligible for a safety valve reduction after finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the gun in Stark's possession was connected to his drug trafficking activity. The court reasonably inferred that Stark brought the gun to protect himself and the large quantity of drugs that he was transporting in his RV. Because Stark failed to prove otherwise, the district court's findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Stark asserts that the gun was suppressed evidence and, therefore, should not have been taken into account during sentencing. Although he concedes that suppressed evidence may generally be considered at sentencing, he argues that the district court should have nonetheless excluded evidence of the gun because the police misconduct in this case was egregious. <i>see </i><i>United States v. Acosta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200104\"><a href=\"/opinion/200104/united-states-v-acosta/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[W]e hold that the exclusionary rule does not bar the use of evidence seized in violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> sentencing. We leave open the question of whether the exclusionary rule would bar the use of evidence when police intentionally act in violation of the Fourth Amendment in order to increase a defendant's sentence.\" (footnote omitted)). We need not decide whether to adopt such an exception at this time, however, because Stark's argument fails. We have already established that the misconduct was not egregious. <i>See supra</i> section II(A). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's consideration of the gun in determining Stark's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, Stark's conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The charges against Sugar were dismissed.</p>\n<p>[2]  After the return of the indictment, Stark withdrew his cooperation bid. Torres, one of his codefendants, assumed the role of cooperator and testified as a government witness against Stark.</p>\n<p>[3]  Stark's objections to the motion in limine should have been renewed at trial because the district court instructed Stark to do so, and because its ruling on the motion was not final and unconditional. <i>See </i><i>Fed.

Instead, the district court gave a more general instruction, telling the jury to find \"the amount of marijuana that was involved in the conspiracy.\" A general instruction of this kind is permitted as long as the foreseeability determination is made by the judge, as was the case here. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202188\"><a href=\"/opinion/202188/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[7]  The government asserts that Stark is not entitled to plenary review with respect to his drug weight argument because he failed to raise it in his Rule 29 motion. Because the record is unclear on this point, we will err on the side of caution and conduct a de novo review.</p>\n\n</div>",
