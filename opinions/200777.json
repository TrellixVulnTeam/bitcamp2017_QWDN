After    appellants      Jose\n\nMaldonado-Montalvo and Wilfredo Picon-Rivera were convicted of\n\nintroducing adulterated milk into interstate commerce, the district\n\ncourt departed downward from their respective guideline sentencing\n\nranges on the ground that much of the loss occasioned their victims\n\nwas    due   to   factors     other    than    the   wrongful   conduct    of    the\n\ndefendants.1        In sentencing Picon, the district court granted a\n\nfurther downward departure on the ground that he suffers from\n\ndepression.       The government appeals and we once again vacate the\n\nerroneous departure rulings made by the district court.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n             For approximately four years — between 1993 and 1997\n\n—     Maldonado     and   Picon,      licensed     commercial   dairy     farmers,\n\nadulterated the milk which they sold to a nearby milk-processing\n\nplant by adding salt and water.               The salt served to increase the\n\nweight of the water which was added, thereby effectively disguising\n\nthe dilution.        Moreover, the defendants \"bought off\" the truck\n\ndrivers employed by the milk processor, in order to entice them to\n\n\n\n       1\n      As the government elected to try Maldonado and Picon\nseparately, each was sentenced by a different district judge.\nSince the facts in both cases are virtually identical, however, we\nconsolidated the two government appeals. Further, the two\nsentencing judges employed virtually identical language in\nsubstantiating their “multiple causation” departures, and so for\nthe sake of simplicity and convenience we quote exclusively from\nthe sentencing transcript in the Picon case.\n\n                                         -3-\n\ffalsify    their   on-site    quality    test   reports   relating   to   the\n\nadulterated milk.     Thus, at the plant the processor unwittingly\n\nmixed the milk which had been adulterated by the defendants with\n\nother regional milk supplies.           As a consequence, the defendants\n\nreceived the Grade A milk price for their adulterated product.\n\n            Following their indictment, the defendants entered guilty\n\npleas to the charge of delivering adulterated milk into interstate\n\ncommerce, a felony.          See 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a), 333(a)(2).           At\n\nsentencing,2 the district court determined that each defendant was\n\nentitled to a downward departure due to the fact — as the district\n\ncourt found — that the loss calculation under U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1\n\n(viz., which included all contaminated milk in the processor’s\n\nsilos) overstated the amount of loss attributable to their wrongful\n\nconduct.     See U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1.          Finally, the district court\n\npointed to Picon’s mental condition as a further basis for its\n\ndownward departure.     See U.S.S.G. § 5H1.3.3\n\n\n\n     2\n      Earlier, the district court had sentenced these defendants on\nthe premise that their respective offense levels should be 12,\nbecause they should only be held accountable for the contaminated\nmilk delivered to the processing plant, rather than the total\nvolume of milk in the silos contaminated by their adulterated milk.\nThose sentences were summarily vacated, then remanded for\nresentencing in light of United States v. Gonzalez-Alvarez, 277\nF.3d 73, 78-79 (1st Cir. 2002) (holding that the total intended\nloss includes the entire silo contents).\n     3\n      The district court departed downward from offense level 18 to\nlevel 12 in sentencing Picon, and from offense level 17 to 12 in\nsentencing Maldonado, thereby effectively reinstating their\nrespective pre-remand sentences. See supra note 2.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f             On appeal, the government once again seeks to set aside\n\nthe downward departure rulings made by the district court.4              We now\n\nreverse and remand for resentencing, before a different judge, in\n\naccordance with this opinion and the accompanying order.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                       II\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\n             A departure ruling under the Sentencing Guidelines is\n\nreviewed de novo to determine whether it was based upon a factor\n\nthat “(i) does not advance the objectives set forth in [18 U.S.C.]\n\nsection     3553(a)(2);5   or   (ii)   is    not   authorized   under   section\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The defendants originally filed no appellate briefs. In the\ninterests of justice, we directed that counsel be appointed to\nrepresent them on appeal.\n     5\n         Section 3553(a)(2) states:\n\n     The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not\n     greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set\n     forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in\n     determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall\n     consider . . . the need for the sentence imposed – (A) to\n     reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\n     respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for\n     the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to\n     criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further\n     crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant\n     with needed educational or vocational training, medical\n     care, or other correctional treatment in the most\n     effective manner.\n\n 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f3553(b);6 or (iii) is not justified by the facts of the case[.]”\n\nUnited States v. Frazier, 340 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\nA.   The Downward Departure Based Upon \"Multiple Causation\"\n\n             In determining their respective sentences, the district\n\ncourt appropriately attributed to each defendant the entire loss;\n\nviz., the total value of all contaminated milk in the processor’s\n\nsilos.     See U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(1); United States v. Reeder, 170\n\nF.3d 93, 109 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"‘[T]he victim loss table in U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2F1.1(b)(1) presumes that the defendant alone is responsible for\n\n\n\n     6\n         Section 3553(b) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n     [T]he court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and\n     within the range, referred to in subsection (a)(4) [viz.,\n     the sentences as prescribed in the Guidelines] unless the\n     court finds that there exists an aggravating or\n     mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not\n     adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing\n     Commission in formulating the guidelines that should\n     result in a sentence different from that described. In\n     determining whether a circumstance was adequately taken\n     into consideration, the court shall consider only the\n     sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official\n     commentary of the Sentencing Commission. In the absence\n     of an applicable sentencing guideline, the court shall\n     impose an appropriate sentence, having due regard for the\n     purposes set forth in subsection (a)(2). In the absence\n     of an applicable sentencing guideline in the case of an\n     offense other than a petty offense, the court shall also\n     have due regard for the relationship of the sentence\n     imposed to sentences prescribed by guidelines applicable\n     to similar offenses and offenders, and to the applicable\n     policy statements of the Sentencing Commission.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe entire amount of victim loss specified in the particular loss\n\nrange selected by the sentencing court.’\") (citation omitted).7\n\nThe Guidelines nevertheless permit a downward departure where the\n\ntotal loss calculation overstates the seriousness of the offense.\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1, comment (n.11) (noting that \"[in] a few\n\ninstances,   the   loss   determined   under   subsection   (b)(1)   may\n\noverstate the seriousness of the offense\"); cf. U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1,\n\ncomment. (n. 11) (1991) (noting that a \"downward departure may be\n\nwarranted\" where the \"total dollar loss that results from the\n\noffense may overstate its seriousness,\" which \"typically occur[s]\"\n\nwhen the defendant's fraud \"is not the sole cause of the loss\").\n\nTheoretically, such a loss overstatement may occur where, inter\n\nalia, “[a]ny portion of the total loss sustained by the victim [is]\n\na consequence of factors extraneous to the defendant's criminal\n\nconduct.”    Reeder, 170 F.3d at 109 (emphasis added); see also\n\nUnited States v. D’Andrea, 107 F.3d 949, 955-56 (1st Cir. 1997);\n\nUnited States v. Shattuck, 961 F.2d 1012, 1016-17 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nAs with any guideline departure, however, a “multiple causation”\n\ndeparture is permitted only if these extraneous factors are “of a\n\nkind, or [are present] to a degree, not adequately taken into\n\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the\n\n\n     7\n      Effective November 2001, the Sentencing Commission deleted §\n2F1.1, which specifically dealt with fraud offenses, and merged its\nprovisions into § 2B1.1, which formerly dealt only with theft.\nThese defendants, however, were sentenced pursuant to the pre-2001\nversion of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fguidelines.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1); see supra note 6.\n\n     1.   Economic Hardship\n\n          The district court in the instant case identified five\n\nextraneous factors.    First, it stated:\n\n          [A]s the dairy industry is a profit-driven\n          entity, dairy farmers are assigned a monthly\n          milk quota that must be maintained or they\n          face the reality of negative financial\n          consequences,   to  include,   reduction   or\n          cancellation of the awarded quota.       Less\n          production by the farmer results in less\n          profit for the processing plant, thus equates\n          to financial disaster for the farmer.      As\n          such, caught in a bind to produce or face\n          financial ruin, the farmers took the best of\n          the bad options available.\n\n          The government in response aptly notes that a defendant's\n\npersonal financial difficulties, as well as economic duress upon a\n\ndefendant's trade or business, are explicitly prohibited as grounds\n\nfor departure under the Sentencing Guidelines.      U.S.S.G. § 5K2.12\n\n(\"The Commission considered the relevance of economic hardship and\n\ndetermined   that   personal   financial   difficulties   and   economic\n\npressures upon a trade or business do not warrant a decrease in\n\nsentence.\"); see Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 93 (1996);\n\nUnited States v. Sachdev, 279 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Perez, 160 F.3d 87, 89 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc); United\n\nStates v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 949 (1st Cir. 1993).        “Forbidden\n\nfactors can never serve as the basis for a [guidelines] departure.”\n\nUnited States v. Martin, 221 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 2000) (emphasis\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fadded).8\n\n     2.    The Coconspirators’ Assistance\n\n           As the next basis for its “multiple causation” departure,\n\nthe district court opined:\n\n           [T]he fraud was also significantly perpetuated\n           by the delivery [truck drivers] hired by the\n           processing plant as they were entrusted with\n           protecting the interests of the processing\n           plant, trained to test for the quality of the\n           milk product, and the authority to reject an\n           unacceptable product, and responsibility for\n           exposing farmers operating contrary to laws\n           regulating consumer products. In a calculated\n           and self-serving fashion, they recruited,\n           encouraged farmers, or were themselves lured\n           to engage in the adulteration of the milk to\n           assist the farmers in meeting their quota for\n           profit.\n\n           Assuming these district court statements contemplate that\n\nthe loss calculations were inflated, in that the defendants did not\n\ncommit the charged offenses alone but conspired with others to\n\nachieve their unlawful goal, the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly\n\ntreat with any such factor.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1).   That is\n\nto say, the district court must attribute to the defendants the\n\namounts of loss resulting from \"all reasonably foreseeable acts and\n\nomissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken\n\ncriminal activity.\"   U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B); see United States\n\nv. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 37 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 948\n\n\n\n     8\n      It is noteworthy that not even the defendants contend on\nappeal that economic hardship constituted a valid ground for the\ndownward departure ordered by the district court.\n\n                                -9-\n\f(2002); United States v. Adeniji, 221 F.3d 1020, 1027 (7th Cir.\n\n2000); United States v. Duliga, 204 F.3d 97, 100 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n            It is patently clear that the defendants in the instant\n\ncase fit this description, in that they concededly paid cash to the\n\ndelivery    truck     drivers       for   aiding    the    concealment     of   their\n\nadulterations.       The defendants incorrectly contend that the record\n\ndemonstrates that the truckers sometimes acted independently of\n\nthem. In arguing against a more-than-minimal-planning enhancement\n\nat the sentencing hearing, defense counsel merely observed that the\n\ntruck drivers could have loaded adulterated milk at the defendants’\n\nfarms without the need for the defendants’ physical presence, since\n\nthe truck drivers had ready access to the necessary equipment and\n\nsupplies.      Defense counsel’s observation – which is unsupported by\n\nthe record, see United States v. Brassard, 212 F.3d 54, 57 (1st\n\nCir.   2000)      (noting    that    counsel’s     remarks    do   not   themselves\n\nconstitute evidence), and which was raised merely to characterize\n\nthe modus operandi of the defendants’ conspiracy as rudimentary –\n\ndoes not preclude a reasonable inference that the defendants who\n\nwere not physically present had prior knowledge of, or gave prior\n\nconsent     to,     the     unsupervised      loadings      conducted     by    their\n\ncoconspirators.\n\n            The     defendants      further      contend   that    the   presentence\n\nreport (PSR) states that other unidentified farmers, neither known\n\nto the defendants nor involved in their conspiracy, already had\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fdelivered         contaminated     milk   to     the    plants,       and    thus     were\n\nexclusively responsible for at least a portion of the actual milk\n\nloss.    Quite the contrary, the PSR states simply that the milk in\n\nthe silos “may” have been contaminated by other farmers.                              The\n\nrecord contains no evidence, however, that any other farmer in fact\n\ndelivered bad milk to the same silos or at the same times as the\n\ndefendants’ deliveries.            See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1161, 1198-99 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting that sentencing findings must\n\nderive from some identifiable evidentiary basis in record). In any\n\nevent, the defendants are not only responsible for the actual loss,\n\nbut for the intended loss, see United States v. Gonzalez-Alvarez,\n\n277 F.3d 73, 80-81 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that defendant is\n\nresponsible for intended loss if it exceeds actual loss), and it is\n\nbeyond serious dispute that these defendants intended and foresaw\n\nthat    their      adulterated     milk   would       end   up   in    the    silos    and\n\ncontaminate the entire contents, resulting in a total loss of all\n\nthose milk stocks.           Accordingly, we conclude that the purported\n\nconduct      of     the    truck   drivers,      whether     or       not    defendants’\n\ncoconspirators,           cannot   constitute     a    legitimate       ground      for   a\n\n“multiple causation” departure.\n\n        3.   The Conduct of the Victim's Agents\n\n             The district court went on to identify the purported\n\ncomplicity of the milk plant employees in the defendants’ milk-\n\nadulteration scheme as a further factor providing support for its\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fdownward departure:\n\n            [I]t was business as usual at the processing\n            plant as it was well known who were the\n            truckers engaged in the adulteration of milk.\n            However, plant managers neglectfully turned\n            the other way, consciously failed their duty\n            and responsibility to expose the corrupt\n            truckers to their superiors or authorities,\n            and contributed to the lawful (sic) practice\n            by assuring that the profitable routes\n            involving farmers actively adulterating milk\n            were assigned to the corrupt truckers. It\n            would   be   incredulous   (sic)    that   the\n            managerial/supervisory staff at the processing\n            plant was not aware or could not have been\n            aware of the unlawful adulteration process,\n            therefore, [it] significantly contributed to\n            the total loss through aiding and abetting.\n\n            A victim's conduct may warrant a downward departure where\n\nthe victim significantly contributed to an increase in the amount\n\nof loss. See, e.g., United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 407 n.8\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).        Assuming, arguendo, that the same rule might\n\napply   even   though    the   defendants   injured   other   victims   who\n\nconcededly did not contribute to the loss (viz., milk consumers),\n\nthe evidentiary record in the instant case cannot meet such a\n\nstandard.      First, there is no record support for the district\n\ncourt’s supposition that the plant managers knew or should have\n\nknown of the adulteration perpetrated by the defendants, nor that\n\nthe plant managers acted either negligently or improperly.              See\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1198-99.      But cf. Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 407 n.8\n\n(noting that defrauded bank officials conducted themselves in\n\n“incredibly negligent fashion” by approving fraudulent loans “with\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fan abandon commonly associated with drunken sailors,” and routinely\n\nviolated official bank policies).\n\n          Moreover, these defendants \"paid off\" the truck drivers\n\nfor the very purpose of obtaining their assistance in disguising\n\ntheir own adulteration of the milk upon its arrival at the plant.\n\nConsequently,       there    is    simply     no   record   evidence     that        the\n\nadulteration    would       have    been    patently     obvious    to   any    other\n\nemployees at the plant.             Cf. U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1, comment. (n.11)\n\n(providing    that    downward       departure     for   inflated    loss      may    be\n\nwarranted where “no one would seriously consider honoring” the\n\nfraudulent instrument);            United States v. LeRose, 219 F.3d 335,\n\n338-39 (4th Cir. 2000) (noting lack of record evidence that bank’s\n\nconduct affected amount of loss, or that negotiated instrument was\n\n“obviously fraudulent”).\n\n     4.      Sentencing Manipulation\n\n          As    a    fourth       basis    for   its   downward    departure,        the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the government contributed to the\n\namount of the loss:\n\n          The [FDA] agent also played a role in the\n          overall accumulation of loss as he decided\n          when enough information had been gathered to\n          initiate the prosecution of the defendant,\n          contributed to the actual adulteration of the\n          milk, and allowed the adulterated milk to\n          reach the silos at the processing plant. The\n          defendant was charged with eleven separate\n          acts of adulteration spanning a period of\n          approximately four years. As such, the number\n          of times the defendant was allowed to engage\n          in the adulteration process corresponds to the\n\n                                          -13-\n\f               number of times the delivery truck was also\n               increasing the volume of adulterated milk.\n\n               Government manipulation designed solely to increase the\n\nseverity of a criminal sentence may afford a ground for departure,\n\nprovided there is sufficient record evidence to demonstrate that\n\nthe government acted in “bad faith.”                 See Gonzalez-Alvarez, 277\n\nF.3d at 80-81 (noting that calculation of amount of intended loss\n\nwas based on defendant’s assumption that government would not\n\ndiscover his adulteration). “Given the wide latitude we afford the\n\ngovernment in conducting sting operations, ‘the burden of showing\n\nsentencing       factor    manipulation     [necessarily]      rests    with      the\n\ndefendant.       As with other fact-sensitive sentencing issues, the\n\nburden    of    proof     must   be   carried   by    a   preponderance      of   the\n\nevidence.’\"       United States v. Rizzo, 121 F.3d 794, 801 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (citation omitted).             \"[G]arden variety manipulation claims\n\nare largely a waste of time.\"           United States v. Montoya, 62 F.3d 1,\n\n4 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n               Since the record on appeal in the instant case fails to\n\nsuggest so much as a hint of bad faith on the part of the\n\ngovernment, the defendants have failed to sustain their burden of\n\nproof, and the \"factfinding\" engaged in by the district court must\n\nbe set aside as plainly speculative and clearly erroneous.                        See\n\nUnited States v. Gibbens, 25 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n     5.        Absence of Injury to Public Health\n\n               Finally,    the   district   court     opined   that    the   record\n\n                                        -14-\n\fcontained no evidence that the milk supplied by the defendants\n\nadversely affected any consumer’s health:\n\n          [T]he commission of the offense did not result\n          in any actual financial loss or health\n          problems.   The dairy industry has confirmed\n          that any potential health hazard would have\n          been neutralized and the below grade quality\n          of the milk would have been enhanced through\n          the treatment, processing, and commingling of\n          the adulterated milk in the silos. As such,\n          the product substitution caused by the\n          addition of non-harmful agents, that is water\n          and salt, would equate to the same guidelines\n          imprisonment   range,    absent   an    upward\n          departure, as that of a defendant who\n          introduced harmful agents to the final milk\n          product or defrauded the victim of an actual\n          $900,000.\n\n          On these identical facts, however, this court had already\n\nheld that (i) the same processor and the ultimate consumers of its\n\nmilk were all victims of the crimes committed by these defendants;\n\n(ii) the ultimate consumers sustained actual financial loss, in\n\nthat the consumers paid Grade A milk prices for milk which was\n\nadulterated and worthless as a matter of law; and (iii) the\n\ndefendants' supposition that the consumers sustained no injury to\n\ntheir health by reason of the adulterated milk was insupportable.\n\nGonzalez-Alvarez, 277 F.3d at 80.9    The case at bar is factually\n\n\n     9\n      Furthermore, the relevant PSRs disclosed that (i) the\ndefendants used contaminated, unsanitary water to dilute their\nmilk; and (ii) the FDA reported that these additions “could have\ncaused the introduction of bacterial/viral organisms that are not\neliminated properly by the pasteurization process and resulted in\nknown and unknown health problems.” The defendants counter that an\nofficial of ORIL, the Commonwealth’s milk regulatory agency, stated\nthat “the pasteurization process would have killed all harmful\n\n                               -15-\n\findistinguishable from Gonzalez-Alvarez.\n\n          Although certain factors relied upon by the district\n\ncourt may be appropriate components of a “multiple causation”\n\ndeparture in particular circumstances, the instant decision related\n\nspecifically to the evidence in this case.    Thus, we simply hold\n\nthat whether evaluated individually or collectively, the five\n\nfactors identified by the district court in the instant case do not\n\nconstitute appropriate grounds for a downward departure.10\n\nB.   The Mental-Health Departure\n\n          The district court discerned an additional ground for its\n\n\nbacteria as required by federal regulations.” We agree with the\ngovernment’s contention that this statement does not contradict the\nFDA statement on the futility of pasteurization.          The ORIL\nofficial, whose announced intention was merely to show that the\ndefendants’ milk was relatively uncontaminated, stated that\npasteurization of defendants’ milk would kill all bacteria in\nunadulterated milk that government-mandated pasteurization is\nexpected to kill, whereas other bacteria or impurities might have\nremained in appellees’ adulterated milk even after pasteurization,\nwhich in turn would have reached the consumer who purchased the\nnon-Grade A milk. See 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) (prohibiting distribution\nof any non-Grade A milk in interstate commerce).\n     10\n       We note that the district court, upon remand following our\nprevious vacatur of these defendants’ sentences, see supra notes 2\n& 3, once again departed downward to the same Sentencing Guidelines\nranges relied upon prior to our remand, and that both district\njudges employed virtually identical language in rationalizing their\ndepartures.   Insofar as this course of action may connote the\ndistrict court's subjective dissatisfaction with the Guidelines’\nsentencing constraints, it is manifestly unavailing. See United\nStates v. Studley, 907 F.2d 254, 260 (1st Cir. 1990) (“Regardless\nof how well founded, a belief by the sentencing judge that the\npunishment set by the Commission is too severe or that the\nguidelines are too inflexible may not be judicial grounds for\ndeparture under the sentencing system mandated by Congress.”)\n(emphasis added).\n\n                               -16-\n\fdownward departure from the applicable guideline sentencing range\n\nwith respect to Picon:\n\n           Shortly after his initial arrest in connection\n           with the instant case, defendant Picon\n           developed mental health problems requiring\n           professional      attention      to    include\n           pharmacology.      His   subsequent   depressed\n           financial situation forced him to sell his\n           contract with the milk industry, cease\n           operations as a dairy farmer, file for\n           bankruptcy, and maintain odd jobs resulting in\n           meager wages all of which contributed to\n           exacerbating his mental health condition.\n           Prolonged incarceration would worsen the\n           defendant’s mental health condition and result\n           in greater costs to the United States.      The\n           Court   understands     that   all   defendants\n           initially suffer from emotional problems at\n           the time of their arrests or during the\n           commencement of the prosecutorial process, but\n           most are able to      overcome the condition.\n           However, in the case of Mr. Picon, that is the\n           defendant, he has not been able to do so.\n           Pursuant   to   his    therapist,   defendant’s\n           prognosis is guarded.      I have examined the\n           therapist’s evaluation submitted to the court.\n\n           The government contends on appeal that the district court\n\nabused   its   discretion   in   relying   upon   Picon’s   mental-health\n\ncondition as a ground for its downward departure, because it failed\n\nto make the requisite express finding that the Bureau of Prisons is\n\nunable to provide Picon with adequate treatment for his condition.\n\n           The Sentencing Guidelines provide:\n\n           Mental and emotional conditions are not\n           ordinarily relevant in determining whether a\n           sentence should be outside the applicable\n           guideline range, except as provided in Chapter\n           Five, Part K, Subpart 2 (Other Grounds for\n           Departure). Mental and emotional conditions\n           may be relevant in determining the conditions\n\n                                   -17-\n\f           of probation or supervised release; e.g.,\n           participation in a mental health program (see\n           §§ 5B1.3(d)(5) and 5D1.3(d)(5)).\n\nU.S.S.G.   §   5H1.3.11      Nevertheless,   departures   based   upon   a\n\ndefendant’s mental condition are discouraged, see United States v.\n\nAker, 181 F.3d 167, 173 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Rivera, 994 F.2d\n\nat 948, which means that the sentencing court must first make a\n\nfinding that the mental condition is extraordinary or atypical, see\n\nKoon, 518 U.S. at 94-95; United States v. Rivera, 192 F.3d 81, 85\n\n(2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Pullen, 89 F.3d 368, 371 (7th Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n           The government’s reliance upon United States v. Studley,\n\n907 F.2d 254 (1st Cir. 1990), is misplaced.         The narrow issue in\n\nStudley was whether the sentencing court should depart downward in\n\nthe event that the Bureau of Prisons were not equipped to treat the\n\ndefendant’s    mental     condition.   Id.   at   259.     Whenever   the\n\nsentencing court intends to depart downward under U.S.S.G. § 5H1.3,\n\nhowever, it must first determine that the defendant’s mental\n\ncondition presents an “extraordinary” or “atypical” case.             See\n\nUnited States v. Doering, 909 F.2d 392, 394-95 (9th Cir. 1990)\n\n\n     11\n      Picon has never contended that his pre-existing depression\nplayed any role in the commission of the underlying offense. See\nU.S.S.G. § 5K2.13 (1997) (“If the defendant committed a non-violent\noffense while suffering from significantly reduced mental capacity\nnot resulting from voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants, a\nlower sentence may be warranted to reflect the extent to which\nreduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the\noffense, provided that the defendant's criminal history does not\nindicate a need for incarceration to protect the public.”).\n\n                                   -18-\n\f(holding that defendant’s need for treatment, standing alone, is\n\nnot an adequate ground for departure); see also United States v.\n\nMoses, 106 F.3d 1273, 1280 (6th Cir. 1997) (same).                      Although the\n\nunavailability    of     an   adequate        prison-treatment       program    could\n\nconceivably give rise to an \"extraordinary\" case, that is not a\n\nsine qua non for a U.S.S.G. § 5H1.3 departure.                   Thus, for example,\n\na sentencing court might determine that a defendant’s mental\n\ncondition    is   such    that     a       lengthy       imprisonment   would       work\n\nirreparable harm, thereby rendering irrelevant the availability vel\n\nnon of prison-treatment programs.\n\n            Turning to this threshold issue, and bearing in mind that\n\ndepartures   under     U.S.S.G.        §   5H1.3        are   discouraged,    our    own\n\nexamination of the medical evaluation relating to Picon’s mental\n\ncondition    clearly     reveals       that       the    district   court    erred   in\n\ndetermining that Picon’s mental condition is extraordinary.                          Dr.\n\nCesar Padilla Maldonado, Picon's psychiatrist, opined that the\n\nindictment had caused Picon major or severe depression,12 which\n\nresulted in business failures and family rifts.13                       Importantly,\n\nhowever, Dr. Maldonado acknowledged that once placed on anti-\n\ndepressant and anti-anxiety medications, Picon had shown marked\n\n\n     12\n      In June 1999, the symptoms included sadness, generalized\nanxiety, poor motivation, indifference, memory loss, poor attention\nspan, and psycho-motor retardation.\n     13\n      Picon successfully engaged in a prolonged legal battle with\nhis ex-wife to retain visitation rights with his seven-year-old\ndaughter.\n\n                                           -19-\n\fimprovement.       See United States v. Peterson, 225 F.3d 1167, 1171\n\n(10th Cir. 2000) (noting that defendant’s treatment for depression\n\nand anxiety not “unusual”); see also U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human\n\nServs. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Servs. Admin., Nat’l\n\nMental Health Info. Ctr., Bulletin Vol. 3, No.2 (2003), available\n\nat http://www.mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/default.asp (reporting that\n\ndepression affects almost one in ten American adults); Nat’l Inst.\n\nof Health, Depression Research Fact Sheet (Apr. 2, 2002), available\n\nat   http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/depresfact.cfm              (“Depressive\n\ndisorders affect approximately 19 million American adults.”).\n\n            Moreover,     Picon    consistently     has     denied     suicidal\n\nideation.    Cf. United States v. Harpst, 949 F.2d 860, 863 (6th\n\n1991) (rejecting downward “mental health” departures based on\n\ndefendant’s suicidal tendencies).           Nor has he ever been diagnosed\n\nwith any extreme form of mental disease, such as psychosis or\n\nschizophrenia.      Cf. United States v. Barton, 76 F.3d 499, 502 (2d\n\nCir. 1996) (vacating § 5H1.3 departure absent evidence defendant\n\nsuffered    from    psychosis,    where   defendant’s     sense   of   morality\n\nremained intact, and “[h]e appreciate[d] both the societal and\n\nmoral constraints of his behavior”); United States v. Lauzon, 938\n\nF.2d 326, 333 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that defendant’s “borderline\n\nintelligence” was not ground for § 5H1.3 departure).              Although Dr.\n\nMaldonado opined that a three-year term of imprisonment would be a\n\n“catastrophic blow” to Picon, nothing in the record on appeal\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fsuggests that Picon’s depression, however unfortunate, rises to the\n\nlevel     of    the   \"extraordinary.\"        Undoubtedly,    imprisonment    is\n\nstressful.       With or without a § 5H1.3 departure, however, Picon\n\nwill be required to serve some prison time, yet will continue to\n\nreceive the same effective treatment in prison.14                   As Picon's\n\ncommission of the criminal offense constituted the catastrophic\n\nevent which precipitated his conviction and imprisonment, the\n\nadverse consequences flowed from his voluntary criminal conduct and\n\nensuing guilty plea.        See United States v. Walker, 27 F.3d 417,\n\n418-19 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding that defendant’s arrest-induced\n\ndepression,       anxiety   and    sleeplessness     were     “irrelevant    for\n\nsentencing purposes,” given that “[p]ost-arrest emotional trauma is\n\na   natural      consequence      of   being     charged     with   a   crime”).\n\nAccordingly, the record in the present case discloses no material\n\nbasis — evidentiary or legal — for concluding that the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines permitted a § 5H1.3 departure, or for that matter, any\n\nother type of guideline departure.\n\n               The sentences imposed by the district court are hereby\n\nreversed; the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion. Upon remand, the cases shall be assigned to a\n\n\n     14\n      The district court’s statement that Picon’s “[p]rolonged\nincarceration would . . . result in greater costs to the United\nStates” is also an inappropriate basis for its departure decision.\nSee United States v. Maldonado, 242 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(noting that costs of incarceration normally are not grounds for\ndownward departure); United States v.

The salt served to increase the weight of the water which was added, thereby effectively disguising the dilution. Moreover, the defendants \"bought off\" the truck drivers employed by the milk processor, in order to entice them to falsify their on-site quality test reports relating to the adulterated milk. Thus, at the plant the processor unwittingly mixed the milk which had been adulterated by the defendants with other regional milk supplies.

As with any guideline departure, however, a \"multiple causation\" departure is permitted only if these extraneous factors are \"of a kind, or [are present] to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(1); <i>see supra</i> note 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Economic Hardship</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in the instant case identified five extraneous factors.

Less production by the farmer results in less profit for the processing plant, thus equates to financial disaster for the farmer.

U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.12 (\"The Commission considered the relevance of economic hardship and determined that personal financial difficulties and economic pressures upon a trade or business do not warrant a decrease in sentence.\"); <i>see Koon v.

In a calculated and self-serving fashion, they recruited, encouraged farmers, or were themselves lured to engage in the adulteration of the milk to assist the farmers in meeting their quota for profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming these district court statements contemplate that the loss calculations were inflated, in that the defendants did not commit the charged offenses alone but conspired with others to achieve their unlawful goal, the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly treat with any such factor. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(1). That is to say, the district court must attribute to the defendants the amounts of loss resulting from \"all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B); <i>see United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 37 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 536 U.S. 948, 122 S.Ct. 2639, 153 L.Ed.2d 819 (2002); <i>United States v. Adeniji,</i> 221 F.3d 1020, 1027 (7th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Duliga,</i> 204 F.3d 97, 100 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is patently clear that the defendants in the instant case fit this description, in that they concededly paid cash to the delivery truck drivers for aiding the concealment of their adulterations. The defendants incorrectly contend that the record demonstrates that the truckers sometimes acted independently of them. In arguing against a more-than-minimal-planning enhancement at the sentencing hearing, defense counsel merely observed that the truck drivers could have loaded adulterated milk at the defendants' farms without the need for the defendants' physical presence, since the truck drivers had ready access to the necessary equipment and supplies. Defense counsel's observation &#8212; which is unsupported by the record, <i>see United States v. Brassard,</i> 212 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that counsel's remarks do not themselves constitute evidence), and which was raised merely to characterize the <i>modus operandi</i> of the defendants' conspiracy as rudimentary &#8212; does not preclude a reasonable inference that the defendants who were not physically present had prior knowledge of, or gave prior consent to, the unsupervised loadings conducted by their coconspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants further contend that the presentence report (PSR) states that other unidentified farmers, neither known to the defendants nor involved in their conspiracy, already had delivered contaminated milk to the plants, and thus were exclusively responsible for at least a portion of the actual milk loss. Quite the contrary, the PSR states simply that the milk in the silos \"may\" have been contaminated by other farmers. The record contains no evidence, however, that any other farmer in fact delivered bad milk to the same silos or at the same times as the defendants' deliveries. <i>See United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1198-99 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting that sentencing findings must derive from some identifiable evidentiary basis in record). In any event, the defendants are not only responsible for the actual loss, but for the intended loss, <i>see United States v. Gonzalez-Alvarez,</i> 277 F.3d 73, 80-81 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that defendant is responsible for intended loss if it exceeds actual loss), and it is beyond serious dispute that these defendants intended and foresaw that their adulterated milk would end up in the silos and contaminate the entire contents, resulting in a total loss of <i>all</i> those milk stocks. Accordingly, we conclude that the purported conduct of the truck drivers, whether or not defendants' coconspirators, cannot constitute a legitimate ground for a \"multiple causation\" departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Conduct of the Victim's Agents</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to identify the purported complicity of the milk plant employees in the defendants' milk-adulteration scheme as a further factor providing support for its downward departure:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t was business as usual at the processing plant as it was well known who were the truckers engaged in the adulteration of milk. However, plant managers neglectfully turned the other way, consciously failed their duty and responsibility to expose the corrupt truckers to their superiors or authorities, and contributed to the lawful (sic) practice by assuring that the profitable routes involving farmers actively adulterating milk were assigned to the corrupt truckers. It would be incredulous (sic) that the managerial/supervisory staff at the processing plant was not aware or could not have been aware of the unlawful adulteration process, therefore, [it] significantly contributed to the total loss through aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A victim's conduct may warrant a downward departure where the victim significantly contributed to an increase in the amount of loss. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d 398, 407 n. 8 (1st Cir. 1995). Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the same rule might apply even though the defendants injured other victims who concededly did not contribute to the loss (<i>viz.,</i> milk consumers), the evidentiary record in the instant case cannot meet such a standard. First, there is no record support for the district court's supposition that the plant managers knew or should have known of the adulteration perpetrated by the defendants, nor that the plant managers acted either negligently or improperly. <i>See Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1198-99. <i>But cf. Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d at 407 n. 8 (noting that defrauded bank officials conducted themselves in \"incredibly negligent fashion\" by approving fraudulent loans \"with an abandon commonly associated with drunken sailors,\" and routinely violated official bank policies).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, these defendants \"paid off\" the truck drivers for the very purpose of obtaining their assistance in disguising their own adulteration of the milk upon its arrival at the plant. Consequently, there is simply no record evidence that the adulteration would have been patently obvious to any other employees at the plant. <i>Cf.</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, comment. (n.11) (providing that downward departure for inflated loss may be warranted where \"no one would seriously consider honoring\" the fraudulent instrument); <i>United States v. LeRose,</i> 219 F.3d 335, 338-39 (4th Cir. 2000) (noting lack of record evidence that bank's conduct affected amount of loss, or that negotiated instrument was \"obviously fraudulent\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Sentencing Manipulation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fourth basis for its downward departure, the district court concluded that the government contributed to the amount of the loss:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The [FDA] agent also played a role in the overall accumulation of loss as he decided when enough information had been gathered to initiate the prosecution of the defendant, contributed to the actual adulteration of the milk, and allowed the adulterated milk to reach the silos at the processing plant. The defendant was charged with eleven separate acts of adulteration spanning a period of approximately four years. As such, the number of times the defendant was allowed to engage in the adulteration process corresponds to the number of times the delivery truck was also increasing the volume of adulterated milk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government manipulation designed solely to increase the severity of a criminal sentence may afford a ground for departure, provided there is sufficient record evidence to demonstrate that the government acted in \"bad faith.\" <i>See Gonzalez-Alvarez,</i> 277 F.3d at 80-81 (noting that calculation of amount of intended loss was based on defendant's assumption that government would not discover his adulteration). \"Given the wide latitude we afford the government in conducting sting operations, `the burden of showing sentencing factor manipulation [necessarily] rests with the defendant. As with other fact-sensitive sentencing issues, the burden of proof must be carried by a preponderance of the evidence.'\" <i>United States v. Rizzo,</i> 121 F.3d 794, 801 (1st Cir.1997) (citation omitted). \"[G]arden variety manipulation claims are largely a waste of time.\" <i>United States v. Montoya,</i> 62 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the record on appeal in the instant case fails to suggest so much as a hint of bad faith on the part of the government, the defendants have failed to sustain their burden of proof, and the \"factfinding\" engaged in by the district court must be set aside as plainly speculative and clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v. Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>Absence of Injury to Public Health</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court opined that the record contained no evidence that the milk supplied by the defendants adversely affected any consumer's health:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he commission of the offense did not result in any actual financial loss or health problems. The dairy industry has confirmed that any potential health hazard would have been neutralized and the below grade quality of the milk would have been enhanced through the treatment, processing, and commingling of the adulterated milk in the silos. As such, the product substitution caused by the addition of non-harmful agents, that is water and salt, would equate to the same guidelines imprisonment range, absent an upward departure, as that of a defendant who introduced harmful agents to the final milk product or defrauded the victim of an actual $900,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these identical facts, however, this court had already held that (i) the same processor and the ultimate consumers of its milk were <i>all victims</i> of the crimes committed by these defendants; (ii) the ultimate consumers sustained actual financial loss, in that the consumers paid Grade A milk prices for milk which was adulterated and worthless as a matter of law; and (iii) the defendants' supposition that the consumers sustained no injury to their health by reason of the adulterated milk was insupportable. <i>Gonzalez-Alvarez,</i> 277 F.3d at 80.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The case at bar is factually indistinguishable from <i>Gonzalez-Alvarez.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although certain factors relied upon by the district court may be appropriate components of a \"multiple causation\" departure in particular circumstances, the instant decision related specifically to the evidence in this case. Thus, we simply hold that whether evaluated individually or collectively, the five factors identified by the district court in the instant case do not constitute appropriate grounds for a downward departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Mental-Health Departure</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court discerned an additional ground for its downward departure from the applicable guideline sentencing range with respect to Picon:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after his initial arrest in connection with the instant case, defendant Picon developed mental health problems requiring professional attention to include pharmacology. His subsequent depressed financial situation forced him to sell his contract with the milk industry, cease operations as a dairy farmer, file for bankruptcy, and maintain odd jobs resulting in meager wages all of which contributed to exacerbating his mental health condition. Prolonged incarceration would worsen the defendant's mental health condition and result in greater costs to the United States. The Court understands that all defendants initially suffer from emotional problems at the time of their arrests or during the commencement of the prosecutorial process, but most are able to overcome the condition. However, in the case of Mr. Picon, that is the defendant, he has not been able to do so. Pursuant to his therapist, defendant's prognosis is guarded. I have examined the therapist's evaluation submitted to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in relying upon Picon's mental-health condition as a ground for its downward departure, because it failed to make the requisite express finding that the Bureau of Prisons is unable to provide Picon with adequate treatment for his condition. The Sentencing Guidelines provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range, except as provided in Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2 (Other Grounds for Departure). Mental and emotional conditions may be relevant in determining the conditions of probation or supervised release; <i>e.g.,</i> participation in a mental health program (see &#167;&#167; 5B1.3(d)(5) and 5D1.3(d)(5)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Nevertheless, departures based upon a defendant's mental condition are discouraged, <i>see United States v. Aker,</i> 181 F.3d 167, 173 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also Rivera,</i> 994 F.2d at 948, which means that the sentencing court must first make a finding that the mental condition is extraordinary or atypical, <i>see Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 94-95, 116 S.Ct. 2035; <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 192 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Pullen,</i> 89 F.3d 368, 371 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's reliance upon <i>United States v. Studley,</i> 907 F.2d 254 (1st Cir.1990), is misplaced. The narrow issue in <i>Studley</i> was whether the sentencing court should depart downward in the event that the Bureau of Prisons were not equipped to treat the defendant's mental condition. <i>Id.</i> at 259. Whenever the sentencing court intends to depart downward under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.3, however, it must first determine that the defendant's mental condition presents an \"extraordinary\" or \"atypical\" case. <i>See United States v. Doering,</i> 909 F.2d 392, 394-95 (9th Cir. 1990) (holding that defendant's need for treatment, standing alone, is not an adequate ground for departure); <i>see also United States v. Moses,</i> 106 F.3d 1273, 1280 (6th Cir.1997) (same). Although the unavailability of an adequate prison-treatment program could conceivably give rise to an \"extraordinary\" case, that is not a <i>sine qua non</i> for a U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.3 departure. Thus, for example, a sentencing court might determine that a defendant's mental condition is such that a lengthy imprisonment would work irreparable harm, thereby rendering irrelevant the availability <i>vel non</i> of prison-treatment programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to this threshold issue, and bearing in mind that departures under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.3 are discouraged, our own examination of the medical evaluation relating to Picon's mental condition clearly reveals that the district court erred in determining that Picon's mental condition is extraordinary. Dr. Cesar Padilla Maldonado, Picon's psychiatrist, opined that the indictment had caused Picon major or severe depression,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> which resulted in business failures and family rifts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Importantly, however, Dr. Maldonado acknowledged that once placed on anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications, Picon had shown marked improvement. <i>See United States v. Peterson,</i> 225 F.3d 1167, 1171 (10th Cir.2000) (noting that defendant's treatment for depression and anxiety not \"unusual\"); <i>see also</i> U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Servs. Admin., Nat'l Mental Health Info. Ctr., Bulletin Vol. 3, No. 2 (2003), <i>available at http://www.mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/default.asp</i> (reporting that depression affects almost one in ten American adults); Nat'l Inst. of Health, Depression Research Fact Sheet (Apr. 2, 2002), <i>available at http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/depresfact.cfm</i> (\"Depressive disorders affect approximately 19 million American adults.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Picon consistently has denied suicidal ideation. <i>Cf. United States v. Harpst,</i> 949 F.2d 860, 863 (6th 1991) (rejecting downward \"mental health\" departures based on defendant's suicidal tendencies). Nor has he ever been diagnosed with any extreme form of mental disease, such as psychosis or schizophrenia. <i>Cf. United States v. Barton,</i> 76 F.3d 499, 502 (2d Cir.1996) (vacating &#167; 5H1.3 departure absent evidence defendant suffered from psychosis, where defendant's sense of morality remained intact, and \"[h]e appreciate[d] both the societal and moral constraints of his behavior\"); <i>United States v. Lauzon,</i> 938 F.2d 326, 333 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that defendant's \"borderline intelligence\" was not ground for &#167; 5H1.3 departure). Although Dr. Maldonado opined that a three-year term of imprisonment would be a \"catastrophic blow\" to Picon, nothing in the record on appeal suggests that Picon's depression, however unfortunate, rises to the level of the \"extraordinary.\" Undoubtedly, imprisonment is stressful. With or without a &#167; 5H1.3 departure, however, Picon will be required to serve some prison time, yet will continue to receive the same effective treatment in prison.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> As Picon's commission of the criminal offense constituted the catastrophic event which precipitated his conviction and imprisonment, the adverse consequences flowed from his voluntary criminal conduct and ensuing guilty plea. <i>See United States v. Walker,</i> 27 F.3d 417, 418-19 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that defendant's arrest-induced depression, anxiety and sleeplessness were \"irrelevant for sentencing purposes,\" given that \"[p]ost-arrest emotional trauma is a natural consequence of being charged with a crime\").

The salt served to increase the weight of the water which was added, thereby effectively disguising the dilution. Moreover, the defendants \"bought off\" the truck drivers employed by the milk processor, in order to entice them to falsify their on-site quality test reports relating to the adulterated milk. Thus, at the plant the processor unwittingly mixed the milk which had been adulterated by the defendants with other regional milk supplies.

Quite the contrary, the PSR states simply that the milk in the silos \"may\" have been contaminated by other farmers. The record contains no evidence, however, that any other farmer in fact delivered bad milk to the same silos or at the same times as the defendants' deliveries. <i>See United States v.

Accordingly, we conclude that the purported conduct of the truck drivers, whether or not defendants' coconspirators, cannot constitute a legitimate ground for a \"multiple causation\" departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Conduct of the Victim's Agents</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to identify the purported complicity of the milk plant employees in the defendants' milk-adulteration scheme as a further factor providing support for its downward departure:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t was business as usual at the processing plant as it was well known who were the truckers engaged in the adulteration of milk. However, plant managers neglectfully turned the other way, consciously failed their duty and responsibility to expose the corrupt truckers to their superiors or authorities, and contributed to the lawful (sic) practice by assuring that the profitable routes involving farmers actively adulterating milk were assigned to the corrupt truckers. It would be incredulous (sic) that the managerial/supervisory staff at the processing plant was not aware or could not have been aware of the unlawful adulteration process, therefore, [it] significantly contributed to the total loss through aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A victim's conduct may warrant a downward departure where the victim significantly contributed to an increase in the amount of loss. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Rostoff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 407 n. 8 (1st Cir. 1995). Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the same rule might apply even though the defendants injured other victims who concededly did not contribute to the loss (<i>viz.,</i> milk consumers), the evidentiary record in the instant case cannot meet such a standard. First, there is no record support for the district court's supposition that the plant managers knew or should have known of the adulteration perpetrated by the defendants, nor that the plant managers acted either negligently or improperly. <i>See Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1198-99. <i>But cf. Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d at 407 n. 8 (noting that defrauded bank officials conducted themselves in \"incredibly negligent fashion\" by approving fraudulent loans \"with an abandon commonly associated with drunken sailors,\" and routinely violated official bank policies).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, these defendants \"paid off\" the truck drivers for the very purpose of obtaining their assistance in disguising their own adulteration of the milk upon its arrival at the plant. Consequently, there is simply no record evidence that the adulteration would have been patently obvious to any other employees at the plant. <i>Cf.</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, comment.

The defendant was charged with eleven separate acts of adulteration spanning a period of approximately four years. As such, the number of times the defendant was allowed to engage in the adulteration process corresponds to the number of times the delivery truck was also increasing the volume of adulterated milk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government manipulation designed solely to increase the severity of a criminal sentence may afford a ground for departure, provided there is sufficient record evidence to demonstrate that the government acted in \"bad faith.\" <i>See Gonzalez-Alvarez,</i> 277 F.3d at 80-81 (noting that calculation of amount of intended loss was based on defendant's assumption that government would not discover his adulteration). \"Given the wide latitude we afford the government in conducting sting operations, `the burden of showing sentencing factor manipulation [necessarily] rests with the defendant.

The dairy industry has confirmed that any potential health hazard would have been neutralized and the below grade quality of the milk would have been enhanced through the treatment, processing, and commingling of the adulterated milk in the silos. As such, the product substitution caused by the addition of non-harmful agents, that is water and salt, would equate to the same guidelines imprisonment range, absent an upward departure, as that of a defendant who introduced harmful agents to the final milk product or defrauded the victim of an actual $900,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these identical facts, however, this court had already held that (i) the same processor and the ultimate consumers of its milk were <i>all victims</i> of the crimes committed by these defendants; (ii) the ultimate consumers sustained actual financial loss, in that the consumers paid Grade A milk prices for milk which was adulterated and worthless as a matter of law; and (iii) the defendants' supposition that the consumers sustained no injury to their health by reason of the adulterated milk was insupportable. <i>Gonzalez-Alvarez,</i> 277 F.3d at 80.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The case at bar is factually indistinguishable from <i>Gonzalez-Alvarez.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although certain factors relied upon by the district court may be appropriate components of a \"multiple causation\" departure in particular circumstances, the instant decision related specifically to the evidence in this case. Thus, we simply hold that whether evaluated individually or collectively, the five factors identified by the district court in the instant case do not constitute appropriate grounds for a downward departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Mental-Health Departure</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court discerned an additional ground for its downward departure from the applicable guideline sentencing range with respect to Picon:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after his initial arrest in connection with the instant case, defendant Picon developed mental health problems requiring professional attention to include pharmacology. His subsequent depressed financial situation forced him to sell his contract with the milk industry, cease operations as a dairy farmer, file for bankruptcy, and maintain odd jobs resulting in meager wages all of which contributed to exacerbating his mental health condition. Prolonged incarceration would worsen the defendant's mental health condition and result in greater costs to the United States. The Court understands that all defendants initially suffer from emotional problems at the time of their arrests or during the commencement of the prosecutorial process, but most are able to overcome the condition. However, in the case of Mr. Picon, that is the defendant, he has not been able to do so. Pursuant to his therapist, defendant's prognosis is guarded.

Whenever the sentencing court intends to depart downward under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.3, however, it must first determine that the defendant's mental condition presents an \"extraordinary\" or \"atypical\" case. <i>See United States v.

Although the unavailability of an adequate prison-treatment program could conceivably give rise to an \"extraordinary\" case, that is not a <i>sine qua non</i> for a U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.3 departure.

Dr. Cesar Padilla Maldonado, Picon's psychiatrist, opined that the indictment had caused Picon major or severe depression,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> which resulted in business failures and family rifts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Importantly, however, Dr. Maldonado acknowledged that once placed on anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications, Picon had shown marked improvement. <i>See United States v.

Although Dr. Maldonado opined that a three-year term of imprisonment would be a \"catastrophic blow\" to Picon, nothing in the record on appeal suggests that Picon's depression, however unfortunate, rises to the level of the \"extraordinary.\" Undoubtedly, imprisonment is stressful.

The ORIL official, whose announced intention was merely to show that the defendants' milk was<i>relatively</i> uncontaminated, stated that pasteurization of defendants' milk would kill all bacteria in <i>unadulterated</i> milk that government-mandated pasteurization is expected to kill, whereas other bacteria or impurities might have remained in appellees' adulterated milk even after pasteurization, which in turn would have reached the consumer who purchased the non-Grade A milk. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 331(a) (prohibiting distribution of any non-Grade A milk in interstate commerce).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> We note that the district court, upon remand following our previous vacatur of these defendants' sentences,<i>see supra</i> notes 2 &amp; 3, once again departed downward to the same Sentencing Guidelines ranges relied upon prior to our remand, and that both district judges employed virtually identical language in rationalizing their departures. Insofar as this course of action may connote the district court's subjective dissatisfaction with the Guidelines' sentencing constraints, it is manifestly unavailing. <i>See United States v.
