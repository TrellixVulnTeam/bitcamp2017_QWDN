Three     attorneys       who\n\nrepresented Stephen A. Saccoccia — a convicted drug dealer and\n\nmoney launderer — appeal from a district court order directing that\n\nthey forfeit some of their attorney fees to the government.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n            The grand jury returned an indictment against Stephen A.\n\nSaccoccia    in     November    1991,   charging       him   with    one    count    of\n\nconspiracy     under      the     Racketeering         Influenced     and    Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1963(d) (RICO), as well as several\n\ncounts of laundering proceeds from an illegal drug trafficking\n\noperation.    See United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).      The government also sought the forfeiture of all the\n\nbusiness and personal property directly or indirectly derived from\n\nSaccoccia's racketeering activities, explicitly including almost\n\n$137,000,000 in currency, and, in the alternative, sought the\n\nsurrender of all non-tainted property of equivalent value (if any)\n\nshould Saccoccia's tainted property have become unavailable.                        See\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 1963(a), (m).            The district court promptly enjoined\n\nthe   transfer      of   the    forfeitable     property     designated      in     the\n\nindictment.       See id. § 1963(d)(1)(A).\n\n            Saccoccia      retained     Jack     Hill,    Esquire,    and    Kenneth\n\nO'Donnell, Esquire, to defend him in the RICO prosecution; he\n\nretained Stephen Finta, Esquire, to defend him against money\n\n\n                                          3\n\flaundering charges pending in California.                  We turn now to a more\n\ndetailed description of the district court proceedings below.\n\n             Beginning        in   March     1992,      under   rather     suspicious\n\ncircumstances, Saccoccia caused $504,985 to be delivered to Hill,\n\n$410,000 to O'Donnell, and $469,200 to Finta, all for legal fees.\n\nApproximately one year later, Saccoccia was convicted and ordered\n\nto    forfeit    the    $137,000,000         in    currency     specified    in   the\n\nindictment.     We subsequently affirmed both the conviction and the\n\nforfeiture.     Saccoccia, 58 F.3d at 754; see also United States v.\n\nHurley, 63 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1995).                Once the government discovered\n\nthat Saccoccia had paid large legal fees to Hill, O'Donnell, and\n\nFinta, it submitted a motion to compel them to turn over the fees\n\nas property subject to forfeiture.\n\n             The district court granted the motion to compel, United\n\nStates v. Saccoccia, 165 F. Supp. 2d 103 (D.R.I. 2001), holding\n\nthat (i) the government established that the legal fees paid to the\n\nappellants      must    have       derived       from   Saccoccia’s      racketeering\n\nactivity, given that Saccoccia had no legitimate sources of income,\n\nand   the    legal     fees    were    paid       “under   especially     suspicious\n\ncircumstances” (viz., by “covert deliveries of large quantities of\n\ncash, made by anonymous intermediaries”), id. at 111-12; (ii)\n\nappellants met their burden of proving that they had no reasonable\n\ncause to believe that the monies Saccoccia used to pay their fees,\n\nprior to Saccoccia’s conviction, were subject to forfeiture, given\n\n\n                                             4\n\fthat   an    Assistant      United     States       Attorney’s       pre-conviction\n\nassurances to appellants — that the government would not seek\n\nforfeiture     of   their    legal     fees     —    implied     some     government\n\nuncertainty regarding whether Saccoccia might possess sufficient\n\nnon-tainted assets with which to pay his attorneys, id. at 112\n\n(citing 18 U.S.C. § 1963(c)); (iii) following the trial at which\n\nSaccoccia     was   convicted,       appellants      could     not    have   held   a\n\nreasonable belief that Saccoccia's assets were not subject to\n\nforfeiture,    given   that    the     trial    record    made       it   clear   that\n\nvirtually all of Saccoccia’s assets had been derived through\n\nillegitimate means, id. at 112-13; (iv) appellants were ordered to\n\nturn over only the portion of their legal fees received following\n\nSaccoccia’s conviction, id. at 113; and (v) the government could\n\nnot reach their pre-conviction legal fees by means of the district\n\ncourt's contempt power due to the fact that the government had\n\ninitiated no such proceeding and the district court had already\n\ndetermined that appellants lacked reasonable cause to believe that\n\nthe pre-conviction legal fees were subject to forfeiture, hence\n\nappellants could not have violated the post-indictment injunction\n\nwillfully, id. at 113-14.\n\n            Appellants now challenge the district court order which\n\ndetermined that their post-conviction legal fees are subject to\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\fforfeiture.1\n\n                                    II\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\n           Appellants Hill and O’Donnell contend, as they did in\n\nopposing   the   government’s    motion   to   compel   below,     that    the\n\nforfeiture statute does not permit the government to reach the\n\nlegal fees they received from Saccoccia, due to the fact that those\n\nfees have been expended.      We subject statutory interpretations to\n\nplenary review.    See Bryson v. Shumway, 308 F.3d 79, 84 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).2\n\n           The    operative   statutory   language      requires    that    a\n\ndefendant forfeit “tainted” property, viz., property (i) acquired\n\nby committing the offense, and (ii) “constituting, or derived from,\n\nany proceeds . . . obtained, directly or indirectly” from its\n\ncommission.      18 U.S.C. § 1963(a)(1),(3).3        Once an indictment\n\n\n\n     1\n      For its part, the government has not cross-appealed from the\ndistrict court ruling that the legal fees appellants received prior\nto the Saccoccia conviction are not subject to forfeiture.\n     2\n      As the forfeiture provisions prescribed by RICO are\nsubstantially similar to the criminal forfeiture provisions in 21\nU.S.C § 853, we cite cases interpreting § 853 as persuasive\nanalogous authority. See United States v. Hooper, 229 F.3d 818,\n821 n.7 (1st Cir. 2000).\n     3\n      For instance, the profits Saccoccia derived from the                drug\nconspiracy would be subject to forfeiture under subsection                (1).\nWere Saccoccia to use some of the drug profits to purchase a              boat\nfor $50,000, the boat would be forfeitable, under subsection              (3),\nas property “derived from” tainted proceeds, even though                   not\nutilized in the conspiracy.\n\n                                    6\n\fissues, the district court may enjoin the transfer of all property\n\n“subject to forfeiture under [section 1963].”                    Id. § 1963(d)(1).\n\nIn the event that tainted property is unavailable for forfeiture\n\n(as when it has been transferred to a third party),4 the government\n\nmay    recover        “substitute”     property,       viz.,     defendant’s    other\n\nuntainted property of equivalent value.                 See id. § 1963(m); United\n\nStates      v.    Lester,     85    F.3d   1409,    1411   n.3    (9th   Cir.   1996)\n\n(“‘[S]ubstitute property,’ . . . by its very nature is ‘not\n\nconnected to the underlying crime.’”) (citation omitted).5\n\n                 The operative statute enables the government to recover\n\nfrom       the   defendant    “tainted”      or    “substitute”     property     in   a\n\ndefendant’s possession, or “tainted” property held by a third party\n\nby virtue of a voidable fraudulent transfer.                     Id. § 1963(c).6      A\n\nthird party may petition the court for a hearing to determine the\n\nvalidity         of   its   legal   interest      in   tainted    property,     id.   §\n\n1963(l)(2), and may defeat a forfeiture petition by establishing,\n\n\n       4\n      Tainted property may be unreachable if it “(1) cannot be\nlocated upon the exercise of due diligence; (2) has been\ntransferred or sold to, or deposited with, a third party; (3) has\nbeen placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court;(4) has been\nsubstantially diminished in value; or (5) has been commingled with\nother property which cannot be divided without difficulty.” 18\nU.S.C. § 1963(m).\n       5\n      The original district court forfeiture order against\nSaccoccia was amended to include his substitute assets based on\nevidence that Saccoccia was in the process of transferring tainted\nassets. See Saccoccia, 58 F.3d at 783.\n       6\n      Subsection 1963(k) accords the government extraordinary\ndiscovery rights in identifying and locating forfeitable property.\n\n                                            7\n\finter alia, that it is a bona fide purchaser for value, “reasonably\n\nwithout   cause   to   believe”   that   the   property   was   subject   to\n\nforfeiture at the time it was purchased, id. § 1963(l)(6)(B).\n\n           Nonetheless,    the    “substitute   property”   provision     is\n\nexclusively applicable to “any other property of the defendant.”\n\nId. § 1963(m) (emphasis added).          The statutory language plainly\n\ndoes not afford an avenue through which the government may reach a\n\nthird party’s untainted assets as a substitute for tainted assets\n\nwhich the third party had already transferred prior to the date of\n\nforfeiture.   See Bryson, 308 F.3d at 84 (“If the meaning of a\n\nstatute is clear, we enforce that meaning.”); United States v.\n\nMeade, 175 F.3d 215, 219 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that when “the\n\nplain language of a statute unambiguously reveals its meaning, and\n\nthe revealed meaning is not eccentric, courts need not consult\n\nother aids to statutory construction.”); see also Lohnes v. Level\n\n3 Communications, Inc., 272 F.3d 49, 61 (1st Cir. 2001) (“[T]he\n\nmaxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius instructs that, ‘when\n\nparties list specific items in a document, any item not so listed\n\nis typically thought to be excluded.’\") (citation omitted).7\n\n\n     7\n      The government’s contrary argument relies primarily upon one\nunpublished decision as “persuasive authority.” United States v.\nMcCorkle, No. 6:98-CR-52-ORL-19C, 2000 WL 133759 (M.D. Fla. Jan.\n14, 2000) (holding that government could recoup attorney's other\nproperty where he had already dissipated the tainted legal fees);\nsee also 1st Cir. Local R. 32.3(b). However, McCorkle contains\nneither an analysis of the pertinent statutory provisions, nor any\nother authority supporting its conclusory holding.         Indeed,\nMcCorkle erroneously cites United States v. Moffitt, Zwerler &\n\n                                     8\n\f          The government does not contend that it can recover the\n\n\"tainted\" property already transferred to Hill and O'Donnell by\n\nSaccoccia (i.e., the in-cash legal fees), nor does it maintain that\n\neither Hill or O'Donnell presently holds any property fairly\n\ntraceable to, or acquired with the proceeds of, their legal fees.\n\nRather, it argues that its right to recover derives from the\n\nknowing violations, by Hill and O'Donnell, of the post-indictment\n\ninjunction entered pursuant to § 1963(d)(1), which constrained\n\nSaccoccia and his counsel from transferring any funds subject to\n\nforfeiture under subsection 1963(a). Cf. United States v. Moffitt,\n\nZwerling & Kemler, 864 F. Supp. 527, 530-31 (E.D. Va. 1994)\n\n(finding assets non-forfeitable where transfers to counsel occurred\n\nprior to injunction); id. at 544 n.46 (“Where an attorney accepts\n\npayment in violation of such a restraining order, the government\n\ncan recover regardless of the fact that the attorney has dissipated\n\nthe funds.”), rev’d on other grounds, 83 F.3d 660 (4th Cir. 1996).\n\n          The absence of language in subsection 1963(m), relating\n\nto the forfeitability vel non of a third party’s substitute assets,\n\nsimply forecloses one form of remedy, not all.      Relief from a\n\n\n\nKemler, 83 F.3d 660, 667-70 (4th Cir. 1996), for the proposition\nthat the forfeiture statute “does not abrogate the government’s\nright to recover attorneys’ fees that have been dissipated by a\nthird party law firm,” McCorkle, 2000 WL 133759, at *3 (citing\nMoffitt, 83 F.3d at 666-69), even though Moffitt found the basis\nfor the government’s potential recovery not in the forfeiture\nstatute’s “substitute asset” provision, but in an extra-statutory\nclaim for common-law conversion, see infra.\n\n                                9\n\fwillful violation of a subsection 1963(d)(1) injunction may be\n\nobtained   in    a   contempt    proceeding.      See    United   States   v.\n\nKirschenbaum, 156 F.3d 784, 795 (7th Cir. 1998).                On the other\n\nhand, the government’s initiation of contempt proceedings would\n\nsignificantly alter its burden in litigation.           Whereas subsections\n\n1963(c) and (l)(6) require the third party to establish that it was\n\nwithout reasonable cause to believe that the transferred property\n\nwas subject to forfeiture under subsection 1963(a), in a criminal\n\nor civil contempt proceeding the government would bear the burden\n\nof persuasion on that issue.         In a criminal contempt proceeding,\n\nmoreover, the government’s burden of proof would be beyond-a-\n\nreasonable-doubt, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 42; United States v. Mourad,\n\n289 F.3d 174, 180 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 337 (2002);\n\nand in a civil contempt proceeding, clear and convincing evidence\n\nwould be required, see AccuSoft Corp. v. Palo, 237 F.3d 31, 47 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).     See generally United States v. Marquado, 149 F.3d 36,\n\n39-40 (1st Cir. 1998) (describing salient differences between\n\ncriminal and civil contempt proceedings).               The district court\n\nnoted, however, that “the government is not seeking to hold the\n\nattorneys in contempt.”         Saccoccia, 165 F. Supp. 2d at 114.\n\n           Additionally,        subsection   1963(m)    would   not   preempt\n\nvarious remedies otherwise available to the government outside the\n\nforfeiture statute, which would maximize its monetary recovery from\n\nthe substitute assets of culpable third parties. See United States\n\n\n                                      10\n\fv. Moffitt, Zwerling & Kemler, 83 F.3d 660, 667-70 (4th Cir. 1996)\n\n(holding that § 1963(m) does not preempt state common-law claims\n\nthat enable the government to reach a third-party transferee’s\n\nsubstitute assets).         For instance, since the government’s right,\n\ntitle, and interest in all tainted property “relates back” to the\n\ndate Saccoccia committed the relevant acts, see 18 U.S.C. § 1963(c)\n\n(“All    right,   title,     and   interest    in    property       described    in\n\nsubsection (a) vests in the United States upon the commission of\n\nthe act giving rise to the forfeiture.”), presumably it could\n\ninitiate a state-law proceeding against Hill and O’Donnell for\n\nconversion of such property, and recover compensatory damages from\n\ntheir non-tainted assets.          See Fuscellaro v. Indus. Nat’l Corp.,\n\n368 A.2d 1227, 1230 (R.I. 1997) (“[T]he gravamen of an action for\n\nconversion     lies   in     the   defendant’s      taking    the     plaintiff’s\n\npersonalty     without      consent    and   exercising      dominion    over    it\n\ninconsistent with the plaintiff’s right of possession.”). However,\n\nhad the government brought such a tort claim in the district court,\n\nthe claim presumably would be adjudicated under substantially\n\ndifferent standards than a claim under subsection 1963(a) or (m),\n\nsince the government would bear the burden of proof, and appellants\n\nmight be entitled to additional procedural safeguards under state\n\nlaw, such as a right to jury trial.            See, e.g., Ross v. Bernhard,\n\n396     U.S.   531,   533    (1970);    Evergreen    Marine     Corp.    v.     Six\n\nConsignments of Frozen Scallops, 4 F.3d 90, 95 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\n\n                                        11\n\fRussell v. City of Bryan, 919 S.W.2d 698, 704 (Tx. App. 1996);\n\nMeyers Way Dev. Ltd. P’ship v. Univ. Sav. Bank, 910 P.2d 1308, 1320\n\n(Wash. Ct. App. 1996).\n\n              At first blush, the present holding may appear to diverge\n\nfrom   the    stated     legislative    intent        to   accord        the    government\n\nextremely      aggressive     forfeiture         remedies     so     as    to    preclude\n\ncriminals from realizing the monetary benefits of their crimes.\n\nSee Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617,\n\n631 (1989).        On the other hand, the very potency of the forfeiture\n\npower demands that it be reasonably contained within ascertainable\n\nlimits.      Thus, for example, Congress provided that a non-defendant\n\nthird party with rights in forfeitable property may redeem its\n\ninterest      by    establishing     either       (i)      that     it    predated       the\n\ndefendant’s crime, see United States v. Lester, 85 F.3d 1409, 1414\n\n(9th   Cir.    1996)     (holding    that       non-defendant       spouse       had    non-\n\nforfeitable pre-existing interest in jointly-held property), or\n\n(ii) that it subsequently acquired a non-forfeitable interest under\n\na bona fide purchase for value, see 18 U.S.C. § 1963(l)(6).\n\n              The implicit limitation in § 1963(m) — the “substitute\n\nassets”      provision    —   that   the    government        may    reach       only   the\n\ndefendant’s substitute assets and not those of a third party – is\n\nsimilar in nature.        Forfeiture is an in personam criminal remedy,\n\ntargeted primarily at the defendant who committed the criminal\n\noffense.       See    Lester,   85    F.3d       at   1414   n.8     (noting      crucial\n\n\n                                           12\n\fdistinction between in personam judgment in criminal forfeiture\n\nproceeding and in rem judgment in civil forfeiture proceeding).\n\n               Finally, the implicit limitation in § 1963(m) does not\n\ntrammel   the     basic    statutory    policy    by    foreclosing        all   other\n\nremedies available to the government, nor does it enable culpable\n\nattorneys to dissipate tainted fees with impunity.                       Rather, the\n\ngovernment may utilize its enforcement powers under subsection\n\n1963(k) to       “trace”    tainted    funds,    see supra        note    6,   thereby\n\ndisproving the contention that appellants’ cash-on-hand is neither\n\nthe tainted fees, nor other property directly or indirectly derived\n\nfrom the tainted fees.           Furthermore, absent such evidence, the\n\ngovernment may reach other non-tainted cash of the attorneys by\n\nsustaining      the   somewhat   weightier,      though     not    insurmountable,\n\nburden    of    establishing     the    elements       of   either       contempt   or\n\nconversion.\n\n               As our construction of the language utilized in the\n\nforfeiture statute is one of first impression, the forfeiture award\n\nagainst Hill and O’Donnell must be vacated and the case must be\n\nremanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.         Upon remand, the government is to be accorded\n\na   reasonable     opportunity    to    determine      whether     it     intends   to\n\ninstitute contempt proceedings or submit conversion claims against\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fappellants.8\n\n          Accordingly,   the   district   court   order   directing\n\nappellants Hill and O'Donnell to surrender their post-conviction\n\nlegal fees is hereby vacated, and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.     The order to compel\n\n\n\n     8\n      Unlike Hill and O'Donnell, Finta failed to raise the\n“substitute assets” issue on appeal. Further, Finta's arguments on\nappeal are meritless.    First, he argues that we lack appellate\njurisdiction because the district court did not reduce its final\njudgment of forfeiture to a separate document, as required by\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 58. Assuming arguendo that Rule 58\nwould apply to a criminal forfeiture proceeding against non-\ndefendants, but see Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c), Finta unquestionably\nwaived the \"separate document\" rule by appealing from the district\ncourt’s July 31, 2001 judgment without objection from the\ngovernment. See Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381, 385\n(1978) (“If, by error, a separate judgment is not filed before a\nparty appeals, nothing but delay would flow from requiring the\ncourt of appeals to dismiss the appeal.       Upon dismissal, the\ndistrict court would simply file and enter the separate judgment,\nfrom which a timely appeal would then be taken. Wheels would spin\nfor no practical purpose.”); Fiore v. Washington County Cmty.\nHealth Ctr., 960 F.2d 229, 235 (1st Cir. 1992).\n     Second, Finta contends that the district court decision\nviolated his Fifth Amendment rights to notice and to confront\nwitnesses, by relying upon evidence introduced at the Saccoccia\ncriminal trial in which Finta did not participate. This argument\nhas been forfeited by Finta's failure to raise it below.        See\nBrigham v. Sun Life of Can., 317 F.3d 72, 85 (1st Cir. 2003).\nMoreover, given Finta's close involvement with and representation\nof Saccoccia during the relevant time periods, as well as his\ndecision not to adduce further evidence to undermine the trial\nrecord at his forfeiture hearing, we discern no plain error.\n     Finally, Finta contends that, without the evidence derived\nfrom the alleged Fifth Amendment violations, there was insufficient\nevidence from which the district court could conclude that he had\nreasonable cause to believe that the legal fees he received\nfollowing Saccoccia’s conviction were tainted. Not only does this\ncontention fail like his second claim, but Finta, not the\ngovernment, bore the burden to adduce sufficient evidence on this\npivotal issue. See 18 U.S.C. § 1963(l)(6)(B).\n\n                                14\n\fappellant Finta to surrender $242,000 in post-conviction legal fees\n\nis hereby affirmed.   SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f",

On the other hand, the very potency of the forfeiture\n\npower demands that it be reasonably contained within ascertainable\n\nlimits.      Thus, for example, Congress provided that a non-defendant\n\nthird party with rights in forfeitable property may redeem its\n\ninterest      by    establishing     either       (i)      that     it    predated       the\n\ndefendant’s crime, see United States v. Lester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719654\"><a href=\"/opinion/719654/united-states-v-richard-j-lester-and-sheila-lester/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1414\n\n(9th   Cir.    1996)     (holding    that       non-defendant       spouse       had    non-\n\nforfeitable pre-existing interest in jointly-held property), or\n\n(ii) that it subsequently acquired a non-forfeitable interest under\n\na bona fide purchase for value, see 18 U.S.C. § 1963(l)(6).\n\n              The implicit limitation in § 1963(m) — the “substitute\n\nassets”      provision    —   that   the    government        may    reach       only   the\n\ndefendant’s substitute assets and not those of a third party – is\n\nsimilar in nature.        Forfeiture is an in personam criminal remedy,\n\ntargeted primarily at the defendant who committed the criminal\n\noffense.       See    Lester,   85    F.3d       at   1414   n.8     (noting      crucial\n\n\n                                           12\n\fdistinction between in personam judgment in criminal forfeiture\n\nproceeding and in rem judgment in civil forfeiture proceeding).\n\n               Finally, the implicit limitation in § 1963(m) does not\n\ntrammel   the     basic    statutory    policy    by    foreclosing        all   other\n\nremedies available to the government, nor does it enable culpable\n\nattorneys to dissipate tainted fees with impunity.                       Rather, the\n\ngovernment may utilize its enforcement powers under subsection\n\n1963(k) to       “trace”    tainted    funds,    see supra        note    6,   thereby\n\ndisproving the contention that appellants’ cash-on-hand is neither\n\nthe tainted fees, nor other property directly or indirectly derived\n\nfrom the tainted fees.           Furthermore, absent such evidence, the\n\ngovernment may reach other non-tainted cash of the attorneys by\n\nsustaining      the   somewhat   weightier,      though     not    insurmountable,\n\nburden    of    establishing     the    elements       of   either       contempt   or\n\nconversion.\n\n               As our construction of the language utilized in the\n\nforfeiture statute is one of first impression, the forfeiture award\n\nagainst Hill and O’Donnell must be vacated and the case must be\n\nremanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.         Upon remand, the government is to be accorded\n\na   reasonable     opportunity    to    determine      whether     it     intends   to\n\ninstitute contempt proceedings or submit conversion claims against\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fappellants.8\n\n          Accordingly,   the   district   court   order   directing\n\nappellants Hill and O'Donnell to surrender their post-conviction\n\nlegal fees is hereby vacated, and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.     The order to compel\n\n\n\n     8\n      Unlike Hill and O'Donnell, Finta failed to raise the\n“substitute assets” issue on appeal. Further, Finta's arguments on\nappeal are meritless.    First, he argues that we lack appellate\njurisdiction because the district court did not reduce its final\njudgment of forfeiture to a separate document, as required by\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 58. Assuming arguendo that Rule 58\nwould apply to a criminal forfeiture proceeding against non-\ndefendants, but see Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c), Finta unquestionably\nwaived the \"separate document\" rule by appealing from the district\ncourt’s July 31, 2001 judgment without objection from the\ngovernment. See Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109822\"><a href=\"/opinion/109822/bankers-trust-co-v-mallis/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385\n(1978) (“If, by error, a separate judgment is not filed before a\nparty appeals, nothing but delay would flow from requiring the\ncourt of appeals to dismiss the appeal.       Upon dismissal, the\ndistrict court would simply file and enter the separate judgment,\nfrom which a timely appeal would then be taken. Wheels would spin\nfor no practical purpose.”); Fiore v. Washington County Cmty.\nHealth Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580698\"><a href=\"/opinion/580698/richard-c-fiore-v-washington-county-community-mental-health-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235 (1st Cir. 1992).\n     Second, Finta contends that the district court decision\nviolated his Fifth Amendment rights to notice and to confront\nwitnesses, by relying upon evidence introduced at the Saccoccia\ncriminal trial in which Finta did not participate. This argument\nhas been forfeited by Finta's failure to raise it below.        See\nBrigham v. Sun Life of Can., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200306\"><a href=\"/opinion/200306/brigham-v-sun-life-of-canada/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (1st Cir. 2003).\nMoreover, given Finta's close involvement with and representation\nof Saccoccia during the relevant time periods, as well as his\ndecision not to adduce further evidence to undermine the trial\nrecord at his forfeiture hearing, we discern no plain error.\n     Finally, Finta contends that, without the evidence derived\nfrom the alleged Fifth Amendment violations, there was insufficient\nevidence from which the district court could conclude that he had\nreasonable cause to believe that the legal fees he received\nfollowing Saccoccia’s conviction were tainted. Not only does this\ncontention fail like his second claim, but Finta, not the\ngovernment, bore the burden to adduce sufficient evidence on this\npivotal issue. See 18 U.S.C. § 1963(l)(6)(B).\n\n                                14\n\fappellant Finta to surrender $242,000 in post-conviction legal fees\n\nis hereby affirmed.
