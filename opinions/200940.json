SHERIDAN,\n\n\n\n                         WILLIAM C. SHERIDAN,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant,\n\n                                  v.\n\n                            NANCY MICHELS,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellee.\n\n\n\n              APPEAL FROM THE BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL\n\n                         OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                      Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     William C. Sheridan, pro se.\n     Nancy H. Michels, with whom the Law Offices of Michels &\nMichels and Carole A. Mansur were on the brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 29, 2004\n\f               LYNCH,    Circuit   Judge   (dissenting).           With    regret,   I\n\ndissent.          The majority decides this case on an argument that\n\nSheridan never raised in the bankruptcy court, in the BAP, or on\n\nappeal, and that Sheridan expressly refused to adopt when this\n\ncourt raised it sua sponte and asked for his view.                    The majority\n\nthen decides that issue the wrong way.              The result is to relegate\n\nSheridan to a new round of litigation in the courts below, more\n\nthan two years after the bankruptcy court suspended him from\n\npractice.      For Sheridan, this is a pyrrhic victory, and one that he\n\nasked us not to give him.19\n\n               The principal opinion by Judge Cyr and the opinion by\n\nJudge Selya concurring in the judgment agree on two points that I\n\nbelieve are not only mistaken but also certain to have consequences\n\nbeyond the narrow realm of attorney discipline in bankruptcy cases:\n\n(1)     that      this   is   an   appropriate      case     for     invoking     the\n\nLaGuardia/Weinstein doctrine to justify this court in addressing an\n\nissue      that    Sheridan   elected   not    to   raise;   and     (2)   that   the\n\ndisciplinary         proceeding    against     Sheridan      was    not     a   \"core\n\nproceeding\" under § 157.             I also dissent from the principal\n\nopinion's conclusion that Sheridan neither consented nor waived his\n\nobjections to entry of a final order in the bankruptcy court.\n\n\n\n      19\n       It is true that, after the court's decision, the order\nsuspending Sheridan will no longer be final.  But the district\ncourt may simply reinstate the remedy chosen by the bankruptcy\ncourt.\n\n                                        -35-\n\f                                      I.\n\n             The   principal   opinion     reaches   the      \"core    proceeding\"\n\nquestion in this case only by holding that while Sheridan perhaps\n\nforfeited the issue, he never consented to the entry of a final\n\njudgment or otherwise waived the requirements of § 157.                     I cannot\n\njoin that conclusion: (i) it requires a restrictive interpretation\n\nof § 157(c) that conflicts with the views of at least five circuits\n\nand   the    leading   commentator   on     bankruptcy     law;       and   (ii)   it\n\nundermines this court's jurisprudence of waiver and consent to say,\n\non this record, that Sheridan ever disputed the finality of the\n\nbankruptcy court's order.\n\nA.    Section 157 and Finality\n\n             A bankruptcy judge's power to enter final orders is not\n\nlimited to core proceedings.         Rather, a bankruptcy court has the\n\nauthority     to   enter   a   dispositive     order     in    any     proceeding,\n\nirrespective of core/non-core status, if the parties consent.                      See\n\n§ 157(c)(2); see also In re S. Indus. Banking Corp., 809 F.2d 329,\n\n331 (6th Cir. 1987) (\"A related proceeding with the consent of all\n\nparties functionally has the same effect as a core proceeding .                     .\n\n. .\").      This court held unequivocally in In re G.S.F. Corp., 938\n\nF.2d 1467 (1st Cir. 1991), that such consent can be implied from a\n\nparty's litigation conduct.        See id. at 1477 (\"[I]mplied consent\n\nwill suffice.\").       We upheld appellate jurisdiction in that case\n\nbecause the parties had, by their conduct before the bankruptcy\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\fcourt, \"acquiesce[d]\" in the treatment of the proceeding as core.\n\nId.   If, by his conduct, Sheridan likewise indicated his knowing\n\nacquiescence in the bankruptcy court's treatment of his case as\n\ncore, then the sanctions order was final, the BAP had appellate\n\njurisdiction, and the core/non-core status of the disciplinary\n\nhearing is irrelevant.20\n\n           The principal opinion seems to interpret In re G.S.F. to\n\nrequire some \"affirmative\" expression of consent before a party\n\nwill be held to have waived the procedures required by § 157(c).\n\nOp. at 8-10.   That decision does not announce such a restrictive\n\nand formalistic rule; it did not require any particular conduct,\n\nbut merely examined the record for \"indication[s] of acquiescence.\"\n\n938 F.2d at 1477.    Further, in concluding that \"implied consent\n\n\n      20\n      In a non-bankruptcy case, this issue would normally be\ncharacterized as \"waiver.\" In bankruptcy cases, the more common\nrubric is that of \"implied consent.\" The difference in terminology\nis not important; notions of waiver and consent are closely\nintertwined in the context of a litigant's asserted right to an\nArticle III tribunal, as the Supreme Court has made clear. See,\ne.g., Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 849\n(1986) (\"[T]he relevance of concepts of waiver to Article III\nchallenges is demonstrated by our decision in Northern Pipeline, in\nwhich the absence of consent to an initial adjudication before a\nnon-Article III tribunal was relied on as a significant factor in\ndetermining that Article III forbade such adjudication.\"). Indeed,\nseveral courts of appeals have used both terms to describe the\ninquiry under § 157(c)(2). See, e.g., In re Johnson, 960 F.2d 396,\n403-04 (4th Cir. 1992); Home Ins. Co. v. Cooper & Cooper, Ltd., 889\nF.2d 746, 749 (7th Cir. 1989); see also In re Nell, 71 B.R. 305,\n310 n.4 (D. Utah 1987). The terms are used interchangeably in this\nopinion, as the substantive standard is the same: because Sheridan\nknew of his right to seek de novo review in the district court and\nchose not to do so, the sanctions order should have been deemed\nfinal and the entire core/non-core problem avoided.\n\n                               -37-\n\fwill suffice\" under § 157(c)(2), this court cited cases like In re\n\nDaniels-Head & Assocs., 819 F.2d 914 (9th Cir. 1987), In re S.\n\nIndus. Banking Corp., supra, and In re Hatfield, 117 B.R. 387\n\n(Bankr. C.D. Ill. 1990), each of which held that the absence of a\n\ntimely objection to the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction is enough\n\nto establish consent.     See 819 F.2d at 919; 809 F.2d at 331; 117\n\nB.R. at 389 n.1.\n\n           The principal opinion contends that such cases must have\n\nbeen wrongly decided in light of the 1987 advisory committee notes\n\nto Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7008, which emphasize \"express\" consent.          See\n\nOp. at 8 n.2.    That argument, however, is undercut by the Supreme\n\nCourt's recent decision in Roell v. Withrow, 123 S. Ct. 1696\n\n(2003), in which the Court held that consent to proceedings before\n\na federal magistrate judge can be implied from a party's litigation\n\nconduct.   Id. at 1703.    In Roell, as in this case, a federal rule\n\ninterpreting    the   underlying    statute   required   advance,   written\n\nconsent from both parties.         Id. at 1701.   As in this case, that\n\nrule was not satisfied.      Nevertheless, the Roell Court held that\n\nunder the terms of the statute itself, implied consent was all that\n\nwas required.   Id. at 1703.   The same logic applies under § 157(c),\n\nwhich requires only \"consent,\" not \"express consent.\"           Moreover,\n\nCongress knew how to require express consent when it wanted that\n\nresult -- it did so in § 157 only a few paragraphs later.           See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 157(e) (\"express consent\" is required from all parties\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\fbefore the bankruptcy court may hold a jury trial).                      In light of\n\nRoell and Congress's calculated choice of words in § 157, the\n\nprincipal     opinion's      restrictive     interpretation         of   the   consent\n\nrequirement in § 157(c) is unjustified.\n\n              Under the view adopted by the principal opinion today, a\n\nparty's   complete      failure    to   object      to    core    treatment     is    not\n\nsufficient to show consent.             That position, if adopted by this\n\ncourt, would place this circuit directly in conflict with the views\n\nof at least five of our sister circuits.                       See In re Tex. Gen.\n\nPetroleum Corp., 52 F.3d 1330, 1337 (5th Cir. 1995) (\"A party who\n\nfails    to   object    to   a   bankruptcy      court's       assumption      of    core\n\njurisdiction consents to that court's entry of final judgment.\");\n\nAbramowitz v. Palmer, 999 F.2d 1274, 1280 (8th Cir. 1993) (finding\n\nimplied consent where \"[n]either party object[ed] to the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's entering a final judgment\"); In re Johnson, 960 F.2d 396,\n\n403-04 (4th Cir. 1992) (finding implied consent because the parties\n\n\"failed to object to the bankruptcy court's determination\" of the\n\nmatters in dispute);         In re Daniels-Head, 819 F.2d at 919 (failure\n\nto raise a timely objection to core treatment constitutes implied\n\nconsent); In re Men's Sportswear, Inc., 834 F.2d 1134, 1137-38 (2d\n\nCir.    1987)   (party's     failure    to     object     to     bankruptcy    court's\n\nexercise of core jurisdiction despite multiple opportunities to\n\nlodge    such   an     objection   \"can      only    be    construed     as    implied\n\n\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fconsent\").21   The leading treatise on bankruptcy law likewise\n\nconcludes that the failure to object to core treatment should be\n\nenough to show consent.   See 1 Collier on Bankruptcy § 3.02[6][b]\n\n(rev. 15th ed. 2003) (\"It is unstated, but probably implied in\n\nsection 157(b)(3), and it has been held, that failure to make\n\ntimely objection to the characterization of the proceeding as a\n\ncore proceeding will be deemed a consent to the jurisdiction of the\n\nbankruptcy court to enter dispositive orders and judgments in like\n\nmanner as section 157(c)(2).\"); id. § 3.03[4] (\"The effect of\n\nfailure to interpose an objection [to core treatment] at the\n\npleading stage should be consent to the final order being entered\n\nby the bankruptcy judge.\").\n\nB.   Waiver in the Bankruptcy Court\n\n          If the principal opinion's restrictive view of consent\n\nunder § 157(c)(2) is wrong, it collapses.    That is because under\n\nthe test adopted by other circuits and (in my view) endorsed by\n\nthis court itself in In re G.S.F., Sheridan waived any right he may\n\nhave had to de novo review in the district court.\n\n          Sheridan utterly failed even to identify the core/non-\n\ncore issue in the bankruptcy court, let alone raise a coherent\n\nobjection to the core status of the proceeding, despite multiple\n\nopportunities to do so. Neither in his responsive pleadings nor in\n\n\n\n     21\n      But see Home Ins. Co., 889 F.2d at 749-50 (express consent\nrequired).\n\n                               -40-\n\fhis various motions to the bankruptcy court did Sheridan -- an\n\nexperienced bankruptcy attorney22 –- argue that the proceedings were\n\nnon-core,   that   the   bankruptcy   court   could   not   enter   a   final\n\njudgment against him, that he was entitled to de novo review of the\n\nfacts and the law in the district court, or anything else that\n\ncould be interpreted as a reference to § 157(c).\n\n            Nor did Sheridan identify this issue at the bench trial.\n\nThe bankruptcy court entered a pretrial scheduling order on January\n\n16, 2001 that required the parties to identify all disputed issues\n\nof law and applicable defenses.          Sheridan, in response, raised\n\nvarious legal objections, not one of which addressed the core/non-\n\ncore status of the proceeding or the bankruptcy court's power to\n\n\n     22\n      The bankruptcy court expressly found that Sheridan \"is an\nexperienced attorney who has practiced [bankruptcy law] for a\nsignificant period of time.\" 2001 WL 1757058, at *24. The court\nfurther found that in light of that extensive experience, Sheridan\n\"was aware\" of the applicable rules and practices in bankruptcy\ncourt. Id.\n     Nevertheless, the principal opinion says that Sheridan's\nextensive experience as a bankruptcy attorney does not support the\ninference that he knowingly acquiesced in core treatment because\n\"these disciplinary proceedings arose, at least in part, from\nSheridan's numerous physical ailments and mental impairments.\" Op.\nat 15 n.7. That is a non-sequitur: whether Sheridan's misconduct\nwas related to his alleged disabilities has nothing to do with\nwhether Sheridan knew, based on his years of practicing bankruptcy\nlaw, that he was obliged to alert the bankruptcy judge if he\nobjected to the treatment of his disciplinary proceeding as core.\nThe principal opinion does not suggest that a disability actually\nprevented Sheridan from objecting to core treatment.\n     In any event, the principal opinion's willingness to attribute\nSheridan's professional misconduct to his disabilities is puzzling,\ngiven that (1) the bankruptcy court made no finding of any\ndisability, and (2) the BAP held that Sheridan utterly failed to\nsupport his claim of disability. See 282 B.R. at 92 & n.15.\n\n                                  -41-\n\fenter a final judgment against him.23         Even during the bench trial,\n\nSheridan made no argument that the court was obliged to enter its\n\nfindings as \"proposed findings of fact\" under § 157(c)(1).                      On\n\nOctober 12, 2001, the bankruptcy court entered a final opinion and\n\norder suspending Sheridan from practice.          Michels v. Sheridan, No.\n\n00-1140-JMD, 2001 WL 1757058 (Bankr. D.N.H. Oct. 12, 2001).\n\n             The principal opinion explains all of this by saying that\n\nSheridan could not have raised the core/non-core issue prior to\n\njudgment because he had no idea that the bankruptcy court intended\n\nto enter a binding sanctions order.          Op. at 13.    That is simply not\n\nso.    Sheridan has never claimed, and could not claim, that he was\n\nunaware     that   the   bankruptcy   court    intended     to     sanction    him\n\ndirectly.      The   bankruptcy   court's     January     16,    2001    pretrial\n\nscheduling order stated that the complaint against Sheridan had\n\nbeen    commenced    under   Administrative     Order     2090-2    of   the   New\n\nHampshire bankruptcy courts.           That order expressly allows the\n\nbankruptcy court to issue binding orders sanctioning and disbarring\n\nattorneys by deeming attorneys who practice before the bankruptcy\n\ncourt to have consented to disciplinary jurisdiction.24                  Sheridan\n\n\n       23\n      Sheridan's reply stated only that the complaint failed to\nallege violations of the applicable rules of ethics and that, in\nthe alternative, his conduct should be excused because of his\ndisabilities.\n       24\n      AO 2090-2 provides, in relevant part, that \"[a]ny attorney\nadmitted or permitted to practice before [the bankruptcy] court\nshall be deemed to have conferred disciplinary jurisdiction upon\nth[e] court for any alleged attorney misconduct arising during the\n\n                                      -42-\n\fwas clearly on notice that the bankruptcy court intended to hold\n\nsuch a proceeding, yet he did not dispute that it was a core\n\nproceeding or that any resulting order would be final.25\n\n            Even in his multiple motions for reconsideration after\n\nthe bench trial, Sheridan failed to raise the core/non-core issue.\n\nIn   his   October   22,   2001   motion,    Sheridan     responded    to    the\n\nbankruptcy   judge's   statement    that     bankruptcy    courts     have   the\n\nsubstantive power to discipline attorneys under the \"inherent\n\npower\" doctrine of Ex parte Burr, 22 U.S. 529 (1824).                        See\n\nSheridan, 2001 WL 1757058, at *1.           Because the principal opinion\n\nrelies heavily on Sheridan's response to conclude that he raised\n\nand pressed the core/non-core argument, I quote it here:\n\n            First, Ex parte Burr, supra (U.S. 1824) concerns\n      broad powers inherent in the exercise of the judicial\n      power    under  Article   III  of   the   United   States\n      Constitution.     However, although the United States\n      Bankruptcy Court is a \"unit of the [Federal] district\n      court,\" it is well established that the powers of\n      Bankruptcy judges are limited to those \"conferred under\"\n      the United States Bankruptcy Code. 28 U.S.C. Section 151.\n            As such the Bankruptcy court does not share all of\n      the powers of the district court.      Thus, in Northern\n      Pipeline Co. vs. Marathon Pipeline Co., 458 U.S. 50\n      (1982) the United States Supreme Court held that it was\n\n\ncourse of a case pending before th[e] court in which that attorney\nhas participated in any way.\"\n      25\n      Sheridan argued in his opening brief that AO 2090-2 was not\npromulgated until February 2001, after the disciplinary complaint\nagainst him was filed. That is not true: the administrative order\nwas adopted in October 2000, and Sheridan is fairly charged with\nknowledge of its contents. An amended version of AO 2090-2 became\neffective in February 2001, but the amendments did not affect any\nportion of the order relevant to Sheridan's case.\n\n                                    -43-\n\f     unconstitutional for the Bankruptcy Courts to exercise\n     the \"essential attributes of judicial power of the\n     Article III district court,\" and that the bankruptcy\n     court's power was limited to \"core proceedings\" of the\n     administration of the bankruptcy estate under the\n     bankruptcy code. 28 U.S.C. section 157(b)(1).\n          It is axiomatic that since the bankruptcy court does\n     not share in the \"essential\" powers of Article III\n     judges, it follows that the bankruptcy court does not\n     share in the \"inherent authority\" derived from the\n     exercise of Article III judicial power.26\n\n\nThis was Sheridan's sole reference to \"core proceedings\" or § 157\n\nin the bankruptcy court.\n\n             As the context makes clear, Sheridan was not objecting in\n\nthese paragraphs to the finality of the bankruptcy court's order\n\nagainst him.       Nor did the bankruptcy court understand him to be\n\nmaking such an argument. Rather, Sheridan was contending only that\n\nbankruptcy courts do not enjoy the \"inherent power\" described in Ex\n\nparte Burr to discipline attorneys.         This is simply an attack on\n\none of the bankruptcy court's asserted sources of disciplinary\n\nauthority.     It is distinct from the contention that the principal\n\nopinion attributes to Sheridan: namely, that the bankruptcy court,\n\nwhile     empowered   to   conduct   disciplinary   proceedings,   was   not\n\npermitted     to   enter    a   final   order   against   Sheridan   under\n\n§ 157(c)(1). Sheridan, an experienced bankruptcy lawyer, knows the\n\ndifference.     Indeed, the principal opinion itself recognizes that\n\nthe question whether a bankruptcy court has the power to discipline\n\n\n     26\n      This passage is quoted exactly from Sheridan's October 22\nmotion; any mistakes or grammatical errors are his.\n\n                                     -44-\n\fattorneys is a question independent of whether it has the power to\n\nenter a final order.27   Yet the principal opinion contends that by\n\nraising the former argument, Sheridan somehow also raised the\n\nlatter.28   This is unfair to bankruptcy judges, who should not be\n\nasked to read tea leaves to discern a litigant's argument.\n\n\n     27\n      For example, the principal opinion concedes that bankruptcy\ncourts have substantive disciplinary authority, but it holds that\nthe exercise of that power in this particular case was not a \"core\nproceeding.\" See Op. at 28-29. Sheridan essentially argued the\nopposite: he challenged the substantive power of bankruptcy courts\nto discipline attorneys, but did not contest that the invocation of\nthat power, if valid, would be a core proceeding.\n     28\n      The principal opinion emphasizes Sheridan's citation to\nNorthern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S.\n50 (1982), which it describes as \"the seminal case regarding the\nconstitutional limitations which undergird the pivotal core/non-\ncore distinction.\" Op. at 16 (emphasis in original). There is no\ndoubt that the \"core proceeding\" concept reflects some of the\nArticle III issues discussed in the plurality opinion in Northern\nPipeline. But it is more than a stretch to say that Sheridan's\nreference to that case amounts to an argument that the proceeding\nbelow was non-core under § 157.      Congress did not create the\ncore/non-core distinction until after Northern Pipeline, so the\ncitation alone hardly suffices to raise the issue.\n     More fundamentally, Northern Pipeline discussed at least five\nways in which the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 unconstitutionally vested\nthe \"essential attributes\" of judicial power in Article I\nbankruptcy judges, only one of which was the fact that bankruptcy\njudges were empowered to issue final orders that were binding and\nenforceable. See 458 U.S. at 85-86. Significantly, another of the\n\"essential attributes\" cited by the Northern Pipeline Court was the\npower of bankruptcy judges to exercise \"all ordinary powers of\ndistrict courts,\" including issuing extraordinary writs and orders.\nId. at 85. This -- and not the core/non-core distinction -- was\nthe proposition for which Sheridan cited Northern Pipeline.\nSheridan has consistently argued that under Northern Pipeline,\nbankruptcy courts lack the \"inherent power\" that district courts\nenjoy to discipline attorneys in the absence of statutory\nauthorization. As noted above, this is logically distinct from the\nargument that bankruptcy courts can discipline attorneys but cannot\nenter final orders.\n\n                                -45-\n\f           All of this, in my view, requires the conclusion that the\n\nbankruptcy court's order was final and appealable.         Sheridan was\n\nplainly aware of the core/non-core distinction.       He simply elected\n\nnot to assert the issue, perhaps for strategic reasons. Perhaps he\n\ngambled that the bankruptcy judge's factual findings would be\n\nfavorable to him, hoping to benefit from a more favorable standard\n\nof review on appeal.    Perhaps he preferred to retain the option of\n\nappealing to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, as he ultimately did.\n\nWhatever his reasons, Sheridan abandoned any right he may have had\n\nto de novo review in the district court by choosing not to object\n\nto core treatment.     See In re G.S.F., 938 F.2d at 1477; accord In\n\nre Tex. Gen. Petroleum Corp., 52 F.3d at 1337; Abramowitz, 999 F.2d\n\nat 1280; In re Johnson, 960 F.2d at 403-04; In re Daniels-Head, 819\n\nF.2d at 919; In re Men's Sportswear, 834 F.2d at 1137-38.              By\n\nrefusing to infer consent from Sheridan's conduct, the majority\n\nsimply encourages future bankruptcy litigants to game the system by\n\nwaiting   until   an   adverse   judgment   before   objecting   to   core\n\ntreatment.   \"Inferring consent in these circumstances . . . checks\n\nthe risk of gamesmanship by depriving parties of the luxury of\n\nwaiting for the outcome before denying the [bankruptcy judge's]\n\nauthority. Judicial efficiency is served; the Article III right is\n\nsubstantially honored.\"     Roell, 123 S. Ct. at 1703.\n\nC.   Waiver on Appeal\n\n           Sheridan's conduct on appeal, both in the BAP and before\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\fthis court, provides further assurance that he consented to core\n\ntreatment.    First, Sheridan elected to bring his appeal in the\n\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel rather than in the district court,\n\ndespite the fact that the BAP has no authority to review proposed\n\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law under § 157(c)(1).                The\n\nprincipal opinion dismisses this point, stating that Sheridan's\n\nappeal was proper because the bankruptcy judge ostensibly entered\n\na final order.       Op. at 16 n.8.       That is true, but it does not\n\nnegate the inference of consent: although Sheridan had an absolute\n\nstatutory    right   to   bring   his    appeal   in   the   district   court\n\nirrespective of the core/non-core issue, see 28 U.S.C. § 158(c)(1),\n\nand although the BAP notified Sheridan of that right in writing,\n\nSheridan nevertheless pursued his appeal in the BAP.             If, as the\n\nprincipal opinion contends, Sheridan had believed he was entitled\n\nto de novo review in the district court, the obvious choice would\n\nhave been to invoke his right to appeal to the district court and\n\nthen to demand de novo review.          His decision to appeal to the BAP\n\ninstead is strong evidence of his consent to core treatment.             Cf.\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 849-50\n\n(1986) (plaintiff's election to forgo review in federal court and\n\nseek relief instead in an Article I proceeding \"constituted an\n\neffective waiver\" of Article III objections because the party had\n\nthe option of Article III adjudication but \"chose to avail himself\n\nof the quicker and less expensive procedure Congress had provided\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\fhim\").\n\n             Sheridan never argued to the BAP that the proceeding in\n\nthe bankruptcy court was non-core. He merely repeated his argument\n\nabout \"inherent power\" under Ex parte Burr.       The BAP opinion makes\n\nclear that the finality of the bankruptcy court's order was never\n\nin dispute.     See, e.g., In re Disciplinary Proceedings, 282 B.R.\n\n79, 85 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2002) (referring to \"final bankruptcy court\n\norders\" and indicating that the bankruptcy court's factual findings\n\nwould be reviewed for clear error).\n\n             The final and most telling indication of Sheridan's\n\nconsent to core treatment came before this court.          Invited by the\n\ncourt to file a supplemental brief on the core/non-core question,\n\nSheridan expressly declined to argue that the disciplinary hearing\n\nwas non-core.     His supplemental brief acknowledged the core/non-\n\ncore issue and even cited § 157(c)(1), the provision barring\n\nbankruptcy     judges   from   entering   final   orders    in   non-core\n\nproceedings absent the consent of the parties.             Nevertheless,\n\nSheridan refused to assert that the disciplinary proceeding was\n\nnon-core –- he stated simply that he \"takes no position\" on whether\n\nthe bankruptcy court order was final, and he urged this court to\n\nprovide prompt and clear guidance on the merits of his appeal\n\nbecause his case had already been pending too long.29\n\n\n     29\n      The principal opinion emphasizes that before Sheridan stated\nhe \"takes no position\" on the core/non-core issue, he successfully\nbriefed the argument that the proceeding below was non-core. Op.\n\n                                  -48-\n\f                                  II.\n\n          The second reason I cannot join the judgment is the\n\nmajority's extension of the LaGuardia/Weinstein exception to our\n\nrules of waiver and forfeiture.     See Op. at 17-19.   The LaGuardia\n\nexception is inapplicable on these facts, and by invoking it here,\n\nthe majority approves a novel and extremely unwise expansion of\n\nthat doctrine.\n\n          Under LaGuardia and its progeny, the court of appeals may\n\nreview de novo an argument that is raised for the first time on\n\nappeal only if:   (1) the argument involves a purely legal question\n\nof constitutional import that can be resolved with certitude on the\n\nexisting record; (2) addressing the argument will promote judicial\n\neconomy because the same issue will arise in nearly identical terms\n\nin other cases; and (3) the argument, if meritorious, would almost\n\ncertainly entitle the appellant to prevail, so that failing to\n\naddress it would result in a miscarriage of justice.      See United\n\nStates v. LaGuardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir. 1990); see also\n\nCastillo v. Matesanz, 348 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2003); In re\n\nWeinstein, 164 F.3d 677, 685 (1st Cir. 1999); Sammartano v. Palmas\n\ndel Mar Props., Inc., 161 F.3d 96, 98-99 (1st Cir. 1998).      Until\n\n\n\nat 16 n.8. Of course he did –- the whole point of the supplemental\nbriefing was to address that argument, and Sheridan duly traced its\ncontours. Yet despite demonstrating that he knew how to make the\nargument if he were so inclined, Sheridan expressly stated that he\n\"takes no position\" on the matter.          The principal opinion\nattributes the argument to him anyway.\n\n                                -49-\n\ftoday, LaGuardia provided a narrow exception to the raise-or-waive\n\nrule, which this court ordinarily applies \"with a near-religious\n\nfervor.\"   Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 627\n\n(1st Cir. 1995). Cases qualifying for the exception, we have said,\n\nare \"few and far between.\"   Id.\n\n           The majority's resort to LaGuardia on facts like these is\n\nunprecedented in multiple respects.    First, this court has never\n\ninvoked the LaGuardia exception when the party on whose behalf the\n\ncourt would intervene has not actually raised the issue on appeal.\n\nHere, not only did Sheridan fail to raise the core/non-core issue\n\non appeal, but he also explicitly declined to advocate the position\n\nwhen asked.\n\n           In addition, the usual predicate conditions for invoking\n\nLaGuardia are absent here.   The core/non-core distinction is not a\n\nmatter of constitutional law or import, no more than any other\n\nquestion of statutory interpretation under the Bankruptcy Code.30\n\n\n     30\n      The principal opinion insists that the core/non-core question\nis a question of \"constitutional import,\" presumably because\nCongress created the core/non-core distinction in response to a\nSupreme Court case predicated on Article III. Op. at 19 & n.10.\nThat argument is misplaced for two reasons. First, the fact that\na statutory scheme reflects considerations of constitutional law\ndoes not elevate the statute itself to constitutional stature. We\ndo not say, for example, that service of process under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 4 is a question of constitutional dimensions, even though that\nRule was plainly written to comport with constitutional due process\nconcerns.    Indeed, if the core/non-core issue is a matter of\nconstitutional law, so too is the rest of the Bankruptcy Code\ninsofar as it reflects Congress's judgment about how best to\nimplement its powers under the Bankruptcy Clause, U.S. Const. Art.\nI, § 8, cl. 4.\n\n                                -50-\n\fNor is the core/non-core determination \"strictly a question of\n\nlaw.\"    LaGuardia, 902 F.2d at 1013.        The principal opinion itself\n\nrecognizes that the core/non-core question in this case is not a\n\npurely   legal   one   --   the   court    does   not   hold   that   attorney\n\ndisciplinary proceedings are always non-core, but rather that the\n\nproceeding was non-core \"[i]n the particular circumstances of the\n\ninstant case.\"     Op. at 5.       And the core/non-core status of an\n\nomnibus attorney disciplinary proceeding initiated by a bankruptcy\n\ncourt is hardly a question that is \"almost certain to be presented\n\nin identical terms in other cases.\"          LaGuardia, 902 F.2d at 1013.\n\n            Similarly, the merits of the core/non-core issue in this\n\ncase are neither \"highly persuasive,\" Harwood, 69 F.3d at 628, nor\n\n\"so compelling as virtually to insure [the appellant's] success,\"\n\n\n\n     Second, the core/non-core distinction is nothing like the\nproblems of constitutional law or import that have previously\nserved as a predicate for this court's resort to LaGuardia. See,\ne.g., Castillo v. Matesanz, 348 F.3d 1, 11-16 (1st Cir. 2003)\n(ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment); In\nre Weinstein, 164 F.3d 677, 684-85 (1st Cir. 1999) (takings claim\nunder the Fifth Amendment); Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood,\n69 F.3d 622, 629 (1st Cir. 1995) (immunity of state legislature\nfrom First Amendment claim under federal common law, by analogy to\nthe Speech and Debate Clause); United States v. Mercedes-Amparo,\n980 F.3d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1992) (due process concerns in\nprosecutorial breach of plea bargain agreement). In the few cases\nin which this court has invoked LaGuardia in the absence of a claim\nbased directly in constitutional law, we have done so to vindicate\na strong governmental interest of a kind not present here. See,\ne.g., Chestnut v. City of Lowell, 305 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 2002)\n(per curiam) (en banc) (relieving a city of punitive damages award\nunder City of Newport); In re 604 Columbus Ave Realty Trust, 968\nF.3d 1332, 1343-44 (1st Cir. 1992) (permitting the FDIC to raise\nspecial governmental defenses based on federal common law).\n\n                                    -51-\n\fSammartano, 161 F.3d at 98-99; United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27,\n\n31 (1st Cir. 1992).          Sheridan has not advanced the core/non-core\n\nargument at all, let alone advanced it in a \"highly persuasive\"\n\nmanner,     and    the     principal     opinion's    reasoning     is    not     \"so\n\ncompelling\" that the outcome is essentially predetermined.                        See\n\nCorrea v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1196 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(declining to invoke LaGuardia where the forfeited argument merely\n\nadvanced one of two possible constructions of a statute).\n\n             Lastly, this case does not meet the final criterion for\n\ninvoking LaGuardia: that if the issue were meritorious, failing to\n\nreach it would constitute a \"miscarriage of justice.\"                   902 F.2d at\n\n1013.     It could hardly be a miscarriage of justice to reach the\n\nmerits of Sheridan's appeal given that both parties have urged us\n\nto do so.    If there is any miscarriage of justice in this case, it\n\nis the disservice done to both sides in remanding this case for\n\nanother round of litigation below.\n\n             If LaGuardia can apply here, it can apply in any case in\n\nwhich an appellate judge wishes to raise and decide an issue sua\n\nsponte,    no     matter   how   compelling     the   evidence     of    waiver    or\n\nforfeiture      and   regardless    of    whether     a   party   advocates     that\n\nposition.       I will not be surprised if this aspect of the court's\n\ndecision today is regretted by this court and the bar for years to\n\ncome.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\f                                     III.\n\n           Finally, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that\n\nthe proceeding against Sheridan was non-core. In my view, the only\n\ninterpretation of § 157 that is consistent with the purposes of the\n\nfederal   bankruptcy    laws   and     Congress's   intent   in    the   1984\n\nbankruptcy amendments is that the disciplinary proceeding against\n\nSheridan, which arose out of misconduct occurring in indisputably\n\ncore proceedings, constituted a core proceeding.\n\nA.   Interpretation of 28 U.S.C. § 157\n\n     1.   Plain text of § 157\n\n          Whether the disciplinary proceeding against Sheridan was\n\na \"core proceeding\" under 28 U.S.C. § 157 is a matter of statutory\n\nconstruction.    The plain text of § 157 makes no explicit reference\n\nto attorney discipline, sanctions, contempt, or anything similar,\n\njust as it fails to describe other proceedings that courts have\n\nrecognized as core.31    Nor is the statutory term \"core proceeding\"\n\nself-defining.\n\n           Nevertheless, the principal opinion purports to find\n\nsupport in the text of § 157.        It discusses the various categories\n\nof core proceedings in § 157(b)(2), emphasizing that \"each of the\n\nenumerated   matters    relates   to    a   function   essential    to   the\n\n\n\n     31\n      See generally 1 Collier on Bankruptcy § 3.02[3] (rev. 15th\ned. 2003) (listing examples of proceedings recognized as \"core\"\neven though they do not fall within the express terms of § 157(b)).\n\n\n                                     -53-\n\fadministration of the bankruptcy case.\" Op. at 21. The proceeding\n\nagainst Sheridan, the principal opinion contends, was different:\n\nit did not arise in any single bankruptcy case, so there was no\n\nrelevant \"case\" to administer. Accordingly, it must have been non-\n\ncore.     This is an expressio unius rationale: Congress provided a\n\nlist of core proceeding categories in § 157(b); that list does not\n\ninclude     omnibus    attorney       disciplinary         hearings       or    similar\n\nproceedings spanning multiple bankruptcy cases; therefore Congress\n\nmeant to exclude such proceedings from \"core\" treatment.\n\n            This is flawed logic.             As the Supreme Court reiterated\n\nlast    Term,   the   expressio       unius      canon   applies     only      when   the\n\nstatutory list in question \"justif[ies] the inference that items\n\nnot mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice.\"                        Barnhart v.\n\nPeabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003).                 No such inference is\n\npossible    here.      It     is   true    that    Congress,    in    drafting        the\n\ncategories of core proceedings in § 157(b)(2), referred to \"the\n\nestate\" (i.e., in the singular), but that choice of words merely\n\nreflects    the     reality    that    the       vast    majority    of     bankruptcy\n\nproceedings pertain to a single debtor.                   Nothing in the statute\n\nsays a proceeding is non-core if it involves more than one estate,\n\nand Congress knew how to exclude matters from § 157(b) when it\n\nwished to do so.        See, e.g., § 157(b)(2)(O) (excluding personal\n\ninjury and      wrongful    death     claims      from   core   treatment).           The\n\nclincher is that Congress specifically provided that the list of\n\n\n                                          -54-\n\fexamples    in    §   157(b)(2)    is    not    exhaustive.    See     28    U.S.C.\n\n§ 157(b)(2) (core proceedings \"are not limited to\" the listed\n\ncategories); see also 1 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, § 3.02[3]\n\n(\"It should be emphasized at the outset that section 157(b)(2) is\n\nnot limiting . . . .\").\n\n            This brings us back to where we started.            The underlying\n\nquestion    on    the   merits    of    the    core/non-core   issue    is       this:\n\nwhether, in light of the structure and purpose of the core/non-core\n\ndistinction and the Bankruptcy Code as a whole, § 157(b)(2) should\n\nbe interpreted to embrace disciplinary proceedings like Sheridan's.\n\nSee In re Hart, 328 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).                 The principal\n\nopinion undertakes no such analysis.\n\n     2.    Background to the 1984 Bankruptcy Amendments\n\n            In fact, there is every reason to believe that Congress\n\nwanted and expected bankruptcy judges to enforce the professional\n\nresponsibilities of bankruptcy attorneys through final and binding\n\norders    where   the   misconduct       in    question   occurred     in    a    core\n\nbankruptcy proceeding or proceedings.32               In 1984, when Congress\n\n\n     32\n      Long before Northern Pipeline and Congress's 1984 enactment\nof § 157, the Supreme Court recognized that a court's power to\nregulate the conduct of the bar, including the power to suspend and\ndisbar attorneys, is essential to the administration of justice and\nthe protection of the public. See, e.g., Roadway Express, Inc. v.\nPiper, 447 U.S. 752, 764-67 (1980); Theard v. United States, 354\nU.S. 278, 281 (1957); Ex parte Bradley, 74 U.S. 364, 374 (1868); Ex\nparte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 378-79 (1867); Ex parte Burr,\n22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 529, 531 (1824); see also In re Snyder, 472 U.S.\n634, 643-45 (1985) (\"Courts have long recognized an inherent\nauthority to suspend or disbar lawyers.\").\n\n                                        -55-\n\famended   the       Bankruptcy     Code    to    create      the   core/non-core\n\ndistinction, the case law available to Congress provided no reason\n\nto think that bankruptcy courts' status as Article I tribunals\n\nwould bar them from entering final disciplinary orders.                   In 1926,\n\nthe Supreme Court itself held in Goldsmith v. U.S. Bd. of Tax\n\nAppeals, 270 U.S. 117 (1926), that the U.S. Board of Tax Appeals,\n\nan   Article    I   tribunal,     possessed     the   authority    not    only   to\n\npromulgate ethical rules for admitting attorneys to practice, but\n\nalso to disbar attorneys who failed to meet those standards.                     See\n\nid. at 121-22 (emphasizing, in holding that the Board possessed\n\nthis power, \"the character of the work to be done by the board, the\n\nquasi judicial nature of its duties, [and] the magnitude of the\n\ninterests to be affected by its decisions\").              The Court explicitly\n\nrejected the contention that such a tribunal cannot disbar or\n\ndiscipline lawyers absent express statutory authority, observing\n\nthat the power of the Board to do so is \"so necessary . . . and so\n\nusual\" that the statute creating it would be interpreted to include\n\nthat power.     Id. at 122.\n\n           Furthermore, Congress knew that federal courts before\n\n1984 had upheld the power of other Article I tribunals to issue\n\nbinding disciplinary orders against counsel appearing before them.\n\nSee, e.g., Kivitz v. SEC, 475 F.2d 956, 962 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (power\n\nof SEC to disbar attorney for ethical misconduct);                       Herman v.\n\nDulles,   205       F.2d   715,   715-16      (D.C.   Cir.     1953)     (similar,\n\n\n                                      -56-\n\fInternational Claims Commission); Francis v. Virgin Islands, 11\n\nF.2d 860, 864 (3d Cir. 1926) (upholding the contempt powers of the\n\nU.S. District Court for the Virgin Islands); Fleming v. United\n\nStates, 279 F. 613, 616 (9th Cir. 1922) (similar, United States\n\nCourt for China).      Consistent with this line of cases, some courts\n\nhad by 1984 already upheld the authority of bankruptcy courts to\n\ndiscipline attorneys for unethical conduct in bankruptcy cases. As\n\nearly as     1979,    for   example,    the     Second     Circuit   described    as\n\n\"nothing novel\" the proposition that a debtor's counsel could be\n\nsanctioned    for    breaching    his    ethical      responsibilities     to    the\n\nbankruptcy court.       See In re Arlan's Dep't Stores, Inc., 615 F.2d\n\n925, 943-44 (2d Cir. 1979).\n\n            Congress enacted the 1984 bankruptcy amendments against\n\nthis background.        Nothing in the 1984 Act or its legislative\n\nhistory suggests that Congress intended to deny bankruptcy judges\n\nthe authority to regulate the bankruptcy bar.                     On the contrary,\n\nthis court has held that Congress's purpose in the 1984 amendments\n\nwas to press the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts \"to its\n\nconstitutional bounds\" in the wake of Northern Pipeline. See In re\n\nArnold Print Works, Inc., 815 F.2d 165, 168 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(Breyer, J.).       The congressional sponsors of the 1984 amendments\n\ndescribed non-core proceedings as \"Marathon-type\" cases, referring\n\nto   the   Northern    Pipeline   decision,          and   they   understood    that\n\ncategory to be \"very limited.\"                 Id.     Accordingly, this court\n\n\n                                        -57-\n\fconcluded that \"Congress intended that 'core proceedings' would be\n\ninterpreted broadly, close to or congruent with constitutional\n\nlimits.\"    Id.\n\n     3.    Article III and attorney discipline\n\n            Congress had no reason to think that Article III is\n\noffended when a bankruptcy court enters a binding order against a\n\nbankruptcy    attorney   for   professional    misconduct   in    a     core\n\nbankruptcy proceeding.     Even the principal opinion does not so\n\ncontend.    Indeed, less than a year after its decision in Northern\n\nPipeline, the Supreme Court emphasized the limits of its holding:\n\n\"The Court's holding in that case establishes only that Congress\n\nmay not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate,\n\nrender final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional\n\ncontract action arising under state law, without consent of the\n\nlitigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review.\"            Thomas\n\nv. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 584 (1985)\n\n(emphasis added).33\n\n            The   proceeding   at    issue    in   Sheridan's    case     is\n\nfundamentally different from a traditional common-law cause of\n\n\n\n     33\n      The Supreme Court endorsed this narrow reading of Northern\nPipeline again the following year, repeatedly citing that case for\nthe proposition that Congress's power to assign matters to non-\nArticle III tribunals is constrained \"where private, common law\nrights are at stake.\" Schor, 478 U.S. at 854; see also id. (noting\nthat \"private, common law rights were historically the types of\nmatters subject to resolution by Article III courts,\" citing\nNorthern Pipeline).\n\n                                    -58-\n\faction.    The privilege to practice law, including the privilege to\n\npractice before a federal tribunal, is a matter of public license.\n\nSee In re Snyder, 472 U.S. 634, 644 (1985).                   It is well-settled\n\nthat courts     have    the   authority      to     revoke   that    license   where\n\nnecessary to protect the public.             See id.; In re Ruffalo, 390 U.S.\n\n544, 550 (1968); Theard v. United States, 354 U.S. 278, 281 (1957);\n\nEx   parte   Wall,     107    U.S.    265,       288-89   (1882).      Further,    a\n\ndisciplinary proceeding is a matter between the court and the\n\nattorney only; no right to a jury trial attaches.                     See Ex parte\n\nWall, 107 U.S. at 288.        It is akin to the enforcement of a \"public\n\nright,\" and as then-Judge Breyer noted for this court in Arnold\n\nPrint Works, the Supreme Court in Northern Pipeline found nothing\n\nunconstitutional in a bankruptcy judge issuing dispositive orders\n\nin such cases.    See 815 F.2d at 170.\n\n      4.   Purposes of the Bankruptcy Code\n\n             Nor is there any reason to infer from the overarching\n\npurposes of the Bankruptcy Code that Congress wanted to limit\n\nbankruptcy    judges'    power       to    issue    final    and    binding    orders\n\ndisbarring, suspending, or otherwise disciplining attorneys who act\n\nunethically in core proceedings.                 On the contrary, the need to\n\nmaintain attorney discipline and enforce the rules of professional\n\nresponsibility is, if anything, stronger in the bankruptcy context,\n\nwhere considerations of speed and cost-effectiveness are paramount:\n\n     A sine qua non in restructuring the debtor-creditor\n     relationship is the court's ability to police the\n\n                                          -59-\n\f     fiduciaries . . . who are responsible for managing the\n     debtor's estate in the best interest of creditors. The\n     bankruptcy court must be able to assure itself and the\n     creditors who rely on the process that court-approved\n     managers of the debtor's estate are performing their\n     work, conscientiously and cost-effectively.\n\n\nIn re Southmark Corp., 163 F.3d 925, 931 (5th Cir. 1999) (holding\n\nthat a professional malpractice claim by a Chapter 11 debtor\n\nagainst   a   court-appointed   accountant      was    a   core   proceeding).\n\nBankruptcy    courts   are   charged     with    the       rehabilitation   of\n\nfinancially     distressed   debtors     and     the       reorganization   or\n\nliquidation of their assets, often under the press of time because\n\nof the threat of financial loss.       In re McLean Indus., 68 B.R. 690,\n\n695 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1986); see also United States v. Mourad, 289\n\nF.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir. 2002) (observing that the power to regulate\n\nattorney behavior is necessary \"if the bankruptcy courts are to\n\ncarry out efficiently and effectively the duties assigned to them\n\nby Congress\" (quoting In re Volpert, 110 F.3d 494, 500 (7th Cir.\n\n1997))). Involving the district court in such disciplinary matters\n\nwould \"unduly burden the already complex and congested calendars of\n\nthe district courts, and undermine the reasons for the district\n\ncourt's reference of Code cases to the bankruptcy courts.\"               In re\n\nMcLean Indus., 68 B.R. at 696; see also In re Mem'l Estates, Inc.,\n\n116 B.R. 108, 112 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (imposition of sanctions must be\n\na core proceeding because \"any other interpretation would seriously\n\nhamper the bankruptcy court in its administration of the estate and\n\n\n                                  -60-\n\fwould provide additional methods of multiplying litigation for\n\nthose seeking to hinder and delay the proceedings in the bankruptcy\n\ncourt\").\n\n             Congress, moreover, must have been aware that problems of\n\nattorney     discipline     are    particularly      acute   in    the    consumer\n\nbankruptcy area, see In re Bruzzese, 214 B.R. 444, 450-51 (Bankr.\n\nE.D.N.Y. 1997),      such    as    the    Chapter   13   proceedings      in   which\n\nSheridan specialized.       Consumer debtors, like those whom Sheridan\n\nrepresented, rarely have the resources or sophistication to bring\n\ntort claims for legal malpractice.              Indeed, because of the high\n\nvolume of consumer bankruptcy filings and the speed at which\n\nbankruptcy    courts   must       process    such   petitions,     many    consumer\n\ndebtors    \"never    discover      that     their   attorneys     have    committed\n\nmalpractice.\"       Id. at 450.       Direct discipline by the bankruptcy\n\ncourt may be the only feasible means in many cases of protecting\n\ndebtors and ensuring the ethical conduct of the consumer bankruptcy\n\nbar in core proceedings. For this reason, \"[b]ankruptcy judges are\n\nexpected by Congress, the public, the appointing courts of appeals,\n\nand the leadership of the bar to maintain high standards of\n\nperformance by all lawyers appearing before them. This is 'part of\n\nthe job description.'\"        Id. at 450-51.\n\n     5.    \"Core comes from core\"\n\n             I do not contend that Congress intended all attorney\n\ndisciplinary proceedings in the bankruptcy courts to be core\n\n\n                                         -61-\n\fproceedings, regardless of how they arise. There are situations in\n\nwhich the justifications for permitting bankruptcy judges to issue\n\nbinding disciplinary orders are less compelling –- for example,\n\nwhen an attorney acts unethically in a non-core proceeding in which\n\nthe parties have refused to consent to the entry of a final order\n\non the merits.    In such cases, the bankruptcy court must recommend\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court in\n\nany event; there is little reason to treat the disciplinary issues\n\nalone as within the bankruptcy court's core powers.\n\n           As to unethical conduct in core proceedings, however,\n\nCongress's purposes in the Bankruptcy Code are much better served\n\nby a rule that permits bankruptcy judges to issue final and binding\n\ndisciplinary orders directly, without resort to the district court\n\nbut with normal rights to appeal.        In fact, there is a widely\n\naccepted rule in attorney discipline cases that \"core comes from\n\ncore\" --   that   is,   disciplinary   hearings   arising   out   of   core\n\nproceedings are themselves core proceedings.        See, e.g., Memorial\n\nEstates, 950 F.2d at 1370; In re O'Connor, 2001 WL 1335883, at *1\n\n(N.D. Tex. 2001); In re French Bourekas, Inc., 183 B.R. 695, 696\n\n(Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1995) (\"[T]he power to sanction parties for\n\nconduct in a core matter is itself core.\"), aff'd, 195 B.R. 19\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 1996); In re VIII S. Mich. Assocs., No. 94C 5593, 1994 WL\n\n698489, at *5 (N.D. Ill. 1994); Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v.\n\nSutherlin, 109 B.R. 700, 703 (E.D. La. 1989); In re Usoskin, 61\n\n\n                                 -62-\n\fB.R. 869, 872 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1986); In re Emergency Beacon Corp.,\n\n52 B.R. 979, 987 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1985), aff'd, 790 F.2d 285 (2d\n\nCir. 1986); see also In re Monarch Capital Corp., 173 B.R. 31, 35-\n\n39 (D. Mass. 1994) (contempt proceeding against debtor's attorneys\n\nwas core because the contempt occurred in a core proceeding).\n\n            The \"core comes from core\" rule also makes practical\n\nsense.    One chief functional difference between a core proceeding\n\nand   a   non-core   proceeding    is   the    deference     accorded   to   the\n\nbankruptcy court's findings of fact.            Compare Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n\n8013 (review of core proceedings), with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9033(d)\n\n(review    of   non-core   proceedings);      see    generally   In   re   Delta\n\nPetroleum (P.R.), Ltd., 193 B.R. 99, 106 (D.P.R. 1996).               In a core\n\nproceeding, the bankruptcy judge is empowered to make factual\n\nfindings on the merits and to have those findings reviewed only for\n\nclear error. No useful purpose is served by denying the bankruptcy\n\ncourt the power to make equally authoritative findings of fact\n\nabout the conduct of the very attorneys who appear before it.                \"If\n\nthe bankruptcy courts are to administer 'the restructuring of\n\ndebtor-creditor relations, which is at the core of the federal\n\nbankruptcy power,' they must also have the power to sanction\n\nparties that interfere with such administration.\"             In re Emergency\n\nBeacon Corp., 52 B.R. at 987.\n\n            Under    the   \"core   comes      from   core\"    principle,     the\n\nproceeding against Sheridan was plainly a core proceeding.                   The\n\n\n                                    -63-\n\foverwhelming majority of the ethical violations of which Sheridan\n\nwas accused occurred in core proceedings.           The bankruptcy court\n\nfound that Sheridan committed at least 83 ethical violations over\n\n33 separate bankruptcy cases.34     It is clear from the record that\n\nat least 80 of those 83 violations, accounting for fully 31 of the\n\n33 cases, occurred in core proceedings (specifically, proceedings\n\nto propose, file, modify, and confirm Chapter 13 plans).35 Further,\n\nthere has been no showing that the remaining three instances of\n\nmisconduct occurred in non-core proceedings; rather, it is simply\n\nimpossible to tell from the record whether those proceedings were\n\nalso core.   As a result, the only impediment to applying the \"core\n\ncomes from core\" rule in this case is a set of 3 ethical violations\n\nin   proceedings   whose   core/non-core   status    is   unknown.   Even\n\nassuming that those violations (which accounted for less than\n\n1/20th of the charges against Sheridan) occurred in non-core\n\nproceedings, there is no reason to think that they materially\n\n\n\n      34\n      In addition, the court determined that Sheridan committed\nfive violations in the disciplinary proceeding itself, bringing the\ntotal to 88 violations in 34 cases.\n      35\n      The vast majority of Sheridan's infractions involved failing\nto file certificates of service for his clients' Chapter 13 plans\n(17 times in 16 cases); failing to file documents or motions\nrelated to his clients' Chapter 13 petitions in a timely manner (39\ntimes in 28 cases); and failing to appear or appearing late at\ncourt hearings (8 occasions) and § 341 meetings (3 occasions)\nrelated to Chapter 13 petitions.          Matters concerning the\nconfirmation of a debtor's plan for reorganization, including\nChapter 13 plans, are core proceedings.            See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 157(b)(2)(L).\n\n                                  -64-\n\faffected the bankruptcy court's choice of sanction.      Cf. Sheridan,\n\n2001 WL 1757058, at *23 (declaring that the evidence at trial\n\n\"clearly    establishes\"   that   Sheridan   is   not   professionally\n\ncompetent).\n\n     6.    Summary\n\n           The court's constrained reading of § 157 contradicts\n\nCongress's intent in the 1984 amendments, which was not to shrink\n\nthe powers of the bankruptcy courts but to extend them to their\n\njurisdictional limits in the wake of Northern Pipeline.      In light\n\nof the open-ended statutory text of § 157; the clear congressional\n\nintent that courts should interpret the term \"core proceeding\"\n\nbroadly; the binding precedent in our own circuit commanding that\n\nwe do so; the absence of relevant constitutional constraints; the\n\nlegitimate functional need for bankruptcy courts to have \"core\"\n\njurisdiction over attorney misconduct arising in core proceedings;\n\nand the broadly accepted rule that \"core comes from core,\" I think\n\nwe would be obliged to hold, were the issue properly presented,\n\nthat the disciplinary proceeding against Sheridan was a \"core\n\nproceeding\" under § 157.\n\nB.   The Principal Opinion's Four Distinguishing Factors\n\n           The principal opinion reserves the question of whether\n\nattorney disciplinary proceedings may ever enjoy core status,\n\nholding instead that Sheridan's case is distinguishable on four\n\ngrounds:   (1) the disciplinary proceeding against Sheridan did not\n\n\n                                  -65-\n\ftake place in the context of an ongoing bankruptcy case, but rather\n\nwas an \"omnibus\" proceeding spanning multiple cases; (2) the rule\n\nof decision in Sheridan's disciplinary proceeding came from state-\n\nlaw ethics rules, rather than federal law; (3) any potential effect\n\non a closed bankruptcy case is remote and speculative; and (4) the\n\nbankruptcy court's disciplinary order was \"extreme\" relative to\n\nSheridan's misconduct.     See Op. at 31-32.      Not one of these grounds\n\nis valid basis for distinguishing this case.\n\n     1.   Omnibus vs. individual disciplinary proceedings\n\n           The principal opinion first argues that Sheridan's case\n\nmerits different treatment because it was an \"omnibus\" disciplinary\n\ninvestigation -- that is, because the bankruptcy court consolidated\n\nthe ethical issues arising in multiple, independent bankruptcy\n\ncases into a single disciplinary hearing.\n\n           This objection is without merit.              Nothing in § 157\n\nrestricts core proceedings to proceedings that concern a single\n\nbankruptcy case, and the principal opinion cites no authority for\n\nits suggestion that § 157(b) should be interpreted so narrowly.\n\nCompare   Arnold   Print   Works,   815    F.2d   at   168.   There   is   no\n\nfunctional reason to discourage bankruptcy courts from combining\n\ndisciplinary issues spanning multiple bankruptcy cases into a\n\nsingle proceeding for expeditious administration.             Normally this\n\ncourt encourages and respects the efforts of lower courts to manage\n\ntheir dockets efficiently.      In re Atlantic Pipe Corp., 304 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -66-\n\f135, 143-45 (1st Cir. 2002); A.M. Capen's Co., Inc. v. Am. Trading\n\n& Prod. Corp., 202 F.3d 469, 472 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000); Rosario-Diaz\n\nv. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998). Moreover, attorney\n\ndiscipline in the federal courts outside of the bankruptcy context\n\nis frequently imposed in \"omnibus\" proceedings.       See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Johnson, 327 F.3d 554, 558, 561-62 (7th Cir. 2003); In re\n\nSmith, 76 F.3d 335, 336 (10th Cir. 1996) (per curiam).           Surely\n\nCongress would not have wanted the bankruptcy judge to hold 30\n\nseparate disciplinary hearings before entering a binding sanctions\n\norder against Sheridan.\n\n           The   case   law   confirms   that   \"omnibus\"   disciplinary\n\nhearings in the bankruptcy courts are generally treated as core\n\nproceedings.     For example, the Fifth Circuit in 1999 affirmed a\n\nfour-year suspension imposed by a bankruptcy court in a proceeding\n\nthat involved evidence of misconduct in three separate bankruptcy\n\ncases.    See In re Dragoo, 219 B.R. 460, 465-68 (Bankr. N.D. Tex.\n\n1998), aff'd, 186 F.3d 614 (5th Cir. 1999).       The court of appeals\n\ndid not take issue with the bankruptcy court's express entry of a\n\nfinal order under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052.36        See 219 B.R. at 468\n\nn.2. See also In re Melendez, 235 B.R. 173, 181-82, 201-04 (Bankr.\n\nD. Mass. 1999) (imposing sanctions in an omnibus disciplinary\n\n\n     36\n      Bankruptcy Rule 7052 makes Fed. R. Civ. P. 52 applicable to\nbankruptcy proceedings.   An order entered under Rule 7052 is a\nfinal judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); see also In re Werthen,\n329 F.3d 269, 272 (1st Cir. 2003) (findings of fact under\nBankruptcy Rule 7052 are reviewed for clear error).\n\n                                  -67-\n\fhearing initiated sua sponte by the bankruptcy court against\n\nseveral debtors' attorneys for inadequate representation of their\n\nrespective clients, and expressly entering its findings under\n\nBankruptcy Rule 7052); In re Nesom, 76 B.R. 101, 102 & n.1 (Bankr.\n\nN.D. Tex. 1987) (suspending an attorney for misconduct in two\n\nbankruptcy cases after a sua sponte disciplinary hearing by the\n\ncourt, and expressly terming the proceeding core).\n\n           The     principal   opinion's    objection    to    consolidated\n\ndisciplinary proceedings also makes little sense in light of the\n\nrules of evidence.        By the principal opinion's reasoning, the\n\nbankruptcy court in Sheridan's case could simply have framed its\n\nhearing as an investigation into Sheridan's misconduct in a single\n\nbankruptcy case, then admitted evidence of Sheridan's misconduct in\n\nother cases under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) and entered a final order on\n\nthat basis.      See In re Ludwick, 185 B.R. 238, 242-47 (Bankr. W.D.\n\nMich. 1995) (en banc) (following this approach in suspending a\n\nbankruptcy attorney from practice for two years); see also id. at\n\n239 (determining that the hearing was a core proceeding).               It\n\nelevates   form    over   substance   to   hold   that   the   functionally\n\nequivalent approach selected by the bankruptcy court in this case\n\nrendered the proceeding non-core.37\n\n\n\n     37\n      For similar reasons, there is no justification for the\nprincipal opinion's suggestion that the power of a bankruptcy judge\nto enter binding disciplinary orders should depend on whether the\nbankruptcy judge personally witnesses the attorney's misconduct.\n\n                                   -68-\n\f      2.   Source of law\n\n           The principal opinion next argues that the proceeding\n\nagainst Sheridan should be characterized as non-core because the\n\nunderlying substantive ethics rules \"derive . . . from state law.\"\n\nOp. at 24-25.    That is flatly wrong.       The rules of attorney conduct\n\nin federal court are federal law, not state law.         The Supreme Court\n\nso held in In re Snyder, in which the court of appeals had asserted\n\nthat an attorney's ethical obligations in federal court are defined\n\nby state law.     The Supreme Court disagreed:         \"The state code of\n\nprofessional responsibility does not by its own terms apply to\n\nsanctions in the federal courts.        Federal courts admit and suspend\n\nattorneys as an exercise of their inherent power; the standards\n\nimposed are a matter of federal law.\"               472 U.S. at 645 n.6\n\n(emphasis added); see also In re Larry's Apartment, L.L.C., 249\n\nF.3d 832, 837-38 (9th Cir. 2001) (federal law, not state law,\n\ngoverns the imposition of sanctions in federal bankruptcy cases).\n\nThis case did not involve a \"state law claim that could exist\n\noutside of bankruptcy.\"       In re ACI-HDT Supply Co., 205 B.R. 231,\n\n236   (B.A.P.   9th   Cir.   1997).     Rather,   it   involved   a   federal\n\nbankruptcy judge's enforcement of federal standards of conduct\n\nagainst an attorney who practiced in the federal bankruptcy courts.\n\n            In any event, the focus on the source of the applicable\n\nlaw is beside the point.      As this court held in Arnold Print Works,\n\n\"[i]t is the nature of the proceeding –- its relation to the basic\n\n\n                                      -69-\n\ffunction of the bankruptcy court –- not the state or federal basis\n\nfor the claim, that makes the difference here.\"                  815 F.2d at 169\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     3.     Closed cases\n\n             The principal opinion also attempts to distinguish the\n\nproceeding against Sheridan on the grounds that much of the charged\n\nmisconduct occurred in now-closed bankruptcy cases,38 so that any\n\nremedy ordered by the bankruptcy court is unlikely to concern the\n\nadministration of those clients' estates. Therefore, the principal\n\nopinion argues, the proceeding cannot be core because it neither\n\n\"concern[s] the administration of [an] estate,\" § 157(b)(2)(A), nor\n\n\"affect[s]     the   liquidation    of       the   assets   of    [an]    estate,\"\n\n§ 157(b)(2)(O).\n\n             This, too, is unpersuasive.             The bankruptcy court's\n\nimposition of sanctions on Sheridan did in fact \"concern[] the\n\nadministration of the estate\" in each of the underlying bankruptcy\n\ncases     within   the   meaning   of    §    157(b)(2)(A).        That    section\n\nconspicuously does not require that the proceeding in question\n\ncontemporaneously affect the ongoing administration of the estate;\n\n\n     38\n      Neither the principal opinion nor the concurring opinion\nacknowledges that several of the underlying bankruptcy cases were\nstill pending at the time the disciplinary proceeding against\nSheridan was instituted in October 2000. Indeed, several of the\ninstances of misconduct proven during the bench trial occurred as\nlate as November 2000, after the disciplinary proceedings had\nbegun. At least in these cases, the disciplinary action against\nSheridan was literally a \"matter[] concerning the administration of\nthe estate.\" § 157(b)(2)(A).\n\n                                    -70-\n\fthe matter must simply \"concern[]\" the administration of the\n\nestate.     Compare § 157(b)(2)(O) (core proceedings include \"other\n\nproceedings affecting . . . the debtor-creditor . . . relationship\"\n\n(emphasis added)).      And the imposition of sanctions against the\n\ndebtor's attorney necessarily \"concern[s]\" the administration of\n\nthe debtor's estate because, in a Chapter 13 case, the debtor's\n\nattorney is paid with funds from the estate in an amount \"based on\n\na consideration of the benefit . . . of [the attorney's] services\n\nto   the   debtor.\"        11    U.S.C.    §   330(a)(4)(B);       see   also       id.\n\n§ 503(b)(2) (authorizing payments to attorneys under § 330(a) as\n\n\"administrative expenses\" of the estate); cf. Delta Petroleum, 193\n\nB.R. at 106 (disputes over the appointment and compensation of\n\nattorneys     are   core        proceedings     because     they    concern         the\n\nadministration of the estate).\n\n            The majority's rule would require a bankruptcy court even\n\nin a single core proceeding to interrupt its adjudication of the\n\ndebtor's    petition    to       decide,   then    and    there,    an    attorney\n\ndisciplinary matter.        It would preclude the court, on penalty of\n\nconverting the proceeding from core to non-core, from waiting to\n\ndeal with the attorney until after it had dealt with debtor's and\n\ncreditors' arguments.           That priority is backwards.\n\n            Moreover,     even     in   the    majority's    terms,      the    order\n\nsanctioning    Sheridan      \"concern[ed]\"       the   administration          of   the\n\nunderlying estates because it provided a clear basis for re-opening\n\n\n                                        -71-\n\fthose cases, which the bankruptcy court may do whenever it finds\n\n\"cause.\"     See 11 U.S.C. § 350(b) (\"A case may be reopened . . . to\n\nadminister assets, to accord relief to the debtor, or for other\n\ncause.\").     The principal opinion characterizes the possibility of\n\nreopening the underlying cases as \"remote and overly speculative.\"\n\nOp. at 31.     But at least one bankruptcy court has reopened a case\n\n\"for cause\" due to evidence of ineffective representation by the\n\ndebtor's counsel.       See Bruzzese, 214 B.R. at 449-50.            Moreover,\n\nthere is no warrant in § 157(b)(2) for insisting on proof that a\n\nproceeding will alter the administration of the estate; the statute\n\nrequires only that the proceeding \"concern[]\" its administration.\n\nThe narrower reading is contrary to this court's conclusion in\n\nArnold     Print    Works   that   Congress    intended    the    term   \"core\n\nproceeding\" to be interpreted expansively.\n\n             Lastly, there is no independent problem with imposing\n\nsanctions on an attorney for misconduct that occurred in a since-\n\nclosed case.        Disciplinary proceedings against attorneys do not\n\ndepend on the continued pendency of the underlying action and can\n\nbe imposed long after a judgment on the merits.                See Chambers v.\n\nNASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 56 (1991); Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx\n\nCorp., 496 U.S. 384, 396 (1990).               This has been the rule in\n\nbankruptcy cases as well.          See In re Hasan, 287 B.R. 308, 311-12\n\n(Bankr. D. Conn. 2002) (collecting cases); see also In re Rambo,\n\n209   B.R.   527,    528-29   (B.A.P.   10th    Cir.   1997)    (dismissal   of\n\n\n                                     -72-\n\funderlying Chapter 13 case did not affect BAP's jurisdiction to\n\ndecide appeal of sanctions order); In re Balboa Improvements, Ltd.,\n\n99 B.R. 966 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1989) (similar).\n\n     4.     \"Extreme\" nature of the sanction\n\n            Finally, the principal opinion cites the \"extreme\" nature\n\nof the sanction imposed on Sheridan as a justification for holding\n\nthat the proceeding against him was not core.            Op. at 31-32.      This\n\nconflates the core/non-core question with the merits of Sheridan's\n\nappeal.      Whether   the    bankruptcy      court's   chosen   sanction   was\n\n\"extreme\" has nothing to do with whether it had the statutory\n\nauthority    to   enter   a   binding    order   embodying   that   sanction.\n\nSuspensions and disbarments are severe sanctions that merit close\n\nreview.   But that review should have been done here.\n\n                                        IV.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -73-\n\f",

The majority decides this case on an argument that\n\nSheridan never raised in the bankruptcy court, in the BAP, or on\n\nappeal, and that Sheridan expressly refused to adopt when this\n\ncourt raised it sua sponte and asked for his view.                    The majority\n\nthen decides that issue the wrong way.              The result is to relegate\n\nSheridan to a new round of litigation in the courts below, more\n\nthan two years after the bankruptcy court suspended him from\n\npractice.      For Sheridan, this is a pyrrhic victory, and one that he\n\nasked us not to give him.19\n\n               The principal opinion by Judge Cyr and the opinion by\n\nJudge Selya concurring in the judgment agree on two points that I\n\nbelieve are not only mistaken but also certain to have consequences\n\nbeyond the narrow realm of attorney discipline in bankruptcy cases:\n\n(1)     that      this   is   an   appropriate      case     for     invoking     the\n\nLaGuardia/Weinstein doctrine to justify this court in addressing an\n\nissue      that    Sheridan   elected   not    to   raise;   and     (2)   that   the\n\ndisciplinary         proceeding    against     Sheridan      was    not     a   \"core\n\nproceeding\" under § 157.             I also dissent from the principal\n\nopinion's conclusion that Sheridan neither consented nor waived his\n\nobjections to entry of a final order in the bankruptcy court.\n\n\n\n      19\n       It is true that, after the court's decision, the order\nsuspending Sheridan will no longer be final.  But the district\ncourt may simply reinstate the remedy chosen by the bankruptcy\ncourt.\n\n                                        -35-\n\f                                      I.\n\n             The   principal   opinion     reaches   the      \"core    proceeding\"\n\nquestion in this case only by holding that while Sheridan perhaps\n\nforfeited the issue, he never consented to the entry of a final\n\njudgment or otherwise waived the requirements of § 157.                     I cannot\n\njoin that conclusion: (i) it requires a restrictive interpretation\n\nof § 157(c) that conflicts with the views of at least five circuits\n\nand   the    leading   commentator   on     bankruptcy     law;       and   (ii)   it\n\nundermines this court's jurisprudence of waiver and consent to say,\n\non this record, that Sheridan ever disputed the finality of the\n\nbankruptcy court's order.\n\nA.    Section 157 and Finality\n\n             A bankruptcy judge's power to enter final orders is not\n\nlimited to core proceedings.         Rather, a bankruptcy court has the\n\nauthority     to   enter   a   dispositive     order     in    any     proceeding,\n\nirrespective of core/non-core status, if the parties consent.

We upheld appellate jurisdiction in that case\n\nbecause the parties had, by their conduct before the bankruptcy\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\fcourt, \"acquiesce[d]\" in the treatment of the proceeding as core.\n\nId.   If, by his conduct, Sheridan likewise indicated his knowing\n\nacquiescence in the bankruptcy court's treatment of his case as\n\ncore, then the sanctions order was final, the BAP had appellate\n\njurisdiction, and the core/non-core status of the disciplinary\n\nhearing is irrelevant.20\n\n           The principal opinion seems to interpret In re G.S.F. to\n\nrequire some \"affirmative\" expression of consent before a party\n\nwill be held to have waived the procedures required by § 157(c).\n\nOp. at 8-10.

Waiver in the Bankruptcy Court\n\n          If the principal opinion's restrictive view of consent\n\nunder § 157(c)(2) is wrong, it collapses.    That is because under\n\nthe test adopted by other circuits and (in my view) endorsed by\n\nthis court itself in In re G.S.F., Sheridan waived any right he may\n\nhave had to de novo review in the district court.\n\n          Sheridan utterly failed even to identify the core/non-\n\ncore issue in the bankruptcy court, let alone raise a coherent\n\nobjection to the core status of the proceeding, despite multiple\n\nopportunities to do so. Neither in his responsive pleadings nor in\n\n\n\n     21\n      But see Home Ins.

Sheridan, in response, raised\n\nvarious legal objections, not one of which addressed the core/non-\n\ncore status of the proceeding or the bankruptcy court's power to\n\n\n     22\n      The bankruptcy court expressly found that Sheridan \"is an\nexperienced attorney who has practiced [bankruptcy law] for a\nsignificant period of time.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1757058</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *24. The court\nfurther found that in light of that extensive experience, Sheridan\n\"was aware\" of the applicable rules and practices in bankruptcy\ncourt. Id.\n     Nevertheless, the principal opinion says that Sheridan's\nextensive experience as a bankruptcy attorney does not support the\ninference that he knowingly acquiesced in core treatment because\n\"these disciplinary proceedings arose, at least in part, from\nSheridan's numerous physical ailments and mental impairments.\" Op.\nat 15 n.7. That is a non-sequitur: whether Sheridan's misconduct\nwas related to his alleged disabilities has nothing to do with\nwhether Sheridan knew, based on his years of practicing bankruptcy\nlaw, that he was obliged to alert the bankruptcy judge if he\nobjected to the treatment of his disciplinary proceeding as core.\nThe principal opinion does not suggest that a disability actually\nprevented Sheridan from objecting to core treatment.\n     In any event, the principal opinion's willingness to attribute\nSheridan's professional misconduct to his disabilities is puzzling,\ngiven that (1) the bankruptcy court made no finding of any\ndisability, and (2) the BAP held that Sheridan utterly failed to\nsupport his claim of disability.

On\n\nOctober 12, 2001, the bankruptcy court entered a final opinion and\n\norder suspending Sheridan from practice.          Michels v.

D.N.H. Oct. 12, 2001).\n\n             The principal opinion explains all of this by saying that\n\nSheridan could not have raised the core/non-core issue prior to\n\njudgment because he had no idea that the bankruptcy court intended\n\nto enter a binding sanctions order.          Op. at 13.    That is simply not\n\nso.    Sheridan has never claimed, and could not claim, that he was\n\nunaware     that   the   bankruptcy   court    intended     to     sanction    him\n\ndirectly.      The   bankruptcy   court's     January     16,    2001    pretrial\n\nscheduling order stated that the complaint against Sheridan had\n\nbeen    commenced    under   Administrative     Order     2090-2    of   the   New\n\nHampshire bankruptcy courts.           That order expressly allows the\n\nbankruptcy court to issue binding orders sanctioning and disbarring\n\nattorneys by deeming attorneys who practice before the bankruptcy\n\ncourt to have consented to disciplinary jurisdiction.24                  Sheridan\n\n\n       23\n      Sheridan's reply stated only that the complaint failed to\nallege violations of the applicable rules of ethics and that, in\nthe alternative, his conduct should be excused because of his\ndisabilities.\n       24\n      AO 2090-2 provides, in relevant part, that \"[a]ny attorney\nadmitted or permitted to practice before [the bankruptcy] court\nshall be deemed to have conferred disciplinary jurisdiction upon\nth[e] court for any alleged attorney misconduct arising during the\n\n                                      -42-\n\fwas clearly on notice that the bankruptcy court intended to hold\n\nsuch a proceeding, yet he did not dispute that it was a core\n\nproceeding or that any resulting order would be final.25\n\n            Even in his multiple motions for reconsideration after\n\nthe bench trial, Sheridan failed to raise the core/non-core issue.\n\nIn   his   October   22,   2001   motion,    Sheridan     responded    to    the\n\nbankruptcy   judge's   statement    that     bankruptcy    courts     have   the\n\nsubstantive power to discipline attorneys under the \"inherent\n\npower\" doctrine of Ex parte Burr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85430\"><a href=\"/opinion/85430/ex-parte-burr/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1824).

Because the principal opinion\n\nrelies heavily on Sheridan's response to conclude that he raised\n\nand pressed the core/non-core argument, I quote it here:\n\n            First, Ex parte Burr, supra (U.S. 1824) concerns\n      broad powers inherent in the exercise of the judicial\n      power    under  Article   III  of   the   United   States\n      Constitution.     However, although the United States\n      Bankruptcy Court is a \"unit of the [Federal] district\n      court,\" it is well established that the powers of\n      Bankruptcy judges are limited to those \"conferred under\"\n      the United States Bankruptcy Code. 28 U.S.C. Section 151.\n            As such the Bankruptcy court does not share all of\n      the powers of the district court.      Thus, in Northern\n      Pipeline Co. vs. Marathon Pipeline Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110771\"><a href=\"/opinion/110771/northern-pipeline-constr-co-v-marathon-pipe-line-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n      (1982) the United States Supreme Court held that it was\n\n\ncourse of a case pending before th[e] court in which that attorney\nhas participated in any way.\"\n      25\n      Sheridan argued in his opening brief that AO 2090-2 was not\npromulgated until February 2001, after the disciplinary complaint\nagainst him was filed. That is not true: the administrative order\nwas adopted in October 2000, and Sheridan is fairly charged with\nknowledge of its contents. An amended version of AO 2090-2 became\neffective in February 2001, but the amendments did not affect any\nportion of the order relevant to Sheridan's case.\n\n                                    -43-\n\f     unconstitutional for the Bankruptcy Courts to exercise\n     the \"essential attributes of judicial power of the\n     Article III district court,\" and that the bankruptcy\n     court's power was limited to \"core proceedings\" of the\n     administration of the bankruptcy estate under the\n     bankruptcy code. 28 U.S.C. section 157(b)(1).\n          It is axiomatic that since the bankruptcy court does\n     not share in the \"essential\" powers of Article III\n     judges, it follows that the bankruptcy court does not\n     share in the \"inherent authority\" derived from the\n     exercise of Article III judicial power.26\n\n\nThis was Sheridan's sole reference to \"core proceedings\" or § 157\n\nin the bankruptcy court.\n\n             As the context makes clear, Sheridan was not objecting in\n\nthese paragraphs to the finality of the bankruptcy court's order\n\nagainst him.       Nor did the bankruptcy court understand him to be\n\nmaking such an argument. Rather, Sheridan was contending only that\n\nbankruptcy courts do not enjoy the \"inherent power\" described in Ex\n\nparte Burr to discipline attorneys.         This is simply an attack on\n\none of the bankruptcy court's asserted sources of disciplinary\n\nauthority.     It is distinct from the contention that the principal\n\nopinion attributes to Sheridan: namely, that the bankruptcy court,\n\nwhile     empowered   to   conduct   disciplinary   proceedings,   was   not\n\npermitted     to   enter    a   final   order   against   Sheridan   under\n\n§ 157(c)(1). Sheridan, an experienced bankruptcy lawyer, knows the\n\ndifference.     Indeed, the principal opinion itself recognizes that\n\nthe question whether a bankruptcy court has the power to discipline\n\n\n     26\n      This passage is quoted exactly from Sheridan's October 22\nmotion; any mistakes or grammatical errors are his.\n\n                                     -44-\n\fattorneys is a question independent of whether it has the power to\n\nenter a final order.27   Yet the principal opinion contends that by\n\nraising the former argument, Sheridan somehow also raised the\n\nlatter.28   This is unfair to bankruptcy judges, who should not be\n\nasked to read tea leaves to discern a litigant's argument.\n\n\n     27\n      For example, the principal opinion concedes that bankruptcy\ncourts have substantive disciplinary authority, but it holds that\nthe exercise of that power in this particular case was not a \"core\nproceeding.\" See Op. at 28-29. Sheridan essentially argued the\nopposite: he challenged the substantive power of bankruptcy courts\nto discipline attorneys, but did not contest that the invocation of\nthat power, if valid, would be a core proceeding.\n     28\n      The principal opinion emphasizes Sheridan's citation to\nNorthern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110771\"><a href=\"/opinion/110771/northern-pipeline-constr-co-v-marathon-pipe-line-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982), which it describes as \"the seminal case regarding the\nconstitutional limitations which undergird the pivotal core/non-\ncore distinction.\" Op. at 16 (emphasis in original). There is no\ndoubt that the \"core proceeding\" concept reflects some of the\nArticle III issues discussed in the plurality opinion in Northern\nPipeline. But it is more than a stretch to say that Sheridan's\nreference to that case amounts to an argument that the proceeding\nbelow was non-core under § 157.      Congress did not create the\ncore/non-core distinction until after Northern Pipeline, so the\ncitation alone hardly suffices to raise the issue.\n     More fundamentally, Northern Pipeline discussed at least five\nways in which the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 unconstitutionally vested\nthe \"essential attributes\" of judicial power in Article I\nbankruptcy judges, only one of which was the fact that bankruptcy\njudges were empowered to issue final orders that were binding and\nenforceable. See 458 U.S. at 85-86. Significantly, another of the\n\"essential attributes\" cited by the Northern Pipeline Court was the\npower of bankruptcy judges to exercise \"all ordinary powers of\ndistrict courts,\" including issuing extraordinary writs and orders.\nId. at 85. This -- and not the core/non-core distinction -- was\nthe proposition for which Sheridan cited Northern Pipeline.\nSheridan has consistently argued that under Northern Pipeline,\nbankruptcy courts lack the \"inherent power\" that district courts\nenjoy to discipline attorneys in the absence of statutory\nauthorization. As noted above, this is logically distinct from the\nargument that bankruptcy courts can discipline attorneys but cannot\nenter final orders.\n\n                                -45-\n\f           All of this, in my view, requires the conclusion that the\n\nbankruptcy court's order was final and appealable.         Sheridan was\n\nplainly aware of the core/non-core distinction.       He simply elected\n\nnot to assert the issue, perhaps for strategic reasons. Perhaps he\n\ngambled that the bankruptcy judge's factual findings would be\n\nfavorable to him, hoping to benefit from a more favorable standard\n\nof review on appeal.    Perhaps he preferred to retain the option of\n\nappealing to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, as he ultimately did.\n\nWhatever his reasons, Sheridan abandoned any right he may have had\n\nto de novo review in the district court by choosing not to object\n\nto core treatment.     See In re G.S.F., 938 F.2d at 1477; accord In\n\nre Tex. Gen. Petroleum Corp., 52 F.3d at 1337; Abramowitz, 999 F.2d\n\nat 1280; In re Johnson, 960 F.2d at 403-04; In re Daniels-Head, 819\n\nF.2d at 919; In re Men's Sportswear, 834 F.2d at 1137-38.              By\n\nrefusing to infer consent from Sheridan's conduct, the majority\n\nsimply encourages future bankruptcy litigants to game the system by\n\nwaiting   until   an   adverse   judgment   before   objecting   to   core\n\ntreatment.   \"Inferring consent in these circumstances . . . checks\n\nthe risk of gamesmanship by depriving parties of the luxury of\n\nwaiting for the outcome before denying the [bankruptcy judge's]\n\nauthority. Judicial efficiency is served; the Article III right is\n\nsubstantially honored.\"     Roell, 123 S. Ct. at 1703.\n\nC.   Waiver on Appeal\n\n           Sheridan's conduct on appeal, both in the BAP and before\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\fthis court, provides further assurance that he consented to core\n\ntreatment.    First, Sheridan elected to bring his appeal in the\n\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel rather than in the district court,\n\ndespite the fact that the BAP has no authority to review proposed\n\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law under § 157(c)(1).                The\n\nprincipal opinion dismisses this point, stating that Sheridan's\n\nappeal was proper because the bankruptcy judge ostensibly entered\n\na final order.       Op. at 16 n.8.       That is true, but it does not\n\nnegate the inference of consent: although Sheridan had an absolute\n\nstatutory    right   to   bring   his    appeal   in   the   district   court\n\nirrespective of the core/non-core issue, see 28 U.S.C. § 158(c)(1),\n\nand although the BAP notified Sheridan of that right in writing,\n\nSheridan nevertheless pursued his appeal in the BAP.             If, as the\n\nprincipal opinion contends, Sheridan had believed he was entitled\n\nto de novo review in the district court, the obvious choice would\n\nhave been to invoke his right to appeal to the district court and\n\nthen to demand de novo review.          His decision to appeal to the BAP\n\ninstead is strong evidence of his consent to core treatment.             Cf.\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111759\"><a href=\"/opinion/111759/commodity-futures-trading-commn-v-schor/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849-50\n\n(1986) (plaintiff's election to forgo review in federal court and\n\nseek relief instead in an Article I proceeding \"constituted an\n\neffective waiver\" of Article III objections because the party had\n\nthe option of Article III adjudication but \"chose to avail himself\n\nof the quicker and less expensive procedure Congress had provided\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\fhim\").\n\n             Sheridan never argued to the BAP that the proceeding in\n\nthe bankruptcy court was non-core. He merely repeated his argument\n\nabout \"inherent power\" under Ex parte Burr.       The BAP opinion makes\n\nclear that the finality of the bankruptcy court's order was never\n\nin dispute.

Invited by the\n\ncourt to file a supplemental brief on the core/non-core question,\n\nSheridan expressly declined to argue that the disciplinary hearing\n\nwas non-core.     His supplemental brief acknowledged the core/non-\n\ncore issue and even cited § 157(c)(1), the provision barring\n\nbankruptcy     judges   from   entering   final   orders    in   non-core\n\nproceedings absent the consent of the parties.             Nevertheless,\n\nSheridan refused to assert that the disciplinary proceeding was\n\nnon-core –- he stated simply that he \"takes no position\" on whether\n\nthe bankruptcy court order was final, and he urged this court to\n\nprovide prompt and clear guidance on the merits of his appeal\n\nbecause his case had already been pending too long.29\n\n\n     29\n      The principal opinion emphasizes that before Sheridan stated\nhe \"takes no position\" on the core/non-core issue, he successfully\nbriefed the argument that the proceeding below was non-core.

See Op. at 17-19.   The LaGuardia\n\nexception is inapplicable on these facts, and by invoking it here,\n\nthe majority approves a novel and extremely unwise expansion of\n\nthat doctrine.\n\n          Under LaGuardia and its progeny, the court of appeals may\n\nreview de novo an argument that is raised for the first time on\n\nappeal only if:   (1) the argument involves a purely legal question\n\nof constitutional import that can be resolved with certitude on the\n\nexisting record; (2) addressing the argument will promote judicial\n\neconomy because the same issue will arise in nearly identical terms\n\nin other cases; and (3) the argument, if meritorious, would almost\n\ncertainly entitle the appellant to prevail, so that failing to\n\naddress it would result in a miscarriage of justice.

Cases qualifying for the exception, we have said,\n\nare \"few and far between.\"   Id.\n\n           The majority's resort to LaGuardia on facts like these is\n\nunprecedented in multiple respects.    First, this court has never\n\ninvoked the LaGuardia exception when the party on whose behalf the\n\ncourt would intervene has not actually raised the issue on appeal.\n\nHere, not only did Sheridan fail to raise the core/non-core issue\n\non appeal, but he also explicitly declined to advocate the position\n\nwhen asked.\n\n           In addition, the usual predicate conditions for invoking\n\nLaGuardia are absent here.   The core/non-core distinction is not a\n\nmatter of constitutional law or import, no more than any other\n\nquestion of statutory interpretation under the Bankruptcy Code.30\n\n\n     30\n      The principal opinion insists that the core/non-core question\nis a question of \"constitutional import,\" presumably because\nCongress created the core/non-core distinction in response to a\nSupreme Court case predicated on Article III. Op. at 19 & n.10.\nThat argument is misplaced for two reasons. First, the fact that\na statutory scheme reflects considerations of constitutional law\ndoes not elevate the statute itself to constitutional stature. We\ndo not say, for example, that service of process under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 4 is a question of constitutional dimensions, even though that\nRule was plainly written to comport with constitutional due process\nconcerns.    Indeed, if the core/non-core issue is a matter of\nconstitutional law, so too is the rest of the Bankruptcy Code\ninsofar as it reflects Congress's judgment about how best to\nimplement its powers under the Bankruptcy Clause, U.S. Const. Art.\nI, § 8, cl. 4.\n\n                                -50-\n\fNor is the core/non-core determination \"strictly a question of\n\nlaw.\"    LaGuardia, 902 F.2d at 1013.        The principal opinion itself\n\nrecognizes that the core/non-core question in this case is not a\n\npurely   legal   one   --   the   court    does   not   hold   that   attorney\n\ndisciplinary proceedings are always non-core, but rather that the\n\nproceeding was non-core \"[i]n the particular circumstances of the\n\ninstant case.\"     Op. at 5.       And the core/non-core status of an\n\nomnibus attorney disciplinary proceeding initiated by a bankruptcy\n\ncourt is hardly a question that is \"almost certain to be presented\n\nin identical terms in other cases.\"          LaGuardia, 902 F.2d at 1013.\n\n            Similarly, the merits of the core/non-core issue in this\n\ncase are neither \"highly persuasive,\" Harwood, 69 F.3d at 628, nor\n\n\"so compelling as virtually to insure [the appellant's] success,\"\n\n\n\n     Second, the core/non-core distinction is nothing like the\nproblems of constitutional law or import that have previously\nserved as a predicate for this court's resort to LaGuardia.

In my view, the only\n\ninterpretation of § 157 that is consistent with the purposes of the\n\nfederal   bankruptcy    laws   and     Congress's   intent   in    the   1984\n\nbankruptcy amendments is that the disciplinary proceeding against\n\nSheridan, which arose out of misconduct occurring in indisputably\n\ncore proceedings, constituted a core proceeding.\n\nA.   Interpretation of 28 U.S.C. § 157\n\n     1.   Plain text of § 157\n\n          Whether the disciplinary proceeding against Sheridan was\n\na \"core proceeding\" under 28 U.S.C. § 157 is a matter of statutory\n\nconstruction.    The plain text of § 157 makes no explicit reference\n\nto attorney discipline, sanctions, contempt, or anything similar,\n\njust as it fails to describe other proceedings that courts have\n\nrecognized as core.31    Nor is the statutory term \"core proceeding\"\n\nself-defining.\n\n           Nevertheless, the principal opinion purports to find\n\nsupport in the text of § 157.        It discusses the various categories\n\nof core proceedings in § 157(b)(2), emphasizing that \"each of the\n\nenumerated   matters    relates   to    a   function   essential    to   the\n\n\n\n     31\n      See generally 1 Collier on Bankruptcy § 3.02[3] (rev. 15th\ned. 2003) (listing examples of proceedings recognized as \"core\"\neven though they do not fall within the express terms of § 157(b)).\n\n\n                                     -53-\n\fadministration of the bankruptcy case.\" Op. at 21. The proceeding\n\nagainst Sheridan, the principal opinion contends, was different:\n\nit did not arise in any single bankruptcy case, so there was no\n\nrelevant \"case\" to administer. Accordingly, it must have been non-\n\ncore.     This is an expressio unius rationale: Congress provided a\n\nlist of core proceeding categories in § 157(b); that list does not\n\ninclude     omnibus    attorney       disciplinary         hearings       or    similar\n\nproceedings spanning multiple bankruptcy cases; therefore Congress\n\nmeant to exclude such proceedings from \"core\" treatment.\n\n            This is flawed logic.             As the Supreme Court reiterated\n\nlast    Term,   the   expressio       unius      canon   applies     only      when   the\n\nstatutory list in question \"justif[ies] the inference that items\n\nnot mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice.\"                        Barnhart v.\n\nPeabody Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122253\"><a href=\"/opinion/122253/barnhart-v-peabody-coal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168 (2003).                 No such inference is\n\npossible    here.      It     is   true    that    Congress,    in    drafting        the\n\ncategories of core proceedings in § 157(b)(2), referred to \"the\n\nestate\" (i.e., in the singular), but that choice of words merely\n\nreflects    the     reality    that    the       vast    majority    of     bankruptcy\n\nproceedings pertain to a single debtor.                   Nothing in the statute\n\nsays a proceeding is non-core if it involves more than one estate,\n\nand Congress knew how to exclude matters from § 157(b) when it\n\nwished to do so.        See, e.g., § 157(b)(2)(O) (excluding personal\n\ninjury and      wrongful    death     claims      from   core   treatment).           The\n\nclincher is that Congress specifically provided that the list of\n\n\n                                          -54-\n\fexamples    in    §   157(b)(2)    is    not    exhaustive.    See     28    U.S.C.\n\n§ 157(b)(2) (core proceedings \"are not limited to\" the listed\n\ncategories); see also 1 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, § 3.02[3]\n\n(\"It should be emphasized at the outset that section 157(b)(2) is\n\nnot limiting . . . .\").\n\n            This brings us back to where we started.            The underlying\n\nquestion    on    the   merits    of    the    core/non-core   issue    is       this:\n\nwhether, in light of the structure and purpose of the core/non-core\n\ndistinction and the Bankruptcy Code as a whole, § 157(b)(2) should\n\nbe interpreted to embrace disciplinary proceedings like Sheridan's.\n\nSee In re Hart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200459\"><a href=\"/opinion/200459/banknorth-v-hart/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).                 The principal\n\nopinion undertakes no such analysis.\n\n     2.    Background to the 1984 Bankruptcy Amendments\n\n            In fact, there is every reason to believe that Congress\n\nwanted and expected bankruptcy judges to enforce the professional\n\nresponsibilities of bankruptcy attorneys through final and binding\n\norders    where   the   misconduct       in    question   occurred     in    a    core\n\nbankruptcy proceeding or proceedings.32               In 1984, when Congress\n\n\n     32\n      Long before Northern Pipeline and Congress's 1984 enactment\nof § 157, the Supreme Court recognized that a court's power to\nregulate the conduct of the bar, including the power to suspend and\ndisbar attorneys, is essential to the administration of justice and\nthe protection of the public.

Consumer debtors, like those whom Sheridan\n\nrepresented, rarely have the resources or sophistication to bring\n\ntort claims for legal malpractice.              Indeed, because of the high\n\nvolume of consumer bankruptcy filings and the speed at which\n\nbankruptcy    courts   must       process    such   petitions,     many    consumer\n\ndebtors    \"never    discover      that     their   attorneys     have    committed\n\nmalpractice.\"       Id. at 450.       Direct discipline by the bankruptcy\n\ncourt may be the only feasible means in many cases of protecting\n\ndebtors and ensuring the ethical conduct of the consumer bankruptcy\n\nbar in core proceedings.

There are situations in\n\nwhich the justifications for permitting bankruptcy judges to issue\n\nbinding disciplinary orders are less compelling –- for example,\n\nwhen an attorney acts unethically in a non-core proceeding in which\n\nthe parties have refused to consent to the entry of a final order\n\non the merits.    In such cases, the bankruptcy court must recommend\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court in\n\nany event; there is little reason to treat the disciplinary issues\n\nalone as within the bankruptcy court's core powers.\n\n           As to unethical conduct in core proceedings, however,\n\nCongress's purposes in the Bankruptcy Code are much better served\n\nby a rule that permits bankruptcy judges to issue final and binding\n\ndisciplinary orders directly, without resort to the district court\n\nbut with normal rights to appeal.

In a core\n\nproceeding, the bankruptcy judge is empowered to make factual\n\nfindings on the merits and to have those findings reviewed only for\n\nclear error. No useful purpose is served by denying the bankruptcy\n\ncourt the power to make equally authoritative findings of fact\n\nabout the conduct of the very attorneys who appear before it.                \"If\n\nthe bankruptcy courts are to administer 'the restructuring of\n\ndebtor-creditor relations, which is at the core of the federal\n\nbankruptcy power,' they must also have the power to sanction\n\nparties that interfere with such administration.\"             In re Emergency\n\nBeacon Corp., 52 B.R. at 987.\n\n            Under    the   \"core   comes      from   core\"    principle,     the\n\nproceeding against Sheridan was plainly a core proceeding.                   The\n\n\n                                    -63-\n\foverwhelming majority of the ethical violations of which Sheridan\n\nwas accused occurred in core proceedings.           The bankruptcy court\n\nfound that Sheridan committed at least 83 ethical violations over\n\n33 separate bankruptcy cases.34     It is clear from the record that\n\nat least 80 of those 83 violations, accounting for fully 31 of the\n\n33 cases, occurred in core proceedings (specifically, proceedings\n\nto propose, file, modify, and confirm Chapter 13 plans).35 Further,\n\nthere has been no showing that the remaining three instances of\n\nmisconduct occurred in non-core proceedings; rather, it is simply\n\nimpossible to tell from the record whether those proceedings were\n\nalso core.   As a result, the only impediment to applying the \"core\n\ncomes from core\" rule in this case is a set of 3 ethical violations\n\nin   proceedings   whose   core/non-core   status    is   unknown.   Even\n\nassuming that those violations (which accounted for less than\n\n1/20th of the charges against Sheridan) occurred in non-core\n\nproceedings, there is no reason to think that they materially\n\n\n\n      34\n      In addition, the court determined that Sheridan committed\nfive violations in the disciplinary proceeding itself, bringing the\ntotal to 88 violations in 34 cases.\n      35\n      The vast majority of Sheridan's infractions involved failing\nto file certificates of service for his clients' Chapter 13 plans\n(17 times in 16 cases); failing to file documents or motions\nrelated to his clients' Chapter 13 petitions in a timely manner (39\ntimes in 28 cases); and failing to appear or appearing late at\ncourt hearings (8 occasions) and § 341 meetings (3 occasions)\nrelated to Chapter 13 petitions.

Summary\n\n           The court's constrained reading of § 157 contradicts\n\nCongress's intent in the 1984 amendments, which was not to shrink\n\nthe powers of the bankruptcy courts but to extend them to their\n\njurisdictional limits in the wake of Northern Pipeline.      In light\n\nof the open-ended statutory text of § 157; the clear congressional\n\nintent that courts should interpret the term \"core proceeding\"\n\nbroadly; the binding precedent in our own circuit commanding that\n\nwe do so; the absence of relevant constitutional constraints; the\n\nlegitimate functional need for bankruptcy courts to have \"core\"\n\njurisdiction over attorney misconduct arising in core proceedings;\n\nand the broadly accepted rule that \"core comes from core,\" I think\n\nwe would be obliged to hold, were the issue properly presented,\n\nthat the disciplinary proceeding against Sheridan was a \"core\n\nproceeding\" under § 157.\n\nB.   The Principal Opinion's Four Distinguishing Factors\n\n           The principal opinion reserves the question of whether\n\nattorney disciplinary proceedings may ever enjoy core status,\n\nholding instead that Sheridan's case is distinguishable on four\n\ngrounds:   (1) the disciplinary proceeding against Sheridan did not\n\n\n                                  -65-\n\ftake place in the context of an ongoing bankruptcy case, but rather\n\nwas an \"omnibus\" proceeding spanning multiple cases; (2) the rule\n\nof decision in Sheridan's disciplinary proceeding came from state-\n\nlaw ethics rules, rather than federal law; (3) any potential effect\n\non a closed bankruptcy case is remote and speculative; and (4) the\n\nbankruptcy court's disciplinary order was \"extreme\" relative to\n\nSheridan's misconduct.     See Op. at 31-32.      Not one of these grounds\n\nis valid basis for distinguishing this case.\n\n     1.   Omnibus vs. individual disciplinary proceedings\n\n           The principal opinion first argues that Sheridan's case\n\nmerits different treatment because it was an \"omnibus\" disciplinary\n\ninvestigation -- that is, because the bankruptcy court consolidated\n\nthe ethical issues arising in multiple, independent bankruptcy\n\ncases into a single disciplinary hearing.\n\n           This objection is without merit.              Nothing in § 157\n\nrestricts core proceedings to proceedings that concern a single\n\nbankruptcy case, and the principal opinion cites no authority for\n\nits suggestion that § 157(b) should be interpreted so narrowly.\n\nCompare   Arnold   Print   Works,   815    F.2d   at   168.   There   is   no\n\nfunctional reason to discourage bankruptcy courts from combining\n\ndisciplinary issues spanning multiple bankruptcy cases into a\n\nsingle proceeding for expeditious administration.             Normally this\n\ncourt encourages and respects the efforts of lower courts to manage\n\ntheir dockets efficiently.

By the principal opinion's reasoning, the\n\nbankruptcy court in Sheridan's case could simply have framed its\n\nhearing as an investigation into Sheridan's misconduct in a single\n\nbankruptcy case, then admitted evidence of Sheridan's misconduct in\n\nother cases under Fed.

It\n\nelevates   form    over   substance   to   hold   that   the   functionally\n\nequivalent approach selected by the bankruptcy court in this case\n\nrendered the proceeding non-core.37\n\n\n\n     37\n      For similar reasons, there is no justification for the\nprincipal opinion's suggestion that the power of a bankruptcy judge\nto enter binding disciplinary orders should depend on whether the\nbankruptcy judge personally witnesses the attorney's misconduct.\n\n                                   -68-\n\f      2.   Source of law\n\n           The principal opinion next argues that the proceeding\n\nagainst Sheridan should be characterized as non-core because the\n\nunderlying substantive ethics rules \"derive . . . from state law.\"\n\nOp. at 24-25.    That is flatly wrong.       The rules of attorney conduct\n\nin federal court are federal law, not state law.         The Supreme Court\n\nso held in In re Snyder, in which the court of appeals had asserted\n\nthat an attorney's ethical obligations in federal court are defined\n\nby state law.     The Supreme Court disagreed:         \"The state code of\n\nprofessional responsibility does not by its own terms apply to\n\nsanctions in the federal courts.        Federal courts admit and suspend\n\nattorneys as an exercise of their inherent power; the standards\n\nimposed are a matter of federal law.\"               472 U.S. at 645 n.6\n\n(emphasis added); see also In re Larry's Apartment, L.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773200\"><a href=\"/opinion/773200/in-re-larrys-apartment-llc-debtor-michael-a-galam-v-michael-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837-38 (9th Cir. 2001) (federal law, not state law,\n\ngoverns the imposition of sanctions in federal bankruptcy cases).\n\nThis case did not involve a \"state law claim that could exist\n\noutside of bankruptcy.\"       In re ACI-HDT Supply Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1528483\"><a href=\"/opinion/1528483/in-re-aci-hdt-supply-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n236   (B.A.P.   9th   Cir.   1997).     Rather,   it   involved   a   federal\n\nbankruptcy judge's enforcement of federal standards of conduct\n\nagainst an attorney who practiced in the federal bankruptcy courts.\n\n            In any event, the focus on the source of the applicable\n\nlaw is beside the point.      As this court held in Arnold Print Works,\n\n\"[i]t is the nature of the proceeding –- its relation to the basic\n\n\n                                      -69-\n\ffunction of the bankruptcy court –- not the state or federal basis\n\nfor the claim, that makes the difference here.\"                  815 F.2d at 169\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     3.     Closed cases\n\n             The principal opinion also attempts to distinguish the\n\nproceeding against Sheridan on the grounds that much of the charged\n\nmisconduct occurred in now-closed bankruptcy cases,38 so that any\n\nremedy ordered by the bankruptcy court is unlikely to concern the\n\nadministration of those clients' estates. Therefore, the principal\n\nopinion argues, the proceeding cannot be core because it neither\n\n\"concern[s] the administration of [an] estate,\" § 157(b)(2)(A), nor\n\n\"affect[s]     the   liquidation    of       the   assets   of    [an]    estate,\"\n\n§ 157(b)(2)(O).\n\n             This, too, is unpersuasive.             The bankruptcy court's\n\nimposition of sanctions on Sheridan did in fact \"concern[] the\n\nadministration of the estate\" in each of the underlying bankruptcy\n\ncases     within   the   meaning   of    §    157(b)(2)(A).        That    section\n\nconspicuously does not require that the proceeding in question\n\ncontemporaneously affect the ongoing administration of the estate;\n\n\n     38\n      Neither the principal opinion nor the concurring opinion\nacknowledges that several of the underlying bankruptcy cases were\nstill pending at the time the disciplinary proceeding against\nSheridan was instituted in October 2000. Indeed, several of the\ninstances of misconduct proven during the bench trial occurred as\nlate as November 2000, after the disciplinary proceedings had\nbegun. At least in these cases, the disciplinary action against\nSheridan was literally a \"matter[] concerning the administration of\nthe estate.\" § 157(b)(2)(A).\n\n                                    -70-\n\fthe matter must simply \"concern[]\" the administration of the\n\nestate.     Compare § 157(b)(2)(O) (core proceedings include \"other\n\nproceedings affecting . . . the debtor-creditor . . . relationship\"\n\n(emphasis added)).      And the imposition of sanctions against the\n\ndebtor's attorney necessarily \"concern[s]\" the administration of\n\nthe debtor's estate because, in a Chapter 13 case, the debtor's\n\nattorney is paid with funds from the estate in an amount \"based on\n\na consideration of the benefit . . . of [the attorney's] services\n\nto   the   debtor.\"        11    U.S.C.    §   330(a)(4)(B);       see   also       id.\n\n§ 503(b)(2) (authorizing payments to attorneys under § 330(a) as\n\n\"administrative expenses\" of the estate); cf. Delta Petroleum, 193\n\nB.R. at 106 (disputes over the appointment and compensation of\n\nattorneys     are   core        proceedings     because     they    concern         the\n\nadministration of the estate).\n\n            The majority's rule would require a bankruptcy court even\n\nin a single core proceeding to interrupt its adjudication of the\n\ndebtor's    petition    to       decide,   then    and    there,    an    attorney\n\ndisciplinary matter.        It would preclude the court, on penalty of\n\nconverting the proceeding from core to non-core, from waiting to\n\ndeal with the attorney until after it had dealt with debtor's and\n\ncreditors' arguments.           That priority is backwards.\n\n            Moreover,     even     in   the    majority's    terms,      the    order\n\nsanctioning    Sheridan      \"concern[ed]\"       the   administration          of   the\n\nunderlying estates because it provided a clear basis for re-opening\n\n\n                                        -71-\n\fthose cases, which the bankruptcy court may do whenever it finds\n\n\"cause.\"     See 11 U.S.C. § 350(b) (\"A case may be reopened . . . to\n\nadminister assets, to accord relief to the debtor, or for other\n\ncause.\").     The principal opinion characterizes the possibility of\n\nreopening the underlying cases as \"remote and overly speculative.\"\n\nOp. at 31.     But at least one bankruptcy court has reopened a case\n\n\"for cause\" due to evidence of ineffective representation by the\n\ndebtor's counsel.       See Bruzzese, 214 B.R. at 449-50.            Moreover,\n\nthere is no warrant in § 157(b)(2) for insisting on proof that a\n\nproceeding will alter the administration of the estate; the statute\n\nrequires only that the proceeding \"concern[]\" its administration.\n\nThe narrower reading is contrary to this court's conclusion in\n\nArnold     Print    Works   that   Congress    intended    the    term   \"core\n\nproceeding\" to be interpreted expansively.\n\n             Lastly, there is no independent problem with imposing\n\nsanctions on an attorney for misconduct that occurred in a since-\n\nclosed case.        Disciplinary proceedings against attorneys do not\n\ndepend on the continued pendency of the underlying action and can\n\nbe imposed long after a judgment on the merits.
