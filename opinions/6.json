Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n              Selya, Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Linda Backiel on brief for appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Chief, Appellate Division, and Thomas F. Klumper,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            February 17, 2010\n\f          Per Curiam.   Defendant-appellant Amado De La Rosa-Ramos\n\npleaded guilty to charges involving his attempted illegal reentry\n\ninto the United States.   The district court sentenced him to two\n\nconcurrent 51-month terms of immurement.   On appeal, he challenges\n\nhis sentence.   We direct a slight modification in the sentence but\n\notherwise affirm.\n\n          The facts, which we glean from the plea colloquy, the\n\npresentence investigation report (PSI Report), and the transcript\n\nof the disposition hearing, are uncomplicated.   On March 25, 2008,\n\nPuerto Rico maritime police called the U.S. Border Patrol to a\n\nlocus roughly 200 yards off the coast of Parque de Colón.     Upon\n\narrival, the border patrol agents observed a number of persons\n\njumping from a detained vessel into the surrounding waters.    The\n\nagents apprehended the defendant and thirteen other individuals.\n\n          In due course, a federal grand jury handed up a two-count\n\nindictment against four persons.       The indictment charged the\n\ndefendant with plotting to effect his own illegal entry and aiding\n\nand abetting the illegal entry of others, in violation of 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1325(a)(1) (count 1), and attempted reentry into the United\n\nStates without proper authorization after having been deported\n\nfollowing the commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1326(a)(2), (b)(2) (count 2).   The defendant entered a\n\nstraight guilty plea to both counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f            A probation officer proceeded to prepare the PSI Report.\n\nUsing the November 2007 edition of the guidelines manual, she\n\ngrouped the counts of conviction because they arose out of the same\n\nplan, scheme, or course of conduct.         See USSG §3D1.2(b).        Inasmuch\n\nas count 2 carried the higher total offense level — 21 — the\n\nprobation officer used it to calculate the guideline sentencing\n\nrange (GSR).1     See id. §3D1.3(a).\n\n            To   complete   this    calculation,    the   probation     officer\n\nneeded to determine the defendant's criminal history category\n\n(CHC).    Because certain details of the defendant's criminal record\n\nare   pertinent   to   an   issue    on   appeal,   we    note   the   relevant\n\nparticulars.\n\n            The first conviction with which we are concerned led to\n\nsentencing by a local Puerto Rico court on November 27, 1995.               The\n\ncharges were for aggravated assault and related weapons violations.\n\nThe Puerto Rico court imposed a two-year prison sentence.               The PSI\n\nReport assigned three criminal history points in respect to this\n\nsentence.    See id. §4A1.1(a).      Following service of this sentence,\n\nthe government deported the defendant.2\n\n\n      1\n       This total offense level resulted from a base offense level\nof 8, see USSG §2L1.2, plus 16 levels because the defendant's\nearlier deportation followed his conviction for a crime of\nviolence, see id. §2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), less 3 levels for acceptance\nof responsibility, see id. §3E1.1.\n      2\n       At sentencing in the instant case, the parties disagreed\nabout the date of deportation. We need not resolve this dispute as\nthe exact date is immaterial to the issues presented on appeal.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           The defendant's other brushes with the law arose out of\n\nactivities that led to his arrest by the Coast Guard on or about\n\nOctober 25, 2003.    This arrest followed the Coast Guard's seizure\n\nof a wooden yawl off the coast of San Juan.        Federal authorities\n\ndetained   several    persons   (including   the   defendant).    They\n\nsubsequently charged the defendant with illegal reentry into the\n\nUnited States after having been deported for commission of an\n\naggravated felony.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2).\n\n           The defendant entered a guilty plea on July 20, 2004, and\n\na federal judge sentenced him to 41 months in prison (subsequently\n\nreduced to 30 months) and three years of supervised release.       The\n\nPSI Report assigned three criminal history points to this sentence.\n\nSee USSG §4A1.1(a).\n\n           On March 24, 2004, the defendant (along with other\n\npersons arrested on October 25, 2003) was charged with smuggling\n\nand harboring illegal aliens.       As part of a plea bargain, the\n\ngovernment later dropped these charges and, instead, filed an\n\ninformation that charged the defendant with misprision of a felony.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 4.    On June 9, 2005, the defendant entered a guilty\n\nplea to this charge.      The court sentenced him the same day to\n\ntwelve months and one day in prison, to run concurrently with the\n\nunserved portion of his 41-month sentence (described above).       The\n\nPSI Report assigned three criminal history points to this sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fSee USSG §4A1.1.    After his release, the government again deported\n\nthe defendant.\n\n          In addition to the foregoing, the PSI Report assigned two\n\npoints because the defendant committed the offenses of conviction\n\n(that is, the offenses underlying this appeal) while serving a term\n\nof supervised release.      See id. §4A1.1(d).\n\n          In the aggregate, these allocations produced a total of\n\neleven criminal history points, which placed the defendant in CHC\n\nV.   See id. Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).            As a further data\n\npoint, the PSI Report noted that the statutory maximum sentences\n\nfor the offenses of conviction were two years for count 1 and\n\ntwenty years for count 2.\n\n          Neither side filed objections to the PSI Report.               See\n\nD.P.R.R. 132(b)(3).       At the disposition hearing, however, the\n\ndefendant disputed certain dates, see, e.g., supra note 2, and\n\nsought   to   \"clarify\"    his   prior    convictions.       Despite    this\n\nclarification,     the    sentencing     court   ruled   that   the    prior\n\nconvictions were appropriately scored in the PSI Report. Then, the\n\ncourt cited a variety of mitigating factors and adjusted the\n\ndefendant's total offense level downward by three levels (to 18).\n\nAccepting all the other recommendations contained in the PSI Report\n\nand retaining the defendant's classification in CHC V, the court\n\ncomputed the GSR at 51-63 months.          The government recommended a\n\nsentence at the low end of the GSR.        The court obliged, sentencing\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe defendant to two concurrent 51-month terms of imprisonment.\n\nThis timely appeal followed.\n\n            Before us, the defendant advances two claims of error.\n\nFirst, he argues that his sentence on count 1 exceeds the statutory\n\nmaximum.        Second,   he   argues    that    the    court   below    erred   in\n\ndetermining      his   CHC.     Since    his    second    claim   requires   more\n\nanalysis, we start there.\n\n            The defendant's challenge to his CHC comprises an attack\n\non two of the district court's intermediate calculations.                 Because\n\nno part of this attack was adumbrated in the district court, the\n\ngovernment asserts that the defendant has waived these claims of\n\nerror.    For his part, the appellant concedes that these claims are\n\nunpreserved — he is raising them for the first time on appeal — but\n\nsays that they are forfeited, not waived.\n\n            The characterization question is not free from doubt.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Turbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d 34, 38 (1st\n\nCir.    2006)    (suggesting,    on     analogous      facts,   that    claims   of\n\nsentencing error were waived).            A party waives a right when he\n\nintentionally relinquishes or abandons it. United States v. Olano,\n\n507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993); United States v. Eisom, 585 F.3d 552, 556\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).       In contrast, a party who merely fails to make a\n\ntimely assertion of a right forfeits that right, but does not waive\n\nit.    United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThe distinction is consequential from the standpoint of possible\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fappellate review; \"a waived issue ordinarily cannot be resurrected\n\non appeal, whereas a forfeited issue may be reviewed for plain\n\nerror.\"    Id. (citations omitted).\n\n            It        is     not      necessary       for      us     to        decide        this\n\ncharacterization question here.                     The merits of the claims in\n\nquestion are easily dispatched, so it is unnecessary for us to\n\naddress the waiver issue head-on.                   Therefore, we assume, favorably\n\nto   the   defendant,         that     what     transpired          here    was    simply       a\n\nforfeiture.      This means, of course, that we may review the claims,\n\nbut only for plain error.              Under that standard, the defendant must\n\nshow \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and\n\nwhich not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but\n\nalso (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"                   United States v. Duarte, 246\n\nF.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            The       defendant       assigns       error   to       the    lower      court's\n\ncompilation      of    his        criminal    history    score.           The    nub     of   his\n\ncomplaint is that the court counted the two sentences arising out\n\nof   the   October         2003    incident    separately.           In    his     view,      the\n\nunderlying charges were \"related cases\" and, thus, should have been\n\ntreated as a single unit (carrying fewer criminal history points).\n\n            This       argument       fails.         Without     objection,         both       the\n\nprobation officer and the district court used the November 2007\n\nedition of the guidelines for all purposes relevant to sentencing.\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fEven on appeal, no one has suggested that some other edition of the\n\nguidelines should have been employed.\n\n           In   all    events,   the    November        2007    edition    of   the\n\nguidelines plainly applies here. Unless doing so would cause an ex\n\npost facto problem, a sentencing court should use the version of\n\nthe guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing.                See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii); USSG §1B1.11(a); United States v. Silva, 554\n\nF.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 2009); United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d\n\n1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).          The district court sentenced the\n\ndefendant on September 26, 2008, for offenses that arose out of\n\nevents that occurred on March 25, 2008.           The November 2007 edition\n\nof the guidelines was in force on both dates.                  A fortiori, using\n\nthat version of the guidelines did not pose an ex post facto\n\nproblem.\n\n           These    guidelines    instruct       that    when    multiple    prior\n\nsentences are in play, separate sentences sometimes may be counted\n\nas a unit for the purpose of calculating a defendant's criminal\n\nhistory score.        See USSG §4A1.2(a).         But in that regard, the\n\nguidelines   make     no   reference   to    a   \"related      cases\"     standard.\n\nInstead, they provide in pertinent part that:\n\n           . . . prior sentences are counted separately\n           unless (A) the sentences resulted from\n           offenses contained in the same charging\n           instrument; or (B) the sentences were imposed\n           on the same day.    Count any prior sentence\n           covered by (A) or (B) as a single sentence.\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fUSSG §4A1.2(a)(2).       Under this standard, whether or not the prior\n\nconvictions are \"related\" is irrelevant.3\n\n            In    this   case,   the   record   makes   manifest   that   the\n\nchallenged convictions were not for offenses described in the same\n\ncharging document, nor were the sentences for them imposed on the\n\nsame day.        Thus, the district court correctly counted the two\n\nconvictions as separate offenses for the purpose of tabulating the\n\ndefendant's criminal history score.\n\n            The defendant has a fallback position.          He argues that\n\nthe district court blundered by awarding three criminal history\n\npoints for the misprision of felony sentence and that, therefore,\n\nthe sentence on count 2 must be vacated.          His premise is correct,\n\nbut the conclusion that he reaches is not.\n\n            The district court erred in assigning three criminal\n\nhistory points to this sentence.         The sentence for the misprision\n\nof felony conviction was for one year and one day.          Thus, only two\n\npoints should have been assigned for that sentence.                See USSG\n\n§4A1.1(a) (requiring three criminal history points be added for\n\nsentences \"exceeding one year and one month\"); id. §4A1.1(b)\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      A \"related cases\" provision was contained in the immediately\npreceding edition of the guidelines: whether convictions were\ncounted separately turned, in some circumstances, on whether the\ncases were \"related.\" See USSG §4A1.2 (2006). But this provision\nwas deleted in 2007, see USSG Supp. to App. C, amend. 709 (2007),\nand it has no bearing here.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f(requiring two criminal history points be added for sentences of at\n\nleast 60 days).\n\n             Although the defendant is correct in insisting that the\n\ncourt should have assigned two, not three, criminal history points\n\nfor   this   sentence,     the   error   was   harmless.       Subtracting   one\n\ncriminal history point would not have shifted the defendant into a\n\ndifferent     CHC   and,    thus,   would      not    have   changed   the   GSR.\n\nConsequently, the counting error did not impugn the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights.        See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a); United States v.\n\nJimenez, 512 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007).              It follows that this claim\n\ncannot survive scrutiny under the third prong of the test for plain\n\nerror.    The sentence imposed on count 2 must stand.\n\n             This leaves the defendant's sentence on count 1.                  He\n\nmaintains that this sentence exceeds the statutory maximum.                    We\n\nagree.\n\n             The facts are these.           With respect to count 1, the\n\ndefendant pleaded guilty to violating 8 U.S.C. § 1325.                       The\n\ndistrict court sentenced him to 51 months' imprisonment.                      The\n\nconviction, however, is for a first offense and, thus, is subject\n\nto a six-month maximum term of imprisonment.4                    See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1325(a).    Thus, the sentence imposed on count 1 was in excess of\n\nthe statutory maximum.           We deem that error plain, and find the\n\n\n      4\n       Although the PSI Report described the maximum term of\nimprisonment as two years for the section 1325 offense, that\nmaximum is only available for a subsequent section 1325 conviction.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fremaining elements of the plain error test satisfied.          See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Hilario-Hilario, 529 F.3d 65, 76 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            This   does   not   mean,   however,   that   resentencing   is\n\nrequired.     The reduction of a sentence to conform to a statutory\n\nmaximum ordinarily may be accomplished without a new sentencing\n\nhearing.    See, e.g., United States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 178\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).     In this case, an instruction to the sentencing\n\ncourt is all that is needed to repair the defect.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the sentence on count 2.         However, we remand count 1,\n\nwith directions to the district court to amend that sentence to a\n\nsentence of six months' imprisonment, to run concurrently with the\n\nsentence imposed on count 2.       As amended, the sentence on count 1\n\nis also affirmed.\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

Defendant-appellant Amado De La Rosa-Ramos\n\npleaded guilty to charges involving his attempted illegal reentry\n\ninto the United States.

On March 25, 2008,\n\nPuerto Rico maritime police called the U.S. Border Patrol to a\n\nlocus roughly 200 yards off the coast of Parque de Colón.     Upon\n\narrival, the border patrol agents observed a number of persons\n\njumping from a detained vessel into the surrounding waters.    The\n\nagents apprehended the defendant and thirteen other individuals.\n\n          In due course, a federal grand jury handed up a two-count\n\nindictment against four persons.       The indictment charged the\n\ndefendant with plotting to effect his own illegal entry and aiding\n\nand abetting the illegal entry of others, in violation of 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1325(a)(1) (count 1), and attempted reentry into the United\n\nStates without proper authorization after having been deported\n\nfollowing the commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1326(a)(2), (b)(2) (count 2).   The defendant entered a\n\nstraight guilty plea to both counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f            A probation officer proceeded to prepare the PSI Report.\n\nUsing the November 2007 edition of the guidelines manual, she\n\ngrouped the counts of conviction because they arose out of the same\n\nplan, scheme, or course of conduct.         See USSG §3D1.2(b).        Inasmuch\n\nas count 2 carried the higher total offense level — 21 — the\n\nprobation officer used it to calculate the guideline sentencing\n\nrange (GSR).1     See id. §3D1.3(a).\n\n            To   complete   this    calculation,    the   probation     officer\n\nneeded to determine the defendant's criminal history category\n\n(CHC).    Because certain details of the defendant's criminal record\n\nare   pertinent   to   an   issue    on   appeal,   we    note   the   relevant\n\nparticulars.\n\n            The first conviction with which we are concerned led to\n\nsentencing by a local Puerto Rico court on November 27, 1995.               The\n\ncharges were for aggravated assault and related weapons violations.\n\nThe Puerto Rico court imposed a two-year prison sentence.               The PSI\n\nReport assigned three criminal history points in respect to this\n\nsentence.    See id. §4A1.1(a).      Following service of this sentence,\n\nthe government deported the defendant.2\n\n\n      1\n       This total offense level resulted from a base offense level\nof 8, see USSG §2L1.2, plus 16 levels because the defendant's\nearlier deportation followed his conviction for a crime of\nviolence, see id. §2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), less 3 levels for acceptance\nof responsibility, see id. §3E1.1.\n      2\n       At sentencing in the instant case, the parties disagreed\nabout the date of deportation. We need not resolve this dispute as\nthe exact date is immaterial to the issues presented on appeal.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           The defendant's other brushes with the law arose out of\n\nactivities that led to his arrest by the Coast Guard on or about\n\nOctober 25, 2003.    This arrest followed the Coast Guard's seizure\n\nof a wooden yawl off the coast of San Juan.        Federal authorities\n\ndetained   several    persons   (including   the   defendant).    They\n\nsubsequently charged the defendant with illegal reentry into the\n\nUnited States after having been deported for commission of an\n\naggravated felony.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2).\n\n           The defendant entered a guilty plea on July 20, 2004, and\n\na federal judge sentenced him to 41 months in prison (subsequently\n\nreduced to 30 months) and three years of supervised release.       The\n\nPSI Report assigned three criminal history points to this sentence.\n\nSee USSG §4A1.1(a).\n\n           On March 24, 2004, the defendant (along with other\n\npersons arrested on October 25, 2003) was charged with smuggling\n\nand harboring illegal aliens.       As part of a plea bargain, the\n\ngovernment later dropped these charges and, instead, filed an\n\ninformation that charged the defendant with misprision of a felony.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 4.    On June 9, 2005, the defendant entered a guilty\n\nplea to this charge.      The court sentenced him the same day to\n\ntwelve months and one day in prison, to run concurrently with the\n\nunserved portion of his 41-month sentence (described above).       The\n\nPSI Report assigned three criminal history points to this sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fSee USSG §4A1.1.    After his release, the government again deported\n\nthe defendant.\n\n          In addition to the foregoing, the PSI Report assigned two\n\npoints because the defendant committed the offenses of conviction\n\n(that is, the offenses underlying this appeal) while serving a term\n\nof supervised release.      See id. §4A1.1(d).\n\n          In the aggregate, these allocations produced a total of\n\neleven criminal history points, which placed the defendant in CHC\n\nV.   See id. Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).            As a further data\n\npoint, the PSI Report noted that the statutory maximum sentences\n\nfor the offenses of conviction were two years for count 1 and\n\ntwenty years for count 2.\n\n          Neither side filed objections to the PSI Report.               See\n\nD.P.R.R. 132(b)(3).       At the disposition hearing, however, the\n\ndefendant disputed certain dates, see, e.g., supra note 2, and\n\nsought   to   \"clarify\"    his   prior    convictions.       Despite    this\n\nclarification,     the    sentencing     court   ruled   that   the    prior\n\nconvictions were appropriately scored in the PSI Report. Then, the\n\ncourt cited a variety of mitigating factors and adjusted the\n\ndefendant's total offense level downward by three levels (to 18).\n\nAccepting all the other recommendations contained in the PSI Report\n\nand retaining the defendant's classification in CHC V, the court\n\ncomputed the GSR at 51-63 months.          The government recommended a\n\nsentence at the low end of the GSR.        The court obliged, sentencing\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe defendant to two concurrent 51-month terms of imprisonment.\n\nThis timely appeal followed.\n\n            Before us, the defendant advances two claims of error.\n\nFirst, he argues that his sentence on count 1 exceeds the statutory\n\nmaximum.        Second,   he   argues    that    the    court   below    erred   in\n\ndetermining      his   CHC.     Since    his    second    claim   requires   more\n\nanalysis, we start there.\n\n            The defendant's challenge to his CHC comprises an attack\n\non two of the district court's intermediate calculations.                 Because\n\nno part of this attack was adumbrated in the district court, the\n\ngovernment asserts that the defendant has waived these claims of\n\nerror.    For his part, the appellant concedes that these claims are\n\nunpreserved — he is raising them for the first time on appeal — but\n\nsays that they are forfeited, not waived.\n\n            The characterization question is not free from doubt.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Turbides-Leonardo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202495\"><a href=\"/opinion/202495/united-states-v-turbides-leonardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (1st\n\nCir.    2006)    (suggesting,    on     analogous      facts,   that    claims   of\n\nsentencing error were waived).

The merits of the claims in\n\nquestion are easily dispatched, so it is unnecessary for us to\n\naddress the waiver issue head-on.                   Therefore, we assume, favorably\n\nto   the   defendant,         that     what     transpired          here    was    simply       a\n\nforfeiture.      This means, of course, that we may review the claims,\n\nbut only for plain error.              Under that standard, the defendant must\n\nshow \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and\n\nwhich not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but\n\nalso (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"                   United States v.

The    nub     of   his\n\ncomplaint is that the court counted the two sentences arising out\n\nof   the   October         2003    incident    separately.           In    his     view,      the\n\nunderlying charges were \"related cases\" and, thus, should have been\n\ntreated as a single unit (carrying fewer criminal history points).\n\n            This       argument       fails.         Without     objection,         both       the\n\nprobation officer and the district court used the November 2007\n\nedition of the guidelines for all purposes relevant to sentencing.\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fEven on appeal, no one has suggested that some other edition of the\n\nguidelines should have been employed.\n\n           In   all    events,   the    November        2007    edition    of   the\n\nguidelines plainly applies here. Unless doing so would cause an ex\n\npost facto problem, a sentencing court should use the version of\n\nthe guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing.                See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii); USSG §1B1.11(a); United States v.

The district court sentenced the\n\ndefendant on September 26, 2008, for offenses that arose out of\n\nevents that occurred on March 25, 2008.           The November 2007 edition\n\nof the guidelines was in force on both dates.                  A fortiori, using\n\nthat version of the guidelines did not pose an ex post facto\n\nproblem.\n\n           These    guidelines    instruct       that    when    multiple    prior\n\nsentences are in play, separate sentences sometimes may be counted\n\nas a unit for the purpose of calculating a defendant's criminal\n\nhistory score.        See USSG §4A1.2(a).         But in that regard, the\n\nguidelines   make     no   reference   to    a   \"related      cases\"     standard.\n\nInstead, they provide in pertinent part that:\n\n           . . . prior sentences are counted separately\n           unless (A) the sentences resulted from\n           offenses contained in the same charging\n           instrument; or (B) the sentences were imposed\n           on the same day.    Count any prior sentence\n           covered by (A) or (B) as a single sentence.\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fUSSG §4A1.2(a)(2).       Under this standard, whether or not the prior\n\nconvictions are \"related\" is irrelevant.3\n\n            In    this   case,   the   record   makes   manifest   that   the\n\nchallenged convictions were not for offenses described in the same\n\ncharging document, nor were the sentences for them imposed on the\n\nsame day.        Thus, the district court correctly counted the two\n\nconvictions as separate offenses for the purpose of tabulating the\n\ndefendant's criminal history score.\n\n            The defendant has a fallback position.          He argues that\n\nthe district court blundered by awarding three criminal history\n\npoints for the misprision of felony sentence and that, therefore,\n\nthe sentence on count 2 must be vacated.          His premise is correct,\n\nbut the conclusion that he reaches is not.\n\n            The district court erred in assigning three criminal\n\nhistory points to this sentence.         The sentence for the misprision\n\nof felony conviction was for one year and one day.          Thus, only two\n\npoints should have been assigned for that sentence.                See USSG\n\n§4A1.1(a) (requiring three criminal history points be added for\n\nsentences \"exceeding one year and one month\"); id. §4A1.1(b)\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      A \"related cases\" provision was contained in the immediately\npreceding edition of the guidelines: whether convictions were\ncounted separately turned, in some circumstances, on whether the\ncases were \"related.\" See USSG §4A1.2 (2006). But this provision\nwas deleted in 2007, see USSG Supp. to App. C, amend. 709 (2007),\nand it has no bearing here.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f(requiring two criminal history points be added for sentences of at\n\nleast 60 days).\n\n             Although the defendant is correct in insisting that the\n\ncourt should have assigned two, not three, criminal history points\n\nfor   this   sentence,     the   error   was   harmless.       Subtracting   one\n\ncriminal history point would not have shifted the defendant into a\n\ndifferent     CHC   and,    thus,   would      not    have   changed   the   GSR.\n\nConsequently, the counting error did not impugn the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights.        See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a); United States v.\n\nJimenez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203091\"><a href=\"/opinion/203091/united-states-v-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 2007).              It follows that this claim\n\ncannot survive scrutiny under the third prong of the test for plain\n\nerror.    The sentence imposed on count 2 must stand.\n\n             This leaves the defendant's sentence on count 1.                  He\n\nmaintains that this sentence exceeds the statutory maximum.                    We\n\nagree.\n\n             The facts are these.           With respect to count 1, the\n\ndefendant pleaded guilty to violating 8 U.S.C. § 1325.                       The\n\ndistrict court sentenced him to 51 months' imprisonment.                      The\n\nconviction, however, is for a first offense and, thus, is subject\n\nto a six-month maximum term of imprisonment.4                    See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1325(a).    Thus, the sentence imposed on count 1 was in excess of\n\nthe statutory maximum.           We deem that error plain, and find the\n\n\n      4\n       Although the PSI Report described the maximum term of\nimprisonment as two years for the section 1325 offense, that\nmaximum is only available for a subsequent section 1325 conviction.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fremaining elements of the plain error test satisfied.          See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Hilario-Hilario, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203342\"><a href=\"/opinion/203342/united-states-v-hilario-hilario/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            This   does   not   mean,   however,   that   resentencing   is\n\nrequired.     The reduction of a sentence to conform to a statutory\n\nmaximum ordinarily may be accomplished without a new sentencing\n\nhearing.    See, e.g., United States v. Barnes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199335\"><a href=\"/opinion/199335/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 178\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).     In this case, an instruction to the sentencing\n\ncourt is all that is needed to repair the defect.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the sentence on count 2.         However, we remand count 1,\n\nwith directions to the district court to amend that sentence to a\n\nsentence of six months' imprisonment, to run concurrently with the\n\nsentence imposed on count 2.       As amended, the sentence on count 1\n\nis also affirmed.\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f</pre>",
