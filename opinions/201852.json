Shepard De Mari on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and H.S. Garcia,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             October 14, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam.     Felix Santos-Rios appeals from his sentence\n\nimposed following a guilty plea to both counts of an indictment\n\ncharging him and three co-defendants with conspiracy to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine, and aiding and abetting each\n\nother to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. 846, 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. 2.              The district court\n\ngranted defendant's motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 on the\n\nground    that     trial   counsel   was    constitutionally    ineffective\n\nregarding her failure to pursue an appeal on Santos-Rios' behalf.\n\nThe district court's amended order in the § 2255 case vacated the\n\noriginal sentence and reimposed the same sentence nunc pro tunc,\n\nthereby restoring defendant's right to appeal.            This appeal was\n\ntimely filed from the reimposed sentence.\n\n            I. Failure to Grant De Novo Sentencing\n\n            Santos-Rios argues that the procedure for reinstating his\n\nright to appeal, vacating and reimposing the original sentence\n\nwithout a hearing, violated his right to be present at sentencing.\n\nThe procedure employed by the district court \"is standard practice\n\namong federal courts.\" Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 62 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).      We specifically approved such a procedure in United\n\nStates v. Torres-Otero, 232 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 2000), holding\n\nunder    similar    circumstances    that   \"the   district   court   is   not\n\nrequired to engage in de novo resentencing, but may instead vacate\n\nthe initial sentence and summarily reimpose a sentencing judgment\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fidentical in all respect to the earlier judgment except for the\n\ndate of entry.\"         Defendant's right to be present was satisfied by\n\nSantos-Rios' presence when the original sentence was imposed, a\n\nsentence identical to the one that was subsequently reimposed. See\n\nUnited States v. De Los Santos-Himitola, 924 F.2d 380, 383 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n            II. Enhancement for Supervisory Role-in-the-Offense\n\n            Assuming, without deciding, that appellant raised the\n\nissue    below,    we    review   for   clear    error      the   district   court's\n\ndetermination that Santos-Rios had a supervisory role in the\n\noffense,    meriting       a   three-level     enhancement        under   U.S.S.G.   §\n\n3B1.1(b). See United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\"The government bears the burden of proving that the defendant\n\nqualifies for this enhancement.                 The evidence supporting the\n\ndefendant's role in the offense may be wholly circumstantial and\n\nthe   government        need   only   prove    that   the    defendant     exercised\n\nauthority or control over another person on one occasion.\"                    United\n\nStates v. Garcia-Morales, 382 F.3d 12, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Santos-Rios argues that the district court's role-in-the-\n\noffense enhancement was clearly erroneous because the sentencing\n\njudge did not make specific findings of fact to support his\n\nconclusion.       However, \"the district court need not make specific\n\nfindings when applying a role-in-the-offense enhancement if 'the\n\nrecord clearly reflects the basis of the court's determination.'\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fUnited States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 779 (1st Cir. 1998).\"\n\nId. at 20.\n\n             A three-level enhancement for a supervisory role is\n\nappropriate \"'if there is evidence that a defendant in committing\n\nthe crime, exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for\n\noverseeing the activities of at least one other person.'\"                  United\n\nStates v. Voccola, 99 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir. 1996).              The presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSR), to which defendant made no objections,\n\nreported that according to the co-defendants' statements, \"it was\n\n[Santos-Rios'] role to line up the individuals from the Port\n\nAuthority and provide them with instructions.\" PSR, ¶ 11.                  Santos-\n\nRios admits that he recruited persons employed at the airport to\n\nparticipate in the drug smuggling scheme.               This is sufficient to\n\nsupport a finding of a supervisory role in the offense. See e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding\n\nthat providing addresses to which package would be sent, recruiting\n\ntwo persons to receive falsely addressed packages and supervising\n\nthem   was   sufficient      to   support     finding   that   defendant    was   a\n\nsupervisor).\n\n             Santos-Rios' argument that co-defendant Carlos Polanco\n\nwas    the   real   leader   of   the   conspiracy      is   unavailing.     \"[A]\n\ndefendant need not be at the top of a criminal scheme to be a\n\nmanager or supervisor.\" United States v. Goldberg, 105 F.3d 770,\n\n777 (1st Cir. 1997).          The district court's determination that\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fSantos-Rios was a \"supervisor\" under §3B1.1(b) was not clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n            III. Blakely/Booker Error\n\n            Santos-Rios argues that he is entitled to resentencing\n\nunder Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), because the\n\ndetermination that he qualified as a \"supervisor\" under U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.1(b),    was   made   by   the   sentencing   judge,   not   by   a    jury.\n\n\"Blakely claims are now viewed through the lens of United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\" Cirilo-Munoz v. United States, 404\n\nF.3d 527, 532 (2005).          The Blakely claim, as viewed in light of\n\nBooker, is unavailing.           This court has held that \"the Sixth\n\nAmendment is not violated simply because a judge finds sentencing\n\nfacts under the guidelines; rather, the error is only that the\n\njudge did so pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system.\"                  United\n\nStates v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 152 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Santos-Rios also argues that he should be resentenced\n\nbecause the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to a\n\nmandatory guidelines system, in violation of Booker, supra. Having\n\nfailed to raise an Apprendi or Blakely claim below, or to challenge\n\nthe guidelines on Sixth Amendment grounds, Santos-Rios' claim is\n\nsubject to plain error review.          Specifically, he must show that\n\nthere is a \"reasonable probability that the district court would\n\nimpose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\" United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Santos-Rios offers no developed argument in support of\n\nsuch a claim, nor does the record support that claim.           He received\n\na   155-month   sentence,    four    months   above    the   bottom   of   the\n\nGuidelines sentencing range.         The comments of the sentencing court\n\nindicate that the court considered the long sentence that Santos-\n\nRios would receive under the Guidelines to be consistent with\n\nCongress' intent to deter participation in such drug trafficking\n\nconspiracies, and appropriate in view of the harm and suffering\n\nthat results from such drug trafficking.           Santos-Rios has not met\n\nhis burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that the court\n\nwould have imposed a more lenient sentence under an advisory\n\nGuidelines scheme.\n\n           IV. Conditions of Supervised Release\n\n           Santos-Rios      claims    that   the   drug   testing   and    drug\n\ntreatment conditions of his supervised release violated his right\n\nto be present at sentencing and constituted an improper delegation\n\nof authority to the probation officer.                See Melendez-Santana,\n\nsupra.   As in Melendez-Santana, the district court's failure at\n\nSantos-Rios' sentencing hearing \"to announce the drug treatment\n\ncondition . . . created a material conflict between the written and\n\noral sentencing orders. . . . This procedure violated [defendant's]\n\nright to be present at sentencing.\" Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f100.       As in that case, the drug treatment condition imposed here\n\nmust be deleted from the written judgment.1\n\n              As   the   government   concedes,   the   sentencing   court\n\nimproperly delegated to the probation officer the authority to\n\ndetermine the number of drug tests he would be subject to.            See\n\nMelendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 101-06.        Because Santos-Rios did not\n\nobject to the delegation at sentencing, however, plain error review\n\napplies.      See United States v.    Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 220 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). And Santos-Rios has failed to demonstrate that the improper\n\ndelegation to the probation officer of authority to determine the\n\nnumber of drug tests can satisfy the third or fourth elements of\n\nthe plain error test.      See id. at 224.    Therefore, the drug testing\n\nconditions of supervised release withstand appellant's challenge.\n\n              We remand with directions to the district court to delete\n\nthe drug treatment requirement from the written conditions of\n\nsupervised release.         In all other respects, the judgment and\n\nsentence are affirmed.       See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       Appellant's argument that his right to be present was also\nviolated by the failure of the district court to announce the drug\ntesting condition at the sentencing hearing is unavailing. The\ncourt announced the drug testing condition at sentencing.\nMoreover, even if it had not, Santos-Rios had constructive notice\nof that condition. See United States v. Tulloch, 380 F.3d 8, 13 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                      -7-\n\f",

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201547\"><a href=\"/opinion/201547/cirilo-munoz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 532 (2005).          The Blakely claim, as viewed in light of\n\nBooker, is unavailing.           This court has held that \"the Sixth\n\nAmendment is not violated simply because a judge finds sentencing\n\nfacts under the guidelines; rather, the error is only that the\n\njudge did so pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system.\"                  United\n\nStates v. Martins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201656\"><a href=\"/opinion/201656/united-states-v-martins/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Santos-Rios also argues that he should be resentenced\n\nbecause the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to a\n\nmandatory guidelines system, in violation of Booker, supra. Having\n\nfailed to raise an Apprendi or Blakely claim below, or to challenge\n\nthe guidelines on Sixth Amendment grounds, Santos-Rios' claim is\n\nsubject to plain error review.          Specifically, he must show that\n\nthere is a \"reasonable probability that the district court would\n\nimpose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\" United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Santos-Rios offers no developed argument in support of\n\nsuch a claim, nor does the record support that claim.           He received\n\na   155-month   sentence,    four    months   above    the   bottom   of   the\n\nGuidelines sentencing range.         The comments of the sentencing court\n\nindicate that the court considered the long sentence that Santos-\n\nRios would receive under the Guidelines to be consistent with\n\nCongress' intent to deter participation in such drug trafficking\n\nconspiracies, and appropriate in view of the harm and suffering\n\nthat results from such drug trafficking.           Santos-Rios has not met\n\nhis burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that the court\n\nwould have imposed a more lenient sentence under an advisory\n\nGuidelines scheme.\n\n           IV. Conditions of Supervised Release\n\n           Santos-Rios      claims    that   the   drug   testing   and    drug\n\ntreatment conditions of his supervised release violated his right\n\nto be present at sentencing and constituted an improper delegation\n\nof authority to the probation officer.                See Melendez-Santana,\n\nsupra.   As in Melendez-Santana, the district court's failure at\n\nSantos-Rios' sentencing hearing \"to announce the drug treatment\n\ncondition . . . created a material conflict between the written and\n\noral sentencing orders. . . . This procedure violated [defendant's]\n\nright to be present at sentencing.\" Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f100.       As in that case, the drug treatment condition imposed here\n\nmust be deleted from the written judgment.1\n\n              As   the   government   concedes,   the   sentencing   court\n\nimproperly delegated to the probation officer the authority to\n\ndetermine the number of drug tests he would be subject to.            See\n\nMelendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 101-06.        Because Santos-Rios did not\n\nobject to the delegation at sentencing, however, plain error review\n\napplies.      See United States v.    Padilla, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201728\"><a href=\"/opinion/201728/united-states-v-padilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 220 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). And Santos-Rios has failed to demonstrate that the improper\n\ndelegation to the probation officer of authority to determine the\n\nnumber of drug tests can satisfy the third or fourth elements of\n\nthe plain error test.      See id. at 224.    Therefore, the drug testing\n\nconditions of supervised release withstand appellant's challenge.\n\n              We remand with directions to the district court to delete\n\nthe drug treatment requirement from the written conditions of\n\nsupervised release.         In all other respects, the judgment and\n\nsentence are affirmed.       See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       Appellant's argument that his right to be present was also\nviolated by the failure of the district court to announce the drug\ntesting condition at the sentencing hearing is unavailing. The\ncourt announced the drug testing condition at sentencing.\nMoreover, even if it had not, Santos-Rios had constructive notice\nof that condition. See United States v. Tulloch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201190\"><a href=\"/opinion/201190/united-states-v-tulloch/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                      -7-\n\f</pre>",
