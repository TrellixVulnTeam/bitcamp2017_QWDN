Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n                     and Fusté,* District Judge.\n\n\n     William L. Chapman, with whom Jennifer A. Eber and Orr & Reno,\nP.A., were on brief, for appellant.\n     Byrne J. Decker, with whom Pierce Atwood LLP was on brief, for\nappellees.\n\n\n                               June 29, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f            FUSTE, District Judge. Appellant Melvin Prostkoff, M.D.,\n\nfiled a petition against Appellees, Paul Revere Life Insurance\n\nCompany and its parent company, Unum Provident Corporation, seeking\n\ndeclaratory judgment that his insurance policy entitles him to cost\n\nof living increases on his disability benefits for the duration of\n\nhis life.    Appellant now appeals the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Appellees.            “We review a district\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment de novo, examining all the facts\n\nand making all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving\n\nparty.”   N.H. Ins. Co. v. Dagnone, 475 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Appellant argues that we should vacate the district\n\ncourt’s judgment and find that he is entitled to receive cost of\n\nliving increases on his disability payments for his lifetime because\n\nhis   insurance   policy   is   ambiguous   and   the   ambiguity      must   be\n\nconstrued in his favor. See Concord Hosp. v. N. H. Med. Malpractice\n\nJoint   Underwriting   Ass’n,    633   A.2d   1384,     1386   (N.H.    1993).\n\nSpecifically, Appellant alleges that, although the Cost of Living\n\nBenefit rider explicitly states that no increases in cost of living\n\nbenefits will be made after the insured’s sixty-fifth birthday, the\n\npolicy is ambiguous because of allegedly contradictory statements\n\ncontained in the Lifetime Benefit rider purchased by Appellant.\n\n            The Lifetime Benefit rider provides that policy holders\n\nwill continue to receive a monthly payment after age sixty-five.\n\nThe rider states that “[t]he monthly amount is the amount shown on\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fthe Policy Schedule. Any cost of living benefit rider added to your\n\npolicy shall apply to this amount.”       Appellant argues that this\n\nlanguage implies that the cost of living benefit should continue to\n\nincrease after he turns sixty-five, even though the Cost of Living\n\nBenefit rider explicitly states that it will not. Appellees counter\n\nthat the Lifetime Benefit rider states only that Appellant will\n\ncontinue to receive cost of living benefits after age sixty-five,\n\nbut not increases. In other words, the amount of the cost of living\n\nbenefits shall be frozen at the amount received by Appellant just\n\nprior to his sixty-fifth birthday, as stated in the Cost of Living\n\nBenefit rider.\n\n          We agree with Appellees and the district court that the\n\nlanguage in both the Lifetime Benefits rider and the Cost of Living\n\nBenefit rider is clear and unambiguous.    We, therefore, affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s decision to grant summary judgment to Appellees on\n\nthe grounds advanced by the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
