Marta      Carrasquillo,        an\n\nemployee      at      the   Puerto      Rico    Department        of    Corrections        and\n\nRehabilitation (the \"DCR\"), brought a civil rights action under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the DCR, and\n\nvarious    DCR      officials       (collectively,          \"Defendants\"),          alleging\n\npolitical discrimination in violation of the First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.        The United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants, a\n\ndecision Carrasquillo now appeals. After careful consideration, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                 I. Factual Background\n\n            The DCR hired Carrasquillo in 1992.                         In October 1994,\n\nCarrasquillo       was      promoted     to    Investigating        Agent      I,    and   was\n\nassigned   to      work     in    the   Intelligence         Unit      of   the     Auxiliary\n\nSecretariat for the Investigation of the Correctional System (the\n\n\"SAISC,\"   for        its   Spanish      acronym).          Between     1998      and   1999,\n\nCarrasquillo worked under the supervision of one of the defendants,\n\nNorberto Jiménez, an investigative agent in the SAISC.                              In March\n\n1999, Jiménez resigned from the DCR, and Carrasquillo took his\n\nplace as supervisor of the Intelligence Unit of the SAISC.\n\n            On September 7, 2000, Carrasquillo was again promoted,\n\nthis   time      to     Investigative         Agent    II    to     reflect       her   added\n\nsupervisory responsibilities. Among other duties, Carrasquillo was\n\nresponsible for disciplining employees and authorizing vacation\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\ftime,    sick    leave,   adjustments     to    time-keeping      records,    and\n\novertime.\n\n               In August 2003, Jiménez returned to the DCR after being\n\nappointed Special Assistant to the Secretary of the DCR.                Upon his\n\nreturn,    Jiménez     again   assumed    the    supervision     of   the    SAISC\n\nIntelligence Unit, thereby replacing Carrasquillo.\n\n               Carrasquillo alleges that, as supervisor of the SAISC\n\nintelligence unit, Jiménez took away many of the professional\n\nresponsibilities she had before his return to the unit.                       For\n\nexample, Carrasquillo alleges that Jiménez ordered her to perform\n\nclerical duties until he could hire a secretary.                She also claims\n\nthat he had her name removed from reports filed by investigative\n\nagents.    Carrasquillo states that she was generally not allowed to\n\nparticipate in field operations, and that when she was asked to\n\nparticipate in an operation, she was told to show up at an hour\n\nafter the operation had concluded.              She also alleges that after\n\nJiménez took over the supervision of the Intelligence Unit, there\n\nwere a number of days in which Carrasquillo was not given work\n\nassignments.\n\n               Carrasquillo further states that in April 2004, Jiménez\n\ntook    over    her   office   space.     She   claims   that    when   she   was\n\ntransferred to a new work area, she was asked to return several\n\nitems, including official license plates, a radio, a vest, keys to\n\na governmental vehicle, and a gas card for a governmental vehicle.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCarrasquillo alleges that she complained to Jiménez about the fact\n\nthat he had divested her of supervisory functions and assigned her\n\nmenial job tasks and told him that she felt marginalized, harassed,\n\nand discriminated against as a result. Carrasquillo also testified\n\nthat at some point, \"[Jiménez] called [her] into his office and\n\ntold [her] . . ., 'We are in power now -- meaning the members of\n\nthe Popular Democratic Party -- and I have the power to kick out of\n\nhere anybody I want.'\"\n\n           Although   Carrasquillo   alleges   that   her   professional\n\nduties and office location changed after Jiménez's return to the\n\nDCR, she admits that her job title and salary scale were not\n\naltered.   The record shows that the only change affecting her\n\nsalary was that after Jiménez replaced Carrasquillo as supervisor\n\nof SAISC, she became eligible for overtime pay, whereas she had not\n\nbeen entitled to such pay as supervisor.\n\n           Carrasquillo is a member of the New Progressive Party\n\n(\"NPP\") in Puerto Rico, while Jiménez is a member of the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (\"PDP\"). Carrasquillo claims that her affiliation\n\nand activism in the NPP were well known within the DCR because she\n\nwas listed in the party's roster, openly participated in political\n\ncampaigns, raised campaign funds for a mayor of Canóvanas, worked\n\nas an electoral officer, regularly attended NPP rallies, and worked\n\ntallying votes during election time. Carrasquillo further contends\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthat when she was replaced by Jiménez, she suffered a de facto\n\ndemotion on the basis of her membership in the NPP.\n\n              On June 10, 2004, Carrasquillo filed a complaint in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nalleging political discrimination in violation of the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments, age discrimination in violation of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"), and violation of\n\nvarious state law provisions.          On July 13, 2004, Defendants filed\n\na motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).\n\nBefore the district court addressed its Rule 12(c) motion, the DCR\n\nfiled a motion for summary judgment on September 16, 2005.\n\n              Carrasquillo did not respond to Defendants' Rule 12(c)\n\nmotion    within    the   time   prescribed.      Carrasquillo     sought    an\n\nextension to file the opposition, but on October 12, 2005, the\n\ndistrict court denied Carrasquillo's request as untimely and deemed\n\nDefendants' motion unopposed.             Thereafter, Carrasquillo timely\n\nfiled    an   opposition    to   Defendants'    summary   judgment   motion.\n\nHowever,      in   her   opposition,    Carrasquillo   did   not   provide    a\n\nstatement admitting, denying, or qualifying Defendants' statement\n\nof uncontested facts, as required by Local Rule 56(c).             See D.P.R.\n\nL. Civ. R. 56(c) (\"A party opposing a motion for summary judgment\n\nshall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise\n\nstatement of material facts.           The opposing statement shall admit,\n\ndeny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fof the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a\n\nfacts is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a\n\nrecord citation . . . .\").          Instead, Carrasquillo filed her own\n\nstatement of uncontested facts, which did not reference or relate\n\nto Defendants' filing.\n\n           On March 29, 2006, the court granted in part and denied\n\nin part Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.                 The\n\ncourt dismissed Carrasquillo's ADEA claim for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies. In addition, upon finding that the DCR is\n\nan arm of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and no indication that\n\nPuerto Rico has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, the court\n\nalso   dismissed   all    claims    for    monetary   damages   against    the\n\nCommonwealth, the DCR, and the individual defendants in their\n\nofficial capacities.      Carrasquillo's First Amendment, Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, and supplemental claims survived the early dismissal.\n\nOnly Jiménez, who was sued in his personal capacity, remained as a\n\ndefendant.\n\n           On July 31, 2006, the court granted Jiménez's request for\n\nsummary judgment.   The court found that Carrasquillo had failed to\n\nspecifically   deny,     qualify,   or    otherwise   object    to   Jiménez's\n\nstatement of uncontested facts in her opposition, as was required\n\nby Local Rule 56(c).         The court concluded that, under these\n\ncircumstances, the facts submitted by Jiménez, including sworn\n\naffidavits stating that Jiménez did not know about Carrasquillo's\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fpolitical affiliation, were to be deemed uncontested, and therefore\n\nadmitted by Carrasquillo.               The court held that, having failed to\n\nrebut     the   assertion        that     Jiménez   lacked       any    knowledge     of\n\nCarrasquillo's         political      affiliation,     Carrasquillo        could    not\n\nestablish a prima facie case of political discrimination.\n\n            The district court went on to hold that Carrasquillo's\n\npolitical discrimination claim failed even if it were to consider\n\nher   nonconforming       supplemental       statement      of   uncontested       facts\n\nbecause     her       factual    assertions       \"[were]     not      sufficient     to\n\ndemonstrate       a   causal    connection       linking    Defendants'     allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory         acts     to   Carrasquillo's        political      beliefs    or\n\nassociation.\"\n\n                                     II. Discussion\n\n            We review the district court's order granting summary\n\njudgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable\n\nto the nonmoving party, with all reasonable inferences drawn in her\n\nfavor.     See Rodríguez v. SmithKline Beecham, 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n            The right to associate with the political party of one's\n\nchoice is an integral part of the basic constitutional freedom to\n\nassociate with others for the common advancement of political\n\nbeliefs and ideas protected by the First Amendment.                        Kusper v.\n\nPontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 56-57 (1973).                 Public employees therefore\n\ngenerally enjoy protection from adverse employment actions based on\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\ftheir political affiliations.   See Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507,\n\n517-19 (1980).   This protection extends to changes in employment,\n\nwhich, although not as extreme as dismissal, result in working\n\nconditions \"'unreasonably inferior' to the norm for the position\"\n\nat issue. Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1218\n\n(1st Cir. 1989). To prevail on a claim of political discrimination,\n\na public employee must at a minimum show that she engaged in\n\nconstitutionally-protected conduct and that this conduct was a\n\nsubstantial factor in the adverse employment decision.      See Mt.\n\nHealthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287\n\n(1977); see also Padilla-García v. Guillermo Rodríguez, 212 F.3d\n\n69, 73 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment in Jiménez's\n\nfavor on the ground that Carrasquillo failed to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of political discrimination.      Noting Carrasquillo's\n\nfailure to dispute Jiménez's statement of uncontested facts, the\n\ndistrict court held that Jiménez's facts, including his assertion\n\nthat he lacked knowledge of Carrasquillo's political affiliation,\n\nwere admitted.   See Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (\"[N]oncompliance with [Local Rule 56(c)], as manifested by\n\na failure to present a statement of disputed facts, embroidered\n\nwith specific citations to the record, justifies the court's\n\ndeeming the facts presented in the movant's statement of undisputed\n\nfacts admitted and ruling accordingly.\").    As such, the district\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fcourt held that \"Carrasquillo . . . failed to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of political discrimination because she [did] not\n\nproduce[] sufficient evidence demonstrating that any defendant knew\n\nof her political affiliation.\"\n\n          On appeal, Carrasquillo does not address the district\n\ncourt's decision to deem Jiménez's submitted fact that he did not\n\nknow Carrasquillo's political affiliation admitted, much less argue\n\nthat this holding was in error. Because Carrasquillo has failed to\n\nappeal this ruling, we deem the issue waived and accept Jiménez's\n\nsubmitted fact as true.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that arguments not raised on appeal are\n\ndeemed waived); see also Rivera-Gómez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631,\n\n635 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation 'to spell out\n\nits arguments squarely and distinctly,' or else forever hold its\n\npeace.\" (quoting Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec.\n\nCo., 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir. 1988))).   As such, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's holding that Carrasquillo failed to establish a\n\nprima facie case of political discrimination given Jiménez's lack\n\nof knowledge of Carrasquillo's political affiliation; if Jiménez\n\ndid not know Carrasquillo's political views, they could not have\n\nbeen a substantial factor motivating any adverse employment action.\n\n          Because we affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nCarrasquillo's political discrimination claim on its merits, we\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fneed not reach her argument that defendants are not entitled to\n\nsovereign or qualified immunity.\n\n                           III. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's   dismissal   of    Carrasquillo's   claim   of   political\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants, a decision Carrasquillo now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Factual Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The DCR hired Carrasquillo in 1992. In October 1994, Carrasquillo was promoted to Investigating Agent I, and was assigned to work in the Intelligence Unit of the Auxiliary Secretariat for the Investigation of the Correctional System (the \"SAISC,\" for its Spanish acronym). Between 1998 and 1999, Carrasquillo worked under the supervision of one of the defendants, Norberto Jiménez, an investigative agent in the SAISC. In March 1999, Jiménez resigned from the DCR, and Carrasquillo took his place as supervisor of the Intelligence Unit of the SAISC.</p>\n<p>On September 7, 2000, Carrasquillo was again promoted, this time to Investigative Agent II to reflect her added supervisory responsibilities. Among other duties, Carrasquillo was responsible for disciplining employees and authorizing vacation time, sick leave, adjustments to time-keeping records, and overtime.</p>\n<p>In August 2003, Jiménez returned to the DCR after being appointed Special Assistant to the Secretary of the DCR. Upon his return, Jiménez again assumed the supervision of the SAISC Intelligence Unit, thereby replacing Carrasquillo.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo alleges that, as supervisor of the SAISC intelligence unit, Jiménez took away many of the professional responsibilities she had before his return to the unit. For example, Carrasquillo alleges that Jiménez ordered her to perform clerical duties until he could hire a secretary. She also claims that he had her name removed from reports filed by investigative agents. Carrasquillo states that she was generally not allowed to participate in field operations, and that when she was asked to participate in an operation, she was told to show up at an hour after the operation had concluded. She also alleges that after Jiménez took over the supervision of the Intelligence Unit, there were a number of days in which Carrasquillo was not given work assignments.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo further states that in April 2004, Jiménez took over her office space. She claims that when she was transferred to a new work area, she was asked to return several items, including official license plates, a radio, a vest, keys to a governmental vehicle, and a gas card for a governmental vehicle. Carrasquillo alleges that she complained to Jiménez about the fact that he had divested her of supervisory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> functions and assigned her menial job tasks and told him that she felt marginalized, harassed, and discriminated against as a result. Carrasquillo also testified that at some point, \"[Jiménez] called [her] into his office and told [her] . . ., `We are in power now  meaning the members of the Popular Democratic Party  and I have the power to kick out of here anybody I want.'\"</p>\n<p>Although Carrasquillo alleges that her professional duties and office location changed after Jiménez's return to the DCR, she admits that her job title and salary scale were not altered. The record shows that the only change affecting her salary was that after Jiménez replaced Carrasquillo as supervisor of SAISC, she became eligible for overtime pay, whereas she had not been entitled to such pay as supervisor.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo is a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") in Puerto Rico, while Jiménez is a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"). Carrasquillo claims that her affiliation and activism in the NPP were well known within the DCR because she was listed in the party's roster, openly participated in political campaigns, raised campaign funds for a mayor of Canóvanas, worked as an electoral officer, regularly attended NPP rallies, and worked tallying votes during election time. Carrasquillo further contends that when she was replaced by Jiménez, she suffered a de facto demotion on the basis of her membership in the NPP.</p>\n<p>On June 10, 2004, Carrasquillo filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico alleging political discrimination in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"), and violation of various state law provisions. On July 13, 2004, Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). Before the district court addressed its Rule 12(c) motion, the DCR filed a motion for summary judgment on September 16, 2005.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo did not respond to Defendants' Rule 12(c) motion within the time prescribed. Carrasquillo sought an extension to file the opposition, but on October 12, 2005, the district court denied Carrasquillo's request as untimely and deemed Defendants' motion unopposed. Thereafter, Carrasquillo timely filed an opposition to Defendants' summary judgment motion. However, in her opposition, Carrasquillo did not provide a statement admitting, denying, or qualifying Defendants' statement of uncontested facts, as required by Local Rule 56(c). <i>See</i> D.P.R.L. Civ. R. 56(c) (\"A party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts. The opposing statement shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation. . . .\").

The court dismissed Carrasquillo's ADEA claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In addition, upon finding that the DCR is an arm of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and no indication that Puerto Rico has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, the court also dismissed all claims for monetary damages against the Commonwealth, the DCR, and the individual defendants in their official capacities. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Carrasquillo's First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and supplemental claims survived the early dismissal.

The court found that Carrasquillo had failed to specifically deny, qualify, or otherwise object to Jiménez's statement of uncontested facts in her opposition, as was required by Local Rule 56(c). The court concluded that, under these circumstances, the facts submitted by Jiménez, including sworn affidavits stating that Jiménez did not know about Carrasquillo's political affiliation, were to be deemed uncontested, and therefore admitted by Carrasquillo. The court held that, having failed to rebut the assertion that Jiménez lacked any knowledge of Carrasquillo's political affiliation, Carrasquillo could not establish a prima facie case of political discrimination.</p>\n<p>The district court went on to hold that Carrasquillo's political discrimination claim failed even if it were to consider her nonconforming supplemental statement of uncontested facts because her factual assertions \"[were] not sufficient to demonstrate a causal connection linking Defendants' allegedly discriminatory acts to Carrasquillo's political beliefs or association.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's order granting summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, with all reasonable inferences drawn in her favor. <i>See </i><i>Rodríguez v.

The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants, a decision Carrasquillo now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Factual Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The DCR hired Carrasquillo in 1992. In October 1994, Carrasquillo was promoted to Investigating Agent I, and was assigned to work in the Intelligence Unit of the Auxiliary Secretariat for the Investigation of the Correctional System (the \"SAISC,\" for its Spanish acronym). Between 1998 and 1999, Carrasquillo worked under the supervision of one of the defendants, Norberto Jiménez, an investigative agent in the SAISC. In March 1999, Jiménez resigned from the DCR, and Carrasquillo took his place as supervisor of the Intelligence Unit of the SAISC.</p>\n<p>On September 7, 2000, Carrasquillo was again promoted, this time to Investigative Agent II to reflect her added supervisory responsibilities. Among other duties, Carrasquillo was responsible for disciplining employees and authorizing vacation time, sick leave, adjustments to time-keeping records, and overtime.</p>\n<p>In August 2003, Jiménez returned to the DCR after being appointed Special Assistant to the Secretary of the DCR. Upon his return, Jiménez again assumed the supervision of the SAISC Intelligence Unit, thereby replacing Carrasquillo.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo alleges that, as supervisor of the SAISC intelligence unit, Jiménez took away many of the professional responsibilities she had before his return to the unit. For example, Carrasquillo alleges that Jiménez ordered her to perform clerical duties until he could hire a secretary. She also claims that he had her name removed from reports filed by investigative agents. Carrasquillo states that she was generally not allowed to participate in field operations, and that when she was asked to participate in an operation, she was told to show up at an hour after the operation had concluded. She also alleges that after Jiménez took over the supervision of the Intelligence Unit, there were a number of days in which Carrasquillo was not given work assignments.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo further states that in April 2004, Jiménez took over her office space. She claims that when she was transferred to a new work area, she was asked to return several items, including official license plates, a radio, a vest, keys to a governmental vehicle, and a gas card for a governmental vehicle. Carrasquillo alleges that she complained to Jiménez about the fact that he had divested her of supervisory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> functions and assigned her menial job tasks and told him that she felt marginalized, harassed, and discriminated against as a result. Carrasquillo also testified that at some point, \"[Jiménez] called [her] into his office and told [her] . . ., `We are in power now  meaning the members of the Popular Democratic Party  and I have the power to kick out of here anybody I want.'\"</p>\n<p>Although Carrasquillo alleges that her professional duties and office location changed after Jiménez's return to the DCR, she admits that her job title and salary scale were not altered. The record shows that the only change affecting her salary was that after Jiménez replaced Carrasquillo as supervisor of SAISC, she became eligible for overtime pay, whereas she had not been entitled to such pay as supervisor.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo is a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") in Puerto Rico, while Jiménez is a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"). Carrasquillo claims that her affiliation and activism in the NPP were well known within the DCR because she was listed in the party's roster, openly participated in political campaigns, raised campaign funds for a mayor of Canóvanas, worked as an electoral officer, regularly attended NPP rallies, and worked tallying votes during election time. Carrasquillo further contends that when she was replaced by Jiménez, she suffered a de facto demotion on the basis of her membership in the NPP.</p>\n<p>On June 10, 2004, Carrasquillo filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico alleging political discrimination in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"), and violation of various state law provisions. On July 13, 2004, Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). Before the district court addressed its Rule 12(c) motion, the DCR filed a motion for summary judgment on September 16, 2005.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo did not respond to Defendants' Rule 12(c) motion within the time prescribed. Carrasquillo sought an extension to file the opposition, but on October 12, 2005, the district court denied Carrasquillo's request as untimely and deemed Defendants' motion unopposed. Thereafter, Carrasquillo timely filed an opposition to Defendants' summary judgment motion. However, in her opposition, Carrasquillo did not provide a statement admitting, denying, or qualifying Defendants' statement of uncontested facts, as required by Local Rule 56(c). <i>See</i> D.P.R.L. Civ. R. 56(c) (\"A party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts. The opposing statement shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation. . . .\"). Instead, Carrasquillo filed her own statement of uncontested facts, which did not reference or relate to Defendants' filing.</p>\n<p>On March 29, 2006, the court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court dismissed Carrasquillo's ADEA claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In addition, upon finding that the DCR is an arm of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and no indication that Puerto Rico has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, the court also dismissed all claims for monetary damages against the Commonwealth, the DCR, and the individual defendants in their official capacities. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Carrasquillo's First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and supplemental claims survived the early dismissal. Only Jiménez, who was sued in his personal capacity, remained as a defendant.</p>\n<p>On July 31, 2006, the court granted Jiménez's request for summary judgment.
