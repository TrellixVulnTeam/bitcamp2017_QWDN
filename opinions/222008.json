Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Boudin, Stahl and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jeanne M. Kempthorne for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Thomas E. Delahanty II, United States Attorney, was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 27, 2011\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge. In December 2008, a grand jury in\n\nthe District of Maine charged Michael Berk with two counts of\n\nattempting to entice a minor to engage in sexual conduct and one\n\ncount of possession of child pornography.        Berk pled guilty to the\n\npornography   charge,   and     he   was   convicted    of   the    two     child\n\nenticement charges after a bench trial.          He was sentenced to 200\n\nmonths in prison.   Two claims are pressed on appeal.              First, Berk\n\nargues that the indictment was defective because it lacked an\n\nelement of the crime charged.        Second, he argues that the evidence\n\npresented at trial was legally insufficient to convict him.                   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           The facts, though disturbing, are not greatly disputed.\n\nRegardless,   because    Berk    challenges    the     sufficiency     of    the\n\nevidence, we recount them in some detail, and in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict.       United States v. Dwinells, 508 F.3d 63,\n\n65 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nA.   Ashley Dame\n\n           On the morning of August 28, 2008, police in Biddeford,\n\nMaine received a complaint from twenty-three year old handyman\n\nAshley Dame, then a father of four living in Biddeford.                     Dame\n\nrecounted the following chain of events.        Earlier that day, he had\n\nsolicited employment on Craigslist, the internet-based classified\n\nadvertisement service.    The ad he posted read:\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           looking for small odd jobs I am a father of 4\n           currently out of work looking for the\n           following yard maint, drywalling, painting,\n           firewood cutting splitting and stacking or\n           anything else u may have for me willing to\n           barter or accept cash I have referances and\n           reasonable rates or tell me what ya got for me\n           to do and what u are willing to barter for the\n           work to get done plz be in the biddeford saco\n           oob [presumably Old Orchard Beach] area thanks\n           and hope to meet u soon.\n\n           Soon after, Dame received an email from the address\n\n\"mbmathy@yahoo.com\" (\"mbmathy\") inquiring \"How old are the kids?\n\nWill you rent any of them out?\"1   Dame replied that his children's\n\nyoung age was why he was looking for work, and that he \"didn't put\n\nthem on here to do it.\"   A few minutes later, mbmathy wrote, \"Yeah,\n\nI didn't know how young so I thought I'd ask if you would consider\n\nmaking money that way -- thanks for the response.\"    This exchange\n\nensued2:\n\n           Dame (11:26 AM): what do you mean rent them\n           out?\n\n           mbmathy (11:28 AM): Well how old are they? If\n           they're too young to do anything it doesn't\n           matter anyway :)\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      When a listing is posted on Craigslist, an anonymous email\naddress appears with the ad.      Responses are automatically re-\ndirected to an email address specified by the individual posting\nthe ad, who can then choose to break the anonymity by responding.\nPrintouts of the emails discussed herein were entered into evidence\nat trial.\n     2\n      Given the general informality of the electronic communication\nat issue, we reproduce verbatim the text of the exchange.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f        Dame (11:30 AM): yeah they are too young for\n        that u do mean like work and whatnot right?if\n        u have anything i will do it.\n\n        mbmathy (11:31 AM): it depends -- how old are\n        they? Boys or girls?\n\n        Dame (11:32 AM): have a 12 yr old daughter\n        and my sons are younger3\n\n        mbmathy (11:40 AM): OK and you say you don't\n        want her doing anything for cash, only you?\n\n        Dame (11:41 AM): yeah i am looking for what i\n        said odd jobs such as painting yard maint\n        cutting and splitting wood etc maybe other\n        things let me know what u have\n\n        mbmathy (11:43 AM):     Paid oral training is\n        what I'm looking for, stuff along those lines.\n        It pays a lot more than regular odd jobs but\n        as you know it isn't for everyone.\n\n        Dame (11:43 AM):     what   is it   that   u   are\n        talking about?\n\n        mbmathy (11:47 AM): It's worth a lot of money\n        to me to be able to train a girl how to give\n        head, or anything along those lines (I'm\n        flexible and open-minded) as long as it's\n        discreet. Like I said most people would just\n        turn an opportunity like this away and that is\n        fine, but it's not like I can just go up to\n        people and ask.\n        So, I totally understand that it's not what\n        you posted for and it probably isn't something\n        you're willing to consider, but if you'd like\n        to talk about it let me know. As I mentioned\n        it's worth a lot more than yard work.\n\n        Dame (11:49 AM):   where are you located?\n\n        mbmathy (11:51 AM): On the ME/NH border.. not\n        too close-by but it's not across the state\n        either.. What do you think?\n\n\n3\n    Dame's daughter was actually eight at the time.\n\n                              -4-\n\f          Dame called the police at 11:53 AM.    A police dispatcher\n\nhad Dame forward copies of the email exchange to her, sent an\n\nofficer to Dame's house and notified a detective.    The responding\n\nofficer, noting the tenor of mbmathy's messages, also contacted the\n\ndepartment detective who investigated sex crimes.      After taking\n\nDame's statement and getting his agreement to assist, the officer\n\ndirected Dame to call the   dispatcher, who instructed Dame about\n\nhow to \"continue the conversation.\"\n\n          At 12:14 PM, roughly twenty-three minutes after his last\n\nemail to Dame, mbmathy messaged, \"Is that a no?\"   Now following the\n\ndirection of police, Dame responded at 12:32 PM:       \"am thinking\n\nabout it can you give me a little more info on this?\"       Mbmathy\n\nprovided this detail at 12:43 PM:    \"I'm looking for something that\n\nwould happen on an ongoing/regular basis, which would put hundreds\n\nof dollars in your pocket depending on what you could offer,\n\navailability, etc.\" He also said that he couldn't be more specific\n\nabout money \"without knowing more details about what [Dame] can\n\noffer.\"\n\n          The final email was sent at 2:30 PM.   The two men -- with\n\nDame being guided by police -- eventually agreed to meet at a\n\nDunkin Donuts near the Portland airport at 5:30 PM.    Mbmathy told\n\nDame that he would be driving a white Pontiac.     Dame said that he\n\nwould arrive in a pick-up truck.    In fact, the truck was one that\n\nwas used by the Maine State Police for undercover work.    Sergeant\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fDale York was assigned to impersonate Dame, wear a recording device\n\nand drive the truck to meet mbmathy.     Other officers maintained\n\nvisual surveillance and monitored the recording device.\n\n          Shortly after York arrived at the meeting place, a black\n\nVolkswagen arrived in the parking lot. Although York was expecting\n\na white Pontiac, he became suspicious when the driver -- later\n\ndetermined to be Berk -- walked by York's truck several times.\n\nFinally, the man approached the truck and asked York if he was\n\nwaiting for a white Pontiac.4    After an exchange of first-name\n\nintroductions, Berk, satisfied that he was meeting with Dame, cut\n\nto the chase.   He expressed his interest in having oral sex with\n\nthe 12-year old daughter, assured York that he would not hurt the\n\ngirl, and said that he would cover any travel expenses.   When York\n\npressed Berk for a price, Berk offered $100 per night for oral sex\n\nup to $300 per week and added \"if there's any more that can happen\n\nthen it will be more.\"     Berk also asked how York thought his\n\n\"daughter\" \"is going to react to this\" and whether York was \"going\n\nto help this out.\"\n\n          They agreed that future contact would be by email; York\n\nsaid that it would take about a week \"to lay the ground work.\"\n\nBerk agreed with York that it was a strange position for the latter\n\nto be in, but pointed out that \"this is not something that I could\n\ngo up and just talk to someone about.\"    York said that he would\n\n     4\n      A transcript of the Berk-York meeting, taken from the hidden\nrecorder, was entered into evidence.\n\n                                -6-\n\f\"see what she thinks.    You know, if she agrees to it, if you want\n\nme to email you this weekend or if you rather have it later on.\"\n\nBerk concluded by saying, \"Just keep in touch.              As far as I'm\n\nconcerned the sooner the better.           Because, I don't, I don't want\n\nthis to just go linger out in the middle of nowhere.          I don't want\n\nto be paranoid or anything.\"\n\n            Moments later, other officers approached the truck and\n\ntook Berk into custody.     He was taken to a local police station\n\nwhere he waived his Miranda rights before agreeing to a videotaped\n\ninterview.    Asked what he thought was the reason for his arrest,\n\nBerk responded that it was related to his two \"interests\":            paying\n\nfor sex and girls under the age of 18.          He also said that in his\n\ncommunication with Dame, he \"saw somebody who needed some money -\n\nI said, hey, do you have any females and . . . as a matter of fact\n\nhe had a certain female I might be interested in -- so I said\n\nalright, well, maybe we should talk about it . . . .          He said she\n\nwas   twelve.\"     A   search   of    Berk's    residence   yielded    child\n\npornography stored on computers and external storage devices.\n\nB.    Dorothy Jensen\n\n            Berk's arrest received coverage from local television\n\nnews outlets.    Among the viewers was Portland resident Dorothy\n\nJensen, who recognized Berk from a photo that he had sent her\n\nduring a series of communications regarding an \"apartment wanted\"\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fad that she had posted on Craigslist for her and her 12-year old\n\ndaughter in early August 2008.\n\n            In responding to Jensen's ad, Berk not only said that he\n\nknew   people     with    available     housing,     but    also    that    he   could\n\n\"supplement [Jensen's] income in a way that would give [her] more\n\nfreedom.\"        He eventually asked for a photo of Jensen and her\n\ndaughter and sent Jensen one of himself.                  On August 24, Berk and\n\nJensen had a lengthy colloquy over the internet, using instant\n\nmessaging.       Acknowledging Jensen's earlier comment that she was\n\n\"running out of time,\" Berk said that he was \"talking about\n\nsomething a little more under the table.\"                  When asked for further\n\ndetails,    Berk    said   it    depended     on   what    Jensen     was   \"open    to\n\nsexually\" and inquired about her age and marital status.                    He added\n\nthat he had asked for the pictures to \"see what she looks like,\n\ndoes she have a boyfriend or anything like that?\"\n\n            After Jensen informed Berk that her daughter had recently\n\nbroken up with her boyfriend, Berk asked whether Jensen would \"be\n\ninterested in renting her out, getting her trained, anything along\n\nthose lines . . . .\"              When asked to be more specific about\n\n\"training,\"        Berk       replied     that       \"it      depends       on      her\n\nexperience/interests and any limits you'd place on her I suppose.\n\nAnything in particular you think she needs to learn better?\"                        In\n\nresponse    to     Jensen's     question,     \"are   we     talking    behavior      or\n\nsexually,\" Berk replied \"both!\"\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            Berk explained that he was \"really expecting to be able\n\nto do this more than once, anywhere from a couple of hours to\n\novernight.\"   He said also that what he would want \"would depend on\n\nwhat [Jensen] can offer and what makes sense.\"       He told Jensen that\n\nshe would be able to inform Berk \"what is OK or not OK.\"            Berk\n\nglossed over the daughter's \"inexperience,\" asking Jensen if she\n\n\"mind[ed] if she gets some training\" and that \"the kind of training\n\ndepends on what you're open to.      I want to make sure you get out of\n\nthis what you need, and that what you give me works for both of\n\nus.\"\n\n            Berk then suggested a meeting with Jensen as soon as the\n\nnext day.     Due to other obligations Jensen couldn't provide a\n\nspecific meeting time, but agreed to communicate with him the next\n\nday.   Before any meeting occurred, Jensen saw Berk on television\n\nafter his arrest and contacted the police.\n\n                                    II.\n\nA.   Challenge to the indictment\n\n            Berk   first   argues   that   the   superseding   indictment\n\npursuant to which he was tried was defective because it failed to\n\nallege an element of the crime charged.          The grand jury charged\n\nBerk with two counts (one each with respect to Dame and Jensen) of\n\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), in that he:\n\n            did use a facility of interstate or foreign\n            commerce, namely the Internet, to knowingly\n            persuade, induce, entice and coerce an\n            individual who had not attained the age of 18\n\n                                    -9-\n\f            years to engage in sexual activity for which a\n            person could be charged with a criminal\n            offense, and did attempt to do so.\n\n(emphasis added).      Berk's main argument is that the indictment was\n\ndefective    because   the    highlighted      phrase   did   not    identify    a\n\nparticular underlying criminal offense \"for which [Berk] could be\n\ncharged,\" and thus the indictment provided him with insufficient\n\nnotice.5    We review the legal question presented de novo.                United\n\nStates v. Lopez-Matias, 522 F.3d 150, 153 (1st Cir. 2008).                      If\n\nerror is found, we then review for harmlessness.              United States v.\n\nLnu, a/k/a Oshunkey, 544 F.3d 361, 369 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 311 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n            An   indictment    is    legally   sufficient     if    it   \"'first,\n\ncontains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a\n\ndefendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second,\n\nenables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future\n\nprosecutions for the same offense.'\"           United States v. Cianci, 378\n\nF.3d 71, 81 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Hamling v. United States, 418\n\nU.S. 87, 117 (1974)).         \"The    indictment . . . must be a plain,\n\n\n     5\n      We bypass the government's assertion that Berk waived the\nlack of notice issue by failing to timely raise it. He also argues\nthat the lack of specificity in the charging document subjected him\nto a substantial risk of being convicted on a basis other than the\none on which the grand jury indicted him. Besides being waived for\nlack of development in the opening brief, see United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), this claim is also waived\nbecause it was not made at all in the district court. See Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 12(b)(3)(B) and 12(e) (motion alleging indictment defect,\nother than indictment's failure to invoke court's jurisdiction or\nto state an offense, is waived if not raised before trial).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fconcise and definite written statement of the essential facts\n\nconstituting the offense charged . . . .\"          Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n7(c)(1).   It \"should be specific enough to notify the defendant of\n\nthe nature of the accusation against him and to apprise the court\n\nof the facts alleged.\"      United States v. Brown, 295 F.3d 152, 154\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (citing Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749,\n\n766-68 (1962)).    Setting forth the words of the statute itself is\n\n\"generally sufficient\" if \"those words set forth all the elements\n\nof the offense without any uncertainty or ambiguity.\"      Id. (citing\n\nUnited States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 929 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n           The indictment in this case, aside from including the\n\ndates of   the    Dame   and Jensen   communications and   noting   \"the\n\ninternet\" as the \"means of . . . commerce\" employed, merely tracks\n\nthe language of the statute.      The first time that the government\n\nspecified a particular \"criminal offense for which [Berk] could be\n\ncharged\" was in its trial brief, which it provided to Berk several\n\nweeks before trial. In that instance the government identified the\n\ncrime as gross sexual assault, in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. tit.\n\n17-A, § 253, which prohibits an individual from having sex with a\n\nperson under the age of fourteen. Later, in its response to Berk's\n\nRule 29 motion for acquittal, the government again specified\n\nsection 253.6\n\n\n     6\n      The government also notes that Berk was arrested on state\ncharges of criminal solicitation after he was apprehended in the\nDunkin Donuts parking lot.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f             We have never held that identifying a specific criminal\n\noffense is a requirement in a section 2422 indictment. Berk relies\n\non Dwinells to support his argument that specificity is required.\n\nIn that case, however, although we noted the presence of specific\n\nMassachusetts laws in the indictment, we did not state that such\n\nparticularity was actually required.             508 F.3d at 72.   We further\n\nobserved that in light of the charge in the indictment, the\n\ndistrict court correctly instructed the jury that the government\n\nhad to prove a nexus between the enticement and the particular\n\nstate law.     Id.    But we have not spoken to the question of whether\n\nthe government is required to specify in an indictment what law is\n\nimplicated.     Cases from other circuits are of a kind.           See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Brand, 467 F.3d 179, 182 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting\n\nthat indictment stated that illegal sexual activity was intended to\n\ntake place in New York, but not identifying applicable state\n\nstatute or whether its inclusion was required); United States v.\n\nHicks,   457   F.3d    838,   840   n.2   (8th    Cir.   2006)   (noting   that\n\nindictment listed Missouri criminal statutes, but not indicating\n\nwhether the listing was required); United States v. Bolen, 136 F.\n\nApp'x 325, 329 (11th Cir. 2005) (finding indictment was sufficient\n\nwhere it specifically alleged child molestation without indicating\n\nwhether said specification was required); United States v. Meek,\n\n366 F.3d 705, 711, n.5 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting the particular\n\nCalifornia criminal statute that would have been violated, but not\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\findicating whether it was included in indictment or whether it was\n\nrequired to be).\n\n           In a similar vein, courts generally -- including us in\n\nan unpublished decision -- have not mentioned the particulars of\n\nthe criminal offense when describing the elements of a section\n\n2422(b) violation. See, e.g., United States v. Gravenhorst, 190 F.\n\nApp'x 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting that conviction requires showing\n\nthat \"defendant attempted to (1) use a facility of interstate\n\ncommerce (2) to knowingly persuade, induce, entice, or coerce (3)\n\nan individual under the age of 18 (4) to engage in illegal sexual\n\nactivity.\"); United States v. Cochrane, 534 F.3d 631, 633 (7th Cir.\n\n2008); United States v. Thomas, 410 F.3d 1235, 1245 (10th Cir.\n\n2005); Brand, 467 F.3d at 201-02; Meek, 366 F.3d at 718).\n\n          In the end, the question of whether the specifics of the\n\noffense that satisfies the fourth element of the federal offense\n\nmust be included in the indictment is one that we need not answer\n\nin this case.   Even were we to assume that the indictment itself\n\nwas inadequate, \"we still must determine whether the defect in the\n\nindictment prejudiced\" Berk.    United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d\n\n885, 894 (1st Cir. 1993).   We conclude that it did not.   In Yefsky\n\nwe found error in an indictment charging a fraud conspiracy because\n\nthe indictment failed to adequately set forth the false pretenses\n\nemployed by the defendant to perpetuate the fraud.   Id.   The error\n\nwas harmless, however, because the defendant \"received ample notice\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fbefore trial of the facts underlying [the conspiracy].\"               Id.   In\n\nthat case the trial court's rulings, discovery and the nature of\n\nthe trial defense provided the defendant sufficient opportunity to\n\nrebut the government's charges against him. Id.; see also Mojica-\n\nBaez, 229 F.3d at 311-12 (holding, on plain error review, that\n\ndefendant was not prejudiced by failure of indictment to charge\n\nelement of use of semi-automatic assault weapon, where notice was\n\ngiven through other means).\n\n          Here,   the     record   reflects      a   pretrial   exchange    of\n\ndiscovery that included the electronic correspondence recounted\n\nabove.   Moreover, the government's trial memo, which specified a\n\nMaine criminal statute that Berk's actions would have violated, was\n\nprovided to Berk more than a month prior to trial.           Finally, at the\n\ntime of his arrest Berk thought that he was meeting with the father\n\nof a particular 12-year old girl in whom he had expressed interest\n\non the same date that was stated in the indictment, and he\n\nacknowledged the basis for his arrest in his statement to police.\n\nThese circumstances compel a finding of harmless error. Cf. United\n\nStates v. Murphy, 762 F.2d 1151, 1153-55 (1st Cir. 1985) (reversing\n\nconviction for witness tampering where the indictment failed to\n\nindicate which, among many possible \"official proceedings,\" the\n\ndefendants had allegedly interfered in and where the government\n\nposited multiple theories at trial, thus hampering the defendants'\n\nability to   defend     themselves).      Even    assuming   error,   we    are\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fsatisfied, \"with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened\n\nwithout stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the\n\n[fact finder's] judgment was not substantially swayed by the\n\nerror.\"   Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 894 (citations and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).7\n\nB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Berk    also   argues   that   his   motion   for   judgment    of\n\nacquittal should have been granted because the evidence at trial\n\nwas insufficient to prove that he attempted to \"persuade, induce,\n\nentice or coerce a minor,\" given that the government's proof\n\ninvolved only contact with adults. After reviewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, Dwinells, 508 F.3d at 72,\n\nwe   conclude   that   the evidence   was   sufficient to      sustain    the\n\nconviction.\n\n           \"Section 2422(b) criminalizes an intentional attempt to\n\nachieve a mental state - a minor's assent - regardless of the\n\n\n      7\n      Berk asks us to follow United States v. Mannava, in which the\nSeventh Circuit held that \"the elements of the offense under [the\nstate] statute must[] be elements of the federal offense . . . .\"\n565 F.3d 412, 415 (7th Cir. 2009). In that case, the indictment\nnoted that the charged sexual activity would have violated Indiana\nlaw. Id. at 414. A bill of particulars specified two possible\nstatutes. Id. The court held that \"it an was error to allow the\njury to convict the defendant without a unanimous determination\nthat the defendant had violated one or both of the Indiana statutes\n. . . .\" Id. But see United States v. Hart, 635 F.3d 850, 855-56\n(6th Cir. 2011) (rejecting Mannava and holding that \"the underlying\n[state] criminal offenses are not elements of the federal\noffense\"). Mannava is not of much help in the circumstances of\nthis case, because the concern in that case was that a jury might\nnot reach a unanimous verdict. Berk received a bench trial.\n\n                                   -15-\n\faccused's intentions vis-à-vis the actual consummation of sexual\n\nactivities with the minor.\"          Dwinells, 508 F.3d at 71 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).     The crime of \"attempt\" requires an intention to commit\n\nthe substantive offense -- here, critically, to \"persuade, induce,\n\nentice   and    coerce\"      --   and    a   substantial   step     towards   its\n\ncommission.      United States v. Burgos, 254 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   A \"'substantial step' is less than what is necessary to\n\ncomplete the substantive crime, but more than 'mere preparation.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Piesak, 521 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 215 F.3d 110, 116 (1st Cir. 2000)); see\n\nalso United States v. Goetzke, 494 F.3d 1231, 1237 (9th Cir. 2007)\n\n(observing that a \"'substantial step' . . . cross[es] the line\n\nbetween preparation and attempt by unequivocally demonstrating that\n\nthe   crime    will   take   place      unless   interrupted   by   independent\n\ncircumstances\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).                  Finally, a\n\ndefendant can be convicted even if the relevant communications are\n\nwith an intermediary. United States v. Lanzon, 639 F.3d 1293, 1299\n\n(11th Cir. 2011); United States v. Douglas, 626 F.3d 161, 165 (2d\n\nCir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1024 (2011); United States v.\n\nNestor, 574 F.3d 159, 162 (3d Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct.\n\n1537 (2010).\n\n              Berk argues that the evidence supports no more than a\n\nfinding that his internet communications with Ashley Dame \"never\n\nwent beyond mere preparation.\" We disagree. The trial court could\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\feasily have found that the explicit communications with a person\n\nwhom Berk thought was the father of a 12-year old girl about\n\n\"renting her out,\" along with the concomitant request to see what\n\nthe girl thought of the idea, were part of an attempt to achieve\n\nthe requisite mental state in the minor.        Beyond that, we have\n\nlittle trouble concluding that actually meeting with the girl's\n\nfather and discussing with him graphic sexual details and prices\n\ngoes far beyond \"mere preparation.\"8\n\n          To be sure, the evidence against Berk with respect to the\n\nJensen matter is not as clear-cut.      The record reflects, however,\n\nthat after responding to Dorothy Jensen's classified ad, Berk not\n\nonly steered the ensuing conversation away from Jensen's search for\n\nhousing and towards paying for sex with Jensen's daughter, but he\n\nalso helped to propel the scheme by finding and sending to Jensen\n\nleads about homes that he said she could \"rent,\" even though he was\n\nnot in the real estate business.       In addition, Berk exchanged or\n\nattempted to exchange photos with Jensen, and he proposed meeting\n\nJensen in order to discuss details of his \"plans\" to help Jensen\n\nearn money for housing.   Even though, unlike in the Dame matter, no\n\nsuch meeting ever took place, it was only the fortuity of Jensen\n\n     8\n      Testifying in his own defense, Berk claimed that he had no\ninterest in actually having sex with the minors, but was instead\nengaging in a form of \"role playing.\"      The district court, as\nfinder of fact, was, of course, free to reject Berk's defense.\nUnited States v. Ford, 22 F.3d 374, 383 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting\nthat finder of fact is free to reject a defendant's explanation of\nevents and that \"it is not the province of this court to reweigh\nconflicting testimony or to make credibility determinations.\").\n\n                                -17-\n\fseeing Berk's face and modus operandi on television that prevented\n\nit.   These actions go beyond mere \"talk\" or \"hot air.\"      Cf. United\n\nStates v. Gladish, 536 F.3d 646, 647 (7th Cir. 2008) (overturning\n\nconviction after finding that explicit sexual talk alone was not a\n\n\"substantial step\"). Nor, as Berk suggests, is travel to a meeting\n\nnecessarily an element of an attempt. See United States v. Bailey,\n\n228 F.3d 637, 639-40 (6th Cir. 2000) (finding sufficient evidence\n\nof \"substantial step\" where defendant did not meet with minors, but\n\nproposed doing so in order to have sex with them).\n\n            In sum, the indictment was not fatally defective and the\n\nevidence was sufficient to support the convictions in both the\n\nJensen and Dame matters.     Berk also interposed a challenge to his\n\nsentence that is dependent on invalidating his conviction.          The\n\npredicate   having failed,   we   need   not address   the   argument.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f",

Berk pled guilty to the pornography charge, and he was convicted of the two child enticement charges after a bench trial. He was sentenced to 200 months in prison. Two claims are pressed on appeal. First, Berk argues that the indictment was defective because it lacked an element of the crime charged. Second, he argues that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to convict him. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I.</i></h2>\n<p>The facts, though disturbing, are not greatly disputed. Regardless, because Berk challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we recount them in some detail, and in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Dwinells,</i> 508 F.3d 63, 65 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Ashley Dame</i></h2>\n<p>On the morning of August 28, 2008, police in Biddeford, Maine received a complaint from twenty-three year old handyman Ashley Dame, then a father of four living in Biddeford. Dame recounted the following chain of events. Earlier that day, he had solicited employment on Craigslist, the internet-based classified advertisement service. The ad he posted read:</p>\n<blockquote>looking for small odd jobs I am a father of 4 currently out of work looking for the following yard maint, drywalling, painting, firewood cutting splitting and stacking or anything else u may have for me willing to barter or accept cash I have referances and reasonable rates or tell me what ya got for me to do and what u are willing to barter for the work to get done plz be in the biddeford saco oob [presumably Old Orchard Beach] area thanks and hope to meet u soon.</blockquote>\n<p>Soon after, Dame received an email from the address \"mbmathy@yahoo.com\" (\"mbmathy\") inquiring \"How old are the kids? Will you rent any of them out?\"<sup>[1]</sup> Dame replied that his children's young age was why he was looking for work, and that he \"didn't put them on here to do it.\" A few minutes later, mbmathy wrote, \"Yeah, I didn't know how young so I thought I'd ask if you would consider making money that way  thanks for the response.\" This exchange ensued<sup>[2]</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:26 AM): what do you mean rent them out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:28 AM): Well how old are they? If they're too young to do anything it doesn't matter anyway:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:30 AM): yeah they are too young for that u do mean like work and whatnot right? if u have anything i will do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:31 AM): it depends  how old are they? Boys or girls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:32 AM): have a 12 yr old daughter and my sons are younger<sup>[3]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> mbmathy (11:40 AM): OK and you say you don't want her doing anything for cash, only you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:41 AM): yeah i am looking for what i said odd jobs such as painting yard maint cutting and splitting wood etc maybe other things let me know what u have</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:43 AM): Paid oral training is what I'm looking for, stuff along those lines. It pays a lot more than regular odd jobs but as you know it isn't for everyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:43 AM): what is it that u are talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:47 AM): It's worth a lot of money to me to be able to train a girl how to give head, or anything along those lines (I'm flexible and open-minded) as long as it's discreet. Like I said most people would just turn an opportunity like this away and that is fine, but it's not like I can just go up to people and ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So, I totally understand that it's not what you posted for and it probably isn't something you're willing to consider, but if you'd like to talk about it let me know. As I mentioned it's worth a lot more than yard work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:49 AM): where are you located?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:51 AM): On the ME/NH border.. not too close-by but it's not across the state either.. What do you think?</blockquote>\n<p>Dame called the police at 11:53 AM. A police dispatcher had Dame forward copies of the email exchange to her, sent an officer to Dame's house and notified a detective. The responding officer, noting the tenor of mbmathy's messages, also contacted the department detective who investigated sex crimes. After taking Dame's statement and getting his agreement to assist, the officer directed Dame to call the dispatcher, who instructed Dame about how to \"continue the conversation.\"</p>\n<p>At 12:14 PM, roughly twenty-three minutes after his last email to Dame, mbmathy messaged, \"Is that a no?\" Now following the direction of police, Dame responded at 12:32 PM: \"am thinking about it can you give me a little more info on this?\" Mbmathy provided this detail at 12:43 PM: \"I'm looking for something that would happen on an ongoing/regular basis, which would put hundreds of dollars in your pocket depending on what you could offer, availability, etc.\" He also said that he couldn't be more specific about money \"without knowing more details about what [Dame] can offer.\"</p>\n<p>The final email was sent at 2:30 PM. The two men  with Dame being guided by police  eventually agreed to meet at a Dunkin Donuts near the Portland airport at 5:30 PM. Mbmathy told Dame that he would be driving a white Pontiac. Dame said that he would arrive in a pick-up truck. In fact, the truck was one that was used by the Maine State Police for undercover work. Sergeant Dale York was assigned to impersonate Dame, wear a recording device and drive the truck to meet mbmathy. Other officers maintained visual surveillance and monitored the recording device.</p>\n<p>Shortly after York arrived at the meeting place, a black Volkswagen arrived in the parking lot. Although York was expecting a white Pontiac, he became suspicious when the driver  later determined to be Berk  walked by York's truck several times. Finally, the man approached the truck and asked York if he was waiting for a white Pontiac.<sup>[4]</sup> After an exchange of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> first-name introductions, Berk, satisfied that he was meeting with Dame, cut to the chase. He expressed his interest in having oral sex with the 12-year old daughter, assured York that he would not hurt the girl, and said that he would cover any travel expenses. When York pressed Berk for a price, Berk offered $100 per night for oral sex up to $300 per week and added \"if there's any more that can happen then it will be more.\" Berk also asked how York thought his \"daughter\" \"is going to react to this\" and whether York was \"going to help this out.\"</p>\n<p>They agreed that future contact would be by email; York said that it would take about a week \"to lay the ground work.\" Berk agreed with York that it was a strange position for the latter to be in, but pointed out that \"this is not something that I could go up and just talk to someone about.\" York said that he would \"see what she thinks. You know, if she agrees to it, if you want me to email you this weekend or if you rather have it later on.\" Berk concluded by saying, \"Just keep in touch. As far as I'm concerned the sooner the better. Because, I don't, I don't want this to just go linger out in the middle of nowhere. I don't want to be paranoid or anything.\"</p>\n<p>Moments later, other officers approached the truck and took Berk into custody. He was taken to a local police station where he waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights before agreeing to a videotaped interview. Asked what he thought was the reason for his arrest, Berk responded that it was related to his two \"interests\": paying for sex and girls under the age of 18. He also said that in his communication with Dame, he \"saw somebody who needed some money  I said, hey, do you have any females and ... as a matter of fact he had a certain female I might be interested in  so I said alright, well, maybe we should talk about it.... He said she was twelve.\" A search of Berk's residence yielded child pornography stored on computers and external storage devices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Dorothy Jensen</i></h2>\n<p>Berk's arrest received coverage from local television news outlets. Among the viewers was Portland resident Dorothy Jensen, who recognized Berk from a photo that he had sent her during a series of communications regarding an \"apartment wanted\" ad that she had posted on Craigslist for her and her 12-year old daughter in early August 2008.</p>\n<p>In responding to Jensen's ad, Berk not only said that he knew people with available housing, but also that he could \"supplement [Jensen's] income in a way that would give [her] more freedom.\" He eventually asked for a photo of Jensen and her daughter and sent Jensen one of himself. On August 24, Berk and Jensen had a lengthy colloquy over the internet, using instant messaging. Acknowledging Jensen's earlier comment that she was \"running out of time,\" Berk said that he was \"talking about something a little more under the table.\" When asked for further details, Berk said it depended on what Jensen was \"open to sexually\" and inquired about her age and marital status. He added that he had asked for the pictures to \"see what she looks like, does she have a boyfriend or anything like that?\"</p>\n<p>After Jensen informed Berk that her daughter had recently broken up with her boyfriend, Berk asked whether Jensen would \"be interested in renting her out, getting her trained, anything along those lines....\" When asked to be more specific about \"training,\" Berk replied that \"it depends <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> on her experience/interests and any limits you'd place on her I suppose. Anything in particular you think she needs to learn better?\" In response to Jensen's question, \"are we talking behavior or sexually,\" Berk replied \"both!\"</p>\n<p>Berk explained that he was \"really expecting to be able to do this more than once, anywhere from a couple of hours to overnight.\" He said also that what he would want \"would depend on what [Jensen] can offer and what makes sense.\" He told Jensen that she would be able to inform Berk \"what is OK or not OK.\" Berk glossed over the daughter's \"inexperience,\" asking Jensen if she \"mind[ed] if she gets some training\" and that \"the kind of training depends on what you're open to. I want to make sure you get out of this what you need, and that what you give me works for both of us.\"</p>\n<p>Berk then suggested a meeting with Jensen as soon as the next day. Due to other obligations Jensen couldn't provide a specific meeting time, but agreed to communicate with him the next day. Before any meeting occurred, Jensen saw Berk on television after his arrest and contacted the police.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II.</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Challenge to the indictment</i></h2>\n<p>Berk first argues that the superseding indictment pursuant to which he was tried was defective because it failed to allege an element of the crime charged. The grand jury charged Berk with two counts (one each with respect to Dame and Jensen) of violating 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), in that he:</p>\n<blockquote>did use a facility of interstate or foreign commerce, namely the Internet, to knowingly persuade, induce, entice and coerce an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years to engage in <i>sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a criminal offense,</i> and did attempt to do so.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis added). Berk's main argument is that the indictment was defective because the highlighted phrase did not identify a particular underlying criminal offense \"for which [Berk] could be charged,\" and thus the indictment provided him with insufficient notice.<sup>[5]</sup> We review the legal question presented de novo. <i>United States v. Lopez-Matias,</i> 522 F.3d 150, 153 (1st Cir.2008). If error is found, we then review for harmlessness. <i>United States v. Lnu, a/k/a Oshunkey,</i> 544 F.3d 361, 369 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>United States v. Mojica-Baez,</i> 229 F.3d 292, 311 (1st Cir. 2000)).</p>\n<p>An indictment is legally sufficient if it \"`first, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.'\" <i>United States v. Cianci,</i> 378 F.3d 71, 81 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Hamling v. United States,</i> 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974)). \"The indictment ... must be a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged....\" Fed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> R.Crim.P. 7(c)(1). It \"should be specific enough to notify the defendant of the nature of the accusation against him and to apprise the court of the facts alleged.\" <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 295 F.3d 152, 154 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Russell v. United States,</i> 369 U.S. 749, 766-68, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962)). Setting forth the words of the statute itself is \"generally sufficient\" if \"those words set forth all the elements of the offense without any uncertainty or ambiguity.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Serino,</i> 835 F.2d 924, 929 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p>The indictment in this case, aside from including the dates of the Dame and Jensen communications and noting \"the internet\" as the \"means of ... commerce\" employed, merely tracks the language of the statute. The first time that the government specified a particular \"criminal offense for which [Berk] could be charged\" was in its trial brief, which it provided to Berk several weeks before trial. In that instance the government identified the crime as gross sexual assault, in violation of Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 17-A, § 253, which prohibits an individual from having sex with a person under the age of fourteen. Later, in its response to Berk's Rule 29 motion for acquittal, the government again specified section 253.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>We have never held that identifying a specific criminal offense is a requirement in a section 2422 indictment. Berk relies on <i>Dwinells</i> to support his argument that specificity is required. In that case, however, although we noted the presence of specific Massachusetts laws in the indictment, we did not state that such particularity was actually required. 508 F.3d at 72. We further observed that in light of the charge in the indictment, the district court correctly instructed the jury that the government had to prove a nexus between the enticement and the particular state law. <i>Id.</i> But we have not spoken to the question of whether the government is required to specify in an indictment what law is implicated. Cases from other circuits are of a kind. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brand,</i> 467 F.3d 179, 182 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that indictment stated that illegal sexual activity was intended to take place in New York, but not identifying applicable state statute or whether its inclusion was required); <i>United States v. Hicks,</i> 457 F.3d 838, 840 n. 2 (8th Cir.2006) (noting that indictment listed Missouri criminal statutes, but not indicating whether the listing was required); <i>United States v. Bolen,</i> 136 Fed.Appx. 325, 329 (11th Cir.2005) (finding indictment was sufficient where it specifically alleged child molestation without indicating whether said specification was required); <i>United States v. Meek,</i> 366 F.3d 705, 711, n. 5 (9th Cir.2004) (noting the particular California criminal statute that would have been violated, but not indicating whether it was included in indictment or whether it was required to be).</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, courts generally  including us in an unpublished decision  have not mentioned the particulars of the criminal offense when describing the elements of a section 2422(b) violation. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gravenhorst,</i> 190 Fed.Appx. 1, 3 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that conviction requires showing that \"defendant attempted to (1) use a facility of interstate commerce (2) to knowingly persuade, induce, entice, or coerce (3) an individual under the age of 18 (4) to engage in illegal sexual activity.\"); <i>United States v. Cochran,</i> 534 F.3d 631, 633 (7th Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 410 F.3d 1235, 1245 (10th Cir.2005); <i>Brand,</i> 467 F.3d at 201-02; <i>Meek,</i> 366 F.3d at 718.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> In the end, the question of whether the specifics of the offense that satisfies the fourth element of the federal offense must be included in the indictment is one that we need not answer in this case. Even were we to assume that the indictment itself was inadequate, \"we still must determine whether the defect in the indictment prejudiced\" Berk. <i>United States v. Yefsky,</i> 994 F.2d 885, 894 (1st Cir.1993). We conclude that it did not. In <i>Yefsky</i> we found error in an indictment charging a fraud conspiracy because the indictment failed to adequately set forth the false pretenses employed by the defendant to perpetuate the fraud. <i>Id.</i> The error was harmless, however, because the defendant \"received ample notice before trial of the facts underlying [the conspiracy].\" <i>Id.</i> In that case the trial court's rulings, discovery and the nature of the trial defense provided the defendant sufficient opportunity to rebut the government's charges against him. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>Mojica-Baez,</i> 229 F.3d at 311-12 (holding, on plain error review, that defendant was not prejudiced by failure of indictment to charge element of use of semi-automatic assault weapon, where notice was given through other means).</p>\n<p>Here, the record reflects a pretrial exchange of discovery that included the electronic correspondence recounted above. Moreover, the government's trial memo, which specified a Maine criminal statute that Berk's actions would have violated, was provided to Berk more than a month prior to trial. Finally, at the time of his arrest Berk thought that he was meeting with the father of a particular 12-year old girl in whom he had expressed interest on the same date that was stated in the indictment, and he acknowledged the basis for his arrest in his statement to police. These circumstances compel a finding of harmless error. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Murphy,</i> 762 F.2d 1151, 1153-55 (1st Cir.1985) (reversing conviction for witness tampering where the indictment failed to indicate which, among many possible \"official proceedings,\" the defendants had allegedly interfered in and where the government posited multiple theories at trial, thus hampering the defendants' ability to defend themselves). Even assuming error, we are satisfied, \"with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the [fact finder's] judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\" <i>Yefsky,</i> 994 F.2d at 894 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Berk also argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted because the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that he attempted to \"persuade, induce, entice or coerce a minor,\" given that the government's proof involved only contact with adults. After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, <i>Dwinells,</i> 508 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> F.3d at 72, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p>\"Section 2422(b) criminalizes an intentional attempt to achieve a <i>mental</i> state  a minor's assent  regardless of the accused's intentions vis-à-vis the actual consummation of sexual activities with the minor.\" <i>Dwinells,</i> 508 F.3d at 71 (emphasis in original). The crime of \"attempt\" requires an intention to commit the substantive offense  here, critically, to \"persuade, induce, entice and coerce\"  and a substantial step towards its commission. <i>United States v. Burgos,</i> 254 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.2001). A \"`substantial step' is less than what is necessary to complete the substantive crime, but more than `mere preparation.'\" <i>United States v. Piesak,</i> 521 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 215 F.3d 110, 116 (1st Cir.2000)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Goetzke,</i> 494 F.3d 1231, 1237 (9th Cir. 2007) (observing that a \"`substantial step'... cross[es] the line between preparation and attempt by unequivocally demonstrating that the crime will take place unless interrupted by independent circumstances\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Finally, a defendant can be convicted even if the relevant communications are with an intermediary. <i>United States v. Lanzon,</i> 639 F.3d 1293, 1299 (11th Cir.2011); <i>United States v. Douglas,</i> 626 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir.2010), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 1024, 178 L.Ed.2d 847 (2011); <i>United States v. Nestor,</i> 574 F.3d 159, 162 (3d Cir.2009), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1537, 176 L.Ed.2d 133 (2010).</p>\n<p>Berk argues that the evidence supports no more than a finding that his internet communications with Ashley Dame \"never went beyond mere preparation.\" We disagree. The trial court could easily have found that the explicit communications with a person whom Berk thought was the father of a 12-year old girl about \"renting her out,\" along with the concomitant request to see what the girl thought of the idea, were part of an attempt to achieve the requisite mental state in the minor. Beyond that, we have little trouble concluding that actually meeting with the girl's father and discussing with him graphic sexual details and prices goes far beyond \"mere preparation.\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>To be sure, the evidence against Berk with respect to the Jensen matter is not as clear-cut. The record reflects, however, that after responding to Dorothy Jensen's classified ad, Berk not only steered the ensuing conversation away from Jensen's search for housing and towards paying for sex with Jensen's daughter, but he also helped to propel the scheme by finding and sending to Jensen leads about homes that he said she could \"rent,\" even though he was not in the real estate business. In addition, Berk exchanged or attempted to exchange photos with Jensen, and he proposed meeting Jensen in order to discuss details of his \"plans\" to help Jensen earn money for housing. Even though, unlike in the Dame matter, no such meeting ever took place, it was only the fortuity of Jensen seeing Berk's face and <i>modus operandi</i> on television that prevented it. These actions go beyond mere \"talk\" or \"hot air.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Gladish,</i> 536 F.3d 646, 647 (7th Cir.2008) (overturning conviction after <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> finding that explicit sexual talk alone was not a \"substantial step\"). Nor, as Berk suggests, is travel to a meeting necessarily an element of an attempt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 228 F.3d 637, 639-40 (6th Cir.2000) (finding sufficient evidence of \"substantial step\" where defendant did not meet with minors, but proposed doing so in order to have sex with them).</p>\n<p>In sum, the indictment was not fatally defective and the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions in both the Jensen and Dame matters. Berk also interposed a challenge to his sentence that is dependent on invalidating his conviction. The predicate having failed, we need not address the argument. <i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  When a listing is posted on Craigslist, an anonymous email address appears with the ad. Responses are automatically re-directed to an email address specified by the individual posting the ad, who can then choose to break the anonymity by responding.\n</p>\n<p>Printouts of the emails discussed herein were entered into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  Given the general informality of the electronic communication at issue, we reproduce verbatim the text of the exchange.</p>\n<p>[3]  Dame's daughter was actually eight at the time.</p>\n<p>[4]  A transcript of the Berk-York meeting, taken from the hidden recorder, was entered into evidence.</p>\n<p>[5]  We bypass the government's assertion that Berk waived the lack of notice issue by failing to timely raise it. He also argues that the lack of specificity in the charging document subjected him to a substantial risk of being convicted on a basis other than the one on which the grand jury indicted him. Besides being waived for lack of development in the opening brief, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990), this claim is also waived because it was not made at all in the district court. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B) and 12(e) (motion alleging indictment defect, other than indictment's failure to invoke court's jurisdiction or to state an offense, is waived if not raised before trial).</p>\n<p>[6]  The government also notes that Berk was arrested on state charges of criminal solicitation after he was apprehended in the Dunkin Donuts parking lot.</p>\n<p>[7]  Berk asks us to follow <i>United States v. Mannava,</i> in which the Seventh Circuit held that \"the elements of the offense under [the state] statute must[] be elements of the federal offense....\" 565 F.3d 412, 415 (7th Cir.2009). In that case, the indictment noted that the charged sexual activity would have violated Indiana law. <i>Id.</i> at 414. A bill of particulars specified two possible statutes. <i>Id.</i> The court held that \"it was an error to allow the jury to convict the defendant without a unanimous determination that the defendant had violated one or both of the Indiana statutes....\" <i>Id. But see </i><i>United States v. Hart,</i> 635 F.3d 850, 855-56 (6th Cir.2011) (rejecting <i>Mannava</i> and holding that \"the underlying [state] criminal offenses are not elements of the federal offense\"). <i>Mannava</i> is not of much help in the circumstances of this case, because the concern in that case was that a jury might not reach a unanimous verdict. Berk received a bench trial.</p>\n<p>[8]  Testifying in his own defense, Berk claimed that he had no interest in actually having sex with the minors, but was instead engaging in a form of \"role playing.\" The district court, as finder of fact, was, of course, free to reject Berk's defense. <i>United States v. Ford,</i> 22 F.3d 374, 383 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that finder of fact is free to reject a defendant's explanation of events and that \"it is not the province of this court to reweigh conflicting testimony or to make credibility determinations.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

Ashley Dame</i></h2>\n<p>On the morning of August 28, 2008, police in Biddeford, Maine received a complaint from twenty-three year old handyman Ashley Dame, then a father of four living in Biddeford. Dame recounted the following chain of events. Earlier that day, he had solicited employment on Craigslist, the internet-based classified advertisement service. The ad he posted read:</p>\n<blockquote>looking for small odd jobs I am a father of 4 currently out of work looking for the following yard maint, drywalling, painting, firewood cutting splitting and stacking or anything else u may have for me willing to barter or accept cash I have referances and reasonable rates or tell me what ya got for me to do and what u are willing to barter for the work to get done plz be in the biddeford saco oob [presumably Old Orchard Beach] area thanks and hope to meet u soon.</blockquote>\n<p>Soon after, Dame received an email from the address \"mbmathy@yahoo.com\" (\"mbmathy\") inquiring \"How old are the kids? Will you rent any of them out?\"<sup>[1]</sup> Dame replied that his children's young age was why he was looking for work, and that he \"didn't put them on here to do it.\" A few minutes later, mbmathy wrote, \"Yeah, I didn't know how young so I thought I'd ask if you would consider making money that way  thanks for the response.\" This exchange ensued<sup>[2]</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:26 AM): what do you mean rent them out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:28 AM): Well how old are they? If they're too young to do anything it doesn't matter anyway:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:30 AM): yeah they are too young for that u do mean like work and whatnot right? if u have anything i will do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:31 AM): it depends  how old are they? Boys or girls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:32 AM): have a 12 yr old daughter and my sons are younger<sup>[3]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> mbmathy (11:40 AM): OK and you say you don't want her doing anything for cash, only you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:41 AM): yeah i am looking for what i said odd jobs such as painting yard maint cutting and splitting wood etc maybe other things let me know what u have</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:43 AM): Paid oral training is what I'm looking for, stuff along those lines. It pays a lot more than regular odd jobs but as you know it isn't for everyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:43 AM): what is it that u are talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:47 AM): It's worth a lot of money to me to be able to train a girl how to give head, or anything along those lines (I'm flexible and open-minded) as long as it's discreet. Like I said most people would just turn an opportunity like this away and that is fine, but it's not like I can just go up to people and ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So, I totally understand that it's not what you posted for and it probably isn't something you're willing to consider, but if you'd like to talk about it let me know. As I mentioned it's worth a lot more than yard work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Dame (11:49 AM): where are you located?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>mbmathy (11:51 AM): On the ME/NH border.. not too close-by but it's not across the state either.. What do you think?</blockquote>\n<p>Dame called the police at 11:53 AM. A police dispatcher had Dame forward copies of the email exchange to her, sent an officer to Dame's house and notified a detective. The responding officer, noting the tenor of mbmathy's messages, also contacted the department detective who investigated sex crimes. After taking Dame's statement and getting his agreement to assist, the officer directed Dame to call the dispatcher, who instructed Dame about how to \"continue the conversation.\"</p>\n<p>At 12:14 PM, roughly twenty-three minutes after his last email to Dame, mbmathy messaged, \"Is that a no?\" Now following the direction of police, Dame responded at 12:32 PM: \"am thinking about it can you give me a little more info on this?\" Mbmathy provided this detail at 12:43 PM: \"I'm looking for something that would happen on an ongoing/regular basis, which would put hundreds of dollars in your pocket depending on what you could offer, availability, etc.\" He also said that he couldn't be more specific about money \"without knowing more details about what [Dame] can offer.\"</p>\n<p>The final email was sent at 2:30 PM. The two men  with Dame being guided by police  eventually agreed to meet at a Dunkin Donuts near the Portland airport at 5:30 PM. Mbmathy told Dame that he would be driving a white Pontiac. Dame said that he would arrive in a pick-up truck. In fact, the truck was one that was used by the Maine State Police for undercover work. Sergeant Dale York was assigned to impersonate Dame, wear a recording device and drive the truck to meet mbmathy. Other officers maintained visual surveillance and monitored the recording device.</p>\n<p>Shortly after York arrived at the meeting place, a black Volkswagen arrived in the parking lot. Although York was expecting a white Pontiac, he became suspicious when the driver  later determined to be Berk  walked by York's truck several times. Finally, the man approached the truck and asked York if he was waiting for a white Pontiac.<sup>[4]</sup> After an exchange of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> first-name introductions, Berk, satisfied that he was meeting with Dame, cut to the chase. He expressed his interest in having oral sex with the 12-year old daughter, assured York that he would not hurt the girl, and said that he would cover any travel expenses. When York pressed Berk for a price, Berk offered $100 per night for oral sex up to $300 per week and added \"if there's any more that can happen then it will be more.\" Berk also asked how York thought his \"daughter\" \"is going to react to this\" and whether York was \"going to help this out.\"</p>\n<p>They agreed that future contact would be by email; York said that it would take about a week \"to lay the ground work.\" Berk agreed with York that it was a strange position for the latter to be in, but pointed out that \"this is not something that I could go up and just talk to someone about.\" York said that he would \"see what she thinks. You know, if she agrees to it, if you want me to email you this weekend or if you rather have it later on.\" Berk concluded by saying, \"Just keep in touch. As far as I'm concerned the sooner the better. Because, I don't, I don't want this to just go linger out in the middle of nowhere. I don't want to be paranoid or anything.\"</p>\n<p>Moments later, other officers approached the truck and took Berk into custody. He was taken to a local police station where he waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights before agreeing to a videotaped interview. Asked what he thought was the reason for his arrest, Berk responded that it was related to his two \"interests\": paying for sex and girls under the age of 18. He also said that in his communication with Dame, he \"saw somebody who needed some money  I said, hey, do you have any females and ... as a matter of fact he had a certain female I might be interested in  so I said alright, well, maybe we should talk about it.... He said she was twelve.\" A search of Berk's residence yielded child pornography stored on computers and external storage devices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Dorothy Jensen</i></h2>\n<p>Berk's arrest received coverage from local television news outlets. Among the viewers was Portland resident Dorothy Jensen, who recognized Berk from a photo that he had sent her during a series of communications regarding an \"apartment wanted\" ad that she had posted on Craigslist for her and her 12-year old daughter in early August 2008.</p>\n<p>In responding to Jensen's ad, Berk not only said that he knew people with available housing, but also that he could \"supplement [Jensen's] income in a way that would give [her] more freedom.\" He eventually asked for a photo of Jensen and her daughter and sent Jensen one of himself. On August 24, Berk and Jensen had a lengthy colloquy over the internet, using instant messaging. Acknowledging Jensen's earlier comment that she was \"running out of time,\" Berk said that he was \"talking about something a little more under the table.\" When asked for further details, Berk said it depended on what Jensen was \"open to sexually\" and inquired about her age and marital status. He added that he had asked for the pictures to \"see what she looks like, does she have a boyfriend or anything like that?\"</p>\n<p>After Jensen informed Berk that her daughter had recently broken up with her boyfriend, Berk asked whether Jensen would \"be interested in renting her out, getting her trained, anything along those lines....\" When asked to be more specific about \"training,\" Berk replied that \"it depends <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> on her experience/interests and any limits you'd place on her I suppose. Anything in particular you think she needs to learn better?\" In response to Jensen's question, \"are we talking behavior or sexually,\" Berk replied \"both!\"</p>\n<p>Berk explained that he was \"really expecting to be able to do this more than once, anywhere from a couple of hours to overnight.\" He said also that what he would want \"would depend on what [Jensen] can offer and what makes sense.\" He told Jensen that she would be able to inform Berk \"what is OK or not OK.\" Berk glossed over the daughter's \"inexperience,\" asking Jensen if she \"mind[ed] if she gets some training\" and that \"the kind of training depends on what you're open to. I want to make sure you get out of this what you need, and that what you give me works for both of us.\"</p>\n<p>Berk then suggested a meeting with Jensen as soon as the next day. Due to other obligations Jensen couldn't provide a specific meeting time, but agreed to communicate with him the next day. Before any meeting occurred, Jensen saw Berk on television after his arrest and contacted the police.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II.</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Challenge to the indictment</i></h2>\n<p>Berk first argues that the superseding indictment pursuant to which he was tried was defective because it failed to allege an element of the crime charged. The grand jury charged Berk with two counts (one each with respect to Dame and Jensen) of violating 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), in that he:</p>\n<blockquote>did use a facility of interstate or foreign commerce, namely the Internet, to knowingly persuade, induce, entice and coerce an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years to engage in <i>sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a criminal offense,</i> and did attempt to do so.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis added). Berk's main argument is that the indictment was defective because the highlighted phrase did not identify a particular underlying criminal offense \"for which [Berk] could be charged,\" and thus the indictment provided him with insufficient notice.<sup>[5]</sup> We review the legal question presented de novo. <i>United States v.

The first time that the government specified a particular \"criminal offense for which [Berk] could be charged\" was in its trial brief, which it provided to Berk several weeks before trial. In that instance the government identified the crime as gross sexual assault, in violation of Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 17-A, § 253, which prohibits an individual from having sex with a person under the age of fourteen. Later, in its response to Berk's Rule 29 motion for acquittal, the government again specified section 253.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>We have never held that identifying a specific criminal offense is a requirement in a section 2422 indictment. Berk relies on <i>Dwinells</i> to support his argument that specificity is required. In that case, however, although we noted the presence of specific Massachusetts laws in the indictment, we did not state that such particularity was actually required. 508 F.3d at 72. We further observed that in light of the charge in the indictment, the district court correctly instructed the jury that the government had to prove a nexus between the enticement and the particular state law. <i>Id.</i> But we have not spoken to the question of whether the government is required to specify in an indictment what law is implicated. Cases from other circuits are of a kind. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brand,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></span>, 182 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that indictment stated that illegal sexual activity was intended to take place in New York, but not identifying applicable state statute or whether its inclusion was required); <i>United States v. Hicks,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></span>, 840 n. 2 (8th Cir.2006) (noting that indictment listed Missouri criminal statutes, but not indicating whether the listing was required); <i>United States v. Bolen,</i> 136 Fed.Appx. 325, 329 (11th Cir.2005) (finding indictment was sufficient where it specifically alleged child molestation without indicating whether said specification was required); <i>United States v. Meek,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786002\"><a href=\"/opinion/786002/united-states-v-jeffrey-meek/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 711, n. 5 (9th Cir.2004) (noting the particular California criminal statute that would have been violated, but not indicating whether it was included in indictment or whether it was required to be).</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, courts generally  including us in an unpublished decision  have not mentioned the particulars of the criminal offense when describing the elements of a section 2422(b) violation. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gravenhorst,</i> 190 Fed.Appx. 1, 3 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that conviction requires showing that \"defendant attempted to (1) use a facility of interstate commerce (2) to knowingly persuade, induce, entice, or coerce (3) an individual under the age of 18 (4) to engage in illegal sexual activity.\"); <i>United States v. Cochran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198696\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198696/united-states-v-cochran/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span>, 633 (7th Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165968\"><a href=\"/opinion/165968/united-states-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></a></span>, 1245 (10th Cir.2005); <i>Brand,</i> 467 F.3d at 201-02; <i>Meek,</i> 366 F.3d at 718.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> In the end, the question of whether the specifics of the offense that satisfies the fourth element of the federal offense must be included in the indictment is one that we need not answer in this case. Even were we to assume that the indictment itself was inadequate, \"we still must determine whether the defect in the indictment prejudiced\" Berk. <i>United States v. Yefsky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608076\"><a href=\"/opinion/608076/united-states-v-sheldon-arthur-yefsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 894 (1st Cir.1993). We conclude that it did not. In <i>Yefsky</i> we found error in an indictment charging a fraud conspiracy because the indictment failed to adequately set forth the false pretenses employed by the defendant to perpetuate the fraud. <i>Id.</i> The error was harmless, however, because the defendant \"received ample notice before trial of the facts underlying [the conspiracy].\" <i>Id.</i> In that case the trial court's rulings, discovery and the nature of the trial defense provided the defendant sufficient opportunity to rebut the government's charges against him. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>Mojica-Baez,</i> 229 F.3d at 311-12 (holding, on plain error review, that defendant was not prejudiced by failure of indictment to charge element of use of semi-automatic assault weapon, where notice was given through other means).</p>\n<p>Here, the record reflects a pretrial exchange of discovery that included the electronic correspondence recounted above. Moreover, the government's trial memo, which specified a Maine criminal statute that Berk's actions would have violated, was provided to Berk more than a month prior to trial. Finally, at the time of his arrest Berk thought that he was meeting with the father of a particular 12-year old girl in whom he had expressed interest on the same date that was stated in the indictment, and he acknowledged the basis for his arrest in his statement to police. These circumstances compel a finding of harmless error. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"452970\"><a href=\"/opinion/452970/united-states-v-patrick-murphy-united-states-of-america-v-kevin-w-deyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">762</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span>, 1153-55 (1st Cir.1985) (reversing conviction for witness tampering where the indictment failed to indicate which, among many possible \"official proceedings,\" the defendants had allegedly interfered in and where the government posited multiple theories at trial, thus hampering the defendants' ability to defend themselves). Even assuming error, we are satisfied, \"with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the [fact finder's] judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\" <i>Yefsky,</i> 994 F.2d at 894 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Berk also argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted because the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that he attempted to \"persuade, induce, entice or coerce a minor,\" given that the government's proof involved only contact with adults. After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, <i>Dwinells,</i> 508 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> F.3d at 72, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p>\"Section 2422(b) criminalizes an intentional attempt to achieve a <i>mental</i> state  a minor's assent  regardless of the accused's intentions vis-à-vis the actual consummation of sexual activities with the minor.\" <i>Dwinells,</i> 508 F.3d at 71 (emphasis in original). The crime of \"attempt\" requires an intention to commit the substantive offense  here, critically, to \"persuade, induce, entice and coerce\"  and a substantial step towards its commission. <i>United States v. Burgos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199459\"><a href=\"/opinion/199459/united-states-v-burgos/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2001).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span> (2010).</p>\n<p>Berk argues that the evidence supports no more than a finding that his internet communications with Ashley Dame \"never went beyond mere preparation.\" We disagree. The trial court could easily have found that the explicit communications with a person whom Berk thought was the father of a 12-year old girl about \"renting her out,\" along with the concomitant request to see what the girl thought of the idea, were part of an attempt to achieve the requisite mental state in the minor. Beyond that, we have little trouble concluding that actually meeting with the girl's father and discussing with him graphic sexual details and prices goes far beyond \"mere preparation.\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>To be sure, the evidence against Berk with respect to the Jensen matter is not as clear-cut. The record reflects, however, that after responding to Dorothy Jensen's classified ad, Berk not only steered the ensuing conversation away from Jensen's search for housing and towards paying for sex with Jensen's daughter, but he also helped to propel the scheme by finding and sending to Jensen leads about homes that he said she could \"rent,\" even though he was not in the real estate business. In addition, Berk exchanged or attempted to exchange photos with Jensen, and he proposed meeting Jensen in order to discuss details of his \"plans\" to help Jensen earn money for housing. Even though, unlike in the Dame matter, no such meeting ever took place, it was only the fortuity of Jensen seeing Berk's face and <i>modus operandi</i> on television that prevented it. These actions go beyond mere \"talk\" or \"hot air.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Gladish,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1401205\"><a href=\"/opinion/1401205/united-states-v-gladish/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span>, 647 (7th Cir.2008) (overturning conviction after <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> finding that explicit sexual talk alone was not a \"substantial step\"). Nor, as Berk suggests, is travel to a meeting necessarily an element of an attempt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770640\"><a href=\"/opinion/770640/united-states-v-robert-owen-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 639-40 (6th Cir.2000) (finding sufficient evidence of \"substantial step\" where defendant did not meet with minors, but proposed doing so in order to have sex with them).</p>\n<p>In sum, the indictment was not fatally defective and the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions in both the Jensen and Dame matters. Berk also interposed a challenge to his sentence that is dependent on invalidating his conviction. The predicate having failed, we need not address the argument. <i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  When a listing is posted on Craigslist, an anonymous email address appears with the ad. Responses are automatically re-directed to an email address specified by the individual posting the ad, who can then choose to break the anonymity by responding.\n</p>\n<p>Printouts of the emails discussed herein were entered into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  Given the general informality of the electronic communication at issue, we reproduce verbatim the text of the exchange.</p>\n<p>[3]  Dame's daughter was actually eight at the time.</p>\n<p>[4]  A transcript of the Berk-York meeting, taken from the hidden recorder, was entered into evidence.</p>\n<p>[5]  We bypass the government's assertion that Berk waived the lack of notice issue by failing to timely raise it. He also argues that the lack of specificity in the charging document subjected him to a substantial risk of being convicted on a basis other than the one on which the grand jury indicted him. Besides being waived for lack of development in the opening brief, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990), this claim is also waived because it was not made at all in the district court. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B) and 12(e) (motion alleging indictment defect, other than indictment's failure to invoke court's jurisdiction or to state an offense, is waived if not raised before trial).</p>\n<p>[6]  The government also notes that Berk was arrested on state charges of criminal solicitation after he was apprehended in the Dunkin Donuts parking lot.</p>\n<p>[7]  Berk asks us to follow <i>United States v. Mannava,</i> in which the Seventh Circuit held that \"the elements of the offense under [the state] statute must[] be elements of the federal offense....\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1210801\"><a href=\"/opinion/1210801/united-states-v-mannava/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span>, 415 (7th Cir.2009). In that case, the indictment noted that the charged sexual activity would have violated Indiana law. <i>Id.</i> at 414. A bill of particulars specified two possible statutes. <i>Id.</i> The court held that \"it was an error to allow the jury to convict the defendant without a unanimous determination that the defendant had violated one or both of the Indiana statutes....\" <i>Id. But see </i><i>United States v. Hart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213491\"><a href=\"/opinion/213491/united-states-v-hart/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span>, 855-56 (6th Cir.2011) (rejecting <i>Mannava</i> and holding that \"the underlying [state] criminal offenses are not elements of the federal offense\"). <i>Mannava</i> is not of much help in the circumstances of this case, because the concern in that case was that a jury might not reach a unanimous verdict. Berk received a bench trial.</p>\n<p>[8]  Testifying in his own defense, Berk claimed that he had no interest in actually having sex with the minors, but was instead engaging in a form of \"role playing.\" The district court, as finder of fact, was, of course, free to reject Berk's defense. <i>United States v. Ford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195344\"><a href=\"/opinion/195344/united-states-v-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 383 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that finder of fact is free to reject a defendant's explanation of events and that \"it is not the province of this court to reweigh conflicting testimony or to make credibility determinations.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
