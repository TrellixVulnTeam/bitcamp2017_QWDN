The court denied the motion.\n\n            Hitchcock now appeals from the judgment, contending for\n\nthe first time that ambiguities in the policy raised disputed\n\nissues of fact entitling it to trial.          Hitchcock did not advance\n\nthis contention in its opposition to USLife’s motion for summary\n\njudgment or in its motion for reconsideration.               Because of this\n\nfailure and the absence of \"extraordinary circumstances,\" which\n\nHitchcock does not claim to exist, we affirm.              Clauson v. Smith,\n\n823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Landrau-Romero v. Banco\n\nPopular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 2000); United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).2\n\n                                     II.\n\n           Our   affirmance    on    the    basis   of     our   long-standing\n\nforfeiture doctrine visits no prejudice on Hitchcock because its\n\nposition is wholly without merit. USLife issued a group disability\n\n\n\n     2\n      Hitchcock also appeals from the district court’s denial of\nits Rule 56(f) motion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). It asserts error\nbecause of ambiguities in the policy. We reject the assertion both\nbecause it is barred by waiver, as noted above, and because\nHitchcock cites us to no abuse of discretion. Pub. Serv. Co. of\nN.H. v. Hudson Light & Power, 938 F.2d 338, 346 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                      -3-\n\finsurance    policy     to    the   University       Physicians       Trust    (Trust).\n\nHitchcock was one of a number of participating employers who had\n\nentered into agreements with the Trust, entitling it to selected\n\ncoverage provided by the policy.                 The policy described available\n\nbenefits and options, setting out general provisions, exclusions,\n\nand means by which coverage could be terminated.                   With respect to\n\nthe latter, the policy provided that “USLife reserves the right to\n\nend this policy on any policy anniversary after the first.”                           The\n\nrights under the policy of each participating employer such as\n\nHitchcock were further defined in discrete plans of insurance by\n\nwhich that employer obtained coverage under the policy.                               The\n\nparticular        employer’s    plan      specifies     the     premium       for     that\n\nemployer’s coverage and varies with the coverages elected.\n\n            Hitchcock’s        dealings      with    respect     to    its     plan    of\n\ninsurance were entirely with Medical Group Financial Services, Inc.\n\n(MGFS), the settlor and Trust administrator.                     It had no direct\n\ncontact with USLife.           In December 1997, MGFS offered Hitchcock a\n\nnew premium rate under its plan of insurance “guaranteed for three\n\nyears,” to end on December 31, 2000.                On December 21, 1998, USLife\n\nnotified MGFS that the policy would be canceled on the next\n\nanniversary date, July 1, 1999.\n\n             We    agree     with   the    district     court    that     the       policy\n\nunambiguously gave USLife the right to cancel the policy on any\n\nanniversary date after the first.                 The rate guarantee, on which\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fHitchcock would hang its hat, was the product of a wholly unrelated\n\ntransaction, to wit, MGFS’s negotiation of rates with Hitchcock\n\nunder the particular plan of insurance by which it secured coverage\n\nunder the policy. The policy deals specifically with the effect of\n\nrate guarantees on USLife’s rights under the policy.   It provides\n\nthat USLife may change a premium on the day following the rate\n\nguarantee date specified in an employer’s plan of insurance. Thus,\n\nthe policy unambiguously spells out USLife’s obligation under the\n\npolicy: it must provide coverage at the agreed-upon rate for the\n\nperiod of the rate guarantee unless it cancels the (entire) policy\n\nat the next anniversary date.    Given these specific provisions,\n\nnothing in the policy gives rise to an issue whether Hitchcock’s\n\nrate guarantee under its plan modified USLife’s right to terminate\n\nthe policy.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
