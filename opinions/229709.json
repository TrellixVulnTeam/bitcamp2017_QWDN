They moved for dismissal of the indictment on the ground that the district court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter, in that the matters alleged are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended, 29 U.S.C.A. &#167; 151 et seq., which to that extent has superseded the Sherman Act.  It was also claimed that the subject matter of the indictment is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior under the Fisheries Co-operative Marketing Act, 15 U.S.C.A. &#167; 521, 522, which to that extent has superseded the Sherman Act.  The district court entered an order denying the motion to dismiss.  From this order an appeal was taken.  We dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction by order entered June 4, 1952, on the ground that the order appealed from was merely an interlocutory order in the course of a criminal proceeding, whereas this court has jurisdiction of appeals in criminal cases, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, only from 'final decisions' of the district courts.  In support of our order dismissing the appeal we cited Heike v. United States, 1910, 217 U.S. 423, 30 S.Ct. 539, 54 L.Ed. 821; Catlin v. United States, 1945, 324 U.S. 229, 236, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911; Dowling Bros. Distilling Co. v. United States, 6 Cir., 1946, 328 U.S. 848, 66 S.Ct. 1120, 90 L.Ed. 1622; United States v.
