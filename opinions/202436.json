Jacobo Vázquez-Mieses (\"Vázquez\"), an alien\n\nwho   was    previously   deported     following   a   drug   trafficking\n\nconviction, pled guilty to reentering the United States without the\n\nrequisite permission and was sentenced to 46 months' imprisonment\n\n(the bottom of the applicable guideline range)1 and three years'\n\nsupervised release.       On appeal, Vázquez does not dispute the\n\naccuracy of the guideline calculations or argue that his sentence\n\nis substantively unreasonable under United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220, 261 (2005). Rather, his arguments are more procedural in\n\nnature.     For the reasons discussed below, we find those arguments\n\nunpersuasive.\n\n            His first contention--that the district court violated 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(c) by failing to state the reasons for the sentence\n\nin open court--is easily dispatched.       Where, as here, the sentence\n\nimposed is within the guideline range, the correctness of that\n\nrange is undisputed, and the breadth of the range is less than 24\n\nmonths, section 3553(c) does not require \"[a] district court          . .\n\n. to cite any reason for sentencing a defendant within [that\n\n\n      1\n      That range, which was not disputed in the district court and\nis not challenged on appeal, was computed as follows:      a total\noffense level of 21 (base offense level of 8, U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(a)\n(Nov. 2004 ed.), plus 16 levels because the sentence for one of his\nprior felony drug trafficking convictions exceeded 13 months, id.\n§ 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), minus 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility,\nid. § 3A1.1(a)) combined with a criminal history category of III (6\ncriminal history points for two prior sentences of imprisonment\nexceeding one year and one month, id. § 4A1.1(a)) yielded a range\nof 46 to 57 months' imprisonment, id. ch. 5, pt.

O'Connell, 252 F.3d 524, 529 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n           Although reasonableness review, post-Booker, does make it\n\n\"important for [the reviewing court] to have the district court's\n\nreasons for its sentence\" even if the sentence is within a narrow\n\nguideline range, United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), \"a court's reasoning can often be\n\ninferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained\n\nin the pre-sentence report with what the judge did,\" id.             Here,\n\nthe   reasons   for   the   sentence   are   readily   apparent   from   the\n\nsentencing transcript as supplemented by the presentence report.\n\n           At sentencing, the court responded to the mitigating\n\ncircumstances proffered by the defendant--that he was addicted to\n\ndrugs when he committed his prior offenses but had been drug-free\n\nin recent years and that the instant offense was motivated by a\n\ndesire to improve his financial situation--by reminding him of his\n\nextensive criminal record.         The court again referred to that\n\nrecord, \"without giving the specific details,\"2 before announcing\n\nhis sentence. Despite that record, the court adopted both parties'\n\nrecommendations to sentence Vázquez to the bottom of the guideline\n\n\n      2\n      As detailed in the presentence report, that record included\nrepeated drug trafficking offenses, some of which were only\nslightly too old to be counted in calculating his criminal history\nscore.    The only gaps in that history occurred when he was\nincarcerated or deported following two previous illegal entries.\n\n                                   -3-\n\frange.       In exercising such leniency, the court was presumably\n\ninfluenced by defense counsel's argument that a sentence at the\n\nlower end of the guideline range \"would provide adequate punishment\n\nfor the offense committed,\" Vázquez's own explanation of the\n\ncircumstances          of     his   instant    and    prior    offenses,    and    the\n\ngovernment's        statement        that     Vázquez   had      been   \"very,    very\n\ncooperative\" in quickly accepting responsibility and expressing\n\nremorse for his offense.              No further explanation was required.\n\n               Although Vázquez now proffers an additional ground for\n\nleniency--that the reduced sentence he would have received had he\n\nbeen       sentenced     in    a    \"fast-track\"     district3    would    have   been\n\n\"sufficient\" to serve the purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a)--the district court was not required to address that or any\n\nother potential ground for leniency that was not brought to its\n\nattention.      United States v. Alli, 444 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nMoreover,      it   is      questionable      whether   such     an   argument    would\n\nconstitute a valid reason for leniency in any event, United States\n\nv.

United States v.\n\nVazquez-Molina, 389 F.3d 54, 57-58 (1st Cir. 2004), vacated on\n\nother     grounds,     544   U.S.   946   (2005).       Under   that    appellant-\n\nunfriendly standard, \"an appellant must demonstrate:                   '(1) that an\n\nerror occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only\n\n(3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4)\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.'\"         Id. (quoting United States v. Duarte, 246\n\nF.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n             Even assuming that these misstatements satisfy the first\n\ntwo prongs of the plain error standard, Vázquez cannot show the\n\nprejudice necessary to satisfy the remaining two prongs.                      He does\n\nnot     claim   that    he    would   not       have   pled   guilty    had     those\n\nmisstatements not been made at that stage.                      By the time of\n\nsentencing, those mistakes had been corrected in the presentence\n\n\n\n      4\n      In fact, although probation is not recommended by the\nguidelines, U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A; § 5B1.1, probation is allowed by\nstatute for this Class C felony offense, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(a)(3),\n3561; and the maximum term of supervised release recommended by the\nguidelines is three years, id. § 5D1.2(a)(2).\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\freport, which Vázquez had reviewed without objection and which the\n\ncourt relied upon in sentencing.       Given the court's expressed\n\nconcern about the seriousness of Vázquez's criminal record and the\n\nguidelines' suggestion of a sentence of up to almost six years, any\n\nsuggestion that the court could have been persuaded to impose a\n\nprobationary sentence, instead of the 46-month prison sentence\n\nactually imposed, is fanciful.   The fact that the court ultimately\n\nimposed a three-year, rather than a two-year, term of supervised\n\nrelease is also inconsequential, given that Vázquez will likely be\n\ndeported long before the additional year begins.\n\n          Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.
