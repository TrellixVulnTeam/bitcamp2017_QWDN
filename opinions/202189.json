Steven J. McAuliffe, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief for\nthe defendant, appellant.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, and Thomas\nP. Colantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for the appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           May 3, 2006\n\f              Per Curiam.      After pleading guilty to two counts of\n\npossessing and distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1), defendant Luis Caraballo was sentenced, under\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), to nine years'\n\nimprisonment, three and a half years below the bottom of the\n\nadvisory guidelines range.           In this appeal, Caraballo challenges\n\nthe    nine-year    sentence    as   unreasonably       high   because      various\n\nmitigating      circumstances--including,         primarily,     his     multiple\n\nserious medical problems--make the sentence longer than necessary\n\nto    serve   the   purposes   of    sentencing   set    forth   in    18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a).      We review the sentence for unreasonableness, Booker,\n\n543 U.S. at 260-61, under the standards set forth in United States\n\nv. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n              Caraballo's challenge to his sentence rests primarily on\n\nhis contention that the district court gave insufficient weight to\n\nhis medical impairments, particularly the deterioration of both\n\nhips, which causes him considerable pain and impairs his mobility.\n\nAccording to Caraballo, this medical condition makes him less\n\nlikely to commit future crimes, particularly violent ones; makes\n\nhim less able to cope with prison life; clouds any hope for a\n\nproductive life after release from prison; and could best be\n\ntreated, after release, by the Veterans Administration, rather than\n\nby the Bureau of Prisons.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            In fact, the district court afforded considerable weight\n\nto   Caraballo's     medical   condition,      which       it    characterized      as\n\n\"obviously a serious situation.\"          Indeed, that condition was the\n\ncourt's    primary    rationale   for   imposing       a    sentence     below     the\n\nguideline    sentencing    range.       (The    other        rationale       was   the\n\nrelatively    routine,    street-level      nature         of    the   offenses    of\n\nconviction.) However, the district court felt that other statutory\n\nfactors--including the \"public['s] need[] to be protected from\n\n[Caraballo's] demonstrably violent personality,\" see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a)(2)(C), and the need to account for his \"terrible . . .\n\nviolent record,\"1 see id. § 3553(a)(1)--warranted \"a substantial\n\nsentence . . . beyond that which one would obtain for this type of\n\nsmall drug deal.\" In reaching that conclusion, the judge expressed\n\nskepticism that Caraballo's medical condition, while serious, would\n\nprevent him from continuing his lifelong pattern of domestic\n\nviolence and implicitly discredited Caraballo's argument that his\n\nforced    sobriety,   while    incarcerated,     would          cure   the   lifetime\n\nalcohol abuse that triggered his violent conduct in the past.\n\nAccordingly, rather than impose a sentence within the guideline\n\nsentencing range of 151 to 188 months (approximately 12½ to 15½\n\nyears), the district court imposed a lesser, but still substantial,\n\nsentence of 9 years, which it believed adequate to punish Caraballo\n\n\n      1\n      Caraballo's nine prior convictions included six instances of\ndomestic violence, two involving deadly weapons, and one instance\nof threatening to harm a police officer and his family.\n\n                                    -3-\n\ffor his conduct while still giving him hope that he can be a\n\nproductive citizen when released.     That determination was not\n\nunreasonable.\n\n          Caraballo's remaining argument focuses on the application\n\nof the career offender guideline, USSG § 4B1.1, which largely\n\naccounted for his guideline sentencing range of 151 to 188 months.\n\nCaraballo does not dispute that the career offender guideline was\n\nproperly calculated and applied, given his prior record of at least\n\ntwo \"felony\" convictions for violent crimes, as the term \"felony\"\n\nis defined in the guidelines.    See id. § 4B1.2, comment. (n.1)\n\n(defining \"prior felony conviction\" as \"a prior . . . federal or\n\nstate conviction for an offense punishable by . . . imprisonment\n\nfor a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense\n\nis specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual\n\nsentence imposed\").2   He argues, however, that a sentence of less\n\nthan nine years was necessary to avoid the purportedly \"unwarranted\n\nsentencing disparity,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), between his sentence\n\nand the sentences received by defendants who are prosecuted for\n\nsimilar offenses in other states.\n\n          The government disputes the factual predicate for that\n\nargument, contending, with statutory support, that at least two of\n\nCaraballo's prior convictions, those involving deadly weapons,\n\n\n     2\n      Caraballo's prior Massachusetts assault convictions counted\nas felonies for this purpose because, under Massachusetts law,\nthose offenses were punishable by imprisonment for up to 2½ years.\n\n                                -4-\n\fwould be deemed felonies for purposes of the career offender\n\nguideline if committed in other states (including New Hampshire).\n\nMore important, any disparity caused by application of the career\n\noffender guideline is one that results from the policy choices made\n\nby Congress and implemented by the Sentencing Commission.   See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 994(h) (directing the Sentencing Commission to \"assure\n\nthat the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at\n\nor near the maximum term authorized\" for career offenders).    The\n\ndistrict court therefore permissibly rejected any such disparity as\n\na basis for further reducing Caraballo's sentence.    See Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 519; United States v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 62-65\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Given the district court's \"reasoned explanation\" for\n\nthe sentence imposed, Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519, and the\n\ndeference due to its \"on the scene\" judgment, id., we conclude that\n\na 9-year sentence, 3½ years below the bottom of the advisory\n\nguideline sentencing range, was not unreasonably high in light of\n\nthe relevant statutory factors. Cf. United States v. Scherrer, No.\n\n05-1705, 2006 WL 932550, at *5 (1st Cir. Apr. 12, 2006) (en banc)\n\n(upholding an adequately explained sentence 2 3/4 years above the\n\nguideline sentencing range); United States v. Smith, No. 05-1725,\n\n2006 WL 893622, at *6 (1st Cir. Apr. 7, 2006) (vacating an\n\ninadequately explained sentence less than half the minimum of the\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fguideline   sentencing   range).     Accordingly,   the   sentence   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f",
