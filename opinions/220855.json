Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Boudin and Howard, Circuit Judges\n                    and Barbadoro,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Lawrence G. Green, with whom Lynn C. Norton and Burns &\nLevinson LLP were on brief, for appellant.\n     Andrew H. Schapiro, with whom Christopher J. Houpt and Mayer\nBrown LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             July 13, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     Appellee Sheldon Adelson brought\n\nthis declaratory action to determine rights under an oral contract\n\nthat he had negotiated with appellant Moshe Hananel.                 In the\n\ndistrict court Hananel argued that the agreement, pursuant to which\n\nhe was employed by a company owned by Adelson, entitled him to\n\nobtain a twelve percent investment in Adelson's casino venture in\n\nMacau.   Adelson claimed that their agreement was not so broad as to\n\ncontemplate the Macau investment option.           Rather, the contract\n\nlimited Hananel to reaping twelve percent of net profits from high-\n\ntech   sector   investments   in   Israel   that   had    been   discovered,\n\nrecommended and supervised by Hananel, and that were realized while\n\nhe was employed by Adelson's company.\n\n           In a prior appeal of this matter, Adelson v. Hananel, 510\n\nF.3d 43 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Adelson I\"), we reversed the district\n\ncourt's forum non conveniens dismissal, but we did uphold the\n\ncourt's determination that, under the prima facie standard, Hananel\n\nwas subject to specific personal jurisdiction.           After a three-week\n\nbench trial on remand, the district court ruled in favor of\n\nAdelson, declaring that Hananel did not hold an option to obtain a\n\ntwelve percent interest in Adelson's Macau casino.               Adelson v.\n\nHananel, 641 F.Supp.2d 65 (D. Mass. 2009) (\"Adelson II\").           Hananel\n\nappeals from this judgment, arguing that the district court lacked\n\npersonal jurisdiction, erroneously assigned to him the burden of\n\nproof, abused its discretion regarding a missing witness, and made\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffactual errors regarding the formation and performance of the\n\ncontract.   We affirm.\n\n                             I. Background\n\n            Hananel is a native, citizen, and resident of Israel.\n\nAdelson is a U.S. citizen and a permanent resident and domiciliary\n\nof Nevada, where he votes, owns property, and holds a driver's\n\nlicense.    Adelson is also a native of Massachusetts and a current\n\nMassachusetts homeowner. He has worldwide business connections and\n\ninvestments, and he owns a warren of businesses known as the\n\n\"Interface Group.\"\n\n            On the basis of the disputed oral contract negotiated\n\nwith Adelson, Hananel worked for one of Adelson's companies,\n\nInterface Partners International, Ltd. (\"IPI\"), from approximately\n\n1996 to 2000.   IPI is a Delaware corporation that Adelson founded\n\nin 1994 for the purpose of investing in Israel, with a particular\n\nfocus on Israel's high-tech sector.\n\n            During the time period relevant to this case, IPI had\n\noffices in Needham, Massachusetts, and Ramat Gan, Israel.    Hananel\n\nwas based in Israel and was responsible for seeking investment\n\nopportunities there.     Although IPI did not have regular employees\n\nworking in Needham, it received ongoing legal and financial advice\n\nthrough frequent communications with one of the Interface Group\n\ncompanies co-located there, Interface Group Massachusetts (\"IGM\").\n\nIGM personnel in the Needham office who provided such advice\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fincluded IGM's general counsel Paul Roberts, who also described\n\nhimself as \"counsel to IGI\", and IGM's CFO Stephen O'Connor. There\n\nwas testimony at trial that IPI's funding customarily came from\n\nAdelson's personal account in Las Vegas, Nevada, but not before\n\npassing   through   the   IPI    Massachusetts      \"office\"      as   a   capital\n\ncontribution to IPI Massachusetts that was then \"lent\" to IPI\n\nIsrael. Hananel made periodic calls to the Needham office and sent\n\nfax   transmissions    there     at   least    monthly,     including      budget\n\nproposals for approval.         He made one brief visit to the Needham\n\noffice in late 1995, just before commencing his duties for IPI, and\n\nhe later attended a meeting in Massachusetts to seek business\n\nopportunities in his role as chairman of a company in which IPI had\n\ninvested.\n\n            The   parties'   evidence       about   the   terms   of   Hananel's\n\ncompensation was irreconcilable.        As the district court accurately\n\ndescribed the testimony:\n\n      In the discussions regarding Hananel's employment, it is\n      undisputed that Adelson and Hananel agreed he would have\n      a salary of $100,000 a year.      They also agreed that\n      Hananel would somehow receive 12% of the investments with\n      which he was involved while at IPI . . . . Adelson and\n      Hananel have different memories of the details of the\n      twelve percent. Adelson testified that they agreed that\n      Hananel would receive 12% of the net profits only of high\n      tech   investments   in  Israel   that   Hananel   found,\n      recommended, and supervised and which came to fruition\n      while he was employed by IPI, but only so long as he\n      remained employed there.    Hananel testified that they\n      agreed that he would receive \"options\" of up to 12\n      percent on any investment he or the Israeli office\n      \"initiated\" outside the United States without any other\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f     geographic or time limitations so long as Hananel put up\n     the proportionate costs of the investment at any point.\nAdelson II, 641 F.Supp.2d at 72.\n\n            In this appeal, Hananel argues, as to jurisdiction, that\n\ndifferences between the prima facie facts determined before the\n\nfirst appeal and the facts as later found by the district court at\n\nthe merits trial undermine our previous decision on personal\n\njurisdiction.   He draws attention to prior references, by both the\n\ndistrict    court   and   by     us,       to    Adelson   being   a   resident   of\n\nMassachusetts when in fact he was a resident of Nevada, and he\n\nemphasizes that at trial the district court concluded that the\n\ncontract was formed in Israel rather than in Massachusetts.                       As\n\nnoted, Hananel also presses claims that the district court erred in\n\nassigning the burden of proof to him rather than to Adelson; that\n\nit should have ordered an adverse inference based on the \"missing\n\nwitness\"    rule;   and   that       the    court    misapprehended      the   facts\n\nsurrounding both the formation of and his performance under the\n\ncontract.\n\n                               II.     Jurisdiction\n\n            General jurisdiction over Hananel was not alleged, and he\n\nargues that the district court also lacked specific jurisdiction\n\nover him.    We review the jurisdictional issue de novo.                 Barret v.\n\nLombardi, 239 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 2001).                 We concluded in Adelson\n\nI that the district court had personal jurisdiction over Hananel\n\nunder the prima facie standard, and that Massachusetts was not an\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\finconvenient forum.   Adelson I, 510 F.3d 43.   We are not persuaded\n\nthat the facts as found at trial undermine our previous decision,\n\nand we conclude that Hananel's Massachusetts contacts support the\n\ndistrict court's exercise of personal jurisdiction.\n\n          To establish specific personal jurisdiction over Hananel,\n\nAdelson \"must demonstrate that the Massachusetts long-arm statute\n\ngrants jurisdiction over Hananel and that the exercise of that\n\njurisdiction comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment.\" Adelson I, 510 F.3d at 48 (internal citation omitted).\n\nWe have construed the Massachusetts long-arm statute1 as being\n\ncoextensive with the limits permitted by the Constitution. We thus\n\nturn directly to the constitutional test for determining specific\n\njurisdiction, see Daynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &\n\nPoole, P.A., 290 F.3d 42, 52 (1st Cir. 2002), which has \"three\n\ndistinct components, namely, relatedness, purposeful availment\n\n(sometimes called 'minimum contacts'), and reasonableness,\" Hannon\n\nv. Beard, 524 F.3d 275, 282 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal citation\n\nomitted). See also Astro-Med, Inc., v. Nihon Kohden America, Inc.,\n\n591 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The statute provides that \"[a] court may exercise personal\njurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to\na cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's\ntransacting any business in this commonwealth.\" Mass. Gen. Laws\nch. 223A, § 3(a).\n\n                                 -6-\n\f                             A. Relatedness\n\n          To   demonstrate   \"relatedness,\"   Adelson   must   show   \"'a\n\ndemonstrable nexus between [his] claims and [Hananel's] forum-based\n\nactivities, such . . . [that] the litigation itself is founded\n\ndirectly on those activities.'\"     Hannon, 524 F.3d at 280 (quoting\n\nMass. Sch. of Law at Andover v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st\n\nCir. 1998)).    \"[T]he relatedness test is a 'flexible, relaxed\n\nstandard,'\" N. Laminate Sales, Inc. v. Davis, 403 F.3d 14, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)), and the analysis focuses on the relationship between the\n\ndefendant and the forum.     Hannon, 524 F.3d at 283 (citing Sawtelle\n\nv. Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381, 1389 (1st Cir. 1995)); see also Goodyear\n\nDunlop Tires Operations S.A. v. Brown, No. 10-76, slip op. at 2,\n\n2011 WL 2518815, at *3 (U.S. June 27, 2011) (\"Specific jurisdiction\n\n. . . depends on an 'affiliatio[n] between the forum and the\n\nunderlying controversy'\"); J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro,\n\nNo. 09-1343, slip op. at 6, 2011 WL 2518811, at *6 (U.S. June 27,\n\n2011) (Kennedy, J.) (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia,\n\nS.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414, n.8 (1984)) (\"submission through\n\ncontact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify\n\nspecific jurisdiction 'in a suit arising out of or related to the\n\ndefendant's contacts with the forum'\"). Because this is a contract\n\ndispute, in examining the defendant's relationship to the forum \"we\n\nlook to whether 'the defendant's activity in the forum state was\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\finstrumental   either    in    the   formation   of    the   contract    or   its\n\nbreach.'\"    Adams v. Adams, 601 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting\n\nAdelson I, 510 F.3d at 49).           We may also consider whether the\n\ndefendant    was    \"subject    to   substantial      control    and     ongoing\n\nconnection to [Massachusetts] in the performance of the contract.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); cf. Hahn v.\n\nVermont Law School, 698 F.2d 48, 49 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"less [than\n\nsubstantial contacts are] required to support jurisdiction when the\n\ncause of action arises from the defendant's contacts with the forum\n\n. . . than when it does not.\").2\n\n            Here,   Hananel's    contacts   to   the    forum   are     directly\n\nrelated to his fulfillment of the terms of his employment contract\n\nas he claims them to be.        As the district court recognized:\n\n     [R]egardless of the contract's core terms, the parties'\n     actual course of dealing connects the contract to\n     Massachusetts: Hananel was in regular contact with\n     Interface employees in Massachusetts, the money that\n     funded Hananel's work came through Massachusetts, and\n     Hananel's budgets were routinely faxed to the office in\n     Massachusetts. . . .    This is enough to satisfy the\n     relatedness prong.\n\nAdelson II, 641 F.Supp.2d at 78.\n\n\n     2\n      Although, as Hananel points out, the district court concluded\nthat the agreement was governed by Israeli law, this conclusion\ndoes not affect the outcome of our jurisdictional analysis because\nthe issue before us is one of personal jurisdiction, not choice of\nlaw. J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, No. 09-1343, slip\nop. at 10, 2011 WL 2518811, at *9 (U.S. June 27, 2011) (Kennedy,\nJ.) (citing Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 254 (1958)); see also\nCambridge Literary Properties, Ltd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik\nG.m.b.H, 295 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2002) (contrasting personal\njurisdiction analysis with choice of law analysis).\n\n                                      -8-\n\f               In addition, the record shows that Hananel visited the\n\nMassachusetts Interface office prior to beginning formal, full time\n\nemployment with IPI in January 2006. Later, while employed by IPI,\n\nHananel attended a board meeting in Massachusetts as a direct\n\nresult of an IPI investment.3\n\n               Although Hananel does not deny that as manager of the IPI\n\nIsrael office he had regular contact with the Needham office, he\n\nargues that his Massachusetts \"activities were minor administrative\n\ntasks       insufficient    to   warrant   jurisdiction.\"   This     argument\n\nunderstates his managerial role in IPI and the importance of the\n\nMassachusetts funding connection to the finances of IPI Israel. As\n\ndiscussed in greater detail below, we disagree with Hananel's\n\ncharacterization       of    his   Massachusetts   activities   as   \"purely\n\nincidental contacts\" and agree with the district court that they\n\nevince the relationship between Hananel's actions under the oral\n\ncontract and the forum of Massachusetts.\n\n                            B. Purposeful Availment\n\n               For there to be personal jurisdiction over Hananel, his\n\ncontacts must \"represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of\n\nconducting activities in [Massachusetts], thereby invoking the\n\nbenefits and protections of [Massachusetts's] laws and making [his]\n\n\n        3\n      During his tenure with IPI, Hananel recommended that it\ninvest in the tech company, IMDSoft. After the investment Hananel\nwas named chairman of the board of IMDSoft and traveled to Andover,\nMassachusetts, in that capacity with the goal of advancing business\npartnership opportunities for IMDSoft.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fpresence before [Massachusetts'] courts foreseeable.\" Daynard, 290\n\nF.3d at 60; see also J. McIntyre Machinery, slip op. at 11, 2011 WL\n\n2518811, at *9 (specific jurisdiction calls for plaintiff to\n\nestablish that defendant \"engaged in conduct purposefully directed\n\nat the forum\"); id. (\"The question is whether a defendant has\n\nfollowed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy\n\nexisting within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign, so that the\n\nsovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment\n\nconcerning that conduct.\").\n\n           Hananel directed regular administrative and financial\n\nconduct toward Massachusetts, and his contacts with the state were\n\nvoluntary and the result of more than just a single event or\n\ntransaction.    We see no reason to deviate from our previous\n\nconclusion   that   \"given   that   it     was   Hananel   who   sought   this\n\nemployment contract with a company whose key officers were all\n\nlocated in Massachusetts and whose financial accounts were all\n\nadministered out of Massachusetts, the court properly concluded\n\nthat Hananel had purposefully availed himself of Massachusetts\n\nlaw.\"   Adelson I, 510 F.3d at 50; cf. J. McIntyre Machinery, slip\n\nop. at 11, 2011 WL 2518811, at *9 (no specific jurisdiction where\n\ndefendant had no office in the forum, never \"sent any employees\n\nto[] the [forum]\" and \"does not have a single contact with [the\n\nforum] short of the\" sole piece of equipment at issue in the suit).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f            That Hananel's December 1995 trip to Massachusetts was\n\nbrief and its purpose was not found to be substantially related to\n\nnegotiation of the agreement does not detract from the conclusion\n\nthat the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate.                  Hananel \"need\n\nnot have been physically present in [Massachusetts] in order to\n\nhave 'transacted business' there\" for purposes of establishing\n\nminimum contacts.        Hannon, 524 F.3d at 281 (citing Fairview Mach.\n\n& Tool Co., Inc. v. Oakbrook Intern., Inc., 56 F.Supp.2d 134, 138\n\n(D. Mass. 1999)) (holding that even though defendant had not been\n\nphysically present in Massachusetts, \"contacts that [he] would have\n\nhad   to   make   to   arrange   for    [prisoner's]     transfer    .   .   .   to\n\nMassachusetts are sufficient to constitute 'transacting business'\n\nunder the broadly-construed long-arm statute\").4\n\n            Here, as in Hannon, there was purposeful availment where\n\nHananel's    business     activities     for   IPI    involved,     inter    alia,\n\n\"communication     and    interaction    between      [him]   in   [Israel]      and\n\n[staff] in Massachusetts.\" See Hannon, 524 F.3d at 281. Affirming\n\nthe district court's relevant factual findings, we conclude that\n\nHananel's    faxes,      money   transfers,     and     meetings     demonstrate\n\nsufficient communications and interactions with Massachusetts to\n\n\n\n      4\n      We have construed the Massachusetts statute broadly and\n\"'do[] not require that the defendant have engaged in commercial\nactivity.

Harrods Ltd., 790\nF.2d 978, 982 (1st Cir. 1986)).\n\n                                       -11-\n\fsatisfy us that Hananel had at least minimum contacts with the\n\nforum      and     that   these      contacts    were   not   \"random,     isolated    or\n\nfortuitous.\"           See Adelson I, 510 F.3d at 50.\n\n                                     C. Reasonableness\n\n                  To   examine     reasonableness,      we    consider     the   gestalt\n\nfactors:               \"(1)      [Hananel's]        burden     of     appearing,      (2)\n\n[Massachusetts's]             interest      in   adjudicating       the   dispute,    (3)\n\n[Adelson's] interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,\n\n(4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective\n\nresolution of the controversy, and [5] the common interests of all\n\nsovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\"                         Adelson I,\n\n510 F.3d at 51; see also N. Laminate Sales, 403 F.3d at 26 (citing\n\nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 477 (1985)).\n\n                  First, because Hananel has not demonstrated a \"special or\n\nunusual burden\" in staging a defense in Massachusetts over and\n\nabove that of doing so in any foreign jurisdiction, we conclude\n\nthat       this    factor     does    not   weigh    against    jurisdiction.         See\n\nPritzker, 42 F.3d at 64 (\"[I]nsofar as staging a defense in a\n\nforeign jurisdiction is almost always inconvenient and/or costly,\n\nwe   think        this    factor     is   only   meaningful     where     a   party   can\n\ndemonstrate some kind of special or unusual burden.\").5\n\n\n       5\n      As we have recognized, Hananel has certain health issues that\naffect his lifestyle, such as his diabetes and legal blindness.\nAdelson I, 510 F.3d at 51. But, these issues would affect him no\nmatter where this dispute were tried.       Based on the evidence\npresented at trial, we do not see reason to deviate from our prior\n\n                                             -12-\n\f          Second,    Hananel   emphasizes   the   fact   that   both   the\n\ndistrict court and this court in the previous appeal were mistaken\n\nwhen they concluded that Adelson was a Massachusetts resident and\n\ndomiciliary, when in fact he was a resident and domiciliary of\n\nNevada.   In presenting this argument, Hananel stakes too much on\n\nthe importance of Adelson's state of residence to the personal\n\njurisdiction analysis.    Although this factual conclusion may have\n\ncontributed to our original weighing of Massachusetts' interest in\n\nhearing the matter, Adelson's residency and domicile are not alone\n\ndispositive of personal jurisdiction and there are other facts that\n\nsupport Massachusetts' interests in the matter.\n\n          When   previously     we   connected     Adelson's     assumed\n\nMassachusetts residency with Massachusetts' interests in the case,\n\nwe also noted that \"[Massachusetts'] interest . . . is further\n\nheightened by the involvement of IPI's executive officers who are\n\nemployed in Massachusetts and of funds which are held and managed\n\nin Massachusetts.\"   Adelson I, 510 F.3d at 51.     Besides, given the\n\nrelatedness and purposeful availment demonstrated here, the weight\n\nof this one factor within \"reasonablenss\" is slight.       Sawtelle, 70\n\nF.3d at 1394 (internal quotation marks omitted) (\"[T]he weaker the\n\nplaintiff's showings on the first two prongs (relatedness and\n\npurposeful availment), the less a defendant need show in terms of\n\n\nconclusion that these issues would not make defense in\nMassachusetts a \"special or unusual\" burden compared to other\nforeign jurisdictions. Id.\n\n                                 -13-\n\funreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction.   The reverse is equally\n\ntrue: an especially strong showing of reasonableness may serve to\n\nfortify a borderline showing of relatedness and purposefulness.\").\n\n          Third, Adelson demonstrated his interest in obtaining\n\nconvenient and effective relief through the federal courts in\n\nMassachusetts by bringing his suit there, and \"nothing about this\n\ncase suggests that those courts will have any difficulty rendering\n\neffective relief\" if Adelson's declaratory action is affirmed. See\n\nJet Wine & Spirits, Inc. v. Bacardi & Co., Ltd., 298 F.3d 1, 12\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Fourth, although the district court noted that \"the\n\nexistence of prior lawsuits in Israel . . . make this case an\n\ninefficient burden on the judicial system,\" it concluded that \"this\n\nis 'insufficient to tip the constitutional balance on the facts of\n\nthis case.'\"   Adelson II, 641 F.Supp.2d at 79 (quoting Adelson I,\n\n510 F.3d at 52).6   We agree.\n\n          As to the fifth and final factor, we do not see how a\n\nfinding of jurisdiction here would speak one way or another to the\n\ncommon interests of all sovereigns in advancing a particular social\n\npolicy.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Subsequent to briefing and argument in this case, Adelson\ninformed us of a decision by the Tel Aviv District Labor Court\naddressing claims that mirror some of those presented here. We\nhave no occasion to consider that decision. We review this appeal\nbased on the record before us.\n\n                                -14-\n\f                 Even     if    the     last     two      factors   weighed    against\n\njurisdiction,           this    alone    would     be   \"insufficient     to   tip    the\n\nconstitutional balance\" on the facts presented here.                        Adelson I,\n\n510 F.3d at 51; see also Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26\n\nF.3d 201, 210 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"the reasonableness prong of the due\n\nprocess inquiry evokes a sliding scale\"). We conclude that the sum\n\nof the gestalt factors weigh in favor of jurisdiction.\n\n                 Given the reasonableness of exercising jurisdiction, the\n\nrelatedness of the dispute to the forum, and Hananel's contacts\n\nwith       the   forum,    we   affirm    the     district    court's     assertion   of\n\npersonal jurisdiction over Hananel.\n\n                                 III.    Burden of Proof\n\n                 We review de novo the placement of the burden of proof.\n\nEstate       of    Abraham       v.     C.I.R.,     408     F.3d    26,   35   (2005).7\n\nMassachusetts law governs this issue, Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S.\n\n109, 117 (1943), and it does not call for the burden of proof to\n\nautomatically be borne by the filing party in a declaratory action\n\n(here, Adelson).           Foley v. McGonigle, 326 N.E.2d 723, 724 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1975) (internal quotation marks omitted) (stating the\n\n\"fact that the plaintiff initiated this proceeding for declaratory\n\nrelief does not shift th[e] burden to him\"); accord Cardarelli\n\nConstr. Co. v. Froton-Dunstable Reg'l Sch. Dist., 349 N.E.2d 383,\n\n       7\n      Hananel asserts that Adelson waived any right to argue that\nthe burden of proof was Hananel's. In light of our disposition of\nthe issue, we need not address this argument.\n\n                                            -15-\n\f384 (Mass. App. Ct. 1976) (citing Stop & Shop, Inc. v. Ganem, 200\n\nN.E.2d 248, 252 (Mass. 1964)) (\"It is well settled that a party\n\nasserting the illegality of a contract has the burden of proving\n\nthe facts necessary to establish such illegality.\").                 Instead,\n\nMassachusetts looks to which party would be seeking damages had the\n\nmatter been filed as a standard suit rather than as a declaratory\n\naction.   Stop & Shop, 200 N.E.2d at 252 (in a lease dispute, \"[h]ad\n\nthe lessors brought an action for damages for breach of an implied\n\ncovenant to continue operations they would, of course, have had the\n\nburden of showing the covenant.            That the lessee initiated the\n\nproceeding for declaratory relief does not shift that burden to the\n\nlessee.\").\n\n              Here, Hananel seeks an interpretation of the agreement\n\nthat would permit him to assert a contractual right of recovery.\n\nAs the natural plaintiff who would have had the burden of proving\n\nhis affirmative claim to the twelve percent option in a damages\n\naction, we see no impropriety in assigning the burden of proof to\n\nhim.    See Markley v. Semle, 713 A.2d 945, 947 (Me. 1998) (internal\n\ncitation omitted) (\"In a declaratory judgment action, . . . [t]he\n\nparty who asserts the affirmative of the controlling issues in the\n\ncase, whether or not he is the nominal plaintiff in the action,\n\nbears   the    risk   of   non-persuasion.\");   Am.   Eagle   Ins.    Co.   v.\n\nThompson, 85 F.3d 327, 331 (8th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (\"It is a fundamental rule that the burden of proof\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fin its primary sense rests upon the party who, as determined by the\n\npleadings, asserts the affirmative of an issue and it remains there\n\nuntil the termination of the action.      It is generally upon the\n\nparty who will be defeated if no evidence relating to the issue is\n\ngiven on either side.\").\n\n           Regardless, any error in assigning the burden of proof is\n\nharmless unless \"the court's . . . decision at the end of the trial\n\nturned on 'burden of proof' rules rather than on the weight of the\n\nevidence in the record.\"   Applewood Landscape & Nursery Co., Inc.\n\nv. Hollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1506 (1st Cir. 1989).           The\n\ndistrict court's ruling indicates that it did not consider the\n\nburden of proof issue to be dispositive:    after weighing evidence\n\nin the record, the district court concluded that \"it is clear\" that\n\nthe parties did not reach \"a meeting of the minds.\"   In any event,\n\nno matter who bore the burden of proof, as discussed below the\n\nfinding that Hananel failed to \"initiate the investment\" prohibits\n\na holding in favor of Hananel's exercise of the option.\n\n                     IV. The Contract's Terms\n\n           We review the district court's findings of fact for clear\n\nerror.   Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir. 1993).   The\n\ndistrict court concluded that there was no \"meeting of the minds\"\n\nabout the meaning of the \"option\" in the contract, and even \"[i]n\n\nHananel's best case\" his work \"[was] insufficient to constitute\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\finitiating the investment, under any reasonable understanding of\n\nthe term.\"    Adelson II, 641 F.Supp.2d at 84.\n\n           It is not disputed that Hananel and Adelson spoke several\n\ntimes between August 1995 and December 1995 regarding Hananel's\n\nemployment with IPI.     As noted, however, what they agreed to is\n\ndisputed. Hananel testified that the intention was for him to have\n\nan option covering any investment proposed by him, except for\n\ninvestments in the United States. Adelson's position has been that\n\nthey agreed that Hananel would receive a portion of net profits\n\nfrom a much narrower category of investments.\n\n           It is also not disputed that Hananel, Adelson, and\n\nRoberts (IGM's general counsel) were present in the Needham,\n\nMassachusetts, office on December 5, 1995.        But, the parties\n\ngreatly dispute the exact contents and nature of that office visit.\n\nAdelson testified that the employment contract's final details were\n\nhammered out in that December meeting, including the meaning of\n\nalleged contract terms such as the share of \"net profits minus\n\nlosses.\"     In stark contrast, Hananel testified that the contract\n\nwas finalized in Israel, the employment contract was not discussed\n\nduring the December office visit, and, in any event, that visit did\n\nnothing to change the substance of the contract.\n\n           The district court found that \"while a meeting [in\n\nMassachusetts] may have taken place, it was at most a rehash of the\n\nterms of Hananel's contract, which had already been finalized with\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fAdelson in Israel.\"       Adelson II, 641 F.Supp.2d at 73.       It then\n\nconcluded:   \"As to the extent and meaning of the term at the center\n\nof the dispute, the option in projects initiated by Hananel, it is\n\nclear that there was simply no meeting of the minds.\"        Id. at 83\n\n(emphasis added).    We have scoured the record and have discovered\n\nno basis on which to upset that determination.       As we have noted:\n\n     In actions that are tried to the court, the judge's\n     findings of fact are to be honored unless clearly\n     erroneous, paying due respect to the judge's right to\n     draw reasonable inferences and to gauge the credibility\n     of witnesses. A corollary of this proposition is that,\n     when there are two permissible views of the evidence, the\n     factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly\n     erroneous. . . . [W]hen a case has been decided on the\n     facts by a judge . . . an appellate court must refrain\n     from any temptation to retry the factual issues anew.\n\nJohnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1138 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           In sum, the district court's finding that there was no\n\n\"meeting of the minds,\" was grounded in the record and not clearly\n\nerroneous.   See   United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 195 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (\"After all, when the evidence gives rise to competing\n\ninterpretations, each plausible, the factfinder's choice between\n\nthem cannot be clearly erroneous.\").\n\n           Moreover, even accepting Hananel's argument that there\n\nwas a \"meeting of the minds\" about the existence and scope of the\n\ntwelve percent option clause, the district court's finding that\n\nHananel   failed    to   \"initiate\"   whatever   investment(s)   Adelson\n\nsubsequently made in Macau was also not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f              As the district court noted, there were questions of\n\nveracity in both parties' accounts of the employment contract, the\n\n\"option,\"     and   the   discussions        of   Macau.     But,   even   viewing\n\nHananel's     account     in    the   most    favorable    light,   a   reasonable\n\nobserver applying practical business sense and plain meaning could\n\nconclude easily that satisfying the \"initiate\" requirement of the\n\noption – on what would become a $7 billion project – would have\n\nrequired Hananel to do more than what his evidence showed: discuss\n\nMacau during a few 1999 meetings; prepare limited materials on\n\nMacau   for    Adelson's       review;   \"research[]       Macau   generally\"   and\n\npotential investments in Macau; give Adelson some third-party maps\n\nand brochures; and urge him to visit Macau.                As the district court\n\ndescribed it, \"Hananel may have gotten Adelson's wheels spinning,\n\nbut he never got anything in gear.\"               Adelson II, 641 F.2d at 84.\n\n                        V.     The Missing Witness Rule\n\n              Hananel's final argument is that the district court\n\nabused its discretion when it denied him a \"missing witness\"\n\ninference, because Adelson did not call an Israeli witness, Danny\n\nRaviv, as Hananel had expected.              After a jury trial, a claim about\n\nfailure to give a missing witness instruction indeed would be\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.              Latin Am. Music Co. v. Am. Soc.\n\nof Composers, Authors & Publishers, 593 F.3d 95, 101 (1st Cir.\n\n2010) (instructing jury on \"missing witness\" rule reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion).            As this was a bench trial, however, we\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\freview for clear error the decision not to draw the inference.                    See\n\nBogosian v. Woloohojian Reality Corp., 323 F.3d 55, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).    We conclude that the district court, as factfinder, was\n\nunder    no   obligation   to     draw    the   adverse    inference,       for    the\n\n\"'missing      witness'    rule    permits,      rather    than    compels,       the\n\nfactfinder to draw [the] inference . . . , particularly where the\n\nfactfinder concludes that the party who requested the . . .\n\ninference failed to subpoena a witness otherwise available to\n\ntestify.\" Id. at 67 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added)\n\n(no error in bench trial where district court did not draw adverse\n\ninference from absence of witnesses).\n\n              Hananel has not shown the necessity for applying the\n\nmissing witness rule here.         First, he offers no concrete evidence\n\nthat demonstrates that Raviv was peculiarly available or obviously\n\npartial to Adelson. United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d 620, 631-32\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (missing witness rule permits adverse inference\n\nonly when witness is \"peculiarly available to\" to party not seeking\n\nthe instruction or \"favorably disposed\" to him); Steinhilber v.\n\nMcCarthy, 26 F.Supp.2d 265, 280 (D. Mass. 1998).                  Second, he has\n\nnot   provided    a   satisfactory       explanation      for   why,   if   Raviv's\n\ntestimony was so essential, he failed to take any action to compel\n\nthe witness's appearance in court.              According to Hananel, other\n\nwitnesses in Israel for whom he had obtained letters rogatory were\n\nnot as important to the disposition of this action as Raviv.                      Yet,\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fhe failed to pursue similar action to depose Raviv, and he offers\n\nno proof that obtaining a subpoena or letter rogatory would have\n\nbeen impossible.   See United States v. Anderson, 452 F.3d 66, 82\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (denying instruction, stating, \"The fact that [the\n\nparty] was able to subpoena [the witness] yet failed to do so gives\n\nus additional reason to believe that the district court was correct\n\nin finding that [the witness] was not 'peculiarly available' to the\n\n[opposing party]\").\n\n          As the district court stated:\n\n     In this case, however, there is no reason to believe that\n     Raviv was not available to testify if called by the\n     Defendant.   Defendant made no effort to call him to\n     testify or to depose him. In this case, where Raviv's\n     testimony would likely cut both ways, the Court is\n     unwilling to allow Defendant the dual benefit of avoiding\n     Raviv's potentially damaging testimony by purposely\n     failing to call him, while simultaneously giving him the\n     benefit of a negative inference for Plaintiff's failure\n     to call him.\n\nAdelson II, 641 F.Supp.2d at 77 n.3 (internal citation omitted).\n\n          This finding was not erroneous. The appellant's argument\n\nappears to be a manifestation of his regret at his decision not to\n\nconfront Raviv in court.   Regret is not a ground for reversal.\n\n                           VI.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment\n\nof the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f",

Green, with whom Lynn C. Norton and Burns &amp; Levinson LLP were on brief, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Andrew H. Schapiro, with whom Christopher J. Houpt and Mayer Brown LLP were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN and HOWARD, Circuit Judges and BARBADORO,<sup>[*]</sup> District Judge.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Appellee Sheldon Adelson brought this declaratory action to determine rights under an oral contract that he had negotiated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> with appellant Moshe Hananel. In the district court Hananel argued that the agreement, pursuant to which he was employed by a company owned by Adelson, entitled him to obtain a twelve percent investment in Adelson's casino venture in Macau. Adelson claimed that their agreement was not so broad as to contemplate the Macau investment option. Rather, the contract limited Hananel to reaping twelve percent of net profits from high-tech sector investments in Israel that had been discovered, recommended and supervised by Hananel, and that were realized while he was employed by Adelson's company.</p>\n<p>In a prior appeal of this matter, <i>Adelson v. Hananel,</i> 510 F.3d 43 (1st Cir.2007) (\"<i>Adelson I</i>\"), we reversed the district court's <i>forum non conveniens</i> dismissal, but we did uphold the court's determination that, under the <i>prima facie</i> standard, Hananel was subject to specific personal jurisdiction. After a three-week bench trial on remand, the district court ruled in favor of Adelson, declaring that Hananel did not hold an option to obtain a twelve percent interest in Adelson's Macau casino. <i>Adelson v. Hananel,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d 65 (D.Mass.2009) (\"<i>Adelson II</i>\"). Hananel appeals from this judgment, arguing that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction, erroneously assigned to him the burden of proof, abused its discretion regarding a missing witness, and made factual errors regarding the formation and performance of the contract. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Hananel is a native, citizen, and resident of Israel. Adelson is a U.S. citizen and a permanent resident and domiciliary of Nevada, where he votes, owns property, and holds a driver's license. Adelson is also a native of Massachusetts and a current Massachusetts homeowner. He has worldwide business connections and investments, and he owns a warren of businesses known as the \"Interface Group.\"</p>\n<p>On the basis of the disputed oral contract negotiated with Adelson, Hananel worked for one of Adelson's companies, Interface Partners International, Ltd. (\"IPI\"), from approximately 1996 to 2000. IPI is a Delaware corporation that Adelson founded in 1994 for the purpose of investing in Israel, with a particular focus on Israel's high-tech sector.</p>\n<p>During the time period relevant to this case, IPI had offices in Needham, Massachusetts, and Ramat Gan, Israel. Hananel was based in Israel and was responsible for seeking investment opportunities there. Although IPI did not have regular employees working in Needham, it received ongoing legal and financial advice through frequent communications with one of the Interface Group companies co-located there, Interface Group Massachusetts (\"IGM\"). IGM personnel in the Needham office who provided such advice included IGM's general counsel Paul Roberts, who also described himself as \"counsel to IGI\", and IGM's CFO Stephen O'Connor. There was testimony at trial that IPI's funding customarily came from Adelson's personal account in Las Vegas, Nevada, but not before passing through the IPI Massachusetts \"office\" as a capital contribution to IPI Massachusetts that was then \"lent\" to IPI Israel. Hananel made periodic calls to the Needham office and sent fax transmissions there at least monthly, including budget proposals for approval. He made one brief visit to the Needham office in late 1995, just before commencing his duties for IPI, and he later attended a meeting in Massachusetts to seek business opportunities in his role as chairman of a company in which IPI had invested.</p>\n<p>The parties' evidence about the terms of Hananel's compensation was irreconcilable. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> As the district court accurately described the testimony:</p>\n<blockquote>In the discussions regarding Hananel's employment, it is undisputed that Adelson and Hananel agreed he would have a salary of $100,000 a year. They also agreed that Hananel would somehow receive 12% of the investments with which he was involved while at IPI.... Adelson and Hananel have different memories of the details of the twelve percent. Adelson testified that they agreed that Hananel would receive 12% of the net profits only of high tech investments in Israel that Hananel found, recommended, and supervised and which came to fruition while he was employed by IPI, but only so long as he remained employed there. Hananel testified that they agreed that he would receive \"options\" of up to 12 percent on any investment he or the Israeli office \"initiated\" outside the United States without any other geographic or time limitations so long as Hananel put up the proportionate costs of the investment at any point.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 72.</p>\n<p>In this appeal, Hananel argues, as to jurisdiction, that differences between the <i>prima facie</i> facts determined before the first appeal and the facts as later found by the district court at the merits trial undermine our previous decision on personal jurisdiction. He draws attention to prior references, by both the district court and by us, to Adelson being a resident of Massachusetts when in fact he was a resident of Nevada, and he emphasizes that at trial the district court concluded that the contract was formed in Israel rather than in Massachusetts. As noted, Hananel also presses claims that the district court erred in assigning the burden of proof to him rather than to Adelson; that it should have ordered an adverse inference based on the \"missing witness\" rule; and that the court misapprehended the facts surrounding both the formation of and his performance under the contract.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>General jurisdiction over Hananel was not alleged, and he argues that the district court also lacked specific jurisdiction over him. We review the jurisdictional issue de novo. <i>Barrett v. Lombardi,</i> 239 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir.2001). We concluded in <i>Adelson I</i> that the district court had personal jurisdiction over Hananel under the <i>prima facie</i> standard, and that Massachusetts was not an inconvenient forum. <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d 43. We are not persuaded that the facts as found at trial undermine our previous decision, and we conclude that Hananel's Massachusetts contacts support the district court's exercise of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>To establish specific personal jurisdiction over Hananel, Adelson \"must demonstrate that the Massachusetts long-arm statute grants jurisdiction over Hananel and that the exercise of that jurisdiction comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 48 (internal citation omitted). We have construed the Massachusetts long-arm statute<sup>[1]</sup> as being coextensive with the limits permitted by the Constitution. We thus turn directly to the constitutional test for determining specific jurisdiction, <i>see </i><i>Daynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &amp; Poole, P.A.,</i> 290 F.3d 42, 52 (1st Cir.2002), which has \"three distinct components, namely, relatedness, purposeful <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> availment (sometimes called `minimum contacts'), and reasonableness,\" <i>Hannon v. Beard,</i> 524 F.3d 275, 282 (1st Cir.2008) (internal citation omitted). <i>See also </i><i>Astro-Med, Inc., v. Nihon Kohden America, Inc.,</i> 591 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Relatedness</h2>\n<p>To demonstrate \"relatedness,\" Adelson must show \"`a demonstrable nexus between [his] claims and [Hananel's] forum-based activities, such ... [that] the litigation itself is founded directly on those activities.'\" <i>Hannon,</i> 524 F.3d at 280 (quoting <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 1998)). \"[T]he relatedness test is a `flexible, relaxed standard,'\" <i>N. Laminate Sales, Inc. v. Davis,</i> 403 F.3d 14, 25 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Pritzker v. Yari,</i> 42 F.3d 53, 61 (1st Cir.1994)), and the analysis focuses on the relationship between the defendant and the forum. <i>Hannon,</i> 524 F.3d at 283 (citing <i>Sawtelle v. Farrell,</i> 70 F.3d 1381, 1389 (1st Cir.1995)); <i>see also </i><i>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations S.A. v. Brown,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 131 S.Ct. 2846, 2851, 180 L.Ed.2d 796 (2011) (\"Specific jurisdiction ... depends on an `affiliatio[n] between the forum and the underlying controversy'\"); <i>J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 131 S.Ct. 2780, 2788, 180 L.Ed.2d 765 (2011) (Kennedy, J.) (quoting <i>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall,</i> 466 U.S. 408, 414, n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984)) (\"submission through contact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction `in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant's contacts with the forum'\"). Because this is a contract dispute, in examining the defendant's relationship to the forum \"we look to whether `the defendant's activity in the forum state was instrumental either in the formation of the contract or its breach.'\" <i>Adams v. Adams,</i> 601 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 49). We may also consider whether the defendant was \"subject to substantial control and ongoing connection to [Massachusetts] in the performance of the contract.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <i>cf. </i><i>Hahn v. Vermont Law School,</i> 698 F.2d 48, 49 (1st Cir.1983) (\"less [than substantial contacts are] required to support jurisdiction when the cause of action arises from the defendant's contacts with the forum ... than when it does not.\").<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, Hananel's contacts to the forum are directly related to his fulfillment of the terms of his employment contract as he claims them to be. As the district court recognized:</p>\n<blockquote>[R]egardless of the contract's core terms, the parties' actual course of dealing connects the contract to Massachusetts: Hananel was in regular contact with Interface employees in Massachusetts, the money that funded Hananel's work came through Massachusetts, and Hananel's budgets were routinely faxed to the office in Massachusetts.... This is enough to satisfy the relatedness prong.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 78.</p>\n<p>In addition, the record shows that Hananel visited the Massachusetts Interface office <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> prior to beginning formal, full time employment with IPI in January 1996. Later, while employed by IPI, Hananel attended a board meeting in Massachusetts as a direct result of an IPI investment.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Although Hananel does not deny that as manager of the IPI Israel office he had regular contact with the Needham office, he argues that his Massachusetts \"activities were minor administrative tasks insufficient to warrant jurisdiction.\" This argument understates his managerial role in IPI and the importance of the Massachusetts funding connection to the finances of IPI Israel. As discussed in greater detail below, we disagree with Hananel's characterization of his Massachusetts activities as \"purely incidental contacts\" and agree with the district court that they evince the relationship between Hananel's actions under the oral contract and the forum of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Purposeful Availment</h2>\n<p>For there to be personal jurisdiction over Hananel, his contacts must \"represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in [Massachusetts], thereby invoking the benefits and protections of [Massachusetts's] laws and making [his] presence before [Massachusetts'] courts foreseeable.\" <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 60; <i>see also </i><i>J. McIntyre Machinery,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2790 (specific jurisdiction calls for plaintiff to establish that defendant \"engaged in conduct purposefully directed at the forum\"); <i>id.</i> (\"The question is whether a defendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment concerning that conduct.\").</p>\n<p>Hananel directed regular administrative and financial conduct toward Massachusetts, and his contacts with the state were voluntary and the result of more than just a single event or transaction. We see no reason to deviate from our previous conclusion that \"given that it was Hananel who sought this employment contract with a company whose key officers were all located in Massachusetts and whose financial accounts were all administered out of Massachusetts, the court properly concluded that Hananel had purposefully availed himself of Massachusetts law.\" <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 50; <i>cf. </i><i>J. McIntyre Machinery,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2790 (no specific jurisdiction where defendant had no office in the forum, never \"sent any employees to[] the [forum]\" and \"does not have a single contact with [the forum] short of the\" sole piece of equipment at issue in the suit).</p>\n<p>That Hananel's December 1995 trip to Massachusetts was brief and its purpose was not found to be substantially related to negotiation of the agreement does not detract from the conclusion that the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate. Hananel \"need not have been physically present in [Massachusetts] in order to have `transacted business' there\" for purposes of establishing minimum contacts. <i>Hannon,</i> 524 F.3d at 281 (citing <i>Fairview Mach. &amp; Tool Co., Inc. v. Oakbrook Intern., Inc.,</i> 56 F.Supp.2d 134, 138 (D.Mass. 1999)) (holding that even though defendant had not been physically present in Massachusetts, \"contacts that [he] would have had to make to arrange for [prisoner's] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> transfer ... to Massachusetts are sufficient to constitute `transacting business' under the broadly-construed long-arm statute\").<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, as in <i>Hannon,</i> there was purposeful availment where Hananel's business activities for IPI involved, <i>inter alia,</i> \"communication and interaction between [him] in [Israel] and [staff] in Massachusetts.\" <i>See </i><i>Hannon,</i> 524 F.3d at 281. Affirming the district court's relevant factual findings, we conclude that Hananel's faxes, money transfers, and meetings demonstrate sufficient communications and interactions with Massachusetts to satisfy us that Hananel had at least minimum contacts with the forum and that these contacts were not \"random, isolated or fortuitous.\" <i>See </i><i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 50.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Reasonableness</h2>\n<p>To examine reasonableness, we consider the gestalt factors: \"(1) [Hananel's] burden of appearing, (2) [Massachusetts's] interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) [Adelson's] interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy, and [5] the common interests of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\" <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 51; <i>see also </i><i>N. Laminate Sales,</i> 403 F.3d at 26 (citing <i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,</i> 471 U.S. 462, 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985)).</p>\n<p>First, because Hananel has not demonstrated a \"special or unusual burden\" in staging a defense in Massachusetts over and above that of doing so in any foreign jurisdiction, we conclude that this factor does not weigh against jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Pritzker,</i> 42 F.3d at 64 (\"[I]nsofar as staging a defense in a foreign jurisdiction is almost always inconvenient and/or costly, we think this factor is only meaningful where a party can demonstrate some kind of special or unusual burden.\").<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, Hananel emphasizes the fact that both the district court and this court in the previous appeal were mistaken when they concluded that Adelson was a Massachusetts resident and domiciliary, when in fact he was a resident and domiciliary of Nevada. In presenting this argument, Hananel stakes too much on the importance of Adelson's state of residence to the personal jurisdiction analysis. Although this factual conclusion may have contributed to our original weighing of Massachusetts' interest in hearing the matter, Adelson's residency and domicile are not alone dispositive of personal jurisdiction and there are other facts that support Massachusetts' interests in the matter.</p>\n<p>When previously we connected Adelson's assumed Massachusetts residency with Massachusetts' interests in the case, we also noted that \"[Massachusetts'] interest... is further heightened by the involvement of IPI's executive officers who are employed in Massachusetts and of funds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> which are held and managed in Massachusetts.\" <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 51. Besides, given the relatedness and purposeful availment demonstrated here, the weight of this one factor within \"reasonableness\" is slight. <i>Sawtelle,</i> 70 F.3d at 1394 (internal quotation marks omitted) (\"[T]he weaker the plaintiff's showings on the first two prongs (relatedness and purposeful availment), the less a defendant need show in terms of unreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction. The reverse is equally true: an especially strong showing of reasonableness may serve to fortify a borderline showing of relatedness and purposefulness.\").</p>\n<p>Third, Adelson demonstrated his interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief through the federal courts in Massachusetts by bringing his suit there, and \"nothing about this case suggests that those courts will have any difficulty rendering effective relief\" if Adelson's declaratory action is affirmed. <i>See </i><i>Jet Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc. v. Bacardi &amp; Co., Ltd.,</i> 298 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Fourth, although the district court noted that \"the existence of prior lawsuits in Israel ... make this case an inefficient burden on the judicial system,\" it concluded that \"this is `insufficient to tip the constitutional balance on the facts of this case.'\" <i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 79 (quoting <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 52).<sup>[6]</sup> We agree.</p>\n<p>As to the fifth and final factor, we do not see how a finding of jurisdiction here would speak one way or another to the common interests of all sovereigns in advancing a particular social policy.</p>\n<p>Even if the last two factors weighed against jurisdiction, this alone would be \"insufficient to tip the constitutional balance\" on the facts presented here. <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 51; <i>see also </i><i>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto,</i> 26 F.3d 201, 210 (1st Cir.1994) (\"the reasonableness prong of the due process inquiry evokes a sliding scale\"). We conclude that the sum of the gestalt factors weigh in favor of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Given the reasonableness of exercising jurisdiction, the relatedness of the dispute to the forum, and Hananel's contacts with the forum, we affirm the district court's assertion of personal jurisdiction over Hananel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Burden of Proof</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the placement of the burden of proof. <i>Estate of Abraham v. C.I.R.,</i> 408 F.3d 26, 35 (2005).<sup>[7]</sup> Massachusetts law governs this issue, <i>Palmer v. Hoffman,</i> 318 U.S. 109, 117, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), and it does not call for the burden of proof to automatically be borne by the filing party in a declaratory action (here, Adelson). <i>Foley v. McGonigle,</i> 3 Mass.App.Ct. 746, 326 N.E.2d 723, 724 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted) (stating the \"fact that the plaintiff initiated this proceeding for declaratory relief does not shift th[e] burden to him\"); <i>accord Cardarelli Constr. Co. v. Groton-Dunstable Reg'l Sch. Dist.,</i> 4 Mass.App.Ct. 823, 349 N.E.2d 383, 384 (1976) (citing <i>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc. v. Ganem,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> 347 Mass. 697, 200 N.E.2d 248, 252 (1964)) (\"It is well settled that a party asserting the illegality of a contract has the burden of proving the facts necessary to establish such illegality.\"). Instead, Massachusetts looks to which party would be seeking damages had the matter been filed as a standard suit rather than as a declaratory action. <i>Stop &amp; Shop,</i> 200 N.E.2d at 252 (in a lease dispute, \"[h]ad the lessors brought an action for damages for breach of an implied covenant to continue operations they would, of course, have had the burden of showing the covenant. That the lessee initiated the proceeding for declaratory relief does not shift that burden to the lessee.\").</p>\n<p>Here, Hananel seeks an interpretation of the agreement that would permit him to assert a contractual right of recovery. As the natural plaintiff who would have had the burden of proving his affirmative claim to the twelve percent option in a damages action, we see no impropriety in assigning the burden of proof to him. <i>See </i><i>Markley v. Semle,</i> 713 A.2d 945, 947 (Me.1998) (internal citation omitted) (\"In a declaratory judgment action, ... [t]he party who asserts the affirmative of the controlling issues in the case, whether or not he is the nominal plaintiff in the action, bears the risk of non-persuasion.\"); <i>Am. Eagle Ins. Co. v. Thompson,</i> 85 F.3d 327, 331 (8th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (\"It is a fundamental rule that the burden of proof in its primary sense rests upon the party who, as determined by the pleadings, asserts the affirmative of an issue and it remains there until the termination of the action. It is generally upon the party who will be defeated if no evidence relating to the issue is given on either side.\").</p>\n<p>Regardless, any error in assigning the burden of proof is harmless unless \"the court's ... decision at the end of the trial turned on `burden of proof' rules rather than on the weight of the evidence in the record.\" <i>Applewood Landscape &amp; Nursery Co., Inc. v. Hollingsworth,</i> 884 F.2d 1502, 1506 (1st Cir.1989). The district court's ruling indicates that it did not consider the burden of proof issue to be dispositive: after weighing evidence in the record, the district court concluded that \"it is <i>clear\"</i> that the parties did not reach \"a meeting of the minds.\" In any event, no matter who bore the burden of proof, as discussed below the finding that Hananel failed to \"initiate the investment\" prohibits a holding in favor of Hananel's exercise of the option.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. The Contract's Terms</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error. <i>Williams v. Poulos,</i> 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir.1993). The district court concluded that there was no \"meeting of the minds\" about the meaning of the \"option\" in the contract, and even \"[i]n Hananel's best case\" his work \"[was] insufficient to constitute initiating the investment, under any reasonable understanding of the term.\" <i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 84.</p>\n<p>It is not disputed that Hananel and Adelson spoke several times between August 1995 and December 1995 regarding Hananel's employment with IPI. As noted, however, what they agreed to is disputed. Hananel testified that the intention was for him to have an option covering any investment proposed by him, except for investments in the United States. Adelson's position has been that they agreed that Hananel would receive a portion of net profits from a much narrower category of investments.</p>\n<p>It is also not disputed that Hananel, Adelson, and Roberts (IGM's general counsel) were present in the Needham, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> Massachusetts, office on December 5, 1995. But, the parties greatly dispute the exact contents and nature of that office visit. Adelson testified that the employment contract's final details were hammered out in that December meeting, including the meaning of alleged contract terms such as the share of \"net profits minus losses.\" In stark contrast, Hananel testified that the contract was finalized in Israel, the employment contract was not discussed during the December office visit, and, in any event, that visit did nothing to change the substance of the contract.</p>\n<p>The district court found that \"while a meeting [in Massachusetts] may have taken place, it was at most a rehash of the terms of Hananel's contract, which had already been finalized with Adelson in Israel.\" <i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 73. It then concluded: \"As to the extent and meaning of the term at the center of the dispute, the option in projects initiated by Hananel, <i>it is clear</i> that there was simply no meeting of the minds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 83 (emphasis added). We have scoured the record and have discovered no basis on which to upset that determination. As we have noted:</p>\n<p>In actions that are tried to the court, the judge's findings of fact are to be honored unless clearly erroneous, paying due respect to the judge's right to draw reasonable inferences and to gauge the credibility of witnesses. A corollary of this proposition is that, when there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.... [W]hen a case has been decided on the facts by a judge ... an appellate court must refrain from any temptation to retry the factual issues a new.</p>\n<p><i>Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co.,</i> 63 F.3d 1129, 1138 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>In sum, the district court's finding that there was no \"meeting of the minds,\" was grounded in the record and not clearly erroneous. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lara,</i> 181 F.3d 183, 195 (1st Cir.1999) (\"After all, when the evidence gives rise to competing interpretations, each plausible, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, even accepting Hananel's argument that there <i>was</i> a \"meeting of the minds\" about the existence and scope of the twelve percent option clause, the district court's finding that Hananel failed to \"initiate\" whatever investment(s) Adelson subsequently made in Macau was also not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>As the district court noted, there were questions of veracity in both parties' accounts of the employment contract, the \"option,\" and the discussions of Macau. But, even viewing Hananel's account in the most favorable light, a reasonable observer applying practical business sense and plain meaning could conclude easily that satisfying the \"initiate\" requirement of the option  on what would become a $7 billion project  would have required Hananel to do more than what his evidence showed: discuss Macau during a few 1999 meetings; prepare limited materials on Macau for Adelson's review; \"research[] Macau generally\" and potential investments in Macau; give Adelson some third-party maps and brochures; and urge him to visit Macau. As the district court described it, \"Hananel may have gotten Adelson's wheels spinning, but he never got anything in gear.\" <i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 84.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. The Missing Witness Rule</h2>\n<p>Hananel's final argument is that the district court abused its discretion when it denied him a \"missing witness\" inference, because Adelson did not call an Israeli witness, Danny Raviv, as Hananel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> had expected. After a jury trial, a claim about failure to give a missing witness instruction indeed would be reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>Latin Am. Music Co. v. Am. Soc. of Composers, Authors &amp; Publishers,</i> 593 F.3d 95, 101 (1st Cir.2010) (instructing jury on \"missing witness\" rule reviewed for abuse of discretion). As this was a bench trial, however, we review for clear error the decision not to draw the inference. <i>See </i><i>Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp.,</i> 323 F.3d 55, 68 (1st Cir. 2003). We conclude that the district court, as factfinder, was under no obligation to draw the adverse inference, for the \"`missing witness' rule <i>permits,</i> rather than <i>compels,</i> the factfinder to draw [the] inference..., particularly where the factfinder concludes that the party who requested the... inference failed to subpoena a witness otherwise available to testify.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added) (no error in bench trial where district court did not draw adverse inference from absence of witnesses).</p>\n<p>Hananel has not shown the necessity for applying the missing witness rule here. First, he offers no concrete evidence that demonstrates that Raviv was peculiarly available or obviously partial to Adelson. <i>United States v. Spinosa,</i> 982 F.2d 620, 631-32 (1st Cir.1992) (missing witness rule permits adverse inference only when witness is \"peculiarly available to\" to party not seeking the instruction or \"favorably disposed\" to him); <i>Steinhilber v. McCarthy,</i> 26 F.Supp.2d 265, 280 (D.Mass.1998). Second, he has not provided a satisfactory explanation for why, if Raviv's testimony was so essential, he failed to take any action to compel the witness's appearance in court. According to Hananel, other witnesses in Israel for whom he had obtained letters rogatory were not as important to the disposition of this action as Raviv. Yet, he failed to pursue similar action to depose Raviv, and he offers no proof that obtaining a subpoena or letter rogatory would have been impossible. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Anderson,</i> 452 F.3d 66, 82 (1st Cir.2006) (denying instruction, stating, \"The fact that [the party] was able to subpoena [the witness] yet failed to do so gives us additional reason to believe that the district court was correct in finding that [the witness] was not `peculiarly available' to the [opposing party]\").</p>\n<p>As the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>In this case, however, there is no reason to believe that Raviv was not available to testify if called by the Defendant. Defendant made no effort to call him to testify or to depose him. In this case, where Raviv's testimony would likely cut both ways, the Court is unwilling to allow Defendant the dual benefit of avoiding Raviv's potentially damaging testimony by purposely failing to call him, while simultaneously giving him the benefit of a negative inference for Plaintiff's failure to call him.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 77 n. 3 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>This finding was not erroneous. The appellant's argument appears to be a manifestation of his regret at his decision not to confront Raviv in court. Regret is not a ground for reversal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The statute provides that \"[a] court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's transacting any business in this commonwealth.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3(a).</p>\n<p>[2]  Although, as Hananel points out, the district court concluded that the agreement was governed by Israeli law, this conclusion does not affect the outcome of our jurisdictional analysis because the issue before us is one of personal jurisdiction, not choice of law. <i>J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 131 S.Ct. 2780, 2790, 180 L.Ed.2d 765 (2011) (Kennedy, J.) (citing <i>Hanson v. Denckla,</i> 357 U.S. 235, 254, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)); <i>see also </i><i>Cambridge Literary Properties, Ltd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H,</i> 295 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.2002) (contrasting personal jurisdiction analysis with choice of law analysis).</p>\n<p>[3]  During his tenure with IPI, Hananel recommended that it invest in the tech company, IMDSoft. After the investment Hananel was named chairman of the board of IMDSoft and traveled to Andover, Massachusetts, in that capacity with the goal of advancing business partnership opportunities for IMDSoft.</p>\n<p>[4]  We have construed the Massachusetts statute broadly and \"`do[] not require that the defendant have engaged in commercial activity. [The] language is general and applies to any purposeful acts by an individual, whether person, private, or commercial.'\" <i>Hannon,</i> 524 F.3d at 280 (quoting <i>Ealing Corp. v. Harrods Ltd.,</i> 790 F.2d 978, 982 (1st Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p>[5]  As we have recognized, Hananel has certain health issues that affect his lifestyle, such as his diabetes and legal blindness. <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 51. But, these issues would affect him no matter where this dispute were tried. Based on the evidence presented at trial, we do not see reason to deviate from our prior conclusion that these issues would not make defense in Massachusetts a \"special or unusual\" burden compared to other foreign jurisdictions. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  Subsequent to briefing and argument in this case, Adelson informed us of a decision by the Tel Aviv District Labor Court addressing claims that mirror some of those presented here. We have no occasion to consider that decision. We review this appeal based on the record before us.</p>\n<p>[7]  Hananel asserts that Adelson waived any right to argue that the burden of proof was Hananel's. In light of our disposition of the issue, we need not address this argument.</p>\n\n</div>",

In the district court Hananel argued that the agreement, pursuant to which he was employed by a company owned by Adelson, entitled him to obtain a twelve percent investment in Adelson's casino venture in Macau. Adelson claimed that their agreement was not so broad as to contemplate the Macau investment option. Rather, the contract limited Hananel to reaping twelve percent of net profits from high-tech sector investments in Israel that had been discovered, recommended and supervised by Hananel, and that were realized while he was employed by Adelson's company.</p>\n<p>In a prior appeal of this matter, <i>Adelson v. Hananel,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span> (1st Cir.2007) (\"<i>Adelson I</i>\"), we reversed the district court's <i>forum non conveniens</i> dismissal, but we did uphold the court's determination that, under the <i>prima facie</i> standard, Hananel was subject to specific personal jurisdiction. After a three-week bench trial on remand, the district court ruled in favor of Adelson, declaring that Hananel did not hold an option to obtain a twelve percent interest in Adelson's Macau casino. <i>Adelson v. Hananel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2474468\"><a href=\"/opinion/2474468/adelson-v-hananel/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2009) (\"<i>Adelson II</i>\"). Hananel appeals from this judgment, arguing that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction, erroneously assigned to him the burden of proof, abused its discretion regarding a missing witness, and made factual errors regarding the formation and performance of the contract. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Hananel is a native, citizen, and resident of Israel. Adelson is a U.S. citizen and a permanent resident and domiciliary of Nevada, where he votes, owns property, and holds a driver's license. Adelson is also a native of Massachusetts and a current Massachusetts homeowner. He has worldwide business connections and investments, and he owns a warren of businesses known as the \"Interface Group.\"</p>\n<p>On the basis of the disputed oral contract negotiated with Adelson, Hananel worked for one of Adelson's companies, Interface Partners International, Ltd. (\"IPI\"), from approximately 1996 to 2000. IPI is a Delaware corporation that Adelson founded in 1994 for the purpose of investing in Israel, with a particular focus on Israel's high-tech sector.</p>\n<p>During the time period relevant to this case, IPI had offices in Needham, Massachusetts, and Ramat Gan, Israel. Hananel was based in Israel and was responsible for seeking investment opportunities there. Although IPI did not have regular employees working in Needham, it received ongoing legal and financial advice through frequent communications with one of the Interface Group companies co-located there, Interface Group Massachusetts (\"IGM\"). IGM personnel in the Needham office who provided such advice included IGM's general counsel Paul Roberts, who also described himself as \"counsel to IGI\", and IGM's CFO Stephen O'Connor. There was testimony at trial that IPI's funding customarily came from Adelson's personal account in Las Vegas, Nevada, but not before passing through the IPI Massachusetts \"office\" as a capital contribution to IPI Massachusetts that was then \"lent\" to IPI Israel. Hananel made periodic calls to the Needham office and sent fax transmissions there at least monthly, including budget proposals for approval. He made one brief visit to the Needham office in late 1995, just before commencing his duties for IPI, and he later attended a meeting in Massachusetts to seek business opportunities in his role as chairman of a company in which IPI had invested.</p>\n<p>The parties' evidence about the terms of Hananel's compensation was irreconcilable. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> As the district court accurately described the testimony:</p>\n<blockquote>In the discussions regarding Hananel's employment, it is undisputed that Adelson and Hananel agreed he would have a salary of $100,000 a year. They also agreed that Hananel would somehow receive 12% of the investments with which he was involved while at IPI.... Adelson and Hananel have different memories of the details of the twelve percent. Adelson testified that they agreed that Hananel would receive 12% of the net profits only of high tech investments in Israel that Hananel found, recommended, and supervised and which came to fruition while he was employed by IPI, but only so long as he remained employed there. Hananel testified that they agreed that he would receive \"options\" of up to 12 percent on any investment he or the Israeli office \"initiated\" outside the United States without any other geographic or time limitations so long as Hananel put up the proportionate costs of the investment at any point.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 72.</p>\n<p>In this appeal, Hananel argues, as to jurisdiction, that differences between the <i>prima facie</i> facts determined before the first appeal and the facts as later found by the district court at the merits trial undermine our previous decision on personal jurisdiction. He draws attention to prior references, by both the district court and by us, to Adelson being a resident of Massachusetts when in fact he was a resident of Nevada, and he emphasizes that at trial the district court concluded that the contract was formed in Israel rather than in Massachusetts. As noted, Hananel also presses claims that the district court erred in assigning the burden of proof to him rather than to Adelson; that it should have ordered an adverse inference based on the \"missing witness\" rule; and that the court misapprehended the facts surrounding both the formation of and his performance under the contract.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>General jurisdiction over Hananel was not alleged, and he argues that the district court also lacked specific jurisdiction over him. We review the jurisdictional issue de novo. <i>Barrett v. Lombardi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199236\"><a href=\"/opinion/199236/barrett-v-veritas-offshore/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2001). We concluded in <i>Adelson I</i> that the district court had personal jurisdiction over Hananel under the <i>prima facie</i> standard, and that Massachusetts was not an inconvenient forum. <i>Adelson I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span>. We are not persuaded that the facts as found at trial undermine our previous decision, and we conclude that Hananel's Massachusetts contacts support the district court's exercise of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>To establish specific personal jurisdiction over Hananel, Adelson \"must demonstrate that the Massachusetts long-arm statute grants jurisdiction over Hananel and that the exercise of that jurisdiction comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 48 (internal citation omitted). We have construed the Massachusetts long-arm statute<sup>[1]</sup> as being coextensive with the limits permitted by the Constitution.

We may also consider whether the defendant was \"subject to substantial control and ongoing connection to [Massachusetts] in the performance of the contract.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <i>cf. </i><i>Hahn v. Vermont Law School,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"413304\"><a href=\"/opinion/413304/william-a-hahn-v-vermont-law-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">698</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1983) (\"less [than substantial contacts are] required to support jurisdiction when the cause of action arises from the defendant's contacts with the forum ... than when it does not.\").<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, Hananel's contacts to the forum are directly related to his fulfillment of the terms of his employment contract as he claims them to be. As the district court recognized:</p>\n<blockquote>[R]egardless of the contract's core terms, the parties' actual course of dealing connects the contract to Massachusetts: Hananel was in regular contact with Interface employees in Massachusetts, the money that funded Hananel's work came through Massachusetts, and Hananel's budgets were routinely faxed to the office in Massachusetts.... This is enough to satisfy the relatedness prong.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 78.</p>\n<p>In addition, the record shows that Hananel visited the Massachusetts Interface office <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> prior to beginning formal, full time employment with IPI in January 1996. Later, while employed by IPI, Hananel attended a board meeting in Massachusetts as a direct result of an IPI investment.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Although Hananel does not deny that as manager of the IPI Israel office he had regular contact with the Needham office, he argues that his Massachusetts \"activities were minor administrative tasks insufficient to warrant jurisdiction.\" This argument understates his managerial role in IPI and the importance of the Massachusetts funding connection to the finances of IPI Israel. As discussed in greater detail below, we disagree with Hananel's characterization of his Massachusetts activities as \"purely incidental contacts\" and agree with the district court that they evince the relationship between Hananel's actions under the oral contract and the forum of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Purposeful Availment</h2>\n<p>For there to be personal jurisdiction over Hananel, his contacts must \"represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in [Massachusetts], thereby invoking the benefits and protections of [Massachusetts's] laws and making [his] presence before [Massachusetts'] courts foreseeable.\" <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 60; <i>see also </i><i>J. McIntyre Machinery,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2790 (specific jurisdiction calls for plaintiff to establish that defendant \"engaged in conduct purposefully directed at the forum\"); <i>id.</i> (\"The question is whether a defendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment concerning that conduct.\").</p>\n<p>Hananel directed regular administrative and financial conduct toward Massachusetts, and his contacts with the state were voluntary and the result of more than just a single event or transaction. We see no reason to deviate from our previous conclusion that \"given that it was Hananel who sought this employment contract with a company whose key officers were all located in Massachusetts and whose financial accounts were all administered out of Massachusetts, the court properly concluded that Hananel had purposefully availed himself of Massachusetts law.\" <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 50; <i>cf. </i><i>J. McIntyre Machinery,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2790 (no specific jurisdiction where defendant had no office in the forum, never \"sent any employees to[] the [forum]\" and \"does not have a single contact with [the forum] short of the\" sole piece of equipment at issue in the suit).</p>\n<p>That Hananel's December 1995 trip to Massachusetts was brief and its purpose was not found to be substantially related to negotiation of the agreement does not detract from the conclusion that the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate. Hananel \"need not have been physically present in [Massachusetts] in order to have `transacted business' there\" for purposes of establishing minimum contacts. <i>Hannon,</i> 524 F.3d at 281 (citing <i>Fairview Mach. &amp; Tool Co., Inc. v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 138 (D.Mass. 1999)) (holding that even though defendant had not been physically present in Massachusetts, \"contacts that [he] would have had to make to arrange for [prisoner's] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> transfer ... to Massachusetts are sufficient to constitute `transacting business' under the broadly-construed long-arm statute\").<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, as in <i>Hannon,</i> there was purposeful availment where Hananel's business activities for IPI involved, <i>inter alia,</i> \"communication and interaction between [him] in [Israel] and [staff] in Massachusetts.\" <i>See </i><i>Hannon,</i> 524 F.3d at 281. Affirming the district court's relevant factual findings, we conclude that Hananel's faxes, money transfers, and meetings demonstrate sufficient communications and interactions with Massachusetts to satisfy us that Hananel had at least minimum contacts with the forum and that these contacts were not \"random, isolated or fortuitous.\" <i>See </i><i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 50.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Reasonableness</h2>\n<p>To examine reasonableness, we consider the gestalt factors: \"(1) [Hananel's] burden of appearing, (2) [Massachusetts's] interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) [Adelson's] interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy, and [5] the common interests of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\" <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 51; <i>see also </i><i>N. Laminate Sales,</i> 403 F.3d at 26 (citing <i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 477, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span> (1985)).</p>\n<p>First, because Hananel has not demonstrated a \"special or unusual burden\" in staging a defense in Massachusetts over and above that of doing so in any foreign jurisdiction, we conclude that this factor does not weigh against jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Pritzker,</i> 42 F.3d at 64 (\"[I]nsofar as staging a defense in a foreign jurisdiction is almost always inconvenient and/or costly, we think this factor is only meaningful where a party can demonstrate some kind of special or unusual burden.\").<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, Hananel emphasizes the fact that both the district court and this court in the previous appeal were mistaken when they concluded that Adelson was a Massachusetts resident and domiciliary, when in fact he was a resident and domiciliary of Nevada. In presenting this argument, Hananel stakes too much on the importance of Adelson's state of residence to the personal jurisdiction analysis. Although this factual conclusion may have contributed to our original weighing of Massachusetts' interest in hearing the matter, Adelson's residency and domicile are not alone dispositive of personal jurisdiction and there are other facts that support Massachusetts' interests in the matter.</p>\n<p>When previously we connected Adelson's assumed Massachusetts residency with Massachusetts' interests in the case, we also noted that \"[Massachusetts'] interest... is further heightened by the involvement of IPI's executive officers who are employed in Massachusetts and of funds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> which are held and managed in Massachusetts.\" <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 51. Besides, given the relatedness and purposeful availment demonstrated here, the weight of this one factor within \"reasonableness\" is slight. <i>Sawtelle,</i> 70 F.3d at 1394 (internal quotation marks omitted) (\"[T]he weaker the plaintiff's showings on the first two prongs (relatedness and purposeful availment), the less a defendant need show in terms of unreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction. The reverse is equally true: an especially strong showing of reasonableness may serve to fortify a borderline showing of relatedness and purposefulness.\").</p>\n<p>Third, Adelson demonstrated his interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief through the federal courts in Massachusetts by bringing his suit there, and \"nothing about this case suggests that those courts will have any difficulty rendering effective relief\" if Adelson's declaratory action is affirmed. <i>See </i><i>Jet Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc. v. Bacardi &amp; Co., Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200035\"><a href=\"/opinion/200035/jet-wine-spirits-v-bacardi-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Fourth, although the district court noted that \"the existence of prior lawsuits in Israel ... make this case an inefficient burden on the judicial system,\" it concluded that \"this is `insufficient to tip the constitutional balance on the facts of this case.'\" <i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 79 (quoting <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 52).<sup>[6]</sup> We agree.</p>\n<p>As to the fifth and final factor, we do not see how a finding of jurisdiction here would speak one way or another to the common interests of all sovereigns in advancing a particular social policy.</p>\n<p>Even if the last two factors weighed against jurisdiction, this alone would be \"insufficient to tip the constitutional balance\" on the facts presented here. <i>Adelson I,</i> 510 F.3d at 51; <i>see also </i><i>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 210 (1st Cir.1994) (\"the reasonableness prong of the due process inquiry evokes a sliding scale\"). We conclude that the sum of the gestalt factors weigh in favor of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Given the reasonableness of exercising jurisdiction, the relatedness of the dispute to the forum, and Hananel's contacts with the forum, we affirm the district court's assertion of personal jurisdiction over Hananel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

Instead, Massachusetts looks to which party would be seeking damages had the matter been filed as a standard suit rather than as a declaratory action. <i>Stop &amp; Shop,</i> 200 N.E.2d at 252 (in a lease dispute, \"[h]ad the lessors brought an action for damages for breach of an implied covenant to continue operations they would, of course, have had the burden of showing the covenant. That the lessee initiated the proceeding for declaratory relief does not shift that burden to the lessee.\").</p>\n<p>Here, Hananel seeks an interpretation of the agreement that would permit him to assert a contractual right of recovery. As the natural plaintiff who would have had the burden of proving his affirmative claim to the twelve percent option in a damages action, we see no impropriety in assigning the burden of proof to him. <i>See </i><i>Markley v.

It is generally upon the party who will be defeated if no evidence relating to the issue is given on either side.\").</p>\n<p>Regardless, any error in assigning the burden of proof is harmless unless \"the court's ... decision at the end of the trial turned on `burden of proof' rules rather than on the weight of the evidence in the record.\" <i>Applewood Landscape &amp; Nursery Co., Inc. v. Hollingsworth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529277\"><a href=\"/opinion/529277/applewood-landscape-nursery-co-inc-v-wayne-b-hollingsworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span>, 1506 (1st Cir.1989). The district court's ruling indicates that it did not consider the burden of proof issue to be dispositive: after weighing evidence in the record, the district court concluded that \"it is <i>clear\"</i> that the parties did not reach \"a meeting of the minds.\" In any event, no matter who bore the burden of proof, as discussed below the finding that Hananel failed to \"initiate the investment\" prohibits a holding in favor of Hananel's exercise of the option.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. The Contract's Terms</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error. <i>Williams v. Poulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195087\"><a href=\"/opinion/195087/williams-v-poulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.1993). The district court concluded that there was no \"meeting of the minds\" about the meaning of the \"option\" in the contract, and even \"[i]n Hananel's best case\" his work \"[was] insufficient to constitute initiating the investment, under any reasonable understanding of the term.\" <i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 84.</p>\n<p>It is not disputed that Hananel and Adelson spoke several times between August 1995 and December 1995 regarding Hananel's employment with IPI. As noted, however, what they agreed to is disputed. Hananel testified that the intention was for him to have an option covering any investment proposed by him, except for investments in the United States. Adelson's position has been that they agreed that Hananel would receive a portion of net profits from a much narrower category of investments.</p>\n<p>It is also not disputed that Hananel, Adelson, and Roberts (IGM's general counsel) were present in the Needham, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> Massachusetts, office on December 5, 1995. But, the parties greatly dispute the exact contents and nature of that office visit. Adelson testified that the employment contract's final details were hammered out in that December meeting, including the meaning of alleged contract terms such as the share of \"net profits minus losses.\" In stark contrast, Hananel testified that the contract was finalized in Israel, the employment contract was not discussed during the December office visit, and, in any event, that visit did nothing to change the substance of the contract.</p>\n<p>The district court found that \"while a meeting [in Massachusetts] may have taken place, it was at most a rehash of the terms of Hananel's contract, which had already been finalized with Adelson in Israel.\" <i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 73. It then concluded: \"As to the extent and meaning of the term at the center of the dispute, the option in projects initiated by Hananel, <i>it is clear</i> that there was simply no meeting of the minds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 83 (emphasis added). We have scoured the record and have discovered no basis on which to upset that determination. As we have noted:</p>\n<p>In actions that are tried to the court, the judge's findings of fact are to be honored unless clearly erroneous, paying due respect to the judge's right to draw reasonable inferences and to gauge the credibility of witnesses. A corollary of this proposition is that, when there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.... [W]hen a case has been decided on the facts by a judge ... an appellate court must refrain from any temptation to retry the factual issues a new.</p>\n<p><i>Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702493\"><a href=\"/opinion/702493/pens-plan-guide-p-23912p-james-johnson-v-watts-regulator-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, 1138 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>In sum, the district court's finding that there was no \"meeting of the minds,\" was grounded in the record and not clearly erroneous. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lara,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764882\"><a href=\"/opinion/764882/united-states-v-giovanni-lara-appellantno-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir.1999) (\"After all, when the evidence gives rise to competing interpretations, each plausible, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, even accepting Hananel's argument that there <i>was</i> a \"meeting of the minds\" about the existence and scope of the twelve percent option clause, the district court's finding that Hananel failed to \"initiate\" whatever investment(s) Adelson subsequently made in Macau was also not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>As the district court noted, there were questions of veracity in both parties' accounts of the employment contract, the \"option,\" and the discussions of Macau. But, even viewing Hananel's account in the most favorable light, a reasonable observer applying practical business sense and plain meaning could conclude easily that satisfying the \"initiate\" requirement of the option  on what would become a $7 billion project  would have required Hananel to do more than what his evidence showed: discuss Macau during a few 1999 meetings; prepare limited materials on Macau for Adelson's review; \"research[] Macau generally\" and potential investments in Macau; give Adelson some third-party maps and brochures; and urge him to visit Macau. As the district court described it, \"Hananel may have gotten Adelson's wheels spinning, but he never got anything in gear.\" <i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 84.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. The Missing Witness Rule</h2>\n<p>Hananel's final argument is that the district court abused its discretion when it denied him a \"missing witness\" inference, because Adelson did not call an Israeli witness, Danny Raviv, as Hananel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> had expected. After a jury trial, a claim about failure to give a missing witness instruction indeed would be reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>Latin Am. Music Co. v. Am. Soc. of Composers, Authors &amp; Publishers,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span>, 101 (1st Cir.2010) (instructing jury on \"missing witness\" rule reviewed for abuse of discretion). As this was a bench trial, however, we review for clear error the decision not to draw the inference. <i>See </i><i>Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781269\"><a href=\"/opinion/781269/elizabeth-v-bogosian-plaintiff-appellantcross-appellee-v-woloohojian/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir. 2003). We conclude that the district court, as factfinder, was under no obligation to draw the adverse inference, for the \"`missing witness' rule <i>permits,</i> rather than <i>compels,</i> the factfinder to draw [the] inference..., particularly where the factfinder concludes that the party who requested the... inference failed to subpoena a witness otherwise available to testify.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added) (no error in bench trial where district court did not draw adverse inference from absence of witnesses).</p>\n<p>Hananel has not shown the necessity for applying the missing witness rule here. First, he offers no concrete evidence that demonstrates that Raviv was peculiarly available or obviously partial to Adelson. <i>United States v. Spinosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597409\"><a href=\"/opinion/597409/united-states-v-vincent-d-spinosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, 631-32 (1st Cir.1992) (missing witness rule permits adverse inference only when witness is \"peculiarly available to\" to party not seeking the instruction or \"favorably disposed\" to him); <i>Steinhilber v. McCarthy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2406778\"><a href=\"/opinion/2406778/steinhilber-v-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 280 (D.Mass.1998). Second, he has not provided a satisfactory explanation for why, if Raviv's testimony was so essential, he failed to take any action to compel the witness's appearance in court. According to Hananel, other witnesses in Israel for whom he had obtained letters rogatory were not as important to the disposition of this action as Raviv. Yet, he failed to pursue similar action to depose Raviv, and he offers no proof that obtaining a subpoena or letter rogatory would have been impossible. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Anderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202292\"><a href=\"/opinion/202292/united-states-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2006) (denying instruction, stating, \"The fact that [the party] was able to subpoena [the witness] yet failed to do so gives us additional reason to believe that the district court was correct in finding that [the witness] was not `peculiarly available' to the [opposing party]\").</p>\n<p>As the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>In this case, however, there is no reason to believe that Raviv was not available to testify if called by the Defendant. Defendant made no effort to call him to testify or to depose him. In this case, where Raviv's testimony would likely cut both ways, the Court is unwilling to allow Defendant the dual benefit of avoiding Raviv's potentially damaging testimony by purposely failing to call him, while simultaneously giving him the benefit of a negative inference for Plaintiff's failure to call him.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Adelson II,</i> 641 F.Supp.2d at 77 n. 3 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>This finding was not erroneous. The appellant's argument appears to be a manifestation of his regret at his decision not to confront Raviv in court. Regret is not a ground for reversal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The statute provides that \"[a] court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's transacting any business in this commonwealth.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3(a).</p>\n<p>[2]  Although, as Hananel points out, the district court concluded that the agreement was governed by Israeli law, this conclusion does not affect the outcome of our jurisdictional analysis because the issue before us is one of personal jurisdiction, not choice of law. <i>J.

We have no occasion to consider that decision.
