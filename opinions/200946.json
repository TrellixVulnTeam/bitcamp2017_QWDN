Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Coffin and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Lorenzo J. Palomares, by Appointment of the Court, on brief\nfor appellant.\n     German A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, H.S.\nGarcía, United States Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-Pabón,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              March 24, 2004\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.              This is the last chapter of a\n\ncriminal prosecution for aiding and abetting in a drug transaction\n\nconspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 18 U.S.C. § 2, and\n\nusing a firearm in relation to such transaction, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).          Appellant appeals from a judgment imposing\n\na sentence of 84 months on the ground that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in refusing to allow him to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea.\n\n     This is a very hard row for appellant to hoe.              The standard of\n\nreview, as appellant agrees, is abuse of discretion.                      He also\n\nagrees that the burden of establishing a \"fair and just\" reason for\n\nwithdrawal of a plea is upon the defendant and that the four\n\ncriteria we    employ      in    making    this   determination     are   (1)   the\n\nplausibility of proffered reasons, (2) the timing of the motion for\n\nwithdrawal,    (3)   the    presence       or   absence   of   an   assertion   of\n\ninnocence, and (4) the voluntariness or involuntariness of the plea\n\nin derogation of the requirements set out by Fed. R. Crim. P. 11.\n\nSee United States v. Muriel, 111 F.3d 975, 978 (lst Cir. 1997).                 We\n\nadd that we review findings of fact with \"considerable deference .\n\n. . to the firsthand assessment\" of the district court.                    United\n\nStates v. Aker, 181 F.3d 167, 170 (lst Cir. 1999)(citing United\n\nStates v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 348 (lst Cir. 1997)).\n\n     We begin with the chronology of the plea proceedings, which\n\nreveals not only an absence of haste and pressure, but efforts to\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\faccommodate appellant in moments of uncertainty or confusion.             The\n\nfirst    motion   for   change   of    plea   occurred   five   months   after\n\nappellant's not guilty plea at arraignment.              Three weeks later,\n\nappellant asked the court to delay a change of plea hearing to\n\nreflect over discussions he had had with an attorney other than his\n\nown counsel, who had expressed an opinion that a more favorable\n\nplea agreement, eliminating the firearms charge, might be possible.\n\nThe court granted a substantial continuance. Two months passed, in\n\nwhich a plea agreement was arrived at between the government and\n\nappellant, accompanied by a statement of facts which contained\n\nadmissions of appellant that he had aided and abetted others in a\n\ndrug transaction and was carrying a loaded firearm.              A change of\n\nplea hearing was held on October 26, 2001.           Three months elapsed.\n\nThen, on January 25, 2002, a motion to withdraw the plea was filed.\n\nThis was denied almost four months later.\n\n        In addressing the criteria of \"fair and just\" reasons for\n\nchange of plea, we note the three month delay in filing the motion\n\nto withdraw the guilty plea.          Appellant here faces a considerable\n\nobstacle in overcoming the disfavor accompanying such a belated\n\nmotion as that in this case.          See, e.g., United States v. Parilla-\n\nTirado, 22 F.3d 368, 373 (lst Cir. 1994).\n\n        The justification advanced in the motion consisted of the\n\nfollowing sentences:       \"Defendant further advised he had always\n\nwanted to exercise his right to a jury trial; that he was innocent\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fof the charges and had entered the guilty plea as he felt pressured\n\nto do so.\"\n\n     Defendant sought to explain his delay in filing the motion on\n\nthe ground that there had been no visit by his counsel.    But there\n\nis no indication that a visit had been requested and counsel added\n\na footnote stating that there was no need for such a visit prior to\n\nan interview with the Probation Officer.\n\n     The district court noted the complete absence of evidentiary\n\nsupport and held that defendant had not met his burden to show the\n\nplea was involuntarily made and that the request for withdrawal\n\nwas bulwarked by a fair and just reason.\n\n     No further enlightenment as to defendant's reasons arose until\n\nsix months later, on July 22, 2002, at defendant's sentencing\n\nhearing.     Only then were specific grounds identified.\n\n     There are three such.     The first is that appellant's mother\n\nhad a \"grave illness.\"     On examination of the sentencing hearing\n\nrecord, this turns out to be appellant's mother's extreme fear of\n\na trial and appellant's wishing to avoid that trauma so that she\n\nmight recover. While deeply respecting such feelings, we could not\n\nvery well accept such a reason as a sufficient basis to justify a\n\nbelated withdrawal of plea motion, without dismantling the bulk of\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11 jurisprudence.\n\n     Appellant's second reason is the belatedly surfacing statement\n\nfrom appellant's long incarcerated co-defendant, Velazquez-Rivera,\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fwho stated that appellant was completely unaware of the pending\n\ndrug sale of two kilograms of cocaine, and that appellant was\n\npresent because Velazquez was going to sell a gold chain for\n\nappellant to one Cruz.1     When Velazquez picked up the chain,\n\nappellant accompanied Velazquez to meet Cruz, but when they met,\n\nVelazquez approached Cruz \"to prevent [appellant] from noticing the\n\ntransaction [sale of the cocaine].\"    The skeptical reader may be\n\nforgiven for asking why appellant insisted on accompanying his\n\nappointed sales agent and why Velazquez allowed appellant to\n\naccompany him if he was so insistent on concealing the drug\n\ntransaction from him.     And, we note, there was no exculpatory\n\nexplanation why appellant came to the scene with a loaded gun.\n\n     A final reason advanced by appellant was that the prosecutor\n\nwas prejudiced against appellant, treating his co-defendants more\n\nfavorably.   This argument was not elaborated on with enough detail\n\nfor us to make any judgment, certainly not a judgment that an\n\negregious miscarriage of justice had occurred.\n\n     What we have observed about the absence of a sufficiently\n\nplausible articulated basis for change of plea also serves to\n\naddress the adequacy of appellant's assertion of innocence. We add\n\nonly that the absence of any attempt to justify the possession on\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      This unsworn statement, dated December 5, 2001, was submitted\nto the court on May 29, 2002, with a motion for reconsideration of\nthe court's denial of defendant's request to withdraw his plea.\n\n                                -5-\n\fhis person of a loaded hand gun constitutes another barrier to the\n\npersuasiveness of his justification.\n\n      It remains to assess from the record whether appellant's plea\n\nof   guilty   was   an   understanding    and   voluntary   one.    We   make\n\nallowances for some difficulty in hearing and a period of confusion\n\nin dealing with the court's Rule 11 questions.               But the entire\n\nsequence of proceedings appears to us above any serious criticism.\n\nThe plea agreement spelled out the counts of the indictment, the\n\npenalties, guidelines and calculations, the warnings, the rights\n\nsurrendered, satisfaction with counsel.           And the change of plea\n\nhearing was conducted with meticulous care by the district judge,\n\nwith sensitivity to any difficulty of understanding registered by\n\nappellant.     Counsel for appellant was not only one of recognized\n\ncompetence but was highly regarded by appellant.            When asked if he\n\nwas satisfied with counsel's representation, appellant replied,\n\n\"very much so.\"\n\n      Our judgment, therefore, is that appellant has fallen far\n\nshort of presenting the kind of compelling case that could mandate\n\nreversal.     Were we to find an abuse of discretion on this record,\n\nthere would be very little sense in conducting a Rule 11 hearing.\n\nThe most careful inquiry and most deliberate answers would be swept\n\naway by \"second thoughts . . . . about the wisdom of [an] earlier\n\ndecision,\" Parilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f",
