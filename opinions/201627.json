PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     The Appellants (hereinafter “Defendants”) were convicted after\n\njury trial in the District of Puerto Rico of the offenses of\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine, attempting to distribute cocaine,\n\nboth in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1), and of\n\ncarrying firearms during and in relation to the commission of a\n\ndrug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).\n\nDefendants     Villafane-Jimenez      (hereinafter       “Villafane”)   and\n\nRodriguez-Nichols (hereinafter “Rodriguez”) were each sentenced to\n\nprison     terms   totaling   295    months.    Defendant    Pena-Martinez\n\n(hereinafter “Pena”) was sentenced to a prison term of 352 months.1\n\nAll three Defendants were made subject to supervised release terms\n\nof five years.\n\n     The     Defendants   appeal    their   respective    convictions   and\n\nchallenge     various     aspects    of     their   respective    sentence\n\ndeterminations and the imposition of certain specific conditions of\n\nsupervised release. This Court has appellate jurisdiction over the\n\ncase under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a).             The Court\n\nwill consider the issues the Defendants generate on appeal, affirm\n\n\n\n     1\n     The total sentences of Villafane and Rodriguez are made up of\nconcurrent sentences on Counts I and II of 235 months plus a\nstatutorily mandated consecutive sentence thereto of 60 months on\nCount III.    Pena’s total sentence is made up of 292 month\nconcurrent sentences on Counts I and II plus the consecutive 60\nmonth sentence on Count III.\n\n                                    -3-\n\ftheir convictions and affirm their sentences in part, remanding for\n\nresentencing of each Defendant only with respect to the drug\n\ntreatment condition of supervised release.\n\n     II.    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n     There is no significant dispute as to the specific acts and\n\nconduct of each of the Defendants that are the basis for their\n\nindictments and convictions.         The Defendants admitted to these at\n\ntrial.      The only dispute goes to the intent with which the\n\nDefendants    engaged   in   that    conduct.    The    conduct   itself   is\n\ndisplayed in the record as follows.\n\n     Special Agent Jeffrey Pelaez was employed by the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation’s (hereinafter “FBI”) Public Corruption\n\nUnit in Washington, D.C.         He was assigned to the FBI resident\n\nagency in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to investigate allegations of\n\npolice     corruption   within   the    Puerto   Rico   Police    Department\n\n(hereinafter “PRPD”).        He was in charge of an operation known as\n\n“Honor Perdido.”2       The operation lasted from June 2000 to June\n\n2001.    In the course of the operation, Pelaez recruited ex-police\n\nofficer Arturo Ortiz-Colon (hereinafter “Ortiz”) as an informant\n\nand undercover operative.           Ortiz had lost his position in the\n\nPuerto Rican police because of prior criminal activity.              He had\n\nalso witnessed criminal activity of officers within the PRPD.\n\n\n     2\n     This operation generated this Court’s consideration of issues\nnot involved in the present case in United States v. Flecha-\nMaldonado, 373 F.3d 170 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fPelaez launched Ortiz as his operative in a drug “sting” operation\n\naimed at corrupt police officers.\n\n     Arrangements were made for Ortiz to pose as an actual FBI\n\nagent.   He was given credentials, agency business cards, a marked\n\nvehicle, and a gun, all to create the impression that he was an FBI\n\nagent.   The FBI rented two apartments at an expensive resort.\n\nOrtiz lived in one of those apartments, which was wired for audio\n\nand video surveillance, and the FBI used the other apartment to\n\nmonitor what was happening in Ortiz’s apartment.\n\n     The evidence would support a jury finding that Ortiz was to\n\npretend to be a corrupt FBI agent involved in a drug trafficking\n\norganization in which “the boss” was a fictional Columbian male\n\nnamed “El Viejo.”   Ortiz was to appear to be looking, on behalf of\n\nthe fictional El Viejo, for law enforcement officers to transport\n\nEl Viejo’s drug shipments, and to protect the shipments from rival\n\ndrug gangs and intervening police officers.    He was to approach\n\nindividuals who he personally knew, or had reason to believe, were\n\ncorrupt,3 and solicit them to carry out an illegal drug transport\n\nand be paid to do it.\n\n     The Government’s evidence supports a finding that Ortiz did,\n\nin fact, pose to the Defendants as a corrupt FBI officer engaged in\n\nillicit drug trafficking.   The jury could reasonably have found\n\n\n     3\n      Neither Villafane nor Rodriguez were known to Ortiz prior to\nthe time he recruited them after being introduced to them by Pena.\nNone of the Defendants had any record of criminal convictions.\n\n                                -5-\n\fthat he approached Pena representing that he needed policemen\n\nwilling to assist him in a major illegal shipment of contraband\n\ncocaine by unloading the drugs, transporting the drugs to their\n\ndestination,    unloading   them   from   the   vehicles,   and   providing\n\nthroughout security to the operation as armed, uniformed police\n\nofficers.4   Agent Pelaez described at trial a meeting between Ortiz\n\nand the Defendants on May 9, 2001, which he monitored by television\n\nsurveillance.     Ortiz there discussed with the Defendants the\n\n“specifics” of how the transportation of cocaine would occur.            He\n\ntold the Defendants that the cocaine was owned by “El Viejo,” who\n\nwould be the person paying them for their services. Agent Pelaez’s\n\ntestimony also described the Defendants’ videotaped activities in\n\nunloading the drugs from a boat at a marina and putting them in a\n\nJeep Cherokee on May 11, 2001.      All of the Defendants handled and\n\ntransported the drugs and Rodriguez patrolled the area with “a\n\nfully automatic machine gun” to protect against any interference\n\nwith the conduct of the operation.\n\n     Pena and Rodriguez left the marina area where the drugs were\n\nobtained in Ortiz’s vehicle with the drugs and a rifle and their\n\nsidearms.    Villafane, also armed, followed them in a marked police\n\n\n     4\n      The prosecution witnesses testified at trial that they did not\nspecifically require the Defendants to carry firearms, but that it\nwas assumed that the Defendants would do so. This assumption was\napparently understood by the Defendants as they appeared on the day\nof the transport/escort uniformed and armed. They contended at\ntrial that this occurred only because they were fresh from other\npolice duties.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fcruiser “to provide security.”       They took the drugs to Ortiz’s\n\napartment.    Their   activities    there   were   videotaped.5   At   a\n\nsubsequent meeting on May 14, the Defendants were each paid $5000\n\nin cash and they discussed the operation and how it could be better\n\ndone the next time.   Thus, the thrust of the Government’s evidence\n\nwas that the three Defendants understood that they were being\n\nrecruited by a corrupt FBI agent to participate in an illicit,\n\nmajor drug trafficking project for which they would receive at\n\nleast $4000 and that they willingly participated therein.\n\n     Defendants challenge the validity of the drug convictions on\n\nCounts I and II and their convictions on Count III, claiming that\n\nthey thought all along that Ortiz was a legitimate FBI officer\n\nseeking their assistance in legitimate law enforcement activities\n\naimed at curtailing an illegal drug transaction.\n\n     The Defendants also attack their convictions on Count III on\n\nthe separate basis that they carried their weapons because they\n\nwere required by law to do so when in uniform and that the presence\n\nof the firearms at the scene of their drug trafficking activities\n\nwas merely coincidental to the drug trafficking activities and not\n\n\n\n\n     5\n     Various videotapes and audiotapes reflecting the interaction\nof the Defendants with Ortiz at various stages of the operation\nwere played to the jury at trial.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f“in relation to” the drug trafficking activities, as the statute,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), requires.6\n\n     III.   THE CHALLENGES TO THE CONVICTIONS\n\n     A.     The Estoppel by Entrapment Defense\n\n     Defendants seek reversal of their convictions because, they\n\nallege, their prosecution violates fairness elements of Due Process\n\nof Law under the Federal Constitution.    They claim this to be so\n\n\n\n     6\n     We note in advancing to a discussion of the substantive\naspects of Defendants’ challenges to their convictions, as\ndistinguished from the sentencing issues they generate, that these\nchallenges come to us on two separate procedural footings. We have\nreviewed carefully these circumstances and conclude that the\nsubstantive issues are paramount to our resolution of the appeal\nand that the procedural nuances below have no impact on that\nresolution.\n\n     We assume, for reasons of judicial economy, and despite\nuncertainties that arise from the contours of his briefing on\nappeal, that Defendant Pena intends that his arguments for reversal\nof the conviction on Count I also relate to that on Count II.\n\n     The standard of review for determining whether the denial of\na Rule 29 Motion is erroneous is de novo. United States v. Rivera-\nRuiz, 244 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\nHernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998). The standard is the\nsame in conducting a review of the record on appeal to examine the\nviability of a free-standing challenge to the sufficiency of the\nevidence.   United States v. Caron, 64 F.3d 713, 715 (1st Cir.\n1995).\n\n     We treat the position of all three Defendants in seeking\nreversal of the convictions on all three Counts as raising the same\ntwo substantive issues for resolution: (1) whether the evidence was\nsufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt each Defendant’s\nspecific intent to commit each of the three crimes by reason of an\nestoppel by entrapment and (2) whether the evidence as to Count III\nwas sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each\nDefendant’s carrying of a firearm was “in relation to” the\ncommission of the drug trafficking offenses.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fbecause    they   offered       evidence,      disputed    by       the   Government’s\n\nevidence at trial, that they reasonably relied on representations,\n\nwhich they allege were made by Ortiz, that the conduct upon which\n\ntheir     convictions     are    based    was    part     of    a    legitimate   law\n\nenforcement project Ortiz was carrying out in his capacity as an\n\nFBI agent.      This, they argue, implicitly represented to them that\n\ntheir conduct was legal.7            Hence, they assert, the convictions\n\nshould     be   vacated    because       the    Government      is    estopped    from\n\nprosecuting them by reason of their entrapment into the illegal\n\nactivity.\n\n        The short answer to this contention is that the Defendants\n\nhave the burden of proof to establish at trial their defense of\n\nestoppel by entrapment and they failed to do so.                     They had a full\n\nopportunity to adduce any evidence they wished in support of that\n\ndefense, their counsel argued the defense to the jury, and the\n\ndistrict court gave instructions to the jury concerning the defense\n\n(as to which there were no objections), and the defense was\n\nultimately submitted to the jury on a disputed record.                      The result\n\nat trial was that the jury found for the Government.                       We conclude\n\n\n\n     7\n     It is to be noted that the record does not disclose that the\nDefendants have ever made any specific claim that Ortiz told them\nin so many words, that is, made an “affirmative representation,”\nthat their conduct was, or would be “legal.” Such an affirmative\nrepresentation has been held to be required as an element of the\nestoppel by entrapment defense, to be proven by the Defendant.\nUnited States v. Ellis, 168 F.3d 558, 561 (1st Cir. 1999). That\nargument is not made by the parties here.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fafter a careful review of the trial record that the evidence is\n\nsufficient to support that result.\n\n     In briefing on this appeal, the Defendants simply reargue the\n\nfactual aspects of the defense in juxtaposition to the Government’s\n\nevidence    that   they,   in   fact,   committed    each   of   the   charged\n\noffenses.    On a general theory, Defendants assert that all of the\n\nevidence is insufficient to prove that they possessed specific\n\ncriminal intent to commit the offense.        There is no claim made here\n\nthat evidence material to the defense was limited or excluded at\n\ntrial.     It is not contended that the issues generated by the\n\ndefense were not submitted to the jury or that those issues were\n\ntaken away from jury consideration on the evidentiary record.\n\nMoreover, it is not contended that there was any defect in the jury\n\ninstructions given by the Court in respect to the defense.                  The\n\nthrust of the arguments as they are made can only be viewed as the\n\nassertion of a claim that the Defendants established at trial the\n\ndefense of estoppel by entrapment as a matter of law.              Review of\n\nsuch a claim is plenary because “the issue is whether or not there\n\nwas sufficient evidence to support a theory of defense ....”\n\nCaron, 64 F.3d at 715.\n\n     In order to establish the subject defense at trial, the\n\nDefendants were required to establish that (1) a governmental\n\nofficial told them their conduct was legal; (2) they relied on that\n\nrepresentation;     (3)    their   reliance    was    reasonable       in   the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcircumstances; and (4) given that reliance, prosecution for the\n\nconduct is unfair.    Ellis, 168 F.3d at 561; United States v. Smith,\n\n940 F.2d 710, 715 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n     Our careful review of this record convinces us that there is\n\nno basis to conclude that the Defendants’ proof warranted the\n\nacceptance of the defense as a matter of law.                    Clearly, the\n\nevidence made, at best, issues of fact for a fact-finder to resolve\n\nas to the viability of the defense.\n\n     Whether a reasonable fact-finder should be persuaded of the\n\nvalidity of the defense depends entirely, in the circumstances of\n\nthis record, upon the resolution of any number of disputed issues\n\nof fact and the determination of the credibility, in whole or in\n\npart, of nearly every witness who testified at trial.                These are\n\ntypical jury functions for the resolution of disputed questions of\n\nfact.\n\n     The   lynchpin   for    the    resolution    of     the    issue   of   the\n\nDefendants’ intent is the determination of fact as to what Ortiz\n\ntold them (and what they understood) about the legal status of the\n\noperation:   either   that   it    was   an   exercise   in    legitimate    law\n\nenforcement (as the Defendants contend) or that it was to be\n\nassistance to a corrupt FBI agent in illegally transporting,\n\nescorting, and safeguarding a shipment of contraband drugs for a\n\ngarden-variety   civilian     drug       trafficker    (as     the   Government\n\ncontends).    A choice among these two alternatives resolves the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fissue of whether there is sufficient evidence to establish the\n\nDefendants’ guilty intent.\n\n     All Defendants asserted in ambiguous language that they were\n\nled to believe that the project was a covert or undercover police\n\noperation.     Ortiz and Pelaez testified that the Defendants were\n\ntold it was an illegal activity from the beginning.               There is\n\nabundant   evidence   in   the   record    to   support   the   Defendants’\n\nconvictions.    It could be concluded that the Defendants were told\n\nthe operation was an illegal one and that the description and\n\ncircumstances of the project would have left them, as experienced\n\npolice officers, no room to reasonably believe that it was a\n\nlegitimate law enforcement effort.        Further, the evidence supports\n\na finding that they knew, because told by Ortiz, that there would\n\nbe no arrest as a result of the seizure and transport of the\n\ncontraband, a strange circumstance for a legal police operation.\n\nThey were told that they were to be paid a sum of money (not less\n\nthan $4000) for their participation in the project that was far in\n\nexcess of the usual rate of compensation of line police officers\n\nfor an a couple of hours of official work.           They were told the\n\nultimate amount of their compensation would depend upon the amount\n\nof drugs transported by them.      They were told that the money for\n\ntheir compensation would come from the supposed owner of the drugs,\n\nnot from FBI funds.    They were ultimately paid and accepted $5000\n\neach for their efforts and the payments were made in cash at\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fOrtiz’s apartment. The circumstances of their compensation and the\n\ndetermination of the amount of it were, alone, forceful, persuasive\n\nproof    from   which   a   reasonable   jury   could   conclude   that   the\n\nDefendants knew they were not participating in a legitimate police\n\noperation and were a confirmation of Defendants’ culpable knowledge\n\nand intent from the very beginning of their involvement in the\n\noperation.      That confirmation is entirely consistent with all of\n\nthe other evidence indicating the guilt of the Defendants.\n\n        We conclude that the defense was properly submitted to the\n\njury on unchallenged instructions, that no error occurred in that\n\nrespect, that the record amply supports the jury’s verdict and that\n\nthe Rule 29 Motion was properly denied.\n\n        B.   The Weapons Charge-Count III\n\n        We assume the Defendants press the estoppel by entrapment\n\nargument to attack the existence of specific intent on Count III,\n\nbut we find that position is without merit in the record.            First,\n\nthe argument that Rodriguez never drew his sidearm overlooks\n\nentirely that evidence in the record (that was undisputed) that he\n\nwas asked to carry a police-owned automatic rifle during the\n\ntransport and escort activities to discourage intervention by\n\nothers, and that he did, in fact, do so.        This evidence, by itself,\n\nis enough to permit a jury to conclude that Rodriguez had the\n\ngeneral knowledge and intent to carry a firearm during and in\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\frelation to his activity in the transport/escort as charged in\n\nCount III.\n\n      The    Government      did    not    need     to    prove    that    Defendants\n\nspecifically intended to use or did use a firearm in the course of\n\nthe transport activity in order for a jury to convict them of the\n\nCount     III     offense.      The     Government        needed    only   to    prove\n\nindividually their general intent, e.g., that they each knew that\n\nthey carried a firearm during the course of the drug offense\n\nconduct, in order to lay a predicate in the evidence that was\n\nadequate for their convictions on Count III.                   See United States v.\n\nBrown, 915 F.2d 219, 225 (6th Cir. 1990).                         We find that the\n\nevidence clearly supports the existence of that level of knowledge\n\nby all three Defendants, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n        Defendants also advanced below the argument on the Rule 29\n\nMotion, and reiterate it here, that the evidence was insufficient\n\nto satisfy the “nexus” requirement of the violation charged in\n\nCount III.        This element of the possession offense is treated at\n\nlength in United States v. Grace, 367 F.3d 29 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThere we said that the current version of the statute does not\n\nrequire     the    Government      to   show     that    the   Defendant    “actively\n\nemployed” the firearm “in furtherance of” the drug crime.                       Id. at\n\n35.   We held, however, that it must be shown in order to secure a\n\nconviction that the Defendant has “possessed the gun to further the\n\ndrug crime.”         Id. (emphasis added).              In Grace, the underlying\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\foffenses were possession and distribution of drugs.      The Court\n\nthere found that the possession of the gun was in furtherance of\n\nthe possession and distribution of the drugs.     We said that the\n\n“government must illustrate through specific facts, which tie the\n\ndefendant to the firearm, that the firearm was possessed to advance\n\nor promote the criminal activity.”    Id. (quoting United States v.\n\nLawrence, 308 F.3d 623, 630 (6th Cir. 2002)).\n\n     The evidence material to Count III of this Indictment can\n\nproperly be evaluated on the basis that the jury approached its\n\nconsideration of this Count having concluded that the Defendants\n\nwere guilty on Counts I and II.   Once it is established that the\n\nDefendants had the specific intent to engage in a conspiracy to\n\ndistribute drugs illegally and to participate actively in the\n\nattempt to distribute them, the question becomes whether the\n\nevidence established a “nexus” between that criminal conduct on\n\nCounts I and II and possession by the Defendants of the firearms.8\n\n     As noted previously, in the case of Rodriguez, the existence\n\nof such a nexus is transparently clear because he patrolled the\n\ndrug transfer site at Ortiz’s instructions with an automatic rifle\n\nfrom the Defendants’ police cruiser.    It was easily to be deduced\n\n\n     8\n      The evidence is overwhelming (indeed, it is undisputed) that\neach Defendant personally carried at least one firearm during the\ntransport/escort activities. This evidence is clearly sufficient\nto meet the requirement of specific facts which tie the Defendants\nto the firearms. Grace, 367 F.3d at 35; United States v. Vazquez\nGuadalupe, __ F.3d __, No. 02-2505, 2005 WL 1163678, at *1 (1st\nCir. May 18, 2005).\n\n                               -15-\n\fby the jury in the circumstances that the obvious intent of that\n\nconduct was to discourage “intervenors” from interfering in the\n\ntransfer and escort of the drugs.             That conduct was clearly “in\n\nfurtherance of” the transport and escort of the drugs.\n\n      The situation is little different in the cases of Villafane\n\nand   Pena   even   though    they   assert    (and    the   record   does   not\n\ncontradict) that they never drew or used their sidearms in the\n\ncourse of the transport/escort activity.                As noted above, the\n\nbrandishing or use of firearms is not a necessary element of the\n\nCount III offense.        Grace, 367 F.3d at 35.       The evidence supports\n\nthe conclusion that the sole and mutually understood purpose of\n\nDefendants’ participation in the activity as law officers was to\n\nprevent,     by   their    presence,    other    drug     dealers     or   other\n\nlegitimately motivated police officers from interfering in and\n\ndisrupting the transport of the drugs.                It is obvious that the\n\npresence of the guns, displayed in the open, by the Defendants as\n\nactive participants in the illegal activity, would have a tendency\n\nto discourage interruption of the transport by other persons and\n\nwas intended by the Defendants to do so.                Further, it could be\n\nfairly inferred by the jury that potential intervenors would likely\n\nalso bear arms and that the presence of the Defendants’ firearms in\n\nopen view would disabuse any potential intervenor of any thought\n\nthat he would enjoy a superiority of force in intervening in the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fsituation.   The possession of the firearms did, as intended by the\n\nDefendants, “further” the illegal drug trafficking activities.\n\n     We are satisfied, viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, that this record clearly justifies\n\na rational jury in concluding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all\n\nof the Defendants possessed their firearms at the time of the\n\ntransport/escort   activity     in    order   to   further   the   successful\n\nexecution of the illegal drug trafficking activity in question.\n\nThe possession was “in relation to” that activity.                  Id.    The\n\nverdict on Count III is supported in the record as to all three\n\nDefendants, and the Rule 29 Motion was properly denied.\n\n     IV.   THE CHALLENGES TO THE ELEMENTS OF SENTENCE\n\n     Defendants raise on appeal three distinct issues of substance\n\nin respect to their sentences: (1) that Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\n\nU.S. 466 (2000), Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), and\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005) require a remand for\n\nresentencing in light of the non-mandatory status of the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines; (2) that the district court committed\n\nerrors in imposing on Defendant Villafane a condition of supervised\n\nrelease requiring that he submit to searches by his supervising\n\nofficer while on his term of supervised release; and (3) that the\n\ndistrict   court   erred   in   the    structure    of   the   condition    of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fsupervised release imposed on Defendants Pena and Villafane in\n\nrespect to the frequency of their submission to drug testing.9\n\n     A.   The Blakely/Booker Challenges10\n\n     The record makes it clear that in determining all of these\n\nsentences the district court followed the analytical regime in\n\nplace before rendition of the decision in Booker.            It is to be\n\npresumed and it is, in fact, clear from the record that the\n\nDistrict Judge considered herself required to determine and impose\n\nsentences as established by the Sentencing Guidelines.              It is\n\nequally   clear   that   in   working    out   the   necessary   guideline\n\ndeterminations, she made several findings of fact critical to the\n\n\n\n     9\n     Defendants Pena and Rodriguez also raise issues concerning the\ndistrict court’s application of Guidelines § 3C1.1 (obstruction of\njustice), § 3B1.3 (abuse of position of public authority), and §\n3E1.1 (acceptance of responsibility). We have carefully reviewed\nthese claims, which were forfeited below, United States v.\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 n.7 (1st Cir. 2005), for the\nexistence of plain error. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n733 (1993).\n\n     We find that on the records made below at trial and in the\nsentencing proceedings these claims of error are facially without\nmerit and that no semblance of error, plain or otherwise, exists in\nthe district court’s findings in support of its application of the\nsubject Guidelines.    These claims do not warrant any detailed\ndiscussion. It suffices to say that the record contains abundant\nevidence to support the conclusions that Pena obstructed justice by\nhis testimony at trial, both Pena and Rodriguez abused a position\nof public trust and authority by participating in a drug\ntrafficking transaction as uniformed police officers, and that\nneither was entitled to receive a reduction in the offense level\nbecause they had truly accepted responsibility for their acts.\n     10\n      This analysis tracks closely that set out in the case of\nUnited States v. Bailey, 405 F.3d 102 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                  -18-\n\fdetermination of the extent of the final sentences which were not\n\nwithin the scope of jury findings in determining the guilt of the\n\nDefendants and which were not admitted by the Defendants.    It is\n\nalso clear that she made those findings upon application of the\n\npreponderance of the evidence standard.\n\n     There is now no room for doubt that sentences based upon a\n\npredicate of mandated compliance with the requirements of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines do not now pass constitutional muster.   The\n\nsentences imposed on these Defendants do not comply with the\n\nholding of Booker in that respect.\n\n     The Defendants did not, however, object to their sentences on\n\nSixth Amendment grounds in the district court.11 Because Defendants\n\n\n\n     11\n      None of the Defendants made any attack on the sentences in\nthe district court on Sixth Amendment or other constitutional\ngrounds. Such an assertion of error was first made under Blakely\nby Defendant Rodriquez in his second amended brief filed on July\n20, 2004, while this case was pending for argument on this appeal.\nDefendant Villafane made his first assertion of a Blakely error in\nhis Supplemental Brief of Appellant filed on August 18, 2004. Pena\ndid not challenge the constitutionality of the Sentencing\nGuidelines or assert the existence of error under Apprendi in\neither the district court or in the first round of briefing on this\nappeal.\n\n     Thereafter, on January 12, 2005, while this case was under\nadvisement, the Supreme Court decided Booker, confirming the\napplication of the holdings in Apprendi and Blakely to sentences\nimposed under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. This Court\nthen entered on March 8, 2005, its standard order in such cases\ninviting the briefing of any claims made under Booker and its\nantecedent authorities.    All three Defendants thereafter filed\nsupplemental briefs asserting the existence of Booker error and the\ngovernment has responded to those assertions by its own\nsupplemental brief.\n\n                               -19-\n\fmade        no   arguments   in   the    district    court   concerning   the\n\nconstitutionality of the Guidelines or the application of the\n\nGuidelines to their sentences under Apprendi, we review only for\n\nplain error.12       See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76.13\n\n       Under the four-part plain error test outlined in Olano, we\n\ngrant relief only if we find (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and\n\nthat not only (3) affected the defendant’s substantial rights, but\n\nalso (4) “seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.”           Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n\n77 (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 736).                The Defendants bear the\n\nburden of persuasion with respect to all four elements of the test.\n\nSee United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 302 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (citing Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77).\n\n       The first two prongs are satisfied here because the district\n\ncourt treated the Guidelines as mandatory at sentencing.                  See\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77.            To meet the third prong of the\n\n\n\n       12\n      The Defendants could not have challenged in the district\ncourt on the basis of Blakely because that decision had not been\nissued at the time of imposition of the sentences.\n       13\n      We reject any suggestion that Defendants’ initial challenges\nat sentencing were sufficient to preserve the issue of the\nconstitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines for plenary review.\nAlthough we treat “almost any colorable claim” as preserving Booker\nerror, see United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.\n2005), here it is clear that the objections at sentencing in the\ncourt below were directed solely to the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting the district court’s findings in determining the Total\nAdjusted Offense Level.\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\ftest Defendants must show a “reasonable probability” that the\n\ndistrict court would impose a more favorable sentence to the\n\nDefendants under the now “advisory” Guidelines.             Id. at 75.    “[W]e\n\nare inclined not to be overly demanding as to proof of probability\n\nwhere, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there\n\nis reasonable indication that the district judge might well have\n\nreached a different result under advisory guidelines.”                 Heldeman,\n\n402 F.3d at 224; accord United States v. Vega Molina, No. 03-1625,\n\n2005 WL 1177221, at *19 (1st Cir. May 19, 2005).\n\n     Each Defendant has failed to present us with any argument of\n\nsubstance regarding the probability of a sentence reduction on\n\nremand    in    his   case.       Rather,   they   invite   us   to    disregard\n\nAntonakopoulos and accept a per se remand rule in every case where\n\na Booker error occurs.           They argue that we should presume that the\n\ndistrict court would have analyzed the case differently were it not\n\nfor the mandatory nature of the Guidelines.                 That position was\n\nsquarely rejected in Antonakopoulos.\n\n     We        decline     the     Defendants’     invitation     to     ignore\n\nAntonakopoulos.          Absent unusual circumstances not present here,\n\npanels of this court are bound by prior circuit decisions.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir. 2002).14\n\n\n     14\n      To the extent Defendants seek to distinguish their case from\nAntonakopoulos, the effort is unpersuasive. The district court in\nAntonakopoulos faced a set of sentencing issues nearly identical to\nthose presented here. See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 82 (noting\nthat the district court had made no less than three factual\n\n                                        -21-\n\fBecause Defendants have entirely failed to “advance any viable\n\ntheory as to how the Booker error” prejudiced their substantial\n\nrights,15 and because we find nothing in the record to “suggest a\n\n\nfindings resulting in sentence enhancements beyond that authorized\nby the jury verdict and also denied a request for a downward\ndeparture).\n     15\n      Pena’s only suggestion of a basis for remand is that “[i]n\nthe instant case, all enhancements could have been disputed in a\ndifferent light as they were not mandatory.” Supplemental Brief\nfor Appellant [Pena], at 15. This is far from a showing, to a\nreasonable probability, that on remand the district court would, in\nfact, impose a lesser sentence, especially in light of the fact\nthat Pena presented his arguments on the enhancements at the\noriginal sentencing and they were considered by the district court.\nEven though on remand the Guidelines would be “advisory,” no basis\nis shown by Pena to believe it to be reasonably probable that a\nsentence on remand would actually be more favorable to him.\n\n     Villafane likewise makes no showing of reasonable probability\nof a more favorable sentence on remand, arguing instead that\n“neither the defendant nor this court will be able to know whether\nthe District Court, knowing [that] the Guidelines now are not\nmandatory would apply the sentencing factors set forth ... [in 18\nU.S.C. §3553(a)] and determine the same or a lower more reasonable\nand appropriate sentence.”      Supplemental Brief for Appellant\n[Villafane] on “Booker” Errors, at 5.         However, absent any\ndemonstration of some reason to believe it probable that on remand\na lower sentence would actually result, this is nothing more than\nan argument for the per se remand rule on occurrence of a Booker\nerror, expressly rejected in Antonakopoulos. A suggestion of the\npossibility of a favorable sentence is not a showing of a\nreasonable probability of a more favorable sentence on remand as is\nnow required. Bailey, 405 F.3d at 114.\n\n     Rodriquez argues, in the face of the contrary holdings in\nAntonakopoulos and Bailey, that “a Sixth Amendment Booker error is\na structural error as one in which prejudice ought to be presumed.”\nSupplemental Brief Pursuant to Invitation by the Court (Rodriguez),\nat 6 (unnumbered). He suggests that on remand the district court\ncould consider more favorably the factors put forth at sentencing\nin respect to Defendant’s absence of any criminal record, an\nallegedly unblemished police service record, a good reputation in\nthe community, and his alleged acceptance of responsibility. Id.\n\n                               -22-\n\fbasis for such an inference,” we deny the requests to remand for\n\nBooker-error.   Gonzalez-Marcado, 402 F.3d at 303.\n\n     B.   Pena’s Claim of Sentencing Manipulation\n\n     Pena’s   contention   in   respect    to   a   claim   of    sentencing\n\nmanipulation must be addressed, however, as it is external to the\n\ndistrict court’s determination of his sentence.\n\n     Pena asserts that he is the victim of sentencing factor\n\nmanipulation because the Government devised and controlled the\n\nperformance of the sting operation that snared him.16            We have said\n\nthat sentencing factor manipulation occurs “when a ‘defendant,\n\nalthough predisposed to commit a          minor or lesser offense, is\n\n\n\nat 8 (unnumbered).     However, he made no showing that it is\nreasonably probable that the district court would, in fact, reduce\nthe sentence on remand in light of these factors, all of which were\nconsidered at the original sentencing.\n\n     It is far from necessarily true, ... that a judge who\n     found the facts underlying an enhanced sentence would\n     have reached a different result under a post-Booker\n     regime ....    The use of judicial factfinding, then,\n     ordinarily cannot alone meet the ‘reasonable probability’\n     standard of the third Olano prong.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 79-80.\n     16\n      The Government suggests in brief that Pena has waived this\nissue by not raising it in specific terms at the time of imposition\nof sentence. We find no waiver. Defendant raised the issue in\nobjections to the Pre-Sentence Report, and the district court\nnoticed the issue in its Order of February 6, 2003, ruling on the\nobjections and overruling all of them. Order (Docket Entry No.\n198). Pena, in allocution at the time of imposition of sentence,\nargued to the Court that the Government had engaged in misconduct\nin allegedly entrapping him into committing the offenses of\nconviction.\n\n                                 -23-\n\fentrapped in committing a greater offense subject to greater\n\npunishment.’”   United States v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (quoting United States v. Staufer, 38 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th\n\nCir. 1994)).    We have very recently limned the nature of conduct\n\nnecessary to establish sentencing factor manipulation.      We said:\n\n     Sentencing   factor   manipulation   occurs   where   law\n     enforcement agents venture outside the scope of\n     legitimate investigation and engage in extraordinary\n     misconduct that improperly enlarges the scope or scale of\n     the crime. A manipulation claim can be established by\n     showing that the agents overpowered the free will of the\n     defendant and caused him to commit a more serious offense\n     than he was predisposed to commit.\n\nUnited States v. Barbour, 393 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal\n\ncitations omitted).   We have also acknowledged that a sentencing\n\ncourt can depart from the Guidelines and statutory minimums based\n\non sentencing factor manipulation if the Defendant shows that the\n\nGovernment has engaged in extraordinary misconduct in bringing\n\nabout the commission of the offense.   United States v. Montoya, 62\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Gibbens, 25 F.3d 28, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n     We review for clear error the district court’s denial of\n\nPena’s objection on this point.   Gibbens, 25 F.3d at 30.    There is\n\nno merit to Pena’s claim.   The evidence shows that the Government\n\nafforded Pena an opportunity to commit the crimes of conviction,\n\nand that he, being predisposed to do so, readily entered into the\n\ncriminal acts proposed by the Government:   conspiracy, attempt to\n\ndistribute cocaine, and carrying a firearm in relation to a drug\n\n                               -24-\n\ftrafficking offense.   The Government did not expose Pena to any\n\nlesser offense involving a lesser punishment than that applicable\n\nto the offenses of his conviction and then later attempt to entice\n\nhim into more seriously punishable conduct.   The Government’s sole\n\neffort is shown by the evidence to have been to provide an\n\nopportunity to Pena to commit the very offenses of which he stands\n\nconvicted.   Accord Vazquez Guadalupe, 2005 WL 1163678, at *7.\n\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that the Government attempted to\n\nescalate the seriousness of the conduct involved in the offense as\n\noriginally proposed.   The Government offered an occasion for a\n\nsingle transaction: a drug transport/escort while armed.       Pena\n\ncommitted the crime he was predisposed to commit.     The criminal\n\nconduct was not exacerbated beyond the elements of the baseline\n\noffenses in the course of the execution of the offenses by Ortiz\n\nnor was the conduct otherwise prolonged.17    There was no pressure\n\nput on Pena, despite his assertions to the contrary at sentencing,\n\n\n     17\n      The evidence does not support any argument that the Count III\nfirearm offense came about because of any sentence manipulation by\nthe Government. The opportunity provided by the Government was for\nPena to participate as a police officer in the conduct. As noted\nin text, he was not required to carry his sidearm though it was\nassumed by Pelaez and Ortiz that he would do so. He understood and\nwillingly shared in and indulged the assumption. He was asked to\npatrol the scene of the transport/escort with a rifle and again\nwillingly did so without any need to persuade him to do so. This\nwas all carried out within the usual role of a police officer\nacting in his official capacity. As such, the conduct was within\nthe context of the three offenses he was given the opportunity to\ncommit. There was no effort to worsen the sentencing consequences\nof the three offenses.      He committed only the crimes he was\npredisposed to commit.\n\n                               -25-\n\fto engage in the conduct of which he stands convicted.      Further,\n\nthere is absolutely no evidence in the record of illegitimate\n\nmotive on the part of Ortiz as an undercover agent or of misconduct\n\nin his relations as a Government agent with Pena.      The district\n\ncourt’s denial of the objection was properly grounded in the\n\nrecord.\n\n     C.    The Conditions of Supervised Release\n\n     Two other points involve the question of whether the Court\n\nerred in imposing on each of these Defendants two special terms of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n     (1) The Search Condition\n\n     In supplemental briefing on appeal, Villafane has challenged\n\n(for the first time) the district court’s imposition of a search\n\ncondition as part of his supervised release requirements.    We need\n\nnot address whether the condition satisfies the requirements of\n\nUnited States v. Giannetta, 909 F.2d 571 (1st Cir. 1990).        The\n\nissue is forfeit, and does not amount to a miscarriage of justice\n\nmeriting our discretionary review.     See Olano, 507 U.S. at 736.\n\n     (2)   The Drug Treatment Condition\n\n     Pena asserts on appeal for the first time that the district\n\ncourt erred when it delegated to the Supervisory Probation Officer\n\nby the terms of a condition of supervised release the decision to\n\norder him to attend a drug treatment program if he failed a drug\n\n\n\n\n                                -26-\n\ftest. Villafane belatedly joined in the assertion of this claim in\n\nhis “Supplemental Brief” of August 18, 2004.\n\n     Our review of both claims would be for “plain error.”            Here,\n\nhowever,    the   Government   concedes   that   the   imposition   of   the\n\ncondition   constitutes   error   under   United   States   v.    Melendez-\n\nSantana, 353 F.3d 93, 101-02 (1st Cir. 2003), and agrees that “the\n\nchallenged drug treatment condition should be vacated and remanded\n\nfor re-sentencing.”      Government’s Br. at 48.       We accept, in the\n\nabsence of any objection, the Government’s concession.18                 The\n\ndistrict court will reconsider the structure of this condition if\n\nit is imposed in any new sentence of any Defendant.              See United\n\nStates v. Ayala-Pizarro, No. 04-1038, 2005 WL 1119755, at *4 (1st\n\nCir. May 12, 2005) (“A remand to correct a delegation error as to\n\nconditions of supervised release does not open up any other aspect\n\nof a sentence for resentencing.”).\n\n     V.     ORDER\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, the conviction of each of the\n\nDefendants herein is AFFIRMED, and the sentence of each Defendant\n\n\n\n     18\n      We note that the same drug treatment condition was also\nimposed on Defendant Rodriguez. Because the government concedes\nthe district court’s error, and in accordance with the principles\nof Vazquez Guadalupe, we remand the sentences of all three\ndefendants to the district court to address this issue. Vazquez\nGuadalupe, 2005 WL 1163678, at *3 (“In light of the government’s\nconcession in the companion case, we will also remand the\nsupervised release portion of Pacheco-Diaz’s sentence for the\nlimited purpose of determining whether he was similarly sentenced\nin error and, if so, for correction of that error.”).\n\n                                  -27-\n\fis AFFIRMED, except for that portion of each Defendant’s sentence\n\npertaining to the drug treatment condition as a term of supervised\n\nrelease.   The sentence of each of these Defendants is VACATED and\n\nREMANDED for resentencing consistent with this opinion only as to\n\nimposition and structure of the drug treatment condition.\n\n\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f",

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appellants (hereinafter \"Defendants\") were convicted after jury trial in the District of Puerto Rico of the offenses of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, attempting to distribute cocaine, both in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1), and of carrying firearms during and in relation to the commission of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A). Defendants Villafane-Jimenez (hereinafter \"Villafane\") and Rodriguez-Nichols (hereinafter \"Rodriguez\") were each sentenced to prison terms totaling 295 months. Defendant Pena-Martinez (hereinafter \"Pena\") was sentenced to a prison term of 352 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> All three Defendants were made subject to supervised release terms of five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendants appeal their respective convictions and challenge various aspects of their respective sentence determinations and the imposition of certain specific conditions of supervised release. This Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a). The Court will consider the issues the Defendants generate on appeal, affirm their convictions and affirm their sentences in part, remanding for resentencing of each Defendant only with respect to the drug treatment condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no significant dispute as to the specific acts and conduct of each of the Defendants that are the basis for their indictments and convictions. The Defendants admitted to these at trial. The only dispute goes to the intent with which the Defendants engaged in that conduct. The conduct itself is displayed in the record as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Special Agent Jeffrey Pelaez was employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (hereinafter \"FBI\") Public Corruption Unit in Washington, D.C. He was assigned to the FBI resident agency in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to investigate allegations of police corruption within the Puerto Rico Police Department (hereinafter \"PRPD\"). He was in charge of an operation known as \"Honor Perdido.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The operation lasted from June 2000 to June 2001. In the course of the operation, Pelaez recruited ex-police officer Arturo Ortiz-Colon (hereinafter \"Ortiz\") as an informant and undercover operative. Ortiz had lost his position in the Puerto Rican police because of prior criminal activity. He had also witnessed criminal activity of officers within the PRPD. Pelaez launched Ortiz as his operative in a drug \"sting\" operation aimed at corrupt police officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrangements were made for Ortiz to pose as an actual FBI agent. He was given credentials, agency business cards, a marked vehicle, and a gun, all to create the impression that he was an FBI agent. The FBI rented two apartments at an expensive resort. Ortiz lived in one of those apartments, which was wired for audio and video surveillance, and the FBI used the other apartment to monitor what was happening in Ortiz's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence would support a jury finding that Ortiz was to pretend to be a corrupt FBI agent involved in a drug trafficking organization in which \"the boss\" was a fictional Columbian male named \"El Viejo.\" Ortiz was to appear to be looking, on behalf of the fictional El Viejo, for law enforcement officers to transport El Viejo's drug shipments, and to protect the shipments from rival drug gangs and intervening police officers. He was to approach individuals who he personally knew, or had reason to believe, were corrupt,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and solicit them to carry out an illegal drug transport and be paid to do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government's evidence supports a finding that Ortiz did, in fact, pose to the Defendants as a corrupt FBI officer engaged in illicit drug trafficking. The jury could reasonably have found that he approached Pena representing that he needed policemen willing to assist him in a major illegal shipment of contraband cocaine by unloading the drugs, transporting the drugs to their destination, unloading them from the vehicles, and providing throughout security to the operation as armed, uniformed police officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Agent Pelaez described at trial a meeting between Ortiz and the Defendants on May 9, 2001, which he monitored by television surveillance. Ortiz there discussed with the Defendants the \"specifics\" of how the transportation of cocaine would occur. He told the Defendants that the cocaine was owned by \"El Viejo,\" who would be the person paying them for their services. Agent Pelaez's testimony also described the Defendants' videotaped activities in unloading the drugs from a boat at a marina and putting them in a Jeep Cherokee on May 11, 2001. All of the Defendants handled and transported the drugs and Rodriguez patrolled the area with \"a fully automatic machine gun\" to protect against any interference with the conduct of the operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pena and Rodriguez left the marina area where the drugs were obtained in Ortiz's vehicle with the drugs and a rifle and their sidearms. Villafane, also armed, followed them in a marked police cruiser \"to provide security.\" They took the drugs to Ortiz's apartment. Their activities there were videotaped.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> At a subsequent meeting on May 14, the Defendants were each paid $5000 in cash and they discussed the operation and how it could be better done the next time. Thus, the thrust of the Government's evidence was that the three Defendants understood that they were being recruited by a corrupt FBI agent to participate in an illicit, major drug trafficking project for which they would receive at least $4000 and that they willingly participated therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenge the validity of the drug convictions on Counts I and II and their convictions on Count III, claiming that they thought all along that Ortiz was a legitimate FBI officer seeking their assistance in legitimate law enforcement activities aimed at curtailing an illegal drug transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendants also attack their convictions on Count III on the separate basis that they carried their weapons because they were required by law to do so when in uniform and that the presence of the firearms at the scene of their drug trafficking activities was merely coincidental to the drug trafficking activities and not \"in relation to\" the drug trafficking activities, as the statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A), requires.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE CHALLENGES TO THE CONVICTIONS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Estoppel by Entrapment Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants seek reversal of their convictions because, they allege, their prosecution violates fairness elements of Due Process of Law under the Federal Constitution. They claim this to be so because they offered evidence, disputed by the Government's evidence at trial, that they reasonably relied on representations, which they allege were made by Ortiz, that the conduct upon which their convictions are based was part of a legitimate law enforcement project Ortiz was carrying out in his capacity as an FBI agent. This, they argue, implicitly represented to them that their conduct was legal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Hence, they assert, the convictions should be vacated because the Government is estopped from prosecuting them by reason of their entrapment into the illegal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to this contention is that the Defendants have the burden of proof to establish at trial their defense of estoppel by entrapment and they failed to do so. They had a full opportunity to adduce any evidence they wished in support of that defense, their counsel argued the defense to the jury, and the district court gave instructions to the jury concerning the defense (as to which there were no objections), and the defense was ultimately submitted to the jury on a disputed record. The result at trial was that the jury found for the Government. We conclude after a careful review of the trial record that the evidence is sufficient to support that result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In briefing on this appeal, the Defendants simply reargue the factual aspects of the defense in juxtaposition to the Government's evidence that they, in fact, committed each of the charged offenses. On a general theory, Defendants assert that all of the evidence is insufficient to prove that they possessed specific criminal intent to commit the offense. There is no claim made here that evidence material to the defense was limited or excluded at trial. It is not contended that the issues generated by the defense were not submitted to the jury or that those issues were taken away from jury consideration on the evidentiary record. Moreover, it is not contended that there was any defect in the jury instructions given by the Court in respect to the defense. The thrust of the arguments as they are made can only be viewed as the assertion of a claim that the Defendants established at trial the defense of estoppel by entrapment <i>as a matter of law.</i> Review of such a claim is plenary because \"the issue is whether or not there was sufficient evidence to support a theory of defense. . . .\" <i>Caron,</i> 64 F.3d at 715.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish the subject defense at trial, the Defendants were required to establish that (1) a governmental official told them their conduct was legal; (2) they relied on that representation; (3) their reliance was reasonable in the circumstances; and (4) given that reliance, prosecution for the conduct is unfair. <i>Ellis,</i> 168 F.3d at 561; <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 940 F.2d 710, 715 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our careful review of this record convinces us that there is no basis to conclude that the Defendants' proof warranted the acceptance of the defense as a matter of law. Clearly, the evidence made, at best, issues of fact for a fact-finder to resolve as to the viability of the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a reasonable fact-finder should be persuaded of the validity of the defense depends entirely, in the circumstances of this record, upon the resolution of any number of disputed issues of fact and the determination of the credibility, in whole or in part, of nearly every witness who testified at trial. These are typical jury functions for the resolution of disputed questions of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lynchpin for the resolution of the issue of the Defendants' intent is the determination of fact as to what Ortiz told them (and what they understood) about the legal status of the operation: either that it was an exercise in legitimate law enforcement (as the Defendants contend) or that it was to be assistance to a corrupt FBI agent in illegally transporting, escorting, and safeguarding a shipment of contraband drugs for a garden-variety civilian drug trafficker (as the Government contends). A choice among these two alternatives resolves the issue of whether there is sufficient evidence to establish the Defendants' guilty intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All Defendants asserted in ambiguous language that they were led to believe that the project was a covert or undercover police operation. Ortiz and Pelaez testified that the Defendants were told it was an illegal activity from the beginning. There is abundant evidence in the record to support the Defendants' convictions. It could be concluded that the Defendants were told the operation was an illegal one and that the description and circumstances of the project would have left them, as experienced police officers, no room to reasonably believe that it was a legitimate law enforcement effort. Further, the evidence supports a finding that they knew, because told by Ortiz, that there would be no arrest as a result of the seizure and transport of the contraband, a strange circumstance for a <i>legal</i> police operation. They were told that they were to be paid a sum of money (not less than $4000) for their participation in the project that was far in excess of the usual rate of compensation of line police officers for an a couple of hours of official work. They were told the ultimate amount of their compensation would depend upon the amount of drugs transported by them. They were told that the money for their compensation would come from the supposed owner of the drugs, not from FBI funds. They were ultimately paid and accepted $5000 each for their efforts and the payments were made <i>in cash</i> at Ortiz's apartment. The circumstances of their compensation and the determination of the amount of it were, alone, forceful, persuasive proof from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the Defendants knew they were not participating in a legitimate police operation and were a confirmation of Defendants' culpable knowledge and intent from the very beginning of their involvement in the operation. That confirmation is entirely consistent with all of the other evidence indicating the guilt of the Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the defense was properly submitted to the jury on unchallenged instructions, that no error occurred in that respect, that the record amply supports the jury's verdict and that the Rule 29 Motion was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Weapons Charge-Count III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume the Defendants press the estoppel by entrapment argument to attack the existence of specific intent on Count III, but we find that position is without merit in the record. First, the argument that Rodriguez never drew his sidearm overlooks entirely that evidence in the record (that was undisputed) that he was asked to carry a police-owned automatic rifle during the transport and escort activities to discourage intervention by others, and that he did, in fact, do so. This evidence, by itself, is enough to permit a jury to conclude that Rodriguez had the general knowledge and intent to carry a firearm during and in relation to his activity in the transport/escort as charged in Count III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government did not need to prove that Defendants specifically intended to use or did use a firearm in the course of the transport activity in order for a jury to convict them of the Count III offense. The Government needed only to prove individually their general intent, <i>e.g.,</i> that they each knew that they carried a firearm during the course of the drug offense conduct, in order to lay a predicate in the evidence that was adequate for their convictions on Count III. <i>See United States v. Brown,</i> 915 F.2d 219, 225 (6th Cir.1990). We find that the evidence clearly supports the existence of that level of knowledge by all three Defendants, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also advanced below the argument on the Rule 29 Motion, and reiterate it here, that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the \"nexus\" requirement of the violation charged in Count III. This element of the possession offense is treated at length in <i>United States v. Grace,</i> 367 F.3d 29 (1st Cir.2004). There we said that the current version of the statute does not require the Government to show that the Defendant \"actively employed\" the firearm \"in furtherance of\" the drug crime. <i>Id.</i> at 35. We held, however, that it must be shown in order to secure a conviction that the Defendant has \"possessed the gun to <i>further the drug crime.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). In <i>Grace,</i> the underlying offenses were possession and distribution of drugs. The Court there found that the possession of the gun was in furtherance of the possession and distribution of the drugs. We said that the \"government must illustrate through specific facts, which tie the defendant to the firearm, that the firearm was possessed to advance or promote the criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Lawrence,</i> 308 F.3d 623, 630 (6th Cir. 2002)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence material to Count III of this Indictment can properly be evaluated on the basis that the jury approached its consideration of this Count having concluded that the Defendants were guilty on Counts I and II. Once it is established that the Defendants had the specific intent to engage in a conspiracy to distribute drugs illegally and to participate actively in the attempt to distribute them, the question becomes whether the evidence established a \"nexus\" between that criminal conduct on Counts I and II and possession by the Defendants of the firearms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted previously, in the case of Rodriguez, the existence of such a nexus is transparently clear because he patrolled the drug transfer site at Ortiz's instructions with an automatic rifle from the Defendants' police cruiser. It was easily to be deduced by the jury in the circumstances that the obvious intent of that conduct was to discourage \"intervenors\" from interfering in the transfer and escort of the drugs. That conduct was clearly \"in furtherance of\" the transport and escort of the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation is little different in the cases of Villafane and Pena even though they assert (and the record does not contradict) that they never drew or used their sidearms in the course of the transport/escort activity. As noted above, the brandishing or use of firearms is not a necessary element of the Count III offense. <i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 35. The evidence supports the conclusion that the sole and mutually understood purpose of Defendants' participation in the activity as law officers was to prevent, by their presence, other drug dealers or other legitimately motivated police officers from interfering in and disrupting the transport of the drugs. It is obvious that the presence of the guns, displayed in the open, by the Defendants as active participants in the illegal activity, would have a tendency to discourage interruption of the transport by other persons and was intended by the Defendants to do so. Further, it could be fairly inferred by the jury that potential intervenors would likely also bear arms and that the presence of the Defendants' firearms in open view would disabuse any potential intervenor of any thought that he would enjoy a superiority of force in intervening in the situation. The possession of the firearms did, as intended by the Defendants, \"further\" the illegal drug trafficking activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are satisfied, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, that this record clearly justifies a rational jury in concluding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all of the Defendants possessed their firearms at the time of the transport/escort activity in order to further the successful execution of the illegal drug trafficking activity in question. The possession was \"in relation to\" that activity. <i>Id.</i> The verdict on Count III is supported in the record as to all three Defendants, and the Rule 29 Motion was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>IV. THE CHALLENGES TO THE ELEMENTS OF SENTENCE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants raise on appeal three distinct issues of substance in respect to their sentences: (1) that <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) require a remand for resentencing in light of the non-mandatory status of the United States Sentencing Guidelines; (2) that the district court committed errors in imposing on Defendant Villafane a condition of supervised release requiring that he submit to searches by his supervising officer while on his term of supervised release; and (3) that the district court erred in the structure of the condition of supervised release imposed on Defendants Pena and Villafane in respect to the frequency of their submission to drug testing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The <i>Blakely/Booker</i> Challenges<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record makes it clear that in determining all of these sentences the district court followed the analytical regime in place before rendition of the decision in <i>Booker.</i> It is to be presumed and it is, in fact, clear from the record that the District Judge considered herself <i>required</i> to determine and impose sentences as established by the Sentencing Guidelines. It is equally clear that in working out the necessary guideline determinations, she made several findings of fact critical to the determination of the extent of the final sentences which were not within the scope of jury findings in determining the guilt of the Defendants and which were not admitted by the Defendants. It is also clear that she made those findings upon application of the preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is now no room for doubt that sentences based upon a predicate of mandated compliance with the requirements of the Sentencing Guidelines do not now pass constitutional muster. The sentences imposed on these Defendants do not comply with the holding of <i>Booker</i> in that respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendants did not, however, object to their sentences on Sixth Amendment grounds in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Because Defendants made no arguments in the district court concerning the constitutionality of the Guidelines or the application of the Guidelines to their sentences under <i>Apprendi,</i> we review only for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the four-part plain error test outlined in <i>Olano,</i> we grant relief only if we find (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and that not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77 (quoting <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770). The Defendants bear the burden of persuasion with respect to all four elements of the test. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d 294, 302 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two prongs are satisfied here because the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory at sentencing. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77. To meet the third prong of the test Defendants must show a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence to the Defendants under the now \"advisory\" Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 75. \"[W]e are inclined not to be overly demanding as to proof of probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 224; <i>accord United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 533 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each Defendant has failed to present us with any argument of substance regarding the probability of a sentence reduction on remand in his case. Rather, they invite us to disregard <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and accept a <i>per se</i> remand rule in every case where a <i>Booker</i> error occurs. They argue that we should presume that the district court would have analyzed the case differently were it not for the mandatory nature of the Guidelines.

Pena's Claim of Sentencing Manipulation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pena's contention in respect to a claim of sentencing manipulation must be addressed, however, as it is external to the district court's determination of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pena asserts that he is the victim of sentencing factor manipulation because the Government devised and controlled the performance of the sting operation that snared him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> We have said that sentencing factor manipulation occurs \"when a `defendant, although predisposed to commit a minor or lesser offense, is entrapped in committing a greater offense subject to greater punishment.'\" <i>United States v. Woods,</i> 210 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>United States v. Staufer,</i> 38 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir.1994)). We have very recently limned the nature of conduct necessary to establish sentencing factor manipulation. We said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sentencing factor manipulation occurs where law enforcement agents venture outside the scope of legitimate investigation and engage in extraordinary misconduct that improperly enlarges the scope or scale of the crime. A manipulation claim can be established by showing that the agents overpowered the free will of the defendant and caused him to commit a more serious offense than he was predisposed to commit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Barbour,</i> 393 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.2004) (internal citations omitted). We have also acknowledged that a sentencing court can depart from the Guidelines and statutory minimums based on sentencing factor manipulation if the Defendant shows that the Government has engaged in extraordinary misconduct in bringing about the commission of the offense. <i>United States v. Montoya,</i> 62 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for clear error the district court's denial of Pena's objection on this point. <i>Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d at 30. There is no merit to Pena's claim. The evidence shows that the Government afforded Pena an opportunity to commit the crimes of conviction, and that he, being predisposed to do so, readily entered into the criminal acts proposed by the Government: conspiracy, attempt to distribute cocaine, and carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense. The Government did not expose Pena to any lesser offense involving a lesser punishment than that applicable to the offenses of his conviction and then later attempt to entice him into more seriously punishable conduct. The Government's sole effort is shown by the evidence to have been to provide an opportunity to Pena to commit the very offenses of which he stands convicted. <i>Accord Vazquez-Guadalupe,</i> 407 F.3d 492, 499. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Government attempted to escalate the seriousness of the conduct involved in the offense as originally proposed. The Government offered an occasion for a single transaction: a drug transport/escort while armed. Pena committed the crime he was predisposed to commit. The criminal conduct was not exacerbated beyond the elements of the baseline offenses in the course of the execution of the offenses by Ortiz nor was the conduct otherwise prolonged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> There was no pressure put on Pena, despite his assertions to the contrary at sentencing, to engage in the conduct of which he stands convicted. Further, there is absolutely no evidence in the record of illegitimate motive on the part of Ortiz as an undercover agent or of misconduct in his relations as a Government agent with Pena. The district court's denial of the objection was properly grounded in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Conditions of Supervised Release</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other points involve the question of whether the Court erred in imposing on each of these Defendants two special terms of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The Search Condition</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In supplemental briefing on appeal, Villafane has challenged (for the first time) the district court's imposition of a search condition as part of his supervised release requirements. We need not address whether the condition satisfies the requirements of <i>United States v. Giannetta,</i> 909 F.2d 571 (1st Cir.1990). The issue is forfeit, and does not amount to a miscarriage of justice meriting our discretionary review. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The Drug Treatment Condition</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pena asserts on appeal for the first time that the district court erred when it delegated to the Supervisory Probation Officer by the terms of a condition of supervised release the decision to order him to attend a drug treatment program if he failed a drug test. Villafane belatedly joined in the assertion of this claim in his \"Supplemental Brief\" of August 18, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of both claims would be for \"plain error.\" Here, however, the Government concedes that the imposition of the condition constitutes error under <i>United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93, 101-02 (1st Cir.2003), and agrees that \"the challenged drug treatment condition should be vacated and remanded for resentencing.\" Government's Br. at 48. We accept, in the absence of any objection, the Government's concession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> The district court will reconsider the structure of this condition if it is imposed in any new sentence of any Defendant. <i>See United States v.

United States v. Rivera-Ruiz,</i> 244 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir.1998). The standard is the same in conducting a review of the record on appeal to examine the viability of a free-standing challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <i>United States v. Caron,</i> 64 F.3d 713, 715 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We treat the position of all three Defendants in seeking reversal <i>of the convictions</i> on all three Counts as raising the same two substantive issues for resolution: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt each Defendant's specific intent to commit each of the three crimes by reason of an estoppel by entrapment and (2) whether the evidence as to Count III was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each Defendant's carrying of a firearm was \"in relation to\" the commission of the drug trafficking offenses.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> It is to be noted that the record does not disclose that the Defendants have ever made any specific claim that Ortiz told them in so many words, that is, made an \"affirmative representation,\" that their conduct was, or would be \"legal.\" Such an affirmative representation has been held to be required as an element of the estoppel by entrapment defense, to be proven by the Defendant<i>United States v.

This evidence is clearly sufficient to meet the requirement of specific facts which tie the Defendants to the firearms<i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 35; <i>United States v. Vazquez Guadalupe,</i> No. 02-2505, 407 F.3d 492, 493 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Defendants Pena and Rodriguez also raise issues concerning the district court's application of Guidelines &#167; 3C1.1 (obstruction of justice), &#167; 3B1.3 (abuse of position of public authority), and &#167; 3E1.1 (acceptance of responsibility). We have carefully reviewed these claims, which were forfeited below,<i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 n. 7 (1st Cir.2005), for the existence of plain error. <i>United States v.

These claims do not warrant any detailed discussion. It suffices to say that the record contains abundant evidence to support the conclusions that Pena obstructed justice by his testimony at trial, both Pena and Rodriguez abused a position of public trust and authority by participating in a drug trafficking transaction as uniformed police officers, and that neither was entitled to receive a reduction in the offense level because they had truly accepted responsibility for their acts.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> This analysis tracks closely that set out in the case of<i>United States v.

Such an assertion of error was first made under<i>Blakely</i> by Defendant Rodriquez in his second amended brief filed on July 20, 2004, while this case was pending for argument on this appeal. Defendant Villafane made his first assertion of a <i>Blakely</i> error in his Supplemental Brief of Appellant filed on August 18, 2004. Pena did not challenge the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines or assert the existence of error under <i>Apprendi</i> in either the district court or in the first round of briefing on this appeal.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on January 12, 2005, while this case was under advisement, the Supreme Court decided <i>Booker,</i> confirming the application of the holdings in <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely</i> to sentences imposed under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. This Court then entered on March 8, 2005, its standard order in such cases inviting the briefing of any claims made under <i>Booker</i> and its antecedent authorities. All three Defendants thereafter filed supplemental briefs asserting the existence of <i>Booker</i> error and the government has responded to those assertions by its own supplemental brief.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The Defendants could not have challenged in the district court on the basis of<i>Blakely</i> because that decision had not been issued at the time of imposition of the sentences.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> We reject any suggestion that Defendants' initial challenges at sentencing were sufficient to preserve the issue of the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines for plenary review. Although we treat \"almost any colorable claim\" as preserving<i>Booker</i> error, <i>see United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005), here it is clear that the objections at sentencing in the court below were directed solely to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court's findings in determining the Total Adjusted Offense Level.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> To the extent Defendants seek to distinguish their case from<i>Antonakopoulos,</i> the effort is unpersuasive. The district court in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> faced a set of sentencing issues nearly identical to those presented here. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 82 (noting that the district court had made no less than three factual findings resulting in sentence enhancements beyond that authorized by the jury verdict and also denied a request for a downward departure).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Pena's only suggestion of a basis for remand is that \"[i]n the instant case, all enhancements could have been disputed in a different light as they were not mandatory.\" Supplemental Brief for Appellant [Pena], at 15. This is far from a showing, to a reasonable probability, that on remand the district court would, in fact, impose a lesser sentence, especially in light of the fact that Pena presented his arguments on the enhancements at the original sentencing and they were considered by the district court. Even though on remand the Guidelines would be \"advisory,\" no basis is shown by Pena to believe it to be reasonably probable that a sentence on remand would<i>actually</i> be more favorable to him.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Villafane likewise makes no showing of reasonable probability of a more favorable sentence on remand, arguing instead that \"neither the defendant nor this court will be able to know whether the District Court, knowing [that] the Guidelines now are not mandatory would apply the sentencing factors set forth ... [in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)] and determine the same or a lower more reasonable and appropriate sentence.\" Supplemental Brief for Appellant [Villafane] on \"Booker\" Errors, at 5. However, absent any demonstration of some reason to believe it probable that on remand a lower sentence would <i>actually</i> result, this is nothing more than an argument for the <i>per se</i> remand rule on occurrence of a <i>Booker</i> error, expressly rejected in <i>Antonakopoulos.</i> A suggestion of <i>the possibility</i> of a favorable sentence is not a showing of <i>a reasonable probability</i> of a more favorable sentence on remand as is now required. <i>Bailey,</i> 405 F.3d at 114.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Rodriquez argues, in the face of the contrary holdings in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and <i>Bailey,</i> that \"a Sixth Amendment <i>Booker</i> error is a structural error as one in which prejudice ought to be presumed.\" Supplemental Brief Pursuant to Invitation by the Court (Rodriguez), at 6 (unnumbered). He suggests that on remand the district court <i>could</i> consider more favorably the factors put forth at sentencing in respect to Defendant's absence of any criminal record, an allegedly unblemished police service record, a good reputation in the community, and his alleged acceptance of responsibility. <i>Id.</i> at 8 (unnumbered). However, he made no showing that it is <i>reasonably probable</i> that the district court would, <i>in fact,</i> reduce the sentence on remand in light of these factors, all of which were considered at the original sentencing.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It is far from necessarily true, . . . that a judge who found the facts underlying an enhanced sentence would have reached a different result under a post-<i>Booker</i> regime.... The use of judicial factfinding, then, ordinarily cannot alone meet the `reasonable probability' standard of the third <i>Olano</i> prong.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 79-80.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The Government suggests in brief that Pena has waived this issue by not raising it in specific terms at the time of imposition of sentence.

He was asked to patrol the scene of the transport/escort with a rifle and again willingly did so without any need to persuade him to do so. This was all carried out within the usual role of a police officer acting in his official capacity. As such, the conduct was within the context of the three offenses he was given the opportunity to commit. There was no effort to worsen the sentencing consequences of the three offenses. He committed only the crimes he was predisposed to commit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> We note that the same drug treatment condition was also imposed on Defendant Rodriguez.

He was in charge of an operation known as \"Honor Perdido.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The operation lasted from June 2000 to June 2001. In the course of the operation, Pelaez recruited ex-police officer Arturo Ortiz-Colon (hereinafter \"Ortiz\") as an informant and undercover operative. Ortiz had lost his position in the Puerto Rican police because of prior criminal activity. He had also witnessed criminal activity of officers within the PRPD. Pelaez launched Ortiz as his operative in a drug \"sting\" operation aimed at corrupt police officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrangements were made for Ortiz to pose as an actual FBI agent. He was given credentials, agency business cards, a marked vehicle, and a gun, all to create the impression that he was an FBI agent. The FBI rented two apartments at an expensive resort. Ortiz lived in one of those apartments, which was wired for audio and video surveillance, and the FBI used the other apartment to monitor what was happening in Ortiz's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence would support a jury finding that Ortiz was to pretend to be a corrupt FBI agent involved in a drug trafficking organization in which \"the boss\" was a fictional Columbian male named \"El Viejo.\" Ortiz was to appear to be looking, on behalf of the fictional El Viejo, for law enforcement officers to transport El Viejo's drug shipments, and to protect the shipments from rival drug gangs and intervening police officers. He was to approach individuals who he personally knew, or had reason to believe, were corrupt,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and solicit them to carry out an illegal drug transport and be paid to do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government's evidence supports a finding that Ortiz did, in fact, pose to the Defendants as a corrupt FBI officer engaged in illicit drug trafficking. The jury could reasonably have found that he approached Pena representing that he needed policemen willing to assist him in a major illegal shipment of contraband cocaine by unloading the drugs, transporting the drugs to their destination, unloading them from the vehicles, and providing throughout security to the operation as armed, uniformed police officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Agent Pelaez described at trial a meeting between Ortiz and the Defendants on May 9, 2001, which he monitored by television surveillance. Ortiz there discussed with the Defendants the \"specifics\" of how the transportation of cocaine would occur. He told the Defendants that the cocaine was owned by \"El Viejo,\" who would be the person paying them for their services. Agent Pelaez's testimony also described the Defendants' videotaped activities in unloading the drugs from a boat at a marina and putting them in a Jeep Cherokee on May 11, 2001. All of the Defendants handled and transported the drugs and Rodriguez patrolled the area with \"a fully automatic machine gun\" to protect against any interference with the conduct of the operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pena and Rodriguez left the marina area where the drugs were obtained in Ortiz's vehicle with the drugs and a rifle and their sidearms. Villafane, also armed, followed them in a marked police cruiser \"to provide security.\" They took the drugs to Ortiz's apartment. Their activities there were videotaped.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> At a subsequent meeting on May 14, the Defendants were each paid $5000 in cash and they discussed the operation and how it could be better done the next time. Thus, the thrust of the Government's evidence was that the three Defendants understood that they were being recruited by a corrupt FBI agent to participate in an illicit, major drug trafficking project for which they would receive at least $4000 and that they willingly participated therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenge the validity of the drug convictions on Counts I and II and their convictions on Count III, claiming that they thought all along that Ortiz was a legitimate FBI officer seeking their assistance in legitimate law enforcement activities aimed at curtailing an illegal drug transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendants also attack their convictions on Count III on the separate basis that they carried their weapons because they were required by law to do so when in uniform and that the presence of the firearms at the scene of their drug trafficking activities was merely coincidental to the drug trafficking activities and not \"in relation to\" the drug trafficking activities, as the statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A), requires.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE CHALLENGES TO THE CONVICTIONS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Estoppel by Entrapment Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants seek reversal of their convictions because, they allege, their prosecution violates fairness elements of Due Process of Law under the Federal Constitution. They claim this to be so because they offered evidence, disputed by the Government's evidence at trial, that they reasonably relied on representations, which they allege were made by Ortiz, that the conduct upon which their convictions are based was part of a legitimate law enforcement project Ortiz was carrying out in his capacity as an FBI agent. This, they argue, implicitly represented to them that their conduct was legal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Hence, they assert, the convictions should be vacated because the Government is estopped from prosecuting them by reason of their entrapment into the illegal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to this contention is that the Defendants have the burden of proof to establish at trial their defense of estoppel by entrapment and they failed to do so. They had a full opportunity to adduce any evidence they wished in support of that defense, their counsel argued the defense to the jury, and the district court gave instructions to the jury concerning the defense (as to which there were no objections), and the defense was ultimately submitted to the jury on a disputed record. The result at trial was that the jury found for the Government. We conclude after a careful review of the trial record that the evidence is sufficient to support that result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In briefing on this appeal, the Defendants simply reargue the factual aspects of the defense in juxtaposition to the Government's evidence that they, in fact, committed each of the charged offenses. On a general theory, Defendants assert that all of the evidence is insufficient to prove that they possessed specific criminal intent to commit the offense. There is no claim made here that evidence material to the defense was limited or excluded at trial. It is not contended that the issues generated by the defense were not submitted to the jury or that those issues were taken away from jury consideration on the evidentiary record. Moreover, it is not contended that there was any defect in the jury instructions given by the Court in respect to the defense. The thrust of the arguments as they are made can only be viewed as the assertion of a claim that the Defendants established at trial the defense of estoppel by entrapment <i>as a matter of law.</i> Review of such a claim is plenary because \"the issue is whether or not there was sufficient evidence to support a theory of defense. . . .\" <i>Caron,</i> 64 F.3d at 715.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish the subject defense at trial, the Defendants were required to establish that (1) a governmental official told them their conduct was legal; (2) they relied on that representation; (3) their reliance was reasonable in the circumstances; and (4) given that reliance, prosecution for the conduct is unfair. <i>Ellis,</i> 168 F.3d at 561; <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565998\"><a href=\"/opinion/565998/united-states-v-edward-t-smith-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>, 715 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our careful review of this record convinces us that there is no basis to conclude that the Defendants' proof warranted the acceptance of the defense as a matter of law. Clearly, the evidence made, at best, issues of fact for a fact-finder to resolve as to the viability of the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a reasonable fact-finder should be persuaded of the validity of the defense depends entirely, in the circumstances of this record, upon the resolution of any number of disputed issues of fact and the determination of the credibility, in whole or in part, of nearly every witness who testified at trial. These are typical jury functions for the resolution of disputed questions of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lynchpin for the resolution of the issue of the Defendants' intent is the determination of fact as to what Ortiz told them (and what they understood) about the legal status of the operation: either that it was an exercise in legitimate law enforcement (as the Defendants contend) or that it was to be assistance to a corrupt FBI agent in illegally transporting, escorting, and safeguarding a shipment of contraband drugs for a garden-variety civilian drug trafficker (as the Government contends). A choice among these two alternatives resolves the issue of whether there is sufficient evidence to establish the Defendants' guilty intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All Defendants asserted in ambiguous language that they were led to believe that the project was a covert or undercover police operation. Ortiz and Pelaez testified that the Defendants were told it was an illegal activity from the beginning. There is abundant evidence in the record to support the Defendants' convictions. It could be concluded that the Defendants were told the operation was an illegal one and that the description and circumstances of the project would have left them, as experienced police officers, no room to reasonably believe that it was a legitimate law enforcement effort. Further, the evidence supports a finding that they knew, because told by Ortiz, that there would be no arrest as a result of the seizure and transport of the contraband, a strange circumstance for a <i>legal</i> police operation. They were told that they were to be paid a sum of money (not less than $4000) for their participation in the project that was far in excess of the usual rate of compensation of line police officers for an a couple of hours of official work. They were told the ultimate amount of their compensation would depend upon the amount of drugs transported by them. They were told that the money for their compensation would come from the supposed owner of the drugs, not from FBI funds. They were ultimately paid and accepted $5000 each for their efforts and the payments were made <i>in cash</i> at Ortiz's apartment. The circumstances of their compensation and the determination of the amount of it were, alone, forceful, persuasive proof from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the Defendants knew they were not participating in a legitimate police operation and were a confirmation of Defendants' culpable knowledge and intent from the very beginning of their involvement in the operation. That confirmation is entirely consistent with all of the other evidence indicating the guilt of the Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the defense was properly submitted to the jury on unchallenged instructions, that no error occurred in that respect, that the record amply supports the jury's verdict and that the Rule 29 Motion was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Weapons Charge-Count III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume the Defendants press the estoppel by entrapment argument to attack the existence of specific intent on Count III, but we find that position is without merit in the record. First, the argument that Rodriguez never drew his sidearm overlooks entirely that evidence in the record (that was undisputed) that he was asked to carry a police-owned automatic rifle during the transport and escort activities to discourage intervention by others, and that he did, in fact, do so. This evidence, by itself, is enough to permit a jury to conclude that Rodriguez had the general knowledge and intent to carry a firearm during and in relation to his activity in the transport/escort as charged in Count III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government did not need to prove that Defendants specifically intended to use or did use a firearm in the course of the transport activity in order for a jury to convict them of the Count III offense. The Government needed only to prove individually their general intent, <i>e.g.,</i> that they each knew that they carried a firearm during the course of the drug offense conduct, in order to lay a predicate in the evidence that was adequate for their convictions on Count III. <i>See United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548714\"><a href=\"/opinion/548714/united-states-v-larry-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 225 (6th Cir.1990). We find that the evidence clearly supports the existence of that level of knowledge by all three Defendants, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also advanced below the argument on the Rule 29 Motion, and reiterate it here, that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the \"nexus\" requirement of the violation charged in Count III. This element of the possession offense is treated at length in <i>United States v. Grace,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200995\"><a href=\"/opinion/200995/united-states-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004). There we said that the current version of the statute does not require the Government to show that the Defendant \"actively employed\" the firearm \"in furtherance of\" the drug crime. <i>Id.</i> at 35. We held, however, that it must be shown in order to secure a conviction that the Defendant has \"possessed the gun to <i>further the drug crime.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). In <i>Grace,</i> the underlying offenses were possession and distribution of drugs. The Court there found that the possession of the gun was in furtherance of the possession and distribution of the drugs. We said that the \"government must illustrate through specific facts, which tie the defendant to the firearm, that the firearm was possessed to advance or promote the criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Lawrence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779583\"><a href=\"/opinion/779583/united-states-v-allen-lawrence-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span>, 630 (6th Cir. 2002)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence material to Count III of this Indictment can properly be evaluated on the basis that the jury approached its consideration of this Count having concluded that the Defendants were guilty on Counts I and II. Once it is established that the Defendants had the specific intent to engage in a conspiracy to distribute drugs illegally and to participate actively in the attempt to distribute them, the question becomes whether the evidence established a \"nexus\" between that criminal conduct on Counts I and II and possession by the Defendants of the firearms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted previously, in the case of Rodriguez, the existence of such a nexus is transparently clear because he patrolled the drug transfer site at Ortiz's instructions with an automatic rifle from the Defendants' police cruiser. It was easily to be deduced by the jury in the circumstances that the obvious intent of that conduct was to discourage \"intervenors\" from interfering in the transfer and escort of the drugs. That conduct was clearly \"in furtherance of\" the transport and escort of the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation is little different in the cases of Villafane and Pena even though they assert (and the record does not contradict) that they never drew or used their sidearms in the course of the transport/escort activity. As noted above, the brandishing or use of firearms is not a necessary element of the Count III offense. <i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 35. The evidence supports the conclusion that the sole and mutually understood purpose of Defendants' participation in the activity as law officers was to prevent, by their presence, other drug dealers or other legitimately motivated police officers from interfering in and disrupting the transport of the drugs. It is obvious that the presence of the guns, displayed in the open, by the Defendants as active participants in the illegal activity, would have a tendency to discourage interruption of the transport by other persons and was intended by the Defendants to do so. Further, it could be fairly inferred by the jury that potential intervenors would likely also bear arms and that the presence of the Defendants' firearms in open view would disabuse any potential intervenor of any thought that he would enjoy a superiority of force in intervening in the situation. The possession of the firearms did, as intended by the Defendants, \"further\" the illegal drug trafficking activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are satisfied, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, that this record clearly justifies a rational jury in concluding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all of the Defendants possessed their firearms at the time of the transport/escort activity in order to further the successful execution of the illegal drug trafficking activity in question. The possession was \"in relation to\" that activity. <i>Id.</i> The verdict on Count III is supported in the record as to all three Defendants, and the Rule 29 Motion was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>IV.

It is equally clear that in working out the necessary guideline determinations, she made several findings of fact critical to the determination of the extent of the final sentences which were not within the scope of jury findings in determining the guilt of the Defendants and which were not admitted by the Defendants.

There is no merit to Pena's claim. The evidence shows that the Government afforded Pena an opportunity to commit the crimes of conviction, and that he, being predisposed to do so, readily entered into the criminal acts proposed by the Government: conspiracy, attempt to distribute cocaine, and carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense. The Government did not expose Pena to any lesser offense involving a lesser punishment than that applicable to the offenses of his conviction and then later attempt to entice him into more seriously punishable conduct. The Government's sole effort is shown by the evidence to have been to provide an opportunity to Pena to commit the very offenses of which he stands convicted. <i>Accord Vazquez-Guadalupe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201586\"><a href=\"/opinion/201586/united-states-v-vazquez-guadalupe/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 499. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Government attempted to escalate the seriousness of the conduct involved in the offense as originally proposed. The Government offered an occasion for a single transaction: a drug transport/escort while armed. Pena committed the crime he was predisposed to commit. The criminal conduct was not exacerbated beyond the elements of the baseline offenses in the course of the execution of the offenses by Ortiz nor was the conduct otherwise prolonged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> There was no pressure put on Pena, despite his assertions to the contrary at sentencing, to engage in the conduct of which he stands convicted. Further, there is absolutely no evidence in the record of illegitimate motive on the part of Ortiz as an undercover agent or of misconduct in his relations as a Government agent with Pena.

The district court in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> faced a set of sentencing issues nearly identical to those presented here. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 82 (noting that the district court had made no less than three factual findings resulting in sentence enhancements beyond that authorized by the jury verdict and also denied a request for a downward departure).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Pena's only suggestion of a basis for remand is that \"[i]n the instant case, all enhancements could have been disputed in a different light as they were not mandatory.\" Supplemental Brief for Appellant [Pena], at 15. This is far from a showing, to a reasonable probability, that on remand the district court would, in fact, impose a lesser sentence, especially in light of the fact that Pena presented his arguments on the enhancements at the original sentencing and they were considered by the district court. Even though on remand the Guidelines would be \"advisory,\" no basis is shown by Pena to believe it to be reasonably probable that a sentence on remand would<i>actually</i> be more favorable to him.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Villafane likewise makes no showing of reasonable probability of a more favorable sentence on remand, arguing instead that \"neither the defendant nor this court will be able to know whether the District Court, knowing [that] the Guidelines now are not mandatory would apply the sentencing factors set forth ... [in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)] and determine the same or a lower more reasonable and appropriate sentence.\" Supplemental Brief for Appellant [Villafane] on \"Booker\" Errors, at 5. However, absent any demonstration of some reason to believe it probable that on remand a lower sentence would <i>actually</i> result, this is nothing more than an argument for the <i>per se</i> remand rule on occurrence of a <i>Booker</i> error, expressly rejected in <i>Antonakopoulos.</i> A suggestion of <i>the possibility</i> of a favorable sentence is not a showing of <i>a reasonable probability</i> of a more favorable sentence on remand as is now required. <i>Bailey,</i> 405 F.3d at 114.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Rodriquez argues, in the face of the contrary holdings in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and <i>Bailey,</i> that \"a Sixth Amendment <i>Booker</i> error is a structural error as one in which prejudice ought to be presumed.\" Supplemental Brief Pursuant to Invitation by the Court (Rodriguez), at 6 (unnumbered). He suggests that on remand the district court <i>could</i> consider more favorably the factors put forth at sentencing in respect to Defendant's absence of any criminal record, an allegedly unblemished police service record, a good reputation in the community, and his alleged acceptance of responsibility. <i>Id.</i> at 8 (unnumbered). However, he made no showing that it is <i>reasonably probable</i> that the district court would, <i>in fact,</i> reduce the sentence on remand in light of these factors, all of which were considered at the original sentencing.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It is far from necessarily true, . . . that a judge who found the facts underlying an enhanced sentence would have reached a different result under a post-<i>Booker</i> regime....

He was asked to patrol the scene of the transport/escort with a rifle and again willingly did so without any need to persuade him to do so. This was all carried out within the usual role of a police officer acting in his official capacity. As such, the conduct was within the context of the three offenses he was given the opportunity to commit. There was no effort to worsen the sentencing consequences of the three offenses. He committed only the crimes he was predisposed to commit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> We note that the same drug treatment condition was also imposed on Defendant Rodriguez.
