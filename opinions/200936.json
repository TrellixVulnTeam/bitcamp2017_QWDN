MANNING-ROSS,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n              [Hon. Justo Arenas, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                    Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Juan F. Matos-de Juan, Assistant Federal Public Defender, with\nwhom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, and Joannie\nPlaza-Martínez, Assistant Federal Public Defender, were on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     CPT Corey Jack Marks, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, with\nwhom H.S. García, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           March 30, 2004\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.    Magistrate Judge Arenas found\n\ndefendant-appellant, Jerale I. Manning-Ross (\"Manning\"), guilty of\n\ndriving under the influence of alcohol on a federal military base\n\nand fined him $500.    Manning appealed his conviction and fine, in\n\nthe first instance, to this court.     We dismiss the appeal for lack\n\nof jurisdiction.\n\n           The parties now believe, as does this panel, that this\n\ncourt lacks   jurisdiction   over   this   appeal.   \"In   all   cases   of\n\nconviction by a United States magistrate an appeal of right shall\n\nlie from the judgment of the magistrate to a judge of the district\n\ncourt of the district in which the offense was committed.\"               18\n\nU.S.C. § 3402.      It is well established that \"[t]his language\n\nindicates that a defendant challenging a conviction or a sentence\n\nrendered by a Magistrate Judge must do so in the first instance in\n\nthe district court.\"   United States v. Jones, 117 F.3d 644, 645 (2d\n\nCir. 1997) (citing United States v. Baxter, 19 F.3d 155, 156-57\n\n(4th Cir. 1994); United States v. Smith, 992 F.2d 98, 99 (7th Cir.\n\n1993); United States v. Soolook, 987 F.2d 574, 575 (9th Cir. 1993);\n\nMidway Mfg. Co. v. Kruckenberg, 720 F.2d 653, 654 (11th Cir.\n\n1983)).   To appeal the Magistrate Judge's decision, Manning should\n\nhave appealed to the district court.       This court has jurisdiction\n\nto entertain an appeal only after the district court renders a\n\nfinal judgment.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f          Courts confronting similar situations have noted that\n\nalthough the notice of appeal \"identified this court rather than\n\nthe district court as the reviewing body, that error does not\n\ndeprive the lower court of jurisdiction\" to review the conviction\n\nand the fine if notice of the appeal was timely filed and the\n\nappellee will not suffer undue prejudice.      Smith, 992 F.2d at 100;\n\nsee also Jones, 117 F.3d at 645-46; Soolook, 987 F.2d at 575.\n\n          Thus, we dismiss the appeal.       Had we jurisdiction over\n\nthis case, we would have dismissed it in its entirety.         We became\n\naware of the fact that this court lacked jurisdiction after reading\n\nthe briefs, researching the case law, and hearing oral arguments.\n\nBy that point, it was clear that Manning's contention that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to support a conviction lacked merit. It\n\nwas also clear that the fine imposed by the Magistrate Judge was\n\nappropriate, as the Puerto Rico Penal Code contains a catchall\n\npenalty provision   that   prescribes   a   penalty   when   one   is   not\n\nestablished by the other sections of the Code.        See 33 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. § 3045.\n\n          Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
