Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n          Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Steven M. Potolsky, P.A. for appellant.\n     Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-\nPabón, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                             March 18, 2004\n\f           Per curiam.    On July 6, 1998, defendant-appellant Luis\n\nGines-Perez was arrested after the car he was driving was stopped\n\nand found to be carrying 1.4 kilograms of heroin.           Gines-Perez\n\neventually pleaded guilty to three counts of an indictment charging\n\nhim with narcotics distribution-related offenses, but reserved the\n\nright to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.        The motion\n\nchallenged the legality of the initial stop and warrants that\n\nsubsequently issued for searches of Gines-Perez's business and\n\nhome.\n\n           There is no dispute that Gines-Perez's car was originally\n\nstopped because, and only because, it was reported stolen; that the\n\nreport was based on incorrect information in a computer database\n\nused by the Puerto Rico police; that police error caused the\n\ndatabase   to   be   incorrect;   and   that   the   incorrect   database\n\ninformation was itself misinterpreted (in a manner unfavorable to\n\nGines-Perez) by the police dispatcher who informed the arresting\n\nofficers that the vehicle was stolen. These police errors were the\n\nbasis of Gines-Perez's suppression motion, which argued that there\n\nwere no grounds for stopping his car or for the subsequent search\n\nwarrants that issued because of the material found in his car. The\n\ndistrict court rejected this argument, holding (inter alia) that\n\nthe good faith exception identified in Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S.\n\n1, 10-16 (1995), applied to the conduct of the arresting officers.\n\n           The primary basis for the district court's decision,\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fhowever, was its conclusion that, viewing \"the totality of the\n\ncircumstances,\" there were sufficient grounds to sustain the search\n\nunder the \"reasonable suspicion\" doctrine of Terry v. Ohio, 392\n\nU.S. 1 (1968).     In support of this conclusion, the court relied\n\nprimarily on the following facts:           one of the officers involved in\n\nthe arrest knew that Gines-Perez previously had been arrested and\n\nthat he had been the subject of surveillance for money laundering\n\nand drug trafficking; Gines-Perez was observed entering the same\n\nrestaurant where another person under surveillance was dining just\n\nprior to his arrest; after exiting the restaurant with a companion\n\nand sliding behind the wheel of his vehicle, Gines-Perez lifted his\n\nshirt to show his companion something in a manner that aroused\n\nsuspicions; and Gines-Perez drove around the block twice after\n\nexiting the restaurant.         But significantly, the court's Terry\n\nanalysis was not entirely independent of its Evans analysis; the\n\ncourt    also   included   in   its    view     of   the   totality   of   the\n\ncircumstances the fact that \"the car driven by Gines-Perez was\n\nreported as \"stolen.\"\n\n           We are troubled by the district court's reading of Evans\n\nas extending the good faith exception to reliance by an arresting\n\nofficer on faulty computer database information due to police\n\nerror.    This reading was dispositive of Gines-Perez's arguments\n\nbased on police error and, as noted above, implicated in the\n\ncourt's totality of the circumstances decision.            We can understand\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhow the district court arrived at its position.                  It acknowledged\n\nits reliance on the language in Evans framing the issue identified\n\nin the grant of certiorari, i.e., whether evidence seized because\n\nof an inaccurate computer record should be suppressed \"regardless\n\nof whether police personnel or court personnel were responsible .\n\n. . .\"    Evans, 514 U.S. at 6.\n\n              In this instance, however, such reliance on Evans takes\n\nthat case beyond its underlying facts and holdings, for the Court\n\nexplicitly declined to reach the issue.            See id. at 16 n.5 (stating\n\nthat the Court would not address whether the good faith exception\n\nwould    apply    to   police   error);      id.   at   16-17    (O'Connor,     J.,\n\nconcurring) (arguing against application of the exception to police\n\nerror).       The government makes no effort to defend the district\n\ncourt's reading of Evans on appeal.           Nor does the government argue\n\nthat    the   Evans    good   faith   exception     should      apply   under   the\n\ncircumstances of this case.\n\n              Inexplicably,     Gines-Perez's      opening      brief   makes    no\n\nmention of the additional grounds cited in support of the court's\n\nTerry ruling.      Indeed, the brief reads as though the entire basis\n\nfor the court's rejection of his suppression motion was the court's\n\nconclusion that the Evans good faith exception applied to the\n\narresting officers' conduct.          In ignoring what might be read as\n\nalternative independent grounds for upholding the stop, Gines-Perez\n\ncomes dangerously close to a forfeiture.            See United States Public\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fInterest Research Group v. Atlantic Salmon of Maine, LLC, 339 F.3d\n\n23, 33 (1st Cir. 2003) (argument not presented in opening brief is\n\nforfeited).\n\n           Yet under the circumstances, we believe that the fairer\n\ncourse of action is to vacate and remand for clarification and for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. Two factors lead\n\nus to adopt this approach.     First, as already noted, the district\n\ncourt misread Evans as flatly governing this case (which it does\n\nnot), and the stolen vehicle report appears to be part of the\n\ncourt's Terry calculus.     Second, it can be argued (although we do\n\nnot now decide) that there is difficulty seeing how, other than the\n\nstolen vehicle report, the officers involved in the investigation\n\nthat led to Gines-Perez's apprehension could be found to have had\n\na \"particularized and objective basis for suspecting [Gines] of\n\ncriminal   activity\"   at   the   time   of    his    initial   detention.\n\nOrnelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696 (1996) (describing the\n\n\"reasonable suspicion\" required to justify a Terry stop) (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).        Along these lines, we note\n\nthat the government does not identify the crime a reasonable\n\nofficer armed with knowledge of all the facts other than the stolen\n\nvehicle report might have suspected Gines-Perez of committing,\n\nhaving committed, or being about to commit.          But at the same time,\n\nwe do not wish to decide the matter without giving the district\n\ncourt an opportunity to revisit the case in light of our opinion.\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f          On    remand,   the   district    court   may   order   additional\n\nbriefing and/or argument to help facilitate its reaching whatever\n\ndecision it deems appropriate. We also call the parties' attention\n\nto the Supreme Court's recent decision in Groh v. Ramirez, 124 S.\n\nCt. 1284 (2004), which might have some bearing on Gines-Perez's\n\nchallenge to the search warrants.          We shall retain jurisdiction\n\nover this appeal with the understanding that it will be dismissed\n\nshould the court vacate or modify the judgment of conviction from\n\nwhich Gines-Perez appeals.        The parties are directed to file a\n\njoint status report within 30 days of the court's disposition of\n\nthis matter following our remand.          At that point, we shall issue\n\nwhatever additional orders we deem appropriate.\n\n               So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f",
