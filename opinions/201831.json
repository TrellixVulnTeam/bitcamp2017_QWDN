Nathanson, William M.\nCowan, Dora Kripapuri and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and\nPopeo, P.C. were on brief for appellant.\n     David Pastor and Kenneth D. Quat with whom Douglas J. Hoffman\nand Gilman and Pastor, LLP were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                           September 16, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern     District   of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f           Per   Curiam.   Pfizer,   sued   in   two   class   actions   in\n\nMassachusetts state court, removed these actions to the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts pursuant to\n\nthe Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, 119 Stat.\n\n4 (to be codified at 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(d)(2)) (\"CAFA\").                   The\n\nDistrict Court remanded the actions but certified its ruling for an\n\ninterlocutory appeal, and this court accepted Pfizer's appeal from\n\nthe remand order pursuant to CAFA ยง 5, 119 Stat. 12 (to be codified\n\nat 28 U.S.C. ยง 1453(c)(1)).\n\n           Plaintiffs filed their actions in state court, Natale on\n\nFebruary 11, and Kwaak on January 13, 2005.            Section 9 of CAFA\n\nprovides that \"this Act shall apply to any civil action commenced\n\non or after the date of enactment of this Act.\"           CAFA's date of\n\nenactment was February 18, 2005.     Pfizer filed a notice of removal\n\nin the District Court on March 25, 2005, within 30 days of the\n\nfiling of the Natale action.   28 U.S.C. ยง 1446(b).\n\n           Pfizer contends that the actions were commenced on the\n\ndate they were removed.    The two circuits to have addressed the\n\nissue have rejected this contention, having held that \"commenced\"\n\nmeans \"filed\" rather than \"removed.\"    Knudsen v. Liberty Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., 411 F.3d 805, 806 (7th Cir. 2005), following Pritchett v.\n\nOffice Depot, Inc., No. 05-0501, 2005 WL 1994020 (10th Cir. Aug. 18,\n\n2005), amending and superceding 404 F.3d 1232 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nPfizer argues that these actions are different in that removal\n\n\n                                -2-\n\foccurred within the statutory thirty-day period from service of the\n\ncomplaint, rather than after the action had been pending for some\n\nyears. But that argument runs squarely into the statutory provision\n\nthat the Act is to apply only to actions commenced on or after the\n\ndate of enactment.    We agree with the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n\nPfizer, Inc. v. Lott, 417 F.3d 725 (7th Cir. 2005), rejecting this\n\nargument. To accept it would have us rewrite the statute by carving\n\nout a class of late-filed actions.\n\n          Thus, Pfizer is left with its argument that \"commenced\"\n\nmeans \"removed.\"     As Judge Posner points out in Lott,\n\n          While it is true that the proceeding in\n          federal court was \"commenced\" by the filing of\n          the removal petition, that filing was not the\n          beginning of the suit. For what was removed\n          was the suit that had been brought in the\n          Illinois state court, and under Illinois law\n          the filing of the complaint had \"commenced\"\n          the suit.\n\nId. at 726.   The same is true under Massachusetts law.     Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 3 (stating that a civil action is commenced by filing of a\n\ncomplaint); Big D Carpets, Inc. v. The Welch Group, Inc., 37 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 312, 315 (Mass. App. 1994).\n\n          Finally, we are unpersuaded by Pfizer's reliance on a\n\nline of district court decisions following Lorraine Motors, Inc. v.\n\nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 166 F. Supp. 319 (E.D.N.Y. 1958).       Those\n\ncases involved legislation increasing the amount in controversy\n\nrequirement and rest on the rationale that an action should not be\n\nremovable from state court when that action could not have been\n\n                                  -3-\n\foriginally instituted in federal court on the day it was removed\n\nbecause the jurisdictional amount had been raised.    See Lorraine\n\nMotors, 166 F. Supp. at 323.   They have no relevance here.\n\n          The remand order is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
