HELDEMAN,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n              [Hon. Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n               Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     John E. MacDonald with whom Larochelle & MacDonald, Inc. and\nRonald Kliegerman were on brief for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart with whom Robert Clark Corrente, United\nStates Attorney, Luis M. Matos and Michael P. Iannotti, Assistant\nUnited States Attorneys, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            March 29, 2005\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge. In March 2004, Marvin Heldeman pled\n\nguilty in Rhode Island federal district court to one count of\n\nconspiracy to commit health care fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 371 (2000),\n\nseventeen counts of health care fraud, id. § 1347, three counts of\n\nconspiracy to distribute drugs, 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2000), and three\n\ncounts of drug distribution, id. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C).   In June\n\n2004, the court sentenced Heldeman to 46 months' imprisonment, and\n\nordered that his residence be forfeited for having \"facilitated\"\n\nhis drug distribution offenses.       Id. § 853(a)(2).   On appeal,\n\nHeldeman challenges the district court's forfeiture order and seeks\n\na remand for resentencing under United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct.\n\n738   (2005), and United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n           Between October 2000 and December 2002, Heldeman, a New\n\nYork dermatologist, wrote prescriptions for steroids and Oxycodone\n\n(a highly addictive and very strong pain medication) for a number\n\nof individuals--many of whom were bodybuilders and some of whom\n\nHeldeman had never seen or treated.       These prescriptions were\n\nmedically unnecessary and were of the sort not typically prescribed\n\nby dermatologists.    For one bodybuilder, Timothy DiPaola, the\n\nprescriptions were made out in the names of DiPaola's friends, so\n\nthat DiPaola could purchase the drugs with his friends' insurance\n\nand then use them himself.    Heldeman also took phone calls from\n\npharmacies to confirm the validity of the prescriptions he had\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fwritten, and instructed his office manager and nurse to do the same\n\nif pharmacists called.\n\n           In return for writing prescriptions, Heldeman received\n\nvarious services of a sexual nature from his clients.                These\n\nincluded having his clients pose for him in various states of\n\nundress   while   Heldeman    took   photographs   or   videotaped   them.\n\nRoughly half of the prescriptions were written at Heldeman's home\n\nand some of the photography or videotaping occurred there; the pads\n\non which Heldeman wrote the prescriptions that formed the basis for\n\nhis indictment bore his home address; and Heldeman kept business\n\ncards in his apartment bearing his home phone number and the\n\ninscription \"Dr. Marvin, The Bodybuilder's Friend.\"\n\n           On appeal, Heldeman argues that the forfeiture of his\n\nresidence was error.     The pertinent portion of 21 U.S.C. § 853(a)\n\nrequires that anyone convicted of a controlled substance offense\n\npunishable by over one year's imprisonment \"shall forfeit to the\n\nUnited States . . . any of the person's property used, or intended\n\nto be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the\n\ncommission of, such violation.\"            We have held that identical\n\nlanguage in the civil forfeiture statute, id. § 881(a)(7), requires\n\na \"substantial connection\" between the property at issue and the\n\ndrug activity charged.       See United States v. Desmarais, 938 F.2d\n\n347, 353 (1st Cir. 1991) (collecting cases).       Heldeman claims that\n\nsame standard should be applied here.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f            Whatever the exact degree of connection required by the\n\ncriminal forfeiture statute, see United States v. White, 116 F.3d\n\n948, 950-52 (1st Cir. 1997) (leaving open the issue), the evidence\n\nprovided to the district court in this case amply supported the\n\nforfeiture.     All six of the drug offenses with which Heldeman was\n\ncharged involved prescriptions written in his apartment.                   His\n\napartment served as a base of operations for his crime just as\n\nsurely as does a residence where drugs are actually delivered or\n\nstored.    See Desmarais, 938 F.2d at 353.\n\n            Nor is it any defense to claim (as Heldeman does) that\n\nhis activities could have been undertaken elsewhere.             The statute\n\nrequires    only   that     the   property     \"facilitate[]\"   the    offense.\n\nHeldeman’s proffered reading would cripple the statute and defeat\n\nthe evident congressional intent to forfeit property used in\n\ncommitting the crime.         See White, 116 F.3d at 950, 952; United\n\nStates v. Rogers, 102 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied,\n\n522 U.S. 879 (1997).        It would also be at odds with our prior case\n\nlaw on civil forfeiture, which contains no suggestion that the\n\nproperty must be the only means of achieving the defendant's\n\ncriminal goals in order to merit forfeiture.               See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Parcel of Land and Residence at 28 Emery St., Merrimac,\n\nMass.,    914   F.2d   1,   4-5   (1st    Cir.   1990)   (collecting   cases).\n\nHeldeman may not be what the average person thinks of when speaking\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fof a \"drug dealer,\" but he does not dispute that his acts are\n\nwithin section 841 so the forfeiture provision applies.\n\n              Forfeitures     are    subject    to    the   Eighth    Amendment’s\n\nexcessive fines clause \"if they constitute punishment for an\n\noffense.\"         United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 328 (1998).\n\nHere, forfeiture was \"imposed at the culmination of a criminal\n\nproceeding and requires conviction of an underlying felony,\" id.,\n\nand thus was punishment for the offense.              See also United States v.\n\nSherman, 262 F.3d 784, 795 (8th Cir. 2001) (subjecting § 853(a)(2)\n\nforfeiture to excessive fines analysis), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 940\n\n(2002), and cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1095 (2002); United States v.\n\nDicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1292 (11th Cir. 1999) (same), cert. denied,\n\n531 U.S. 828 (2000).         Heldeman says the forfeiture was excessive.\n\n              A     forfeiture   will    violate      the   Eighth    Amendment's\n\nprohibition only if it is \"grossly disproportional to the gravity\n\nof the defendant's offense.\"            Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 336-37.         The\n\ncase law invites us to consider as pertinent factors (1) whether\n\nthe defendant falls into the class of persons at whom the criminal\n\nstatute was principally directed; (2) other penalties authorized by\n\nthe legislature (or the Sentencing Commission); and (3) the harm\n\ncaused   by       the   defendant.       Id.   at    337-40.    Our    review   of\n\ndisproportionality is de novo, with due deference given to the\n\ndistrict court's factual findings.             Id. at 336 & n.10.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f            Heldeman's   equity   in   his    residence   was   just   under\n\n$900,000.     By contrast, the statute and sentencing guidelines\n\nprovide for a penalty of up to $6 million for his offense conduct\n\n(a $1 million fine for each of six counts).               See 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(C); U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(c)(4).         The forfeiture here amounts\n\nto a mere 15 percent of the maximum total fine permitted, and we\n\nare not impressed with Heldeman’s reliance upon the sentimental\n\nvalue of his house. Bajakajian involved a forfeiture exceeding the\n\nguidelines level by a factor of 70.          See 524 U.S. at 339-40.\n\n            Some circuits have treated a forfeiture of less than the\n\nstatutory or guideline maximum as strongly suggesting or conclusive\n\nof compliance with the Eighth Amendment.1           However this may be,\n\nthere are no strong countervailing arguments in favor of Heldeman\n\nthat would warrant a different result.         Heldeman's offense conduct\n\nwas not typical of drug dealing and did not involve guns or\n\nviolence; but it was calculated, repeated, and done for Heldeman's\n\nbenefit rather than misguided sympathy, and facilitated access to\n\ndangerous substances in the absence of medical need.\n\n            Turning to sentencing, Heldeman concedes that he did not\n\nraise a Sixth Amendment argument below in any of its variations or\n\n\n     1\n      See, e.g., United States v. Bernitt, 392 F.3d 873, 880-81\n(7th Cir. 2004), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Mar. 15, 2005) (No.\n04-9247); United States v. Wallace, 389 F.3d 483, 486 (5th Cir.\n2004), cert. denied, 125 S.Ct. 1426 (2005); United States v. Moyer,\n313 F.3d 1082, 1086 (8th Cir. 2002); Dicter, 198 F.3d at 1292;\nUnited States v. 817 N.E. 29th Dr., Wilton Manors, Fla., 175 F.3d\n1304, 1310 (11th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1083 (2000).\n\n                                   -6-\n\flabels.    Accordingly, only plain error review is available.           Here,\n\nthe use of mandatory guidelines at sentencing was \"error\" and\n\n\"plain\" (applying the law as it stands today) but prejudice and\n\nfundamental unfairness remain to be shown.            See United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-36 (1993); Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77.\n\n            With regard to these last two concepts, our principal\n\nconcern in these Booker \"pipeline\" cases is with the likelihood\n\nthat the defendant would have received a lesser sentence in a post-\n\nBooker regime of advisory guidelines.         Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n\n81.   Heldeman points to his advanced age and physical condition.\n\nHeldeman    is   seventy-two   years    old   and   suffers   from    maladies\n\nincluding    diabetes,   prostate      problems,    vision    problems,   and\n\nbrachial    plexus   palsy.    His     physician    described   his   medical\n\ncondition as \"unstable\" and in need of monitoring.              Further, his\n\nunlawful activities--although serious--appear to have been the\n\nexception to an otherwise lawful medical practice.\n\n            The record contains some indication that the district\n\ncourt felt itself constrained by the guidelines.              In particular,\n\nthe court noted that Heldeman's arguments were \"legitimate\" and\n\n\"somewhat mitigating,\" and should be considered in determining\n\nwhere within the guidelines range Heldeman's sentence should fall;\n\nbut it concluded that these factors \"do not approach what is\n\nrequired to justify a downward departure,\" that age and physical\n\ncondition were both discouraged as grounds for departure, and that\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fHeldeman's     traits,    although     worthy      of     consideration,        were\n\ninsufficient to take the case outside the \"heartland\" of the\n\nguidelines.\n\n            Guided by traditional plain error doctrine and Justice\n\nBreyer's specific reference to it in Booker, this court has adhered\n\nto the analysis mandated by Olano where dealing with unpreserved\n\nerrors--although we have been generous in other respects, given the\n\npeculiarities of the situation created by Booker.                  The court has\n\noffered to treat almost any colorable claim in the district court\n\nas   preserving    the    Booker     issue   and        avoiding   plain    error\n\nrequirements.     See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76.                Even where\n\nplain error is required, we have recognized that a district judge\n\nmay well not have expressed his or her reservations because the\n\nguidelines made them hopeless, and so invited proffers by the\n\ndefendant    as   to   what    the   defendant   might      have   said    if    the\n\nguidelines had been advisory at the time.\n\n             Consonantly, we are inclined not to be overly demanding\n\nas to proof of probability where, either in the existing record or\n\nby plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the\n\ndistrict judge might well have reached a different result under\n\nadvisory guidelines.          After all, it will be easy enough for the\n\ndistrict judge on remand to say no with a minimum expenditure of\n\neffort if the sentence imposed under the pre-Booker guidelines\n\nregime is also the one that the judge would have imposed under the\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fmore   relaxed    post-Booker   framework.    This     opinion   has   been\n\ncirculated to the other active members of the court.\n\n           In the present case, we are satisfied that the district\n\njudge might well have given a different sentence if the advisory\n\nguideline regime had been in force and accordingly vacate the\n\nsentence and remand for resentencing.        Given the standard we are\n\nusing, the remand should not be taken as either a suggestion or a\n\nprediction that the sentence will necessarily be altered.              The\n\nforfeiture   is    affirmed.     The   sentence   of   imprisonment    and\n\nsupervised release is vacated and that aspect of the judgment\n\nremanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

In June 2004, the court sentenced Heldeman to 46 months' imprisonment, and ordered that his residence be forfeited for having \"facilitated\" his drug distribution offenses. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 853(a)(2).

Roughly half of the prescriptions were written at Heldeman's home and some of the photography or videotaping occurred there; the pads on which Heldeman wrote the prescriptions that formed the basis for his indictment bore his home address; and Heldeman kept business cards in his apartment bearing his home phone number and the inscription \"Dr. Marvin, The Bodybuilder's Friend.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Heldeman argues that the forfeiture of his residence was error. The pertinent portion of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a) requires that anyone convicted of a controlled substance offense punishable by over one year's imprisonment \"shall forfeit to the United States ... any of the person's property used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.\" We have held that identical language in the civil forfeiture statute, <i>id.</i> &#167; 881(a)(7), requires a \"substantial connection\" between the property at issue and the drug activity charged. <i>See United States v. Desmarais,</i> 938 F.2d 347, 353 (1st Cir.1991) (collecting cases). Heldeman claims that same standard should be applied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the exact degree of connection required by the criminal forfeiture statute, <i>see United States v. White,</i> 116 F.3d 948, 950-52 (1st Cir.1997) (leaving open the issue), the evidence provided to the district court in this case amply supported the forfeiture. All six of the drug offenses with which Heldeman was charged involved prescriptions written in his apartment. His apartment served as a base of operations for his crime just as surely as does a residence where drugs are actually delivered or stored. <i>See Desmarais,</i> 938 F.2d at 353.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it any defense to claim (as Heldeman does) that his activities could have been undertaken elsewhere. The statute requires only that the property \"facilitate[ ]\" the offense. Heldeman's proffered reading would cripple the statute and defeat the evident congressional intent to forfeit property used in committing the crime. <i>See White,</i> 116 F.3d at 950, 952; <i>United States v.

It would also be at odds with our prior case law on civil forfeiture, which contains no suggestion that the property must be the only means of achieving the defendant's criminal goals in order to merit forfeiture. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Parcel of Land and Residence at 28 Emery St., Merrimac, Mass.,</i> 914 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting cases). Heldeman may not be what the average person thinks of when speaking of a \"drug dealer,\" but he does not dispute that his acts are within section 841 so the forfeiture provision applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forfeitures are subject to the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause \"if they constitute punishment for an offense.\" <i>United States v.

Heldeman points to his advanced age and physical condition. Heldeman is seventy-two years old and suffers from maladies including diabetes, prostate problems, vision problems, and brachial plexus palsy. His physician described his medical condition as \"unstable\" and in need of monitoring. Further, his unlawful activities &#8212; although serious &#8212; appear to have been the exception to an otherwise lawful medical practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains some indication that the district court felt itself constrained by the guidelines. In particular, the court noted that Heldeman's arguments were \"legitimate\" and \"somewhat mitigating,\" and should be considered in determining where within the guidelines range Heldeman's sentence should fall; but it concluded that these factors \"do not approach what is required to justify a downward departure,\" that age and physical condition were both discouraged as grounds for departure, and that Heldeman's traits, although worthy of consideration, were insufficient to take the case outside the \"heartland\" of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guided by traditional plain error doctrine and Justice Breyer's specific reference to it in <i>Booker,</i> this court has adhered to the analysis mandated by <i>Olano</i> where dealing with unpreserved errors &#8212; although we have been generous in other respects, given the peculiarities of the situation created by <i>Booker.</i> The court has offered to treat almost any colorable claim in the district court as preserving the <i>Booker</i> issue and avoiding plain error requirements. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76. Even where plain error is required, we have recognized that a district judge may well not have expressed his or her reservations because the guidelines made them hopeless, and so invited proffers by the defendant as to what the defendant might have said if the guidelines had been advisory at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consonantly, we are inclined not to be overly demanding as to proof of probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines. After all, it will be easy enough for the district judge on remand to say no with a minimum expenditure of effort if the sentence imposed under the pre-<i>Booker</i> guidelines regime is also the one that the judge would have imposed under the more relaxed post-<i>Booker</i> framework.

In June 2004, the court sentenced Heldeman to 46 months' imprisonment, and ordered that his residence be forfeited for having \"facilitated\" his drug distribution offenses. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 853(a)(2).

These prescriptions were medically unnecessary and were of the sort not typically prescribed by dermatologists. For one bodybuilder, Timothy DiPaola, the prescriptions were made out in the names of DiPaola's friends, so that DiPaola could purchase the drugs with his friends' insurance and then use them himself. Heldeman also took phone calls from pharmacies to confirm the validity of the prescriptions he had written, and instructed his office manager and nurse to do the same if pharmacists called.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return for writing prescriptions, Heldeman received various services of a sexual nature from his clients. These included having his clients pose for him in various states of undress while Heldeman took photographs or videotaped them. Roughly half of the prescriptions were written at Heldeman's home and some of the photography or videotaping occurred there; the pads on which Heldeman wrote the prescriptions that formed the basis for his indictment bore his home address; and Heldeman kept business cards in his apartment bearing his home phone number and the inscription \"Dr. Marvin, The Bodybuilder's Friend.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Heldeman argues that the forfeiture of his residence was error. The pertinent portion of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a) requires that anyone convicted of a controlled substance offense punishable by over one year's imprisonment \"shall forfeit to the United States ... any of the person's property used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.\" We have held that identical language in the civil forfeiture statute, <i>id.</i> &#167; 881(a)(7), requires a \"substantial connection\" between the property at issue and the drug activity charged. <i>See United States v. Desmarais,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564779\"><a href=\"/opinion/564779/united-states-v-paul-desmarais/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 353 (1st Cir.1991) (collecting cases). Heldeman claims that same standard should be applied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the exact degree of connection required by the criminal forfeiture statute, <i>see United States v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197435\"><a href=\"/opinion/197435/united-states-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>, 950-52 (1st Cir.1997) (leaving open the issue), the evidence provided to the district court in this case amply supported the forfeiture. All six of the drug offenses with which Heldeman was charged involved prescriptions written in his apartment. His apartment served as a base of operations for his crime just as surely as does a residence where drugs are actually delivered or stored. <i>See Desmarais,</i> 938 F.2d at 353.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it any defense to claim (as Heldeman does) that his activities could have been undertaken elsewhere. The statute requires only that the property \"facilitate[ ]\" the offense. Heldeman's proffered reading would cripple the statute and defeat the evident congressional intent to forfeit property used in committing the crime. <i>See White,</i> 116 F.3d at 950, 952; <i>United States v. Rogers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197136\"><a href=\"/opinion/197136/united-states-v-rogers/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 648 (1st Cir.1996), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span> (1997). It would also be at odds with our prior case law on civil forfeiture, which contains no suggestion that the property must be the only means of achieving the defendant's criminal goals in order to merit forfeiture. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Parcel of Land and Residence at 28 Emery St., Merrimac, Mass.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547664\"><a href=\"/opinion/547664/united-states-v-parcel-of-land-and-residence-at-28-emery-street-merrimac/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting cases).

In particular, the court noted that Heldeman's arguments were \"legitimate\" and \"somewhat mitigating,\" and should be considered in determining where within the guidelines range Heldeman's sentence should fall; but it concluded that these factors \"do not approach what is required to justify a downward departure,\" that age and physical condition were both discouraged as grounds for departure, and that Heldeman's traits, although worthy of consideration, were insufficient to take the case outside the \"heartland\" of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guided by traditional plain error doctrine and Justice Breyer's specific reference to it in <i>Booker,</i> this court has adhered to the analysis mandated by <i>Olano</i> where dealing with unpreserved errors &#8212; although we have been generous in other respects, given the peculiarities of the situation created by <i>Booker.</i> The court has offered to treat almost any colorable claim in the district court as preserving the <i>Booker</i> issue and avoiding plain error requirements. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76. Even where plain error is required, we have recognized that a district judge may well not have expressed his or her reservations because the guidelines made them hopeless, and so invited proffers by the defendant as to what the defendant might have said if the guidelines had been advisory at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consonantly, we are inclined not to be overly demanding as to proof of probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines. After all, it will be easy enough for the district judge on remand to say no with a minimum expenditure of effort if the sentence imposed under the pre-<i>Booker</i> guidelines regime is also the one that the judge would have imposed under the more relaxed post-<i>Booker</i> framework. This opinion has been circulated to the other active members of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, we are satisfied that the district judge might well have given a different sentence if the advisory guideline regime had been in force and accordingly vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. Given the standard we are using, the remand should not be taken as either a suggestion or a prediction that the sentence will necessarily be altered. The forfeiture is <i>affirmed.</i> The sentence of imprisonment and supervised release is <i>vacated</i> and that aspect of the judgment <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See, e.g., United States v.
