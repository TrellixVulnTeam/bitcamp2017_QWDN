Gale, United States Attorney, was on brief, for the\n                  \nUnited States.\n\n                                             \n\n                         November 8, 1993\n\n                                             \n\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.  This proceeding requires us, for\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nthe first  time, to chart  the interrelationship between  Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 4(b) (delimiting the appeal period in criminal cases) and\n\nFed. R. Crim.  P. 35(c) (the  text of which is  set forth in  the\n\nmargin).1     We  conclude   that,  under  certain  circumscribed\n\ncircumstances,  post-judgment  motions brought  under  the latter\n\nrule can operate to extend the appeal period limned by the former\n\nrule, and  that the  instant case  qualifies for  this elongating\n\neffect.   Thus, the appeal prosecuted by defendant-appellant Josh\n\nMorillo is  properly before us.   This initial success  heralds a\n\nhollow  victory,  however,  for  we  find  Morillo's  substantive\n\narguments unpersuasive and affirm the judgment below.\n\n                                I.\n                                  \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          A thumbnail  sketch suffices  to put  this appeal  into\n\nworkable  perspective.2  In  1992, a federal  grand jury indicted\n\nappellant on three counts of  distributing heroin in violation of\n\n                    \n\n     1The rule provides:\n\n          The  court, acting  within  7 days  after the\n          imposition   of  sentence,   may  correct   a\n          sentence  that  was imposed  as  a result  of\n          arithmetical,  technical,   or  other   clear\n          error.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 35(c).   This provision has been in effect  only\nsince December, 1991.\n\n     2The   November  1992  edition  of  the  federal  sentencing\nguidelines  applies  in   this  case.    See  United   States  v.\n                                                             \nHarotunian,  920  F.2d  1040,  1041-42  (1st  Cir.  1990).    All\n          \nreferences   herein  are  to   that  version,   unless  otherwise\nspecifically indicated.\n\n                                2\n\n21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1) (1988).  He entered  a plea of not guilty.\n\nThe  district court  set  the case  for trial  in  December.   On\n\nNovember   30,  appellant  moved   for  the  appointment   of  an\n\nindependent toxicologist to  weigh the drugs that  the government\n\nplanned to offer  in evidence against him.  He made it clear that\n\nhe was ready to  plead guilty to the charges but  for the dispute\n\nover drug quantity.  On December 10, 1992,  without any agreement\n\nanent weight,  appellant changed  his plea  and acknowledged  his\n\nguilt  on all counts.   Some two months  later the district court\n\ngranted  appellant's longstanding  motion and  ordered the  drugs\n\nreweighed at a state-run laboratory.  The laboratory reported its\n\nfindings soon thereafter.\n\n          At  a sentencing hearing  held on  March 18,  1993, the\n\ndistrict court  determined that the heroin involved in the counts\n\nof conviction warranted  a base offense level  (BOL) of 18.   See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c)(13)  (Drug  Quantity   Table).3    The  judge\n\nincreased the BOL by two  levels because of Morillo's aggravating\n\nrole in the  offense, see U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c), and decreased  the\n                         \n\nBOL  by two  levels  for acceptance  of  responsibility, see  id.\n                                                                 \n\n 3E1.1(a).    When  combined  with  appellant's  criminal history\n\ncategory  (III),  the various  adjustments  produced a  guideline\n\nsentencing range  (GSR)  of 33-41  months.   The court  sentenced\n\nappellant at the range's apex and entered final judgment on March\n\n19, 1993.\n\n                    \n\n     3In  Part III(A), infra, we  discuss the relevant details of\n                            \nthe debate over  drug weight and, relatedly,  the appropriateness\nof the BOL.\n\n                                3\n\n          On March 23, appellant filed  a motion asking the court\n\nto  correct his sentence because of  an alleged miscalculation in\n\nfiguring drug quantity.  On April 1, appellant filed a  notice of\n\nappeal.   On April  19, the district  court addressed appellant's\n\npost-judgment motion  and denied it  by means of a  margin order.\n\nAppellant did not file a further notice of appeal.\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                      Appellate Jurisdiction\n                                            \n\n                                A.\n                                  \n\n                 Suspensory Motions:  An Overview\n                                                 \n\n          In  a criminal case, a defendant  must appeal within 10\n\ndays after entry of  a judgment of conviction.  See  Fed. R. App.\n                                                   \n\nP. 4(b).  Because the obligation is mandatory and jurisdictional,\n\nunexcused failures of compliance inevitably result in the loss of\n\nappeal rights.  See United States v. Kress, 944 F.2d 155, 161 (3d\n                                          \n\nCir. 1991), cert.  denied, 112 S. Ct. 1163  (1992); United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Zuleta-Molina, 840 F.2d 157, 158 (1st Cir. 1988).  However, in\n                \n\ncases where the entry  of a judgment is  closely followed by  the\n\nfiling  of a certain  type of revisory motion,  the time limit is\n\nrelaxed.  For example, most timely motions for new trial, Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P.  33, or timely  motions in  arrest of judgment,  Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 34, stall the running of the appeal period and permit an\n\nappeal to  be taken  from the judgment  of conviction,  should it\n\nstand, \"within  10 days after the  entry of an order  denying the\n\n[Rule 33 or Rule 34] motion.\"  Fed. R. App. P. 4(b).\n\n          Post-judgment  motions   apart  from   those  expressly\n\n                                4\n\nenumerated in Fed. R. App.  P. 4(b) can have the  same suspensory\n\neffect.    The  paradigmatic  example  is  a  timely  motion  for\n\nrehearing  or reconsideration.  See  United States v. Ibarra, 112\n                                                            \n\nS.

Because the\nappeal period begins to run afresh at the  time of disposition of\nthe  motion, the  motion does  not  toll the  appeal period,  but\nrestarts it.   See Ibarra, 112 S. Ct. at  5 n.2; see also Fed. R.\n                                                         \nApp. 4(b) (discussing  effect of timely motions  filed under Fed.\nR. Crim P. 33, 34).\n\n                                5\n\nthen Fed. R. App. P.  4(b) applies without dilution and Morillo's\n\nnotice  of  appeal,  filed  more  than 10  days  after  entry  of\n\njudgment, is  a nullity.   To avoid  this result,  appellant must\n\nconvince us  that  bringing the  March  23 motion  suspended  the\n\nrunning of the appeal  period by rendering the original  judgment\n\nnonfinal for appeal  purposes, or,  put in  its simplest  aspect,\n\nextended  the time  within which  an  appeal from  the underlying\n\njudgment could be taken.\n\n                                C.\n                                  \n\n                             Analysis\n                                     \n\n          1.   Characterization.  Our first  order of business is\n          1.   Characterization.\n                               \n\nto determine  the character of the  March 23 motion.   The motion\n\ndid not invoke, or even refer to, any particular procedural rule.\n\nWhen  a motion  is silent as  to the  location of  its procedural\n\nmoorings, an inquiring court must look to the motion's substance,\n\nincluding the relief requested, in order properly to characterize\n\nit.  See,  e.g., Dieter, 429 U.S. at 8-9; Hannon v. Maschner, 981\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1142,  1144 n.2  (10th Cir. 1992);  Feinstein v.

R. Crim.  P. 35(c), quoted\n\nsupra note 1.  The motion posits, in fairly blunt terms, that the\n     \n\ndistrict  court made a  numerical mistake  in its  aggregation of\n\ndiscerned drug  quantities.  Whether  or not one  classifies this\n\nclaimed bevue as  \"arithmetical,\" the motion  alleges, at a  bare\n\nminimum,  a strain of  \"clear error.\"   This is the  very sort of\n\nsituation that Rule 35(c) was  designed to address.  See Fed.  R.\n                                                        \n\nCrim.  P.  35(c)  advisory   committee's  note  (1991  amendment)\n\n(stating that  the rule  enables a court  to rectify  \"an obvious\n\nerror or mistake\" affecting the sentence so long as  the error or\n\nmistake is \"discovered  shortly after the sentence  is imposed\");\n\nsee also  United States v.  Corey, 999  F.2d 493, 496  (10th Cir.\n                                 \n\n1993) (explaining that  Rule 35(c) codifies the  district court's\n\n\"inherent authority .  . . to correct sentencing  errors\").  And,\n\nmoreover, no one has suggested a better fit elsewhere.\n\n          2.  Effect.   Having identified the motion  as a motion\n          2.  Effect.\n                    \n\nunder Fed. R.  Crim. P. 35(c), the  lens of inquiry narrows.   We\n\nfocus next  on whether  a motion brought  pursuant to  Rule 35(c)\n\nextends the  time for  appealing from  the underlying  judgment.5\n\n                    \n\n     5To be sure, the text of Rule 35(c) does not mention motions\nand   contemplates  that  the   district  court,  within  certain\nspecified constraints, may  act sua sponte to  correct sentencing\n                                          \nerrors.  But  we do not read  the rule as prohibiting  either the\ngovernment or the defendant from calling  the need for corrective\naction to the  sentencing court's attention by means  of a timely\nfiled post-judgment  motion.   We believe that  such motions  are\npermissible  and note  that other  courts have  read the  rule as\nauthorizing them.   See, e.g., Corey, 999 F.2d  at 494-96; United\n                                                                 \nStates v.

See supra  pp.  4-5\n                                                       \n\n(listing  precedents).    This tenet  applies  in  criminal cases\n\nnotwithstanding  that, by  and  large,  there  are  \"no  explicit\n\nprovisions  for rehearing  proceedings in  criminal  cases.\"   16\n\nCharles A.

The  Healy doctrine is  still good law,\n                                    \n\nhaving survived  the massive  changes wrought  by the  Sentencing\n\nReform Act of 1984.

Forcing a party\n                                          \n\n                                8\n\nto press  ahead with  an appeal  while such a  motion is  pending\n\nwould countervail the principles of efficacy and judicial economy\n\nthat undergird Healy.  Consequently, we hold that when, as now, a\n                    \n\nparty  to a  criminal case  files a  timely motion under  Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P.  35(c), asking  the sentencing  court  to reconsider  an\n\nissue in the case in a way  that will, if successful, bring about\n\nan alteration  of the  defendant's substantive  rights, then  the\n\nfiling of that motion renders  the judgment nonfinal for purposes\n\nof appeal.6  Accord Corey, 999 F.2d at 496.\n                         \n\n          3.

We have\n\nbeen careful  to note,  and believe it  is prudent  to emphasize,\n\nthat only a timely motion for rehearing or reconsideration should\n                  \n\nbe accorded suspensory effect.  See, e.g., Dieter, 429 U.S.  at 8\n                                                 \n\n(limiting suspensory effect to \"timely petitions for rehearing\");\n\nHealy,  376  U.S.  at  77,  80  (same).  Timeliness  is  measured\n     \n\ndifferently in different  contexts.  In Carr,  we were confronted\n                                            \n\nwith  a  motion for  rehearing  addressed to  a  district court's\n\ninherent power  to correct an  erroneous sentence.7   We accorded\n\nsuspensory effect, holding the motion to be timely because it was\n\nbrought \"within the time frame  allowed for taking an appeal from\n\n                    \n\n     6The likelihood that  appellant might prevail on  his motion\nis irrelevant for purposes of determining the motion's suspensory\neffect.  See Ibarra, 112 S. Ct. at 6.  It is the character of the\n                   \npost-judgment  motion, not its  intrinsic merit or  lack thereof,\nthat determines whether,  if seasonably filed, it  will interrupt\nthe running of the appeal period.\n\n     7The events  in Carr antedated  the adoption of  Rule 35(c).\n                         \nSee Carr, 932 F.2d at 71 n.5.\n        \n\n                                9\n\nthe sentencing order.\"  Carr, 932 F.2d at 72.  Hence,  the motion\n                            \n\ninterrupted the  running  of  the  appeal period.

The drafters  of  the rule  were\n\nconcerned lest  they pave  further  avenues of  delay within  the\n\ncriminal  justice system.    To assuage  this  concern, the  rule\n\nstates  that a court may act  thereunder \"within 7 days after the\n\nimposition of sentence.\"  Fed.  R. Crim. P. 35(c).   The interval\n\nconstitutes  a limitation, see  Fed. R.  Crim. P.  35(c) advisory\n                              \n\ncommittee's  note  (1991 amendment)  (discussing  the new  rule's\n\n\"stringent time requirement\")    and the limitation  is absolute:\n\nif no motion  is made within  the seven-day  period, none can  be\n\nmade thereafter; and, moreover, if a motion is timely made but is\n\nnot decided within the seven-day period, the judge's power to act\n\nunder  the rule subsides  and the pending motion  is deemed to be\n\ndenied as  of that date.   Judge Easterbrook neatly  captured the\n\nessence of the  limitation:  \"The district court's inaction ha[s]\n\nthe same effect as denying  the motion, making the judgment final\n\non  the date  the district  judge's power  to alter  the sentence\n\nexpired.\"  United  States v.

Application.   In  this  case, the  district court\n          4.   Application.\n                          \n\npronounced sentence  on March  18 and  entered judgment  the next\n\nday.8    Appellant filed  his  Rule  35(c)  motion on  March  23,\n\ncomfortably within the seven-day period.   The district court did\n\nnot  act immediately  upon  the  motion  and,  consequently,  the\n\npendency  of the  motion  rendered  the  judgment  nonfinal  only\n\nthrough the end  of the seven-day period, when  the appeal period\n\nrestarted.  From that point forward, appellant had 10 days within\n\nwhich to docket his appeal.  See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b).  By filing\n                                \n\na  notice of appeal  on April 1,  1993, he met  the deadline with\n\nroom to spare.  Hence, the appeal is properly before us.9\n\n                    \n\n     8For ease  in reference we  use March 19 as  the dispositive\ndate.   Withal, we  note that Rule 35(c)  purports to measure the\nseven-day period from \"the imposition  of sentence.\"  We think it\nis likely that  when the two dates differ,  this phrase signifies\nthe date judgment enters, rather than the date sentence is orally\npronounced.  See  Zuleta-Molina, 840 F.2d at 158 n.1 (reiterating\n                               \nthat  \"[t]he prescribed  period  for filing  a  notice of  appeal\nbegins at  the time  of entry  of the  judgment or  order on  the\ncriminal docket\");  United States v. Cooper, 876  F.2d 1192, 1195\n                                           \n(5th Cir.  1989) (stating that an appeal's timeliness is measured\nfrom the date  judgment is  entered on the  docket, not from  the\ndate of  order).  At  any rate,  the one-day differential  has no\nmaterial effect in this case.\n\n     9There   are   other   questions  that   might   affect  the\njurisdictional  calculus in  cases  of this  stripe    but  those\nquestions are  not presented  on this record.   For  instance, we\n\n                                11\n\n                               III.\n                                   \n\n                            The Merits\n                                      \n\n                                A.\n                                  \n\n                          Drug Quantity\n                                       \n\n          Under the guidelines, drug quantity is \"a key datum\" in\n\nthe sentencing of narcotics offenders.  United States v. Bradley,\n                                                                \n\n917  F.2d  601, 604  (1st  Cir.  1990).   Because  drug  quantity\n\nprofoundly affects sentence length, relatively small quantitative\n\ndifferences  often have  a significant  leveraging  effect.   The\n\nphenomenon grows  more pronounced as  amounts edge closer  to the\n\nlines that have been drawn within the drug quantity  table.  This\n\ncase aptly illustrates the point.   The district court found that\n\nthe  heroin involved in  the offenses of  conviction weighed just\n\nover  20 grams.   The  defense contends  that the  heroin weighed\n\n19.75 grams.  This seemingly slight difference translates into an\n\nincrement of  two offense  levels.   See U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c)(13),\n                                        \n\n(14)  (Drug  Quantity Table)  (setting  BOL  of 18  for  offenses\n\ninvolving  at  least 20  but less  than  40 grams  of  heroin and\n\n                    \n\nhave no occasion to consider (i) whether a different result might\nobtain if it could be shown that a movant brought a post-judgment\nmotion in  bad faith, see Ibarra,  112 S.

A two-level spread easily can produce\n\na difference of over a year in a standard sentence.10\n\n          The  facts relating to  the dispute over  drug quantity\n\ncan  be  succinctly  summarized.    Defendant  was  charged  with\n\ndistributing heroin on three occasions:   February 7, 20, and 21,\n\n1992.     Each  transaction  culminated  in  the  exchange  of  a\n\nsubstantial number of \"browns,\" individually packaged for street-\n\nlevel sales.  Immediately following each transaction, the federal\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimated the weight of the\n\npurveyed drugs by representative sampling, that is, by weighing a\n\nfew of  the \"browns\"  and multiplying the  average weight  by the\n\ntotal  number of  packs contained  in the  consignment.   On this\n\nbasis, the  DEA reported that the first transaction involved 6.51\n\ngrams of heroin, the second transaction  involved 1.24 grams, and\n\nthe  final transaction involved 20.30 grams.  Appellant contested\n\nonly  the last  of  these  three assessments.    Pursuant to  the\n\ndistrict court's order,  the state toxicology laboratory  studied\n\nthe  heroin involved  in  the third  transaction,  using its  own\n\nformula, and  estimated that it  weighed between 10.39  and 16.21\n\ngrams.  Of necessity, however,  this estimate did not include the\n\nweight of the heroin previously extracted from the third batch by\n\nthe   DEA,  used   in  arriving   at  the  DEA's   drug  quantity\n\ndetermination, and never replaced.\n\n                    \n\n     10For example, in Morillo's criminal history category (III),\nthe spread between the high end of a Level 18 GSR (41 months) and\nthe low end of a Level 16 GSR (27 months) is 14 months.\n\n                                13\n\n          Faced with these competing  estimates, the judge  found\n\nit probable  that the  third batch contained  at least  12 grams.\n\nThis total, when  augmented by the  weight of the drugs  from the\n\nfirst  two transactions (6.51  and 1.24 grams,  respectively) and\n\nthe sample amount originally extracted from the third transaction\n\n(0.41 grams), brought the drug quantity over 20 grams and the BOL\n\nto 18.11\n\n          The  government has the burden of proving drug quantity\n\nby  a fair preponderance of  the evidence.   See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nSklar, 920 F.2d  107, 110 (1st Cir.  1990).  Absent a  mistake of\n     \n\nlaw, we will set aside a sentencing court's determination of drug\n\nquantity only if it is  clearly erroneous.  See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nArgencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1307 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v.\n                                                              \n\nMcCarthy, 961 F.2d 972, 978 (1st Cir. 1992); Bradley, 917 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n605.  In other  words, as a precondition to relief  on appeal, an\n\nappellant  must  convince us  that  the  district  court made  \"a\n\nserious mistake\" in  figuring drug quantity.  Sklar,  920 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n111.\n\n          We discern  no error  here.  When  it is  impossible or\n\nimpractical  to  obtain  an exact  drug  quantity  for sentencing\n\npurposes, a reasoned estimate will  suffice.  See Sklar, 920 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 113;  United States v.

The  court  below  achieved  this  benchmark, taking  a\n\nconservative approach to  the disputed third transaction.   Given\n\nthe  divergent laboratory estimates  ranging from a  low of 10.39\n\ngrams to a high of 20.3 grams, the court's decision that a figure\n\ntoward the low end of the continuum represented the most probable\n\nweight  cannot be  faulted.   Cf., e.g.,  United States  v. 22.80\n                                                                 \n\nAcres of  Land, 839  F.2d 1362, 1365  (9th Cir.  1988) (stressing\n              \n\ndistrict  court's flexibility  in determining  value of  property\n\nwhere testimony of  six expert witnesses indicated  wide range of\n\nvalues).

We  have held, in the context\n\nof  what is  now section  3E1.1(a), that  \"[w]hether a  defendant\n\n`clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of\n\npersonal  responsibility'  is  a fact-dominated  issue,  and  the\n\ndistrict court's decision to withhold a reduction in  the offense\n\nlevel  will not be overturned  unless clearly erroneous.\"  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Royer,  895  F.2d  28, 29  (1st  Cir. 1990)  (citation\n                \n\nomitted).  The  clearly erroneous standard also  guides appellate\n\nreview of district court  determinations under section  3E1.1(b).\n\nSee  United States  v. Donovan,  996  F.2d 1343,  1346 (1st  Cir.\n                              \n\n1993); see also U.S.S.G.  3E1.1 comment. (n.5).\n               \n\n                    \n\n          subsection  (a) is level  16 or  greater, and\n          the defendant has assisted authorities in the\n          investigation  or  prosecution   of  his  own\n          misconduct  by  taking  one or  more  of  the\n          following steps:\n\n               (1)     timely    providing     complete\n               information to the government concerning\n               his own involvement in the offense; or\n               (2) timely notifying  authorities of his\n               intention  to  enter a  plea  of guilty,\n               thereby  permitting  the  government  to\n               avoid preparing for trial and permitting\n               the  court  to  allocate  its  resources\n               efficiently, \n          decrease  the offense  level by  1 additional\n          level.\n\nU.S.S.G.  3E1.1.\n\n                                16\n\n          We   find  no  clear  error  in  the  district  court's\n\ndetermination  that appellant  failed to  qualify  for the  added\n\ndiscount under section  3E1.1(b)(2).  Appellant was  arraigned on\n\nOctober 20, 1992.  He pleaded  not guilty.  Several weeks  later,\n\nin his November  30 motion for the appointment  of an independent\n\ntoxicologist,  appellant indicated that he was \"prepared to plead\n\nguilty  to the three charges . . .  but for the dispute as to the\n\nweight\" of the drugs.  In our view,  notification of an intention\n\nto enter a guilty plea, subject to  a major condition, is far too\n\nproblematic to  meet the standard  of section 3E1.1(b)(2).   That\n\nprovision  was designed to allow the  government and the district\n\ncourt  to  conserve  resources  by  avoiding   unnecessary  trial\n\npreparation.  See, e.g., United States v. Lombardi,     F.3d    ,\n                                                  \n\n    (1st Cir. 1993) [No. 92-2450, slip op. at 11].  A conditional\n\noffer to plead  does not serve this end; until the contingency is\n\nremoved, the  prosecution must  still prepare for  trial and  the\n\ncourt must still reserve calendar time.  Thus, the district judge\n\ndid not  err in  refusing to  treat the  November 30  offer as  a\n\n\"notification\" within the purview of section 3E1.1(b)(2).\n\n          There is little more that  need be said.  Appellant did\n\nnot plead unconditionally until December 10, 1992   the very date\n\nthat  the court  had  set for  jury selection.   A  defendant who\n\nwithholds a  guilty plea until he  stands poised on  the brink of\n\ntrial  has  no entitlement  to  the soothing  unguent  of section\n\n3E1.1(b)(2).  Therefore,  the court below acted  appropriately in\n\nawarding  appellant  a  two-level,  rather  than  a  three-level,\n\n                                17\n\ndecrease for acceptance of responsibility.\n\n                                C.\n                                  \n\n                       Role in the Offense\n                                          \n\n          Finally, appellant claims that the district court erred\n\nin its determination of  his role in the criminal activity.   See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.1(c)  (providing a two-level  increase for assuming\n\nmanagerial  responsibilities  in   certain  criminal  endeavors).\n\nBoosting a defendant's BOL by  two levels under this provision is\n\njustified  if the sentencing court determines that the offense(s)\n\nof  conviction involved  at least  two  participants,13 and  that\n\nthe defendant  exercised control  over one of  them.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Akitoye,  923 F.2d  221, 227  (1st Cir.  1991); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Fuller,  897 F.2d  1217, 1220  (1st Cir.  1990).   The\n                 \n\ngovernment must bear  the burden of proving that  an upward role-\n\nin-the-offense adjustment is warranted.\n\n          In  this case,  it is  undisputed  that at  least three\n\npeople  participated in the felonious enterprise:  appellant, his\n\nsupplier  (Faustino Moronta, Jr.), and a courier, Oscar Severino.\n\nOn at  least one occasion,  appellant paged Severino  via beeper,\n\nand  Severino   responded  to  appellant's   apartment  with  the\n\nmerchandise    heroin apparently  originating with Moronta.   The\n\npresentence  investigation  report  (PSI  Report)  asserted  that\n\nSeverino  worked  for   and  under  the  direction   of  Morillo.\n\n                    \n\n     13The  defendant himself may  be counted in  determining the\noverall  number of participants.   See United  States v. Preakos,\n                                                                \n907  F.2d  7, 10  (1st  Cir. 1990)  (per  curiam).   But  he must\nexercise control over  at least one other  participant to warrant\nan upward adjustment.\n\n                                18\n\nAppellant filed written objections to  several aspects of the PSI\n\nReport, but  he did  not object  to this  determination.   At the\n\nsentencing hearing, appellant's attorney  argued briefly that his\n\nclient  was only a  middleman in the  criminal transaction; while\n\nconceding that Severino brought the drugs to the desired locus at\n\nappellant's  behest,  counsel  claimed that  Severino  did  so as\n\nMoronta's  agent     and that  Morillo  exercised  no independent\n\ncontrol  over  him.    Yet,  appellant  offered  no  evidence  to\n\ncontradict  the assertion  contained  in  the  PSI Report.    Not\n\nsurprisingly,  then, the  district court  accepted the  probation\n\nofficer's version of the chain of command.\n\n          Facts contained in a presentence report  ordinarily are\n\nconsidered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.  See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Zuleta-Alvarez,  922 F.2d  33, 35-36 (1st  Cir. 1990),\n                         \n\ncert.  denied, 111  S.

We  lack  adequate  reason to  make  an\n\nexception to  that rule  for appellant's sake.   A  defendant who\n\naccepts   the   probation  department's   configuration   of  the\n\nsentencing record without  contesting the facts set forth  in the\n\nPSI Report can scarcely be  heard to complain when the sentencing\n\n                                19\n\ncourt uses those facts in making its findings.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Montoya,  967 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.)

He entered a plea of not guilty.   The district court set the case for trial in December.   On November 30, appellant moved for the appointment of an independent toxicologist to weigh the drugs that the government planned to offer in evidence against him.   He made it clear that he was ready to plead guilty to the charges but for the dispute over drug quantity.   On December 10, 1992, without any agreement anent weight, appellant changed his plea and acknowledged his guilt on all counts.   Some two months later the district court granted appellant's longstanding motion and ordered the drugs reweighed at a state-run laboratory.   The laboratory reported its findings soon thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a sentencing hearing held on March 18, 1993, the district court determined that the heroin involved in the counts of conviction warranted a base offense level (BOL) of 18.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(13) (Drug Quantity Table).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The judge increased the BOL by two levels because of Morillo's aggravating role in the offense, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), and decreased the BOL by two levels for acceptance of responsibility, see id. &#167; 3E1.1(a).   When combined with appellant's criminal history category (III), the various adjustments produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 33-41 months.   The court sentenced appellant at the range's apex and entered final judgment on March 19, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, appellant filed a motion asking the court to correct his sentence because of an alleged miscalculation in figuring drug quantity.   On April 1, appellant filed a notice of appeal.   On April 19, the district court addressed appellant's post-judgment motion and denied it by means of a margin order.   Appellant did not file a further notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Suspensory Motions:  An Overview</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a criminal case, a defendant must appeal within 10 days after entry of a judgment of conviction.   See Fed.R.App.P. 4(b).   Because the obligation is mandatory and jurisdictional, unexcused failures of compliance inevitably result in the loss of appeal rights.   See United States v. Kress, 944 F.2d 155, 161 (3d Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1163, 117 L.Ed.2d 410 (1992);  United States v. Zuleta-Molina, 840 F.2d 157, 158 (1st Cir.1988).   However, in cases where the entry of a judgment is closely followed by the filing of a certain type of revisory motion, the time limit is relaxed.   For example, most timely motions for new trial, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, or timely motions in arrest of judgment, Fed.R.Crim.P. 34, stall the running of the appeal period and permit an appeal to be taken from the judgment of conviction, should it stand, \"within 10 days after the entry of an order denying the [Rule 33 or Rule 34] motion.\"   Fed.R.App.P. 4(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Post-judgment motions apart from those expressly enumerated in Fed.R.App.P. 4(b) can have the same suspensory effect.   The paradigmatic example is a timely motion for rehearing or reconsideration.   See United States v.

To avoid this result, appellant must convince us that bringing the March 23 motion suspended the running of the appeal period by rendering the original judgment nonfinal for appeal purposes, or, put in its simplest aspect, extended the time within which an appeal from the underlying judgment could be taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.   Characterization.  Our first order of business is to determine the character of the March 23 motion.   The motion did not invoke, or even refer to, any particular procedural rule.   When a motion is silent as to the location of its procedural moorings, an inquiring court must look to the motion's substance, including the relief requested, in order properly to characterize it.   See, e.g., Dieter, 429 U.S. at 8-9, 97 S.Ct. at 19;  Hannon v. Maschner, 981 F.2d 1142, 1144 n. 2 (10th Cir.1992);  Feinstein v. Moses, 951 F.2d 16, 19 n. 3 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Lefler, 880 F.2d 233, 234 n. 2 (9th Cir.1989);  see also Perez-Perez v. Popular Leasing Rental, Inc., 993 F.2d 281, 283 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that a court should examine the function of an uncaptioned post-judgment motion in order to gauge its effect on the appeal period).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, appellant styled his motion as a motion \"to correct sentence.\"   Elevating substance over form, we conclude that the motion invokes, or is at least the functional equivalent of a motion brought pursuant to, Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c), quoted supra note 1.   The motion posits, in fairly blunt terms, that the district court made a numerical mistake in its aggregation of discerned drug quantities.   Whether or not one classifies this claimed bevue as \"arithmetical,\" the motion alleges, at a bare minimum, a strain of \"clear error.\"   This is the very sort of situation that Rule 35(c) was designed to address.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c) advisory committee's note (1991 amendment) (stating that the rule enables a court to rectify \"an obvious error or mistake\" affecting the sentence so long as the error or mistake is \"discovered shortly after the sentence is imposed\");  see also United States v.

Having identified the motion as a motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c), the lens of inquiry narrows.   We focus next on whether a motion brought pursuant to Rule 35(c) extends the time for appealing from the underlying judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We conclude that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled beyond peradventure that a timely motion for rehearing or reconsideration of a judgment in a criminal case interrupts the original appeal period.   See supra p. 867 (listing precedents).   This tenet applies in criminal cases notwithstanding that, by and large, there are \"no explicit provisions for rehearing proceedings in criminal cases.\"   16 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 3950, at 482 (Supp.1993).   Justice Harlan, writing for a unanimous Court, explained the rationale for giving such motions suspensory effect:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[Depriving parties to a criminal case] of the opportunity to petition a lower court for the correction of errors might, in some circumstances, actually prolong the process of litigation--since plenary consideration of a question of law [on appeal] ordinarily consumes more time than disposition of a petition for rehearing--and could, in some cases, impose an added and unnecessary burden of adjudication upon [the appellate court].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Healy, 376 U.S. at 80, 84 S.Ct. at 556.   The Healy doctrine is still good law, having survived the massive changes wrought by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.   See Carr, 932 F.2d at 71-72;  accord Corey, 999 F.2d at 495-96;  United States v. Greenwood, 974 F.2d 1449, 1470-71 (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2354, 124 L.Ed.2d 262 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It stands to reason that, if a sentence is infected by clear error, a timely motion seeking to correct it--at least a motion which, like this one, seeks to shrink the incarcerative portion of the sentence and, thus, carries the potential to affect substantive rights--fits the Healy mold.   Forcing a party to press ahead with an appeal while such a motion is pending would countervail the principles of efficacy and judicial economy that undergird Healy.   Consequently, we hold that when, as now, a party to a criminal case files a timely motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c), asking the sentencing court to reconsider an issue in the case in a way that will, if successful, bring about an alteration of the defendant's substantive rights, then the filing of that motion renders the judgment nonfinal for purposes of appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Accord Corey, 999 F.2d at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.   Timeliness.  Our speleology into this jurisdictional cave also uncovers a temporal dimension.   We have been careful to note, and believe it is prudent to emphasize, that only a timely motion for rehearing or reconsideration should be accorded suspensory effect.   See, e.g., Dieter, 429 U.S. at 8, 97 S.Ct. at 19 (limiting suspensory effect to \"timely petitions for rehearing\");  Healy, 376 U.S. at 77, 80, 84 S.Ct. at 554, 556 (same).   Timeliness is measured differently in different contexts.   In Carr, we were confronted with a motion for rehearing addressed to a district court's inherent power to correct an erroneous sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We accorded suspensory effect, holding the motion to be timely because it was brought \"within the time frame allowed for taking an appeal from the sentencing order.\"  Carr, 932 F.2d at 72.   Hence, the motion interrupted the running of the appeal period.  Id.;  accord Lefler, 880 F.2d at 235 (explaining that, \"for a criminal defendant's motion for reconsideration to extend the time within which a notice of appeal must be filed, it must be filed within the [original 10-day appeal period]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In precincts patrolled by Rule 35(c), however, the Carr formulation is overgenerous.   The drafters of the rule were concerned lest they pave further avenues of delay within the criminal justice system.   To assuage this concern, the rule states that a court may act thereunder \"within 7 days after the imposition of sentence.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c).   The interval constitutes a limitation, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c) advisory committee's note (1991 amendment) (discussing the new rule's \"stringent time requirement\")--and the limitation is absolute:  if no motion is made within the seven-day period, none can be made thereafter;  and, moreover, if a motion is timely made but is not decided within the seven-day period, the judge's power to act under the rule subsides and the pending motion is deemed to be denied as of that date.   Judge Easterbrook neatly captured the essence of the limitation:  \"The district court's inaction ha[s] the same effect as denying the motion, making the judgment final on the date the district judge's power to alter the sentence expired.\"  United States v. Turner, 998 F.2d 534, 536 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We derive two valuable lessons from the anatomy of the rule:  (1) a motion under Rule 35(c) interrupts the appeal period and renders a judgment nonfinal only if it is brought within seven days following the imposition of sentence;  and (2) the appeal period is restarted when the district court decides a timeous Rule 35(c) motion or at the expiration of seven days next following imposition of sentence, whichever first occurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.   Application.  In this case, the district court pronounced sentence on March 18 and entered judgment the next day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Appellant filed his Rule 35(c) motion on March 23, comfortably within the seven-day period.   The district court did not act immediately upon the motion and, consequently, the pendency of the motion rendered the judgment nonfinal only through the end of the seven-day period, when the appeal period restarted.   From that point forward, appellant had 10 days within which to docket his appeal.   See Fed.R.App.P. 4(b).   By filing a notice of appeal on April 1, 1993, he met the deadline with room to spare.   Hence, the appeal is properly before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Drug Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the guidelines, drug quantity is \"a key datum\" in the sentencing of narcotics offenders.  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.1990).   Because drug quantity profoundly affects sentence length, relatively small quantitative differences often have a significant leveraging effect.   The phenomenon grows more pronounced as amounts edge closer to the lines that have been drawn within the drug quantity table.   This case aptly illustrates the point.   The district court found that the heroin involved in the offenses of conviction weighed just over 20 grams.   The defense contends that the heroin weighed 19.75 grams.   This seemingly slight difference translates into an increment of two offense levels.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(13), (14) (Drug Quantity Table) (setting BOL of 18 for offenses involving at least 20 but less than 40 grams of heroin and setting BOL of 16 for offenses involving at least 10 but less than 20 grams of heroin).   A two-level spread easily can produce a difference of over a year in a standard sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts relating to the dispute over drug quantity can be succinctly summarized.   Defendant was charged with distributing heroin on three occasions:  February 7, 20, and 21, 1992.   Each transaction culminated in the exchange of a substantial number of \"browns,\" individually packaged for street-level sales.   Immediately following each transaction, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimated the weight of the purveyed drugs by representative sampling, that is, by weighing a few of the \"browns\" and multiplying the average weight by the total number of packs contained in the consignment.   On this basis, the DEA reported that the first transaction involved 6.51 grams of heroin, the second transaction involved 1.24 grams, and the final transaction involved 20.30 grams.   Appellant contested only the last of these three assessments.   Pursuant to the district court's order, the state toxicology laboratory studied the heroin involved in the third transaction, using its own formula, and estimated that it weighed between 10.39 and 16.21 grams.   Of necessity, however, this estimate did not include the weight of the heroin previously extracted from the third batch by the DEA, used in arriving at the DEA's drug quantity determination, and never replaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with these competing estimates, the judge found it probable that the third batch contained at least 12 grams.   This total, when augmented by the weight of the drugs from the first two transactions (6.51 and 1.24 grams, respectively) and the sample amount originally extracted from the third transaction (0.41 grams), brought the drug quantity over 20 grams and the BOL to 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has the burden of proving drug quantity by a fair preponderance of the evidence.   See United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir.1990).   Absent a mistake of law, we will set aside a sentencing court's determination of drug quantity only if it is clearly erroneous.   See United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1307 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. McCarthy, 961 F.2d 972, 978 (1st Cir.1992);  Bradley, 917 F.2d at 605.   In other words, as a precondition to relief on appeal, an appellant must convince us that the district court made \"a serious mistake\" in figuring drug quantity.  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 111.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error here.   When it is impossible or impractical to obtain an exact drug quantity for sentencing purposes, a reasoned estimate will suffice.   See Sklar, 920 F.2d at 113;  United States v. Hilton, 894 F.2d 485, 488 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v. Gerante, 891 F.2d 364, 369 (1st Cir.1989).   The court below achieved this benchmark, taking a conservative approach to the disputed third transaction.   Given the divergent laboratory estimates ranging from a low of 10.39 grams to a high of 20.3 grams, the court's decision that a figure toward the low end of the continuum represented the most probable weight cannot be faulted.   Cf., e.g., United States v. 22.80 Acres of Land, 839 F.2d 1362, 1365 (9th Cir.1988) (stressing district court's flexibility in determining value of property where testimony of six expert witnesses indicated wide range of values).   Where, as here, the evidence fully supports more than one inference, a sentencing court's choice from among plausible alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.   See Bradley, 917 F.2d at 606;  United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that appellant had accepted responsibility for his criminality and trimmed his offense level by two levels on that account, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a), but refused to grant an additional one-level credit under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Appellant assigns error to this refusal, eyeing a further reduction pursuant to section 3E1.1(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to decreases in the offense level, including downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility.   See, e.g., United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1993).   Once the sentencing court has ruled against him on such an issue, the defendant faces an uphill battle.   We have held, in the context of what is now section 3E1.1(a), that \"[w]hether a defendant 'clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility' is a fact-dominated issue, and the district court's decision to withhold a reduction in the offense level will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.1990) (citation omitted).   The clearly erroneous standard also guides appellate review of district court determinations under section 3E1.1(b).   See United States v. Donovan, 996 F.2d 1343, 1346 (1st Cir.1993);  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 comment.  (n. 5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no clear error in the district court's determination that appellant failed to qualify for the added discount under section 3E1.1(b)(2).   Appellant was arraigned on October 20, 1992.   He pleaded not guilty.   Several weeks later, in his November 30 motion for the appointment of an independent toxicologist, appellant indicated that he was \"prepared to plead guilty to the three charges ... but for the dispute as to the weight\" of the drugs.   In our view, notification of an intention to enter a guilty plea, subject to a major condition, is far too problematic to meet the standard of section 3E1.1(b)(2).   That provision was designed to allow the government and the district court to conserve resources by avoiding unnecessary trial preparation.   See, e.g., United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 572 (1st Cir.1993).   A conditional offer to plead does not serve this end;  until the contingency is removed, the prosecution must still prepare for trial and the court must still reserve calendar time.   Thus, the district judge did not err in refusing to treat the November 30 offer as a \"notification\" within the purview of section 3E1.1(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little more that need be said.   Appellant did not plead unconditionally until December 10, 1992--the very date that the court had set for jury selection.   A defendant who withholds a guilty plea until he stands poised on the brink of trial has no entitlement to the soothing unguent of section 3E1.1(b)(2).   Therefore, the court below acted appropriately in awarding appellant a two-level, rather than a three-level, decrease for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant claims that the district court erred in its determination of his role in the criminal activity.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c) (providing a two-level increase for assuming managerial responsibilities in certain criminal endeavors).   Boosting a defendant's BOL by two levels under this provision is justified if the sentencing court determines that the offense(s) of conviction involved at least two participants,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and that the defendant exercised control over one of them.   See United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217, 1220 (1st Cir.1990).   The government must bear the burden of proving that an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, it is undisputed that at least three people participated in the felonious enterprise:  appellant, his supplier (Faustino Moronta, Jr.), and a courier, Oscar Severino.   On at least one occasion, appellant paged Severino via beeper, and Severino responded to appellant's apartment with the merchandise--heroin apparently originating with Moronta.   The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) asserted that Severino worked for and under the direction of Morillo.   Appellant filed written objections to several aspects of the PSI Report, but he did not object to this determination.   At the sentencing hearing, appellant's attorney argued briefly that his client was only a middleman in the criminal transaction;  while conceding that Severino brought the drugs to the desired locus at appellant's behest, counsel claimed that Severino did so as Moronta's agent--and that Morillo exercised no independent control over him.   Yet, appellant offered no evidence to contradict the assertion contained in the PSI Report.   Not surprisingly, then, the district court accepted the probation officer's version of the chain of command.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Facts contained in a presentence report ordinarily are considered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.   See United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 35-36 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2039, 114 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991);  Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 508;  United States v. Rivera Ramos, 856 F.2d 420, 424 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 837, 110 S.Ct. 118, 107 L.Ed.2d 79 (1989);  see also United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.1992) (ruling that district courts possess \"broad discretion to determine what data is, or is not, sufficiently dependable to be used in imposing sentence\");  United States v. Iguaran-Palmar, 926 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1991) (similar).   We lack adequate reason to make an exception to that rule for appellant's sake.   A defendant who accepts the probation department's configuration of the sentencing record without contesting the facts set forth in the PSI Report can scarcely be heard to complain when the sentencing court uses those facts in making its findings.   See, e.g., United States v. Montoya, 967 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.)  (ruling that, where the defendant offered no information to suggest an inaccuracy in the PSI Report's drug quantity computation, the sentencing court could rely on the computation), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 507, 121 L.Ed.2d 442 (1992);  United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that the sentencing court lawfully relied on the PSI Report when appellant couched his objections exclusively as interpretations of facts rather than as challenges to the underlying facts themselves);  United States v. Mir, 919 F.2d 940, 943 (5th Cir.1990) (explaining that the district court is free to adopt facts contained in the PSI Report without further inquiry where defendant objects to the PSI Report but offers no rebuttal evidence);  Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 508 (holding that a sentencing court may rely on determinations contained in the PSI Report where defendant adduces no countervailing evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   Mindful that appellate review of role-in-the-offense determinations is conducted under a deferential \"clear error\" standard, see United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 615 (1st Cir.1993);  Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 227, we cannot fault the district court, in the absence of contrary evidence, for adopting the organizational structure suggested in the PSI Report and finding that Morillo, who was able to page Severino and have him deliver drugs on demand, exercised \"some degree of control or organizational authority\" over Severino.

But we do not read the rule as prohibiting either the government or the defendant from calling the need for corrective action to the sentencing court's attention by means of a timely filed post-judgment motion.   We believe that such motions are permissible and note that other courts have read the rule as authorizing them.   See, e.g., Corey, 999 F.2d at 494-96;  United States v.

This initial success heralds a hollow victory, however, for we find Morillo's substantive arguments unpersuasive and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A thumbnail sketch suffices to put this appeal into workable perspective.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In 1992, a federal grand jury indicted appellant on three counts of distributing heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (1988).   He entered a plea of not guilty.   The district court set the case for trial in December.   On November 30, appellant moved for the appointment of an independent toxicologist to weigh the drugs that the government planned to offer in evidence against him.   He made it clear that he was ready to plead guilty to the charges but for the dispute over drug quantity.   On December 10, 1992, without any agreement anent weight, appellant changed his plea and acknowledged his guilt on all counts.   Some two months later the district court granted appellant's longstanding motion and ordered the drugs reweighed at a state-run laboratory.   The laboratory reported its findings soon thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a sentencing hearing held on March 18, 1993, the district court determined that the heroin involved in the counts of conviction warranted a base offense level (BOL) of 18.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(13) (Drug Quantity Table).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The judge increased the BOL by two levels because of Morillo's aggravating role in the offense, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), and decreased the BOL by two levels for acceptance of responsibility, see id. &#167; 3E1.1(a).   When combined with appellant's criminal history category (III), the various adjustments produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 33-41 months.   The court sentenced appellant at the range's apex and entered final judgment on March 19, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, appellant filed a motion asking the court to correct his sentence because of an alleged miscalculation in figuring drug quantity.   On April 1, appellant filed a notice of appeal.   On April 19, the district court addressed appellant's post-judgment motion and denied it by means of a margin order.   Appellant did not file a further notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Suspensory Motions:  An Overview</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a criminal case, a defendant must appeal within 10 days after entry of a judgment of conviction.

However, in cases where the entry of a judgment is closely followed by the filing of a certain type of revisory motion, the time limit is relaxed.   For example, most timely motions for new trial, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, or timely motions in arrest of judgment, Fed.R.Crim.P. 34, stall the running of the appeal period and permit an appeal to be taken from the judgment of conviction, should it stand, \"within 10 days after the entry of an order denying the [Rule 33 or Rule 34] motion.\"   Fed.R.App.P. 4(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Post-judgment motions apart from those expressly enumerated in Fed.R.App.P. 4(b) can have the same suspensory effect.

To avoid this result, appellant must convince us that bringing the March 23 motion suspended the running of the appeal period by rendering the original judgment nonfinal for appeal purposes, or, put in its simplest aspect, extended the time within which an appeal from the underlying judgment could be taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.   Characterization.  Our first order of business is to determine the character of the March 23 motion.   The motion did not invoke, or even refer to, any particular procedural rule.   When a motion is silent as to the location of its procedural moorings, an inquiring court must look to the motion's substance, including the relief requested, in order properly to characterize it.   See, e.g., Dieter, 429 U.S. at 8-9, 97 S.Ct. at 19;  Hannon v.

The motion posits, in fairly blunt terms, that the district court made a numerical mistake in its aggregation of discerned drug quantities.   Whether or not one classifies this claimed bevue as \"arithmetical,\" the motion alleges, at a bare minimum, a strain of \"clear error.\"   This is the very sort of situation that Rule 35(c) was designed to address.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c) advisory committee's note (1991 amendment) (stating that the rule enables a court to rectify \"an obvious error or mistake\" affecting the sentence so long as the error or mistake is \"discovered shortly after the sentence is imposed\");  see also United States v.

Having identified the motion as a motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c), the lens of inquiry narrows.   We focus next on whether a motion brought pursuant to Rule 35(c) extends the time for appealing from the underlying judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We conclude that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled beyond peradventure that a timely motion for rehearing or reconsideration of a judgment in a criminal case interrupts the original appeal period.   See supra p. 867 (listing precedents).   This tenet applies in criminal cases notwithstanding that, by and large, there are \"no explicit provisions for rehearing proceedings in criminal cases.\"   16 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 3950, at 482 (Supp.1993).   Justice Harlan, writing for a unanimous Court, explained the rationale for giving such motions suspensory effect:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[Depriving parties to a criminal case] of the opportunity to petition a lower court for the correction of errors might, in some circumstances, actually prolong the process of litigation--since plenary consideration of a question of law [on appeal] ordinarily consumes more time than disposition of a petition for rehearing--and could, in some cases, impose an added and unnecessary burden of adjudication upon [the appellate court].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Healy, 376 U.S. at 80, 84 S.Ct. at 556.   The Healy doctrine is still good law, having survived the massive changes wrought by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.   See Carr, 932 F.2d at 71-72;  accord Corey, 999 F.2d at 495-96;  United States v. Greenwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590884\"><a href=\"/opinion/590884/united-states-of-america-cross-appellant-v-michael-merrill-greenwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1449</span></a></span>, 1470-71 (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Forcing a party to press ahead with an appeal while such a motion is pending would countervail the principles of efficacy and judicial economy that undergird Healy.   Consequently, we hold that when, as now, a party to a criminal case files a timely motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c), asking the sentencing court to reconsider an issue in the case in a way that will, if successful, bring about an alteration of the defendant's substantive rights, then the filing of that motion renders the judgment nonfinal for purposes of appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Accord Corey, 999 F.2d at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.   Timeliness.  Our speleology into this jurisdictional cave also uncovers a temporal dimension.   We have been careful to note, and believe it is prudent to emphasize, that only a timely motion for rehearing or reconsideration should be accorded suspensory effect.   See, e.g., Dieter, 429 U.S. at 8, 97 S.Ct. at 19 (limiting suspensory effect to \"timely petitions for rehearing\");  Healy, 376 U.S. at 77, 80, 84 S.Ct. at 554, 556 (same).   Timeliness is measured differently in different contexts.   In Carr, we were confronted with a motion for rehearing addressed to a district court's inherent power to correct an erroneous sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We accorded suspensory effect, holding the motion to be timely because it was brought \"within the time frame allowed for taking an appeal from the sentencing order.\"  Carr, 932 F.2d at 72.   Hence, the motion interrupted the running of the appeal period.  Id.;  accord Lefler, 880 F.2d at 235 (explaining that, \"for a criminal defendant's motion for reconsideration to extend the time within which a notice of appeal must be filed, it must be filed within the [original 10-day appeal period]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In precincts patrolled by Rule 35(c), however, the Carr formulation is overgenerous.   The drafters of the rule were concerned lest they pave further avenues of delay within the criminal justice system.   To assuage this concern, the rule states that a court may act thereunder \"within 7 days after the imposition of sentence.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c).   The interval constitutes a limitation, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c) advisory committee's note (1991 amendment) (discussing the new rule's \"stringent time requirement\")--and the limitation is absolute:  if no motion is made within the seven-day period, none can be made thereafter;  and, moreover, if a motion is timely made but is not decided within the seven-day period, the judge's power to act under the rule subsides and the pending motion is deemed to be denied as of that date.   Judge Easterbrook neatly captured the essence of the limitation:  \"The district court's inaction ha[s] the same effect as denying the motion, making the judgment final on the date the district judge's power to alter the sentence expired.\"  United States v.

Application.  In this case, the district court pronounced sentence on March 18 and entered judgment the next day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Appellant filed his Rule 35(c) motion on March 23, comfortably within the seven-day period.   The district court did not act immediately upon the motion and, consequently, the pendency of the motion rendered the judgment nonfinal only through the end of the seven-day period, when the appeal period restarted.   From that point forward, appellant had 10 days within which to docket his appeal.   See Fed.R.App.P. 4(b).   By filing a notice of appeal on April 1, 1993, he met the deadline with room to spare.   Hence, the appeal is properly before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Drug Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the guidelines, drug quantity is \"a key datum\" in the sentencing of narcotics offenders.  United States v. Bradley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 604 (1st Cir.1990).   Because drug quantity profoundly affects sentence length, relatively small quantitative differences often have a significant leveraging effect.   The phenomenon grows more pronounced as amounts edge closer to the lines that have been drawn within the drug quantity table.   This case aptly illustrates the point.   The district court found that the heroin involved in the offenses of conviction weighed just over 20 grams.   The defense contends that the heroin weighed 19.75 grams.   This seemingly slight difference translates into an increment of two offense levels.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(13), (14) (Drug Quantity Table) (setting BOL of 18 for offenses involving at least 20 but less than 40 grams of heroin and setting BOL of 16 for offenses involving at least 10 but less than 20 grams of heroin).   A two-level spread easily can produce a difference of over a year in a standard sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts relating to the dispute over drug quantity can be succinctly summarized.   Defendant was charged with distributing heroin on three occasions:  February 7, 20, and 21, 1992.   Each transaction culminated in the exchange of a substantial number of \"browns,\" individually packaged for street-level sales.   Immediately following each transaction, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimated the weight of the purveyed drugs by representative sampling, that is, by weighing a few of the \"browns\" and multiplying the average weight by the total number of packs contained in the consignment.   On this basis, the DEA reported that the first transaction involved 6.51 grams of heroin, the second transaction involved 1.24 grams, and the final transaction involved 20.30 grams.   Appellant contested only the last of these three assessments.   Pursuant to the district court's order, the state toxicology laboratory studied the heroin involved in the third transaction, using its own formula, and estimated that it weighed between 10.39 and 16.21 grams.   Of necessity, however, this estimate did not include the weight of the heroin previously extracted from the third batch by the DEA, used in arriving at the DEA's drug quantity determination, and never replaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with these competing estimates, the judge found it probable that the third batch contained at least 12 grams.   This total, when augmented by the weight of the drugs from the first two transactions (6.51 and 1.24 grams, respectively) and the sample amount originally extracted from the third transaction (0.41 grams), brought the drug quantity over 20 grams and the BOL to 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has the burden of proving drug quantity by a fair preponderance of the evidence.   See United States v. Sklar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.1990).   Absent a mistake of law, we will set aside a sentencing court's determination of drug quantity only if it is clearly erroneous.   See United States v. Argencourt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610550\"><a href=\"/opinion/610550/united-states-v-joseph-argencourt-aka-joe-black-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1300</span></a></span>, 1307 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v.

In other words, as a precondition to relief on appeal, an appellant must convince us that the district court made \"a serious mistake\" in figuring drug quantity.  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 111.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error here.   When it is impossible or impractical to obtain an exact drug quantity for sentencing purposes, a reasoned estimate will suffice.   See Sklar, 920 F.2d at 113;  United States v. Hilton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535580\"><a href=\"/opinion/535580/united-states-v-terry-wayne-hilton-aka-bill-raymond-pollard/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 488 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v.

The court below achieved this benchmark, taking a conservative approach to the disputed third transaction.   Given the divergent laboratory estimates ranging from a low of 10.39 grams to a high of 20.3 grams, the court's decision that a figure toward the low end of the continuum represented the most probable weight cannot be faulted.   Cf., e.g., United States v. 22.80 Acres of Land, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501878\"><a href=\"/opinion/501878/united-states-v-2280-acres-of-land-more-or-less-in-the-county-of-san/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1362</span></a></span>, 1365 (9th Cir.1988) (stressing district court's flexibility in determining value of property where testimony of six expert witnesses indicated wide range of values).   Where, as here, the evidence fully supports more than one inference, a sentencing court's choice from among plausible alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.   See Bradley, 917 F.2d at 606;  United States v. Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that appellant had accepted responsibility for his criminality and trimmed his offense level by two levels on that account, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a), but refused to grant an additional one-level credit under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Appellant assigns error to this refusal, eyeing a further reduction pursuant to section 3E1.1(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to decreases in the offense level, including downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility.   See, e.g., United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604815\"><a href=\"/opinion/604815/united-states-v-richard-ocasio-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1993).   Once the sentencing court has ruled against him on such an issue, the defendant faces an uphill battle.   We have held, in the context of what is now section 3E1.1(a), that \"[w]hether a defendant 'clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility' is a fact-dominated issue, and the district court's decision to withhold a reduction in the offense level will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\"  United States v.

The clearly erroneous standard also guides appellate review of district court determinations under section 3E1.1(b).   See United States v. Donovan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610557\"><a href=\"/opinion/610557/united-states-v-richard-j-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span>, 1346 (1st Cir.1993);  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 comment.  (n. 5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no clear error in the district court's determination that appellant failed to qualify for the added discount under section 3E1.1(b)(2).   Appellant was arraigned on October 20, 1992.   He pleaded not guilty.   Several weeks later, in his November 30 motion for the appointment of an independent toxicologist, appellant indicated that he was \"prepared to plead guilty to the three charges ... but for the dispute as to the weight\" of the drugs.   In our view, notification of an intention to enter a guilty plea, subject to a major condition, is far too problematic to meet the standard of section 3E1.1(b)(2).   That provision was designed to allow the government and the district court to conserve resources by avoiding unnecessary trial preparation.   See, e.g., United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.1993).   A conditional offer to plead does not serve this end;  until the contingency is removed, the prosecution must still prepare for trial and the court must still reserve calendar time.   Thus, the district judge did not err in refusing to treat the November 30 offer as a \"notification\" within the purview of section 3E1.1(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little more that need be said.   Appellant did not plead unconditionally until December 10, 1992--the very date that the court had set for jury selection.   A defendant who withholds a guilty plea until he stands poised on the brink of trial has no entitlement to the soothing unguent of section 3E1.1(b)(2).   Therefore, the court below acted appropriately in awarding appellant a two-level, rather than a three-level, decrease for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant claims that the district court erred in its determination of his role in the criminal activity.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c) (providing a two-level increase for assuming managerial responsibilities in certain criminal endeavors).   Boosting a defendant's BOL by two levels under this provision is justified if the sentencing court determines that the offense(s) of conviction involved at least two participants,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and that the defendant exercised control over one of them.   See United States v. Akitoye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 227 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v.

The government must bear the burden of proving that an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, it is undisputed that at least three people participated in the felonious enterprise:  appellant, his supplier (Faustino Moronta, Jr.), and a courier, Oscar Severino.   On at least one occasion, appellant paged Severino via beeper, and Severino responded to appellant's apartment with the merchandise--heroin apparently originating with Moronta.   The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) asserted that Severino worked for and under the direction of Morillo.   Appellant filed written objections to several aspects of the PSI Report, but he did not object to this determination.   At the sentencing hearing, appellant's attorney argued briefly that his client was only a middleman in the criminal transaction;  while conceding that Severino brought the drugs to the desired locus at appellant's behest, counsel claimed that Severino did so as Moronta's agent--and that Morillo exercised no independent control over him.   Yet, appellant offered no evidence to contradict the assertion contained in the PSI Report.   Not surprisingly, then, the district court accepted the probation officer's version of the chain of command.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Facts contained in a presentence report ordinarily are considered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.

It is the character of the post-judgment motion, not its intrinsic merit or lack thereof, that determines whether, if seasonably filed, it will interrupt the running of the appeal period</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The events in Carr antedated the adoption of Rule 35(c).   See Carr, 932 F.2d at 71 n. 5</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> For ease in reference we use March 19 as the dispositive date.   Withal, we note that Rule 35(c) purports to measure the seven-day period from \"the imposition of sentence.\"   We think it is likely that when the two dates differ, this phrase signifies the date judgment enters, rather than the date sentence is orally pronounced.   See Zuleta-Molina, 840 F.2d at 158 n. 1 (reiterating that \"[t]he prescribed period for filing a notice of appeal begins at the time of entry of the judgment or order on the criminal docket\");  United States v.

For instance, we have no occasion to consider (i) whether a different result might obtain if it could be shown that a movant brought a post-judgment motion in bad faith, see Ibarra, --- U.S. at ---- n. 3, 112 S.Ct. at 7 n. 3;  or (ii) whether a Rule 35(c) motion that seeks to correct an error but not to alter substantive rights possesses suspensory effect, cf.
