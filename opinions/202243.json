R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                         For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 05-2654\n\n                       UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                  Appellee,\n\n                                       v.\n\n                         HECTOR CASTRO-POLANCO,\n\n                          Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n      [Hon. Hector M. Laffitte, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Evelyn Canals-Lozada, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nNelson J. Perez-Sosa, United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n     Victor González-Bothwell, Assistant Federal Public Defender,\nand Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, on brief for\ndefendant, appellant.\n\n\n                                June 2, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam. Appellant Hector Castro-Polanco, a citizen of\n\nthe Dominican Republic, pled guilty (without a plea agreement) to\n\none count of re-entering the United States after removal subsequent\n\nto the commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(a)(2) and (b).   Because he was sentenced after the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),\n\nthe sentencing guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory.   In\n\ncalculating the guideline range, the sentencing court applied a 16-\n\nlevel increase to the base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. §\n\n2L1.2(b)(1)(A), and arrived at an imprisonment range of 46 to 57\n\nmonths.   Defense counsel requested a sentence below that range,\n\nbased on the defendant's mental impairment.     The court, treating\n\nthe guidelines as purely advisory, imposed a sentence of 46 months,\n\nfor which it gave a \"reasoned explanation.\"        United States v.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Counsel for appellant has filed a motion to withdraw and\n\na brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).\n\nAppellant has filed a supplemental pro se brief.    For the reasons\n\nstated below, and after a full examination of the record, we\n\nconclude that this appeal presents no non-frivolous issues.\n\n          I. Issue Raised in Anders Brief\n\n          The sole issue identified in the Anders brief as a\n\npotential appellate issue is the reasonableness of the sentence.\n\nSpecifically, that brief identifies the issue of whether the\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fdistrict court was unreasonable in failing to vary downwards from\n\nthe guidelines based on Castro-Polanco's alleged mental impairment.\n\nIn reviewing unreasonableness claims, this court emphasizes \"the\n\nprovision of a reasoned explanation, a plausible outcome and -\n\nwhere   these   criteria       are     met   -    some   deference     to     different\n\njudgments by the district judges on the scene. . . . Assuming a\n\nplausible explanation and a defensible overall result, sentencing\n\nis the responsibility of the district court.\"                  Jiménez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d    at   519.      Here,     the    sentencing       court   gave    a     reasoned\n\nexplanation both for imposing a sentence at the bottom of the\n\nguideline range, and for failing to vary below that range on the\n\nground of defendant's alleged mental impairment.\n\n             The district court expressly found that a variance from\n\nthe    guidelines     based    upon     \"impairment       of   capacity\"       was   not\n\nwarranted.          Underlying       that    determination       was    the     court's\n\nsupportable finding that defendant's mental impairment had not\n\nsubstantially contributed to his commission of the illegal re-entry\n\noffense.     The court also explained its sentence with reference to\n\nthe factors to be considered pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\nSpecifically, the court cited the need for the sentence imposed to\n\n\"reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the\n\nlaw, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\" id. § 3353\n\n(a)(2)(A), and \"to provide the defendant with needed . . . medical\n\ncare,   or   other    correctional          treatment    in    the   most     effective\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fmanner.\" Id. § 3553(a)(2)(D).         The court noted that defendant had\n\nbeen a \"habitual offender\" and had a \"proclivity for recidivism.\"\n\nIn explaining the sentence imposed, the court noted the need to\n\n\"appropriately address the issue of recidivism,\" and for defendant\n\nto be \"confined in a . . . structured environment,\" and provided\n\nwith   \"medical    and   psychiatric        care   and    other   correctional\n\ntreatment.\" Id.\n\n             We agree with appellant's counsel that there is no non-\n\nfrivolous argument that the sentence imposed was unreasonable.\n\n             II. Issues Raised in Pro Se Brief\n\n             Castro-Polanco challenges the          sentencing court's 16-\n\nlevel enhancement to his base offense level for prior conviction of\n\na   \"crime   of   violence\"   under    U.S.S.G.    §     2L1.2(b)(1)(A).   In\n\ndetermining that the conviction which preceded deportation (a\n\nMaryland state conviction for second-degree assault) constituted a\n\n\"crime of violence,\" the sentencing court did not appear to have\n\nexamined the elements of the Maryland statute of which defendant\n\nwas convicted.     Nor did it rely directly upon the court documents\n\nwhich it is permitted to consider under Taylor v. United States,\n\n495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990) and Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13,\n\n125 S. Ct. 1254, 1263 (2005).         Instead, the court appeared to have\n\nrelied upon the characterization of the Maryland conviction as a\n\n\"crime of violence\" contained in the presentence investigation\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\freport (PSR) and upon the PSR's factual description (based upon\n\n\"court documents\") of the underlying offense.\n\n            Castro-Polanco did not object at sentencing to the 16-\n\nlevel enhancement.       Therefore, at best, we review only for plain\n\nerror.     See United States v. Mastera, 435 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n2006). Castro-Polanco's challenge fails under the third and fourth\n\nprongs of the plain error test.              He has not met his burden of\n\nshowing either that the alleged error affected his substantial\n\nrights or seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.           Castro-Polanco did not object\n\nto the PSR's factual description of his Maryland offense. Nor does\n\nhe even argue in his pro se brief that the Maryland conviction was\n\nfor a non-violent offense.        The PSR states that the source of the\n\nfactual description is court documents.               Nothing in this record\n\nsuggests    that   the   nature   of   the   actual    offense   would   be   so\n\ndifferent from the PSR's description that it would not qualify as\n\na crime of violence for enhancement purposes.                 We conclude that\n\nthere is no non-frivolous argument that the sentencing court\n\ncommitted    plain   error   in   applying     a   16-level    enhancement    to\n\ncalculate the advisory guideline sentence in this case.1\n\n            Counsel's motion to withdraw is granted, and appellant's\n\nconviction and sentence are affirmed. See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n     1\n       The remaining issues raised in the pro se brief are clearly\nfrivolous.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f",
