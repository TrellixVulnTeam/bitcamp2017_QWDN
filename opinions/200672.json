James   Whitlock\n\n(“Whitlock”) appeals the District Court’s summary judgment for his\n\nemployer, Mac-Gray, Inc. (“Mac-Gray”), on his claims of workplace\n\ndiscrimination      and    hostile     and      abusive     work   environment    in\n\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”),\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213.         The District Court found that Whitlock\n\nhad failed to proffer evidence that he suffered an impairment that\n\nsubstantially restricted his ability to perform a whole range of\n\ncomparable jobs or that Mac-Gray regarded him as having such an\n\nimpairment, and concluded that he thus failed make out a prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination or harassment under the ADA.                        The\n\nDistrict Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and we\n\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.                    For the reasons\n\nstated below, we affirm.\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            Mac-Gray, a national provider of card- and coin-operated\n\nlaundry services in multiple-housing facilities, employed Whitlock\n\nin its Parts and Shipping Department from 1978 until July 2001.\n\nWhitlock    was     diagnosed    with      attention       deficit   hyperactivity\n\ndisorder (“ADHD”) in 1997, and was prescribed the drug Ritalin to\n\nhelp him concentrate and focus.                 To accommodate his impairment,\n\nMac-Gray    allowed    Whitlock      to    construct       partitions   around   his\n\nworkspace    and,    for   a   time,      to    use   an   AM/FM   radio   to   block\n\nbackground noise.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f            In November 1998 Mac-Gray reorganized its Parts and\n\nShipping Department and moved Whitlock from the first to the second\n\n(or mezzanine) floor of its warehouse.              This relocation required\n\ndismantling      of   Whitlock’s    partitions.         Mac-Gray     also   ordered\n\nremoval of Whitlock’s radio because of coworkers’ complaints.\n\n            In response to these changes, Whitlock took short-term\n\ndisability leave.       He returned to work on July 15, 1999.                 He was\n\npermitted to resume use of a radio and to install partitions around\n\nhis workspace.        On the recommendation of Whitlock’s doctor, Mac-\n\nGray also permitted him to work only four days a week with no\n\novertime.\n\n            Whitlock      filed   this    action   on   March   22,    2000.      He\n\ncontinued   to    work,    though   frequently      calling     in    sick,    until\n\nSeptember 29, 2000, when he left on a second short-term disability\n\nleave. On February 21, 2001, Whitlock’s doctor, Dr. Joseph McCabe,\n\nwrote a memorandum “to whom it may concern” stating that due to\n\nWhitlock’s psychiatric illness “he is presently totally disabled”\n\nand that he had “advised the patient not to attempt to return to\n\nemployment at Mac-Gray.” In July 2001 Whitlock left his employment\n\npermanently.\n\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            We review a summary judgment de novo, construing the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and\n\nresolving all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.                       See\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fFeliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort and Country Club,\n\n218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\n             Whitlock contends on appeal that he is disabled by reason\n\nof having been diagnosed with ADHD.              He argues that his ADHD\n\nsubstantially limits a major life activity, namely, his ability to\n\nwork. To function in the workplace, he argues, required that he be\n\naccommodated by being placed behind partitions that blocked visual\n\ndistractions and permitted use of a radio to block competing\n\nnoises.      On this evidence he contends a jury would decide that he\n\nwas disabled.\n\n             Whitlock’s    evidence    may   establish      that   he    has   an\n\nimpairment, but not that he is disabled for purposes of the ADA.\n\n“It is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability\n\nstatus . . . to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an\n\nimpairment.”      Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S.\n\n184,   198    (2002).      “‘[W]hen    the   major   life    activity     under\n\nconsideration      is     that   of   working,    the    statutory       phrase\n\n“substantially limits” requires . . . that plaintiffs allege that\n\nthey are unable to work in a broad class of jobs.’”                Id.   at 200\n\n(quoting Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 491\n\n(1999)); see also Santiago Clemente v. Executive Airlines, 213 F.3d\n\n25, 32 (1st Cir. 2000) (stating that “to be substantially limited\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fin the major life activity of working, [the plaintiff] must be\n\nprecluded from more than a particular job.”).1\n\n              Whitlock has offered no such evidence.        Indeed, Whitlock\n\nconcedes in his deposition that he was capable of performing his\n\nwork despite his ADHD and that Mac-Gray believed he could do his\n\njob.       He admitted that he taught himself to use Mac-Gray’s new\n\ncomputer system, that he “got pretty good at it,” and that Mac-Gray\n\n“placed great trust in his abilities.”\n\n              Whitlock’s other evidence does not suffice to raise a\n\ntriable issue that his impairment substantially restricts his\n\nability to perform a class or broad range of comparable jobs.              As\n\nnoted above, a diagnosis alone does not establish a disability\n\nwithin the meaning of the ADA.          See Toyota Motor, 534 U.S. at 198;\n\nCalef v. Gillette Co., 322 F.3d 75, 86 (1st Cir. 2003) (“Merely\n\npointing      to   a   diagnosis   of   ADHD   is   inadequate.”).   Nor   is\n\nDr. McCabe’s conclusory assertion of total disability–an assertion\n\nlacking elaboration and support in the record–sufficient to make\n\nthe individualized showing of Whitlock’s particular limitations\n\nrequired by Toyota.        See Gonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 74\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (holding “highly conclusory” physician testimony\n\nthat fails to document “precisely how [plaintiff’s] ability to work\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      We assume, without deciding, that working may constitute a\nmajor life activity for purposes of the ADA. See Carroll v. Xerox\nCorp., 294 F.3d 231, 239 n.7 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fhas   been    affected    by    her    impairments”    insufficient        to    prove\n\nexistence of disability under the ADA).\n\n             We    also   reject      Whitlock’s   claim     that   he    meets    the\n\ndefinition of “disabled” under 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) because his\n\nemployer regarded him as such.             To support such a claim Whitlock\n\nmust come forward with evidence that the employer perceived him as\n\n“precluded from more than a particular job.”                  See Murphy v. UPS,\n\n527 U.S. 516, 523-25 (1999).           Whitlock offers no such evidence.            He\n\ncites only the “continuing dialogue” between Mac-Gray and his\n\nphysician regarding his impairment, and the fact that the company\n\nagreed   to       Whitlock’s    requested       accommodations.          The    record\n\ndemonstrates       without     dispute,    however,   that    Mac-Gray         regarded\n\nWhitlock as capable of performing his job.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n              For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the\n\nDistrict Court.\n\n              AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f",

The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mac-Gray, a national provider of card-and coin-operated laundry services in multiple-housing facilities, employed Whitlock in its Parts and Shipping Department from 1978 until July 2001. Whitlock was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\"ADHD\") in 1997, and was prescribed the drug Ritalin to help him concentrate and focus. To accommodate his impairment, Mac-Gray allowed Whitlock to construct partitions around his workspace and, for a time, to use an AM/FM radio to block background noise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1998 Mac-Gray reorganized its Parts and Shipping Department and moved Whitlock from the first to the second (or mezzanine) floor of its warehouse. This relocation required dismantling of Whitlock's partitions. Mac-Gray also ordered removal of Whitlock's radio because of coworkers' complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to these changes, Whitlock took short-term disability leave. He returned to work on July 15, 1999. He was permitted to resume use of a radio and to install partitions around his workspace. On the recommendation of Whitlock's doctor, Mac-Gray also permitted him to work only four days a week with no overtime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitlock filed this action on March 22, 2000. He continued to work, though frequently calling in sick, until September 29, 2000, when he left on a second short-term disability leave. On February 21, 2001, Whitlock's doctor, Dr. Joseph McCabe, wrote a memorandum \"to whom it may concern\" stating that due to Whitlock's psychiatric illness \"he is presently totally disabled\" and that he had \"advised the patient not to attempt to return to employment at Mac-Gray.\" In July 2001 Whitlock left his employment permanently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See Feliciano de la Cruz v.

He argues that his ADHD substantially limits a major life activity, namely, his ability to work. To function in the workplace, he argues, required that he be accommodated by being placed behind partitions that blocked visual distractions and permitted use of a radio to block competing noises. On this evidence he contends a jury would decide that he was disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitlock's evidence may establish that he has an impairment, but not that he is disabled for purposes of the ADA. \"It is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability status ... to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.\" <i>Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v.

Indeed, Whitlock concedes in his deposition that he was capable of performing his work despite his ADHD and that MacGray believed he could do his job. He admitted that he taught himself to use Mac-Gray's new computer system, that he \"got pretty good at it,\" and that Mac-Gray \"placed great trust in his abilities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitlock's other evidence does not suffice to raise a triable issue that his impairment substantially restricts his ability to perform a class or broad range of comparable jobs. As noted above, a diagnosis alone does not establish a disability within the meaning of the ADA. <i>See Toyota Motor,</i> 534 U.S. at 198, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nor is Dr. McCabe's conclusory assertion of total disability-an assertion lacking elaboration and support in the record-sufficient to make the individualized showing of Whitlock's particular limitations required by <i>Toyota.

To support such a claim Whitlock must come forward with evidence that the employer perceived him as \"precluded from more than a particular job.\" <i>See Murphy v.

He cites only the \"continuing dialogue\" between Mac-Gray and his physician regarding his impairment, and the fact that the company agreed to Whitlock's requested accommodations. The record demonstrates without dispute, however, that Mac-Gray regarded Whitlock as capable of performing his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We assume, without deciding, that working may constitute a major life activity for purposes of the ADA<i>See Carroll v.
