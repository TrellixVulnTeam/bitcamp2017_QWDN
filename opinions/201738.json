The   petitioner      presents   a\n\nsympathetic case.          Olgert Topalli, a 24-year-old Albanian man, was\n\narrested and beaten multiple times for his participation in anti-\n\ngovernment rallies.           He escaped Albania with his sister after\n\ncriminals attempted to kidnap her and force her into prostitution.\n\nIn the end, the strict standard of review under which we operate\n\nand the clear language of the immigration statutes compel us to\n\ndeny the relief sought: reversal of the agency's1 decision not to\n\ngrant      asylum,   withholding     of    removal,         or   relief   under   the\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).               We deny the petition.\n\n                                          I.\n\n              Because the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), though\n\nnot the Immigration Judge (IJ), found Topalli credible, we recount\n\nthe facts as Topalli rendered them.\n\n              Topalli and his family were from Korce, Albania. In 1999\n\nhe joined the Albanian Democratic Party (ADP) (the opposition party\n\nto   the    Socialist      government)     as   a    full    member     after   having\n\nparticipated in the party's youth forum for the previous four\n\nyears.      As a member of the ADP, Topalli was arrested and detained\n\nby the police seven times between 1999 and 2001.                       Four of those\n\narrests      were    for    Topalli's     participation          in   anti-government\n\n\n\n1\n   Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the United\nStates on February 3, 2005.     We have substituted him for John\nAshcroft, previous holder of that office, as the respondent. See\nFed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\n                                          -2-\n\frallies, which were illegal because the demonstrators did not\n\nobtain a permit.    The three other times, Topalli was \"arrested on\n\nthe streets for no reason . . . because [the police] would remember\n\n[him].\"     None of the periods of detention lasted more than 24\n\nhours.    The police did not have the right to detain anyone without\n\npressing charges for more than 24 hours.         Topalli also explained\n\nthat at his last rally (and possibly others) he fought with the\n\npolice and confronted them, and so the police may have arrested him\n\nbecause he was fighting them.\n\n            Topalli said that each time he was arrested, the police\n\nbeat him.    He did not claim that the beatings ever resulted in\n\ninjuries requiring medical attention.         He also gave few details\n\nabout these encounters with the police except for the first and\n\nlast times he was arrested.     The first time he was arrested was in\n\n1999, when he participated in his first rally.            That detention\n\nlasted 12 hours, and two or three policemen beat Topalli on the\n\nchest and the back with rubber sticks, swearing at him.           The last\n\ntime he was arrested was in March 2001, when he participated in his\n\nlast   rally.    This   time   the   police   told   Topalli   that   if   he\n\n\"continued to participate, they would imprison [him].\"            After he\n\nwas released, Topalli lived for four months with his aunt in a\n\nvillage about two hours' drive away from Korce.          He then returned\n\nto live with his parents in Korce for several years and ceased to\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fparticipate in ADP events, and he did not have any more problems\n\nwith the police.\n\n           Topalli's older sister Alkada was raped in October 2002\n\nby several men.       Topalli's father went to the police station to\n\nfile a report, but nothing was done by the police because Alkada\n\ncould not identify her attackers. There was no indication this was\n\nconnected with Topalli's political activities.\n\n           Topalli's family won a visa lottery in 2003 for entry\n\ninto the United States.       His whole family in Albania, save he and\n\nhis older sister Alkada and her daughter, emigrated to the United\n\nStates. Topalli and Alkada stayed behind because they were over 21\n\nand not eligible for the visas.\n\n           On February 4, 2004, Topalli saw four men trying to\n\nkidnap his sister and push her into a car as she returned from\n\nwork.   He fought with the men and managed to help Alkada escape,\n\nbut was rendered unconscious in the struggle.          The men took him to\n\nan unknown place, and when he woke up, they threatened him with a\n\ngun and told him not to go to the police or file charges or they\n\nwould kill Topalli and his sister.        They also explained that they\n\nhad   intended   to    kidnap   Alkada    and   ship   her   to     Italy   for\n\nprostitution.    Topalli did not recognize the men, and there was no\n\nindication   that     this   incident    was    connected    with    Topalli's\n\nactivities in the ADP.       He did not report the event to the police.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f               After this incident, Topalli decided to leave Albania\n\nwith his sister and join the rest of his family in the United\n\nStates. He and his sister obtained two false Italian passports for\n\n$10,000.       Using the fake passports, Topalli, Alkada, and Alkada's\n\ndaughter left Albania on March 11, 2004, and attempted to enter the\n\nUnited    States    at    San   Juan,   Puerto   Rico,      on    March   22,   2004.\n\nImmigration officials refused him admission upon discovering that\n\nthe passports were false and detained him, and Topalli claimed fear\n\nof persecution if returned to Albania.              He was then referred to an\n\nIJ for asylum-only proceedings.2\n\n               After a merits hearing on June 17, 2004, the IJ found\n\nTopalli to be not credible and denied his application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n               Topalli appealed the IJ's denial to the BIA.               On October\n\n8, 2004, the BIA dismissed Topalli's appeal.                     The BIA disagreed\n\nwith     the     IJ's    adverse    credibility       finding,       finding         the\n\ninconsistencies         and   omissions    relied    upon    by    the    IJ    to    be\n\ninconsequential. It nonetheless affirmed the IJ's denial of relief\n\nbecause it found that the maltreatment suffered by Topalli did not\n\namount to past persecution, and that Topalli failed to show past\n\npersecution or reasonable likelihood of future persecution:\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The record does not reveal what happened to Alkada and her\ndaughter.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f          While [Topalli] was arrested and physically\n          mistreated a number of times due to his\n           participation in illegal demonstrations, his\n          detentions were short, never lasting more than\n          24 hours, and he apparently did not receive\n          injuries requiring medical attention.       He\n          admitted that, when he stopped participating\n          in these demonstrations, the arrests ceased.\n\nThe BIA also concluded that Topalli's \"primary reason for fleeing\n\nAlbania was to protect his sister from further criminal attacks and\n\nattempts to force her into prostitution,\" which the BIA implicitly\n\nconcluded not to be past persecution on account of one of the\n\nprotected statutory grounds under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\n          Topalli timely petitioned this court for review of the\n\nBIA's order dismissing his appeal.3   Topalli's primary argument is\n\nthat the BIA erred in determining that the treatment afforded to\n\nhim did not constitute past persecution.     Because we find that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA's finding that Topalli's\n\ntreatment was not past persecution on account of one of the\n\n\n3\n   Topalli's challenge is to the BIA's dismissal of his appeal as\na whole, but he offers no arguments with respect to his claims for\nwithholding of removal or protection under the CAT.         He has\ntherefore waived any challenge to the BIA's denial of these claims.\nSee Qin v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 302, 305 n.5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                               -6-\n\fprotected grounds, other arguments for relief by Topalli also\n\nfail.4\n\n                                       II.\n\n            An asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he\n\nor she is \"unable or unwilling to return to [the applicant's\n\ncountry of nationality] . . . because of persecution or a well-\n\nfounded   fear      of   persecution    on   account     of    race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"    8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A); see 8 C.F.R. ยง 1208.13(a).\n\nApplicants    may    meet   this   burden    in    one   of   two   ways:   1)   by\n\ndemonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one\n\nof the statutory grounds, or 2) by establishing past persecution on\n\naccount of one of the statutory grounds so as to be entitled to a\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.                   Mihaylov v.\n\nAshcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2004); 8 C.F.R. ยง 1208.13(b).\n\nTopalli   argues     that   he   has   met   the   burden     for   showing   past\n\npersecution.\n\n            We review the BIA's determination that Topalli failed to\n\nshow past persecution under the deferential substantial evidence\n\nstandard.    Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).                Under\n\n\n4\n  Topalli also argues that 1) the severity of his past persecution\nqualifies him for a discretionary grant of asylum under 8 C.F.R.\n208.13(b)(1)(iii); and 2) because he suffered past persecution, we\nshould remand the case to the BIA and the IJ to determine whether\nhis fear of future persecution is well-founded.      Both of these\narguments require a threshold finding that the BIA erred in finding\nthat Topalli did not suffer past persecution.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthat deferential standard, we must uphold the BIA's resolution \"so\n\nlong as its decision is supported by substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord.\"       Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st\n\nCir.    2005).       The   BIA's   determination     must    stand   \"unless   any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\" 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(B); see Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398\n\nF.3d at 123.\n\nThe Arrests and Beatings\n\n               Topalli first argues that a finding of past persecution\n\nis compelled by the seven times when he was arrested, detained, and\n\nbeaten.\n\n               Because there is no statutory definition of \"persecution\"\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A), \"it is in the first instance the\n\nprerogative of the Attorney General, acting through the BIA, to\n\ngive content to it.\"          Bocova v. Gonzales, __ F.3d __, 2005 WL\n\n1491490, at *3 (1st Cir. June 24, 2005).                    Due to the infinite\n\nvariety of factual circumstances the BIA is likely to face, the BIA\n\nhas preferred to decide what amounts to past persecution on a case-\n\nby-case basis, instead of announcing rigid rules embodying some\n\nprecise calculus of maltreatment and suffering.                See id.\n\n               The question of whether Topalli suffered past persecution\n\non account of his political beliefs here is a close one.                  But we\n\nare    bound    by   our   standard   of   review,   and     without   minimizing\n\nTopalli's beatings at the hands of the police, the record does not\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fcompel a reasonable fact finder to say that he suffered past\n\npersecution.\n\n            The record reveals that the detentions never exceeded 24\n\nhours (and sometimes lasted for much less time).           The police only\n\nonce threatened Topalli with imprisonment if he continued with his\n\n(sometimes illegal) political activities, and Topalli himself was\n\nconfident that the police did not have the power to incarcerate him\n\nfor more than 24 hours without formal charges.         Topalli did not\n\ngive a great deal of detail concerning the duration or severity of\n\nthe beatings,5 but it is relevant that Topalli did not claim to\n\nneed medical attention from the beatings. Topalli conceded that at\n\nleast some of the arrests might have been due to his fighting with\n\nthe police at the illegal rallies, rather than the result of police\n\nsingling him out in a pattern of targeted political harassment.\n\nBesides the three times when he was arrested walking down the\n\nstreet, there were no other incidents of police surveillance,\n\ntargeted harassment, or threats against him. Moreover, Topalli was\n\nable to live in relative peace in Albania, free from police\n\nharassment, for almost three years after his last arrest.                 We\n\ncannot say that we are compelled to conclude that Topalli was\n\nsubjected   to   systematic   maltreatment   rising   to    the   level   of\n\n\n\n5\n   It is Topalli's burden to provide us with specifics of the\ncircumstances of his maltreatment, which only he has knowledge of,\nin order to compel us to find for him. See Dandan v. Ashcroft, 339\nF.3d 567, 574 (7th Cir. 2003).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fpersecution, as opposed to a series of isolated incidents.                    See\n\nBocova, 2005 WL 1491490, at *4.\n\n             In addition, circuit courts, including this one, have\n\naffirmed     on   comparable     facts    the    BIA's    determination    that   a\n\npetitioner's maltreatment did not rise to the level of persecution\n\nnecessary for asylum eligibility.                See, e.g., Bocova, 2005 WL\n\n1491490, at *1, *4 (finding no persecution where petitioner was\n\narrested, beaten, and threatened with death twice over an eight-\n\nyear span, and one beating caused petitioner to lose consciousness\n\nand to be taken to hospital); Dandan v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 567,\n\n573-74 (7th Cir. 2003) (finding no persecution where petitioner was\n\ndetained for three days, denied food, and beaten until face was\n\nswollen); Nelson, 232 F.3d at 264 (finding no persecution where\n\npetitioner was placed in solitary confinement three times, each\n\ntime lasting less than 72 hours and involving physical abuse, and\n\npetitioner was periodically surveyed, threatened, and stopped and\n\nsearched).\n\n             Topalli suggests that the BIA impermissibly made the\n\npresence or absence of injury requiring medical attention into a\n\nsort of \"acid test\" for persecution, contrary to Begzatowski v.\n\nINS,   278   F.3d   665,   670    (7th    Cir.    2002)    (BIA   cannot   require\n\napplicants for asylum to prove serious or permanent injury as the\n\nsine qua non of persecution).            That is not a fair reading of what\n\nthe BIA did.      The BIA took into account, as do we, the absence of\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fthe need for medical attention after the beatings as but one factor\n\nin the analysis.    The BIA is certainly allowed to take into account\n\nthe    severity,   duration,      and    frequency      of   physical   abuse    to\n\ndetermine     whether     the   abuse    extends       beyond   \"unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering\" to rise to the level of\n\npersecution. Nelson, 232 F.3d at 263-64; see also Dandan, 339 F.3d\n\nat    573   (frequency    of    beatings,      while   not   dispositive,   is   a\n\nsignificant factor in determining past persecution).\n\nThe Attempted Kidnaping\n\n             Topalli also argues that the criminal attempt to kidnap\n\nhis sister for prostitution and the subsequent beating he suffered\n\nconstitute persecution because the government is unwilling or\n\nunable to control the criminals.            This argument is misplaced.\n\n             Even if we assume that Topalli is correct that the police\n\nare so corrupt that they \"collude with traffickers in attempts to\n\nexport girls abroad for monetary gain,\" Topalli has not alleged any\n\ntheory for how such criminal activities are directed at him \"on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"               8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A)\n\n(emphasis added).        There is no evidence that the attempt to kidnap\n\nAlkada was because of either Alkada's or Topalli's political\n\nactivities.     The record indicates that the assault on Topalli and\n\nhis sister was a random act of criminal violence, not persecution\n\non account of one of the statutory grounds.               See Ravindran v. INS,\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f976   F.2d   754,   759   (1st   Cir.   1992)   (\"Generally,   evidence   of\n\nwidespread violence and human rights violations affecting all\n\ncitizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\").              We also\n\nagree that the evidence does not support Topalli's claim that he\n\nwould be persecuted in the future.\n\n                                    III.\n\n             The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f",

In 1999 he joined the Albanian Democratic Party (ADP) (the opposition party to the Socialist government) as a full member after having participated in the party's youth forum for the previous four years. As a member of the ADP, Topalli was arrested and detained by the police seven times between 1999 and 2001. Four of those arrests were for Topalli's participation in anti-government rallies, which were illegal because the demonstrators did not obtain a permit. The three other times, Topalli was \"arrested on the streets for no reason . . . because [the police] would remember [him].\" None of the periods of detention lasted more than 24 hours. The police did not have the right to detain anyone without pressing charges for more than 24 hours. Topalli also explained that at his last rally (and possibly others) he fought with the police and confronted them, and so the police may have arrested him because he was fighting them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalli said that each time he was arrested, the police beat him.

He also gave few details about these encounters with the police except for the first and last times he was arrested. The first time he was arrested was in 1999, when he participated in his first rally. That detention lasted 12 hours, and two or three policemen beat Topalli on the chest and the back with rubber sticks, swearing at him. The last time he was arrested was in March 2001, when he participated in his last rally. This time the police told Topalli that if he \"continued to participate, they would imprison [him].\" After he was released, Topalli lived for four months with his aunt in a village about two hours' drive away from Korce. He then returned to live with his parents in Korce for several years and ceased to participate in ADP events, and he did not have any more problems with the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalli's older sister Alkada was raped in October 2002 by several men.

He fought with the men and managed to help Alkada escape, but was rendered unconscious in the struggle. The men took him to an unknown place, and when he woke up, they threatened him with a gun and told him not to go to the police or file charges or they would kill Topalli and his sister. They also explained that they had intended to kidnap Alkada and ship her to Italy for prostitution. Topalli did not recognize the men, and there was no indication that this incident was connected with Topalli's activities in the ADP.

He and his sister obtained two false Italian passports for $10,000. Using the fake passports, Topalli, Alkada, and Alkada's daughter left Albania on March 11, 2004, and attempted to enter the United States at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on March 22, 2004. Immigration officials refused him admission upon discovering that the passports were false and detained him, and Topalli claimed fear of persecution if returned to Albania.

The BIA disagreed with the IJ's adverse credibility finding, finding the inconsistencies and omissions relied upon by the IJ to be inconsequential. It nonetheless affirmed the IJ's denial of relief because it found that the maltreatment suffered by Topalli did not amount to past persecution, and that Topalli failed to show past persecution or reasonable likelihood of future persecution:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While [Topalli] was arrested and physically mistreated a number of times due to his participation in illegal demonstrations, his detentions were short, never lasting more than 24 hours, and he apparently did not receive injuries requiring medical attention.

Under that deferential standard, we must uphold the BIA's resolution \"so long as its decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\" <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir.2005). The BIA's determination must stand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>see Rodriguez-Ramirez,</i> 398 F.3d at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The Arrests and Beatings</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalli first argues that a finding of past persecution is compelled by the seven times when he was arrested, detained, and beaten.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there is no statutory definition of \"persecution\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A), \"it is in the first instance the prerogative of the Attorney General, acting through the BIA, to give content to it.\" <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir.2005). Due to the infinite variety of factual circumstances the BIA is likely to face, the BIA has preferred to decide what amounts to past persecution on a case-by-case basis, instead of announcing rigid rules embodying some precise calculus of maltreatment and suffering. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether Topalli suffered past persecution on account of his political beliefs here is a close one. But we are bound by our standard of review, and without minimizing Topalli's beatings at the hands of the police, the record does not compel a reasonable fact finder to say that he suffered past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals that the detentions never exceeded 24 hours (and sometimes lasted for much less time). The police only once threatened Topalli with imprisonment if he continued with his (sometimes illegal) political activities, and Topalli himself was confident that the police did not have the power to incarcerate him for more than 24 hours without formal charges. Topalli did not give a great deal of detail concerning the duration or severity of the beatings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but it is relevant that Topalli did not claim to need medical attention from the beatings. Topalli conceded that at least some of the arrests might have been due to his fighting with the police at the illegal rallies, rather than the result of police singling him out in a pattern of targeted political harassment. Besides the three times when he was arrested walking down the street, there were no other incidents of police surveillance, targeted harassment, or threats against him. Moreover, Topalli was able to live in relative peace in Albania, free from police harassment, for almost three years after his last arrest. We cannot say that we are compelled to conclude that Topalli was subjected to systematic maltreatment rising to the level of persecution, as opposed to a series of isolated incidents. <i>See Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 263.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, circuit courts, including this one, have affirmed on comparable facts the BIA's determination that a petitioner's maltreatment did not rise to the level of persecution necessary for asylum eligibility. <i>See, e.g., Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 263 (finding no persecution where petitioner was arrested, beaten, and threatened with death twice over an eight-year span, and one beating caused petitioner to lose consciousness and to be taken to hospital); <i>Dandan v. Ashcroft,</i> 339 F.3d 567, 573-74 (7th Cir.2003) (finding no persecution where petitioner was detained for three days, denied food, and beaten until face was swollen); <i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 264 (finding no persecution where petitioner was placed in solitary confinement three times, each time lasting less than 72 hours and involving physical abuse, and petitioner was periodically surveyed, threatened, and stopped and searched).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalli suggests that the BIA impermissibly made the presence or absence of injury requiring medical attention into a sort of \"acid test\" for persecution, contrary to <i>Begzatowski v. INS,</i> 278 F.3d 665, 670 (7th Cir.2002) (BIA cannot require applicants for asylum to prove serious or permanent injury as the sine qua non of persecution). That is not a fair reading of what the BIA did. The BIA took into account, as do we, the absence of the need for medical attention after the beatings as but one factor in the analysis. The BIA is certainly allowed to take into account the severity, duration, and frequency of physical abuse to determine whether the abuse extends beyond \"unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering\" to rise to the level of persecution. <i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 263-64; <i>see also Dandan,</i> 339 F.3d at 573 (frequency of beatings, while not dispositive, is a significant factor in determining past persecution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The Attempted Kidnaping</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalli also argues that the criminal attempt to kidnap his sister for prostitution and the subsequent beating he suffered constitute persecution because the government is unwilling or unable to control the criminals. This argument is misplaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that Topalli is correct that the police are so corrupt that they \"collude with traffickers in attempts to export girls abroad for monetary gain,\" Topalli has not alleged any theory for how such criminal activities are directed at him \"<i>on account of</i> race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). There is no evidence that the attempt to kidnap Alkada was because of either Alkada's or Topalli's political activities. The record indicates that the assault on Topalli and his sister was a random act of criminal violence, not persecution on account of one of the statutory grounds. <i>See Ravindran v. INS,</i> 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Generally, evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\").

The BIA's determination must stand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>see Rodriguez-Ramirez,</i> 398 F.3d at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The Arrests and Beatings</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalli first argues that a finding of past persecution is compelled by the seven times when he was arrested, detained, and beaten.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there is no statutory definition of \"persecution\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A), \"it is in the first instance the prerogative of the Attorney General, acting through the BIA, to give content to it.\" <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 262 (1st Cir.2005). Due to the infinite variety of factual circumstances the BIA is likely to face, the BIA has preferred to decide what amounts to past persecution on a case-by-case basis, instead of announcing rigid rules embodying some precise calculus of maltreatment and suffering. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether Topalli suffered past persecution on account of his political beliefs here is a close one. But we are bound by our standard of review, and without minimizing Topalli's beatings at the hands of the police, the record does not compel a reasonable fact finder to say that he suffered past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals that the detentions never exceeded 24 hours (and sometimes lasted for much less time). The police only once threatened Topalli with imprisonment if he continued with his (sometimes illegal) political activities, and Topalli himself was confident that the police did not have the power to incarcerate him for more than 24 hours without formal charges. Topalli did not give a great deal of detail concerning the duration or severity of the beatings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but it is relevant that Topalli did not claim to need medical attention from the beatings. Topalli conceded that at least some of the arrests might have been due to his fighting with the police at the illegal rallies, rather than the result of police singling him out in a pattern of targeted political harassment. Besides the three times when he was arrested walking down the street, there were no other incidents of police surveillance, targeted harassment, or threats against him. Moreover, Topalli was able to live in relative peace in Albania, free from police harassment, for almost three years after his last arrest. We cannot say that we are compelled to conclude that Topalli was subjected to systematic maltreatment rising to the level of persecution, as opposed to a series of isolated incidents. <i>See Bocova,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, circuit courts, including this one, have affirmed on comparable facts the BIA's determination that a petitioner's maltreatment did not rise to the level of persecution necessary for asylum eligibility. <i>See, e.g., Bocova,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263 (finding no persecution where petitioner was arrested, beaten, and threatened with death twice over an eight-year span, and one beating caused petitioner to lose consciousness and to be taken to hospital); <i>Dandan v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783080\"><a href=\"/opinion/783080/nabil-raja-dandan-ketty-dandan-souzi-dandan-aka-souzy-dandan-sandra/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 573-74 (7th Cir.2003) (finding no persecution where petitioner was detained for three days, denied food, and beaten until face was swollen); <i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 264 (finding no persecution where petitioner was placed in solitary confinement three times, each time lasting less than 72 hours and involving physical abuse, and petitioner was periodically surveyed, threatened, and stopped and searched).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalli suggests that the BIA impermissibly made the presence or absence of injury requiring medical attention into a sort of \"acid test\" for persecution, contrary to <i>Begzatowski v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776332\"><a href=\"/opinion/776332/bajram-begzatowski-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span>, 670 (7th Cir.2002) (BIA cannot require applicants for asylum to prove serious or permanent injury as the sine qua non of persecution). That is not a fair reading of what the BIA did. The BIA took into account, as do we, the absence of the need for medical attention after the beatings as but one factor in the analysis. The BIA is certainly allowed to take into account the severity, duration, and frequency of physical abuse to determine whether the abuse extends beyond \"unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering\" to rise to the level of persecution. <i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 263-64; <i>see also Dandan,</i> 339 F.3d at 573 (frequency of beatings, while not dispositive, is a significant factor in determining past persecution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The Attempted Kidnaping</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topalli also argues that the criminal attempt to kidnap his sister for prostitution and the subsequent beating he suffered constitute persecution because the government is unwilling or unable to control the criminals. This argument is misplaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that Topalli is correct that the police are so corrupt that they \"collude with traffickers in attempts to export girls abroad for monetary gain,\" Topalli has not alleged any theory for how such criminal activities are directed at him \"<i>on account of</i> race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). There is no evidence that the attempt to kidnap Alkada was because of either Alkada's or Topalli's political activities. The record indicates that the assault on Topalli and his sister was a random act of criminal violence, not persecution on account of one of the statutory grounds. <i>See Ravindran v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 759 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Generally, evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\"). We also agree that the evidence does not support Topalli's claim that he would be persecuted in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the United States on February 3, 2005.
