After losing his job as a bus\n\ndriver for Laidlaw, Inc. (\"Laidlaw\"), Eugene Emmanuel filed a\n\ngrievance      with    his   union,       the     International        Brotherhood      of\n\nTeamsters,     Local    Union    No.       25    (\"Union\"),      claiming      that    his\n\ntermination violated the Union's collective bargaining agreement\n\n(\"CBA\").     The Union unsuccessfully pursued Emmanuel's grievance\n\nthrough arbitration.         Dissatisfied with the outcome, Emmanuel sued\n\nthe   Union,    claiming     that     it    had    violated      its    duty    of    fair\n\nrepresentation during the arbitration.                The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for the Union.                 Emmanuel appeals that ruling and\n\nalso challenges the district court's denial of his motion for\n\nreconsideration.       We affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n\n            In 1999, Emmanuel began work for Laidlaw as a school bus\n\ndriver in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.                On June 14, 2000, Laidlaw\n\nasked Emmanuel to drive a bus from its West Roxbury facility to a\n\nfacility in a neighboring town.                  Emmanuel claims that, when he\n\nentered the bus, he could not find the pre-trip inspection log but\n\nrecorded his safety observations on the back of his time sheet.                         He\n\nnoted that the brake was \"set up a little higher than it was\n\nsupposed to be\" but that he did not consider this a safety problem.\n\nEmmanuel    claims     that,    as   he    pulled     out   of    the    West   Roxbury\n\nfacility, the bus accelerated out of control and the brakes failed.\n\nHe steered the bus off the road and crashed through several bushes\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fand a fence before stopping in a ditch.\n\n            Emmanuel blamed the accident on defects in the bus's\n\naccelerator and brake systems.             Laidlaw's investigation revealed\n\nthat the brakes had been recently serviced and were in working\n\norder.     After reviewing other relevant materials, including the\n\npolice report and Emmanuel's statement, Laidlaw determined that\n\nEmmanuel was at fault and that the accident was \"serious in\n\nnature.\"    The CBA permitted Laidlaw to fire an employee without\n\nwarning for involvement in a \"serious at-fault accident.\"                            On\n\nAugust 23, 2000, Laidlaw discharged Emmanuel.\n\n            Emmanuel filed a grievance with the Union, claiming that\n\nthe   discharge     was   \"unjust\"      and     requesting   reinstatement         with\n\nbackpay.    The Union business agent, Ritchie Reardon, represented\n\nEmmanuel in the grievance proceedings.               In October 2000, Reardon,\n\nEmmanuel    and     several     Laidlaw       officials    met    to     resolve    the\n\ngrievance. At this meeting, Laidlaw proposed to reinstate Emmanuel\n\nand   to   convert     the     post-termination       period      into     an   unpaid\n\nsuspension.    Emmanuel rejected the offer and demanded arbitration.\n\n            Prior    to   arbitration,          Emmanuel   met    with    Reardon    to\n\ndiscuss    strategy.         Emmanuel   urged      Reardon   to    argue    that    the\n\naccident was caused by mechanical defects in the bus.                       Emmanuel\n\nprovided Reardon with a list of employees who he claimed would\n\nsupport this theory.         Reardon told Emmanuel that he should arrange\n\nfor these employees to contact him because employees generally\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fresist testifying against their employer after being approached by\n\nthe Union business agent.      None of these employees (only one of\n\nwhom saw the accident) ever contacted Reardon.\n\n          Reardon investigated Emmanuel's theory by interviewing\n\nseveral Laidlaw mechanics.      These individuals were \"hostile\" to\n\nEmmanuel's claim because Emmanuel had been in other accidents which\n\nhe had blamed on mechanical defects, and because the mechanics had\n\ntaken these excuses \"personally.\"         The mechanics told Reardon that\n\nthe brakes and accelerating system were not defective.              Based on\n\nthese conversations, Reardon believed that, if he were to call \"the\n\nmechanics to the witness stand they would actually say things that\n\nwould have harmed Emmanuel's case.\"\n\n          Lacking   evidence   to    corroborate     the   defect    theory,\n\nReardon focused on an alternative argument before the arbitrator.\n\nThe CBA required Laidlaw to impose discipline on an employee within\n\n20 days of the date that the company learned of the accident.1\n\nBecause Laidlaw did not inform Emmanuel of his discharge until 70\n\ndays after the accident, the Union argued that Emmanuel's discharge\n\nviolated the CBA.     The arbitrator rejected this argument and\n\nconcluded that Emmanuel's discharge was justified under the CBA.\n\n          After losing the arbitration, Emmanuel sued the Union for\n\nviolating the duty of fair representation.         His complaint alleged\n\n\n     1\n      The CBA provided that \"discipline shall be imposed no later\nthan twenty days from the day of the company's knowledge of the\nincident, which gave rise to such discipline.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthat the Union inadequately investigated his mechanical defect\n\ntheory and irrationally decided to present the timing issue to the\n\narbitrator. After discovery, the Union moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe district court concluded, as a matter of law, that the Union\n\nhad adequately investigated Emmanuel's defect theory and reasonably\n\nrepresented him at the arbitration.           Because there was no evidence\n\nthat the Union's conduct was discriminatory, in bad faith, or\n\narbitrary,      the court entered judgment for the Union.\n\n           Shortly        after      this     ruling,     Emmanuel        sought\n\nreconsideration based on his discovery of \"new evidence.\"                Through\n\nan internet search, a paralegal working on Emmanuel's case found\n\nthat the bus involved in the accident had been recalled by the\n\nmanufacturer to check for a defect in the acceleration system.\n\nThis   recall    notice    was    published   and   available    prior    to   the\n\narbitration.      Emmanuel argued that this evidence established a\n\nquestion   of    fact     concerning   the    sufficiency   of    the    Union's\n\ninvestigation.      The district court denied the motion.                Emmanuel\n\nappeals both the summary judgment and motion for reconsideration\n\nrulings.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           A. Summary Judgment\n\n           We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, taking\n\nall disputed facts in the light most favorable to Emmanuel.                    See\n\nHoulton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f(1st Cir. 1999).          In so doing, we do not consider \"conclusory\n\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"\n\nMedina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).      We will affirm the grant of summary judgment so long as the\n\nrecord reflects that no genuine issue of material fact exists and\n\nthat the Union is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.                        See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n              As   \"the   exclusive         bargaining   representative      of   the\n\nemployees, [a] [u]nion [has] a statutory duty fairly to represent\n\nall of those employees both in its collective bargaining . . . and\n\nin    its    enforcement       of    the     resulting    collective      bargaining\n\nagreement.\"        United Steelworkers of Am., v. Rawson, 495 U.S. 362,\n\n372 (1990) (quoting Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 177 (1967)).                     This\n\nduty is called the \"duty of fair representation.\"                  BIW Deceived v.\n\nLocal S6, Indus. Union of Marine & Shipbuilding Workers of Am., 132\n\nF.3d 824, 830 (1st Cir. 1997).                    A union breaches this duty by\n\nacting discriminatorily, in bad faith, or arbitrarily toward a\n\nunion member.       Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter, 339 F.3d 9, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).         Proof of any of these bad acts will suffice to\n\nestablish a claim.        See id.\n\n              Emmanuel argues only that the Union acted arbitrarily in\n\nhandling his grievance.             A union acts arbitrarily \"if, in light of\n\nthe factual and legal landscape at the time of the union's actions,\n\nthe   union's       behavior    is     so     far    outside   a   wide   range     of\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\freasonableness as to be irrational.\"                     Miller v. United States\n\nPostal    Service,       985    F.2d    9,    11-12   (1st     Cir.   1993)    (citation\n\nomitted). This standard requires the court to examine objectively\n\nthe    competence    of        the    union's   representation.          See    Neal    v.\n\nNewspaper Holdings, Inc., 349 F.3d 363, 369 (7th Cir. 2003).                           But\n\nin performing this objective evaluation, the reviewing court must\n\naccord the union's conduct substantial deference.                        See Air Line\n\nPilots Ass'n Int'l v. O'Neill, 499 U.S. 65, 78 (1991); Morales-\n\nVallellanes, 339 F.3d at 16.                 This   standard of review recognizes\n\nthat     unions     must        have    ample       latitude     to    perform    their\n\nrepresentative functions.              Miller, 985 F.2d at 12.\n\n            Emmanuel challenges the Union's investigation of his\n\ntheory of the accident.              In particular, he faults the Union for not\n\ninterviewing       the    potential       witnesses     whom     he   identified       for\n\nReardon.\n\n            The duty of fair representation mandates that a union\n\nconduct at least a \"minimal investigation\" into an employee's\n\ngrievance.    Garcia v. Zenith Elec. Corp., 58 F.3d 1171, 1176 (7th\n\nCir. 1995).       But under this standard, only an \"egregious disregard\n\nfor union members' rights constitutes a breach of the union's duty\"\n\nto investigate.          Castelli v. Douglas Aircraft Co., 752 F.2d 1480,\n\n1483 (9th Cir. 1985).\n\n            Reardon was willing to speak with the potential witnesses\n\nthat Emmanuel identified.                 But he told Emmanuel to urge the\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fwitnesses to contact him because, in his experience, employees were\n\nreluctant to testify against management after being approached by\n\nthe   Union    business    agent.    As    Reardon   explained,   requiring\n\npotential      employee-witnesses     to   come   to   him   tested   their\n\n\"willingness to actually testify or provide evidence that is\n\nunfavorable to an employer.\"        Reardon's approach was designed with\n\nan eye toward assuring that the Union only called helpful witnesses\n\nat the arbitration.       This strategy does not constitute a wholesale\n\ndisregard of the Union's duty to investigate Emmanuel's claim.\n\n              Moreover, Emmanuel has not demonstrated, as he must, that\n\nany of these employees would have provided beneficial information.\n\nSee Black v. Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc., 15 F.3d 573, 585 (6th\n\nCir. 1994) (stating that the failure to \"present favorable evidence\n\nduring the grievance process . . . may constitute a breach of . .\n\n. duty . . . only if that evidence probably would have brought\n\nabout a different decision\").        From our review of the record, none\n\nof the witnesses was on the bus at the time of the accident or\n\notherwise was able to offer evidence to corroborate Emmanuel's\n\nassertion that the bus was defective.          These witnesses would not\n\nhave provided competent testimony to support Emmanuel's claim.2\n\n\n\n      2\n      Emmanuel suggests that one of the proposed witnesses would\nhave testified that he was aware of a previous circumstance in\nwhich a bus accelerator stuck. But without testimony that it was\nthe same bus or bus model that Emmanuel drove on the day of the\naccident, this testimony, if admitted into evidence at all, would\nnot have been particularly helpful to Emmanuel's case.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f          In     any   event,    the     Union    did    actively   investigate\n\nEmmanuel's claim. Reardon spoke to several Laidlaw mechanics about\n\nthe incident and Emmanuel's theory.             These individuals would have\n\nbeen critical witnesses at the arbitration because they could have\n\ntestified about the mechanical condition of the bus. The mechanics\n\ntold Reardon that the bus was not defective, and they were openly\n\nresentful of Emmanuel's claim.            These interviews understandably\n\ndiscouraged Reardon from pursuing the defect theory.                  Reardon's\n\ninterviews sufficed to discharge the Union's duty to investigate.\n\nSee Garcia, 58 F.3d at 1177-78 (stating that the union discharged\n\nits duty of fair representation by conducting minimally sufficient\n\ninvestigation, even though the grievant would have preferred that\n\nthe union had investigated his claim more thoroughly); Castelli,\n\n752 F.2d at 1483 (holding that the union met its duty of fair\n\nrepresentation where the union business representative spent no\n\nmore that one and a half hours in investigating the grievance and\n\npreparing for the arbitration);           Findley v. Jones Motor Freight,\n\n639 F.2d 953, 956-61 (3d Cir. 1981) (concluding that the union\n\nsatisfied its duty of fair representation by conducting some\n\ninvestigation of the grievance, even though it could have conducted\n\na more searching investigation).\n\n          In addition to challenging the quality of the Union's\n\ninvestigation,    Emmanuel      faults    the    Union    for   presenting   the\n\nargument that Laidlaw's discharge decision violated the CBA's\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\ftiming provision.            He contends that, because the CBA provision\n\nestablishing time limits for imposing discipline was untested, it\n\nwas irrational for the Union to rely on this argument before the\n\narbitrator.         We disagree.\n\n               \"It is for the union, not the courts to decide whether\n\nand in what manner a particular grievance should be pursued.\"\n\nPatterson v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 959, 121 F.3d 1345,\n\n1349-50 (9th Cir. 1997).               A union does not act arbitrarily merely\n\nbecause      it     errs   in    interpreting      a   particular    provision        of   a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.                  Peterson v. Kennedy, 771 F.2d\n\n1244, 1254 (9th Cir. 1985).               The CBA provision at issue arguably\n\nsupported the Union's position that Emmanuel's termination was\n\nuntimely.         As Reardon had not discovered evidence to support the\n\nmechanical defect theory, it was rational for him to focus on this\n\nalternate theory before the arbitrator.                    See Garcia, 58 F.3d at\n\n1179       (stating    that      the    union     satisfied   its     duty       of    fair\n\nrepresentation where it pursued a rational arbitration strategy\n\neven       though    the     employee     would    have   preferred        a    different\n\nstrategy).3\n\n               In     sum,      the    record     demonstrates      that       the    Union\n\n\n       3\n      Emmanuel also argues that it was irrational for the Union to\nfail to present evidence that other drivers often recorded pre-trip\ninspection information, not in the safety log book, but rather in\nother locations.    Such evidence would have made no difference\nbecause the arbitrator assumed that Emmanuel conducted an\nappropriate pre-trip inspection.      See Black, 15 F.3d at 585.\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\finvestigated the mechanical defect theory and presented a rational\n\nargument to support the grievance.          That is all that the duty of\n\nfair representation requires.\n\n           B. Motion for Reconsideration\n\n           Shortly after the district court granted the Union's\n\nmotion for summary judgment, Emmanuel sought reconsideration on the\n\nground that he had discovered \"new evidence.\"           See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e).   Specifically, through an internet search, he found that the\n\nbus had been recalled in 1995 because of a problem that resulted in\n\n\"the accelerator sticking at the full power position.\"            In light of\n\nthis discovery, Emmanuel argues that the Union was incompetent in\n\nnot doing this basic research and that, if it had done so, it would\n\nhave   found   evidence   to    support    the   mechanical   defect   theory.\n\nEmmanuel posits that this recall notice establishes a triable issue\n\non the sufficiency of the Union's investigation, and that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying his motion for\n\nreconsideration.\n\n           We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for\n\na manifest abuse of discretion.      See Vasapolli v.     Rostoff, 39 F.3d\n\n27, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).          Rule 59(e) provides litigants with a\n\nvehicle to present the district court with evidence uncovered after\n\nthe entry of judgment.         Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).    But it \"does not provide a vehicle for a party\n\nto undo its own procedural failures and it certainly does not allow\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fa party to introduce new evidence or advance arguments that could\n\nand should have been presented to the district court prior to\n\njudgment.\"   Id. (citations omitted).   Thus, a district court does\n\nnot abuse its discretion by denying a motion for reconsideration\n\ngrounded on the discovery of evidence that, in the exercise of due\n\ndiligence, could have been presented earlier. See Hayes v. Douglas\n\nDynamics, Inc., 8 F.3d 88, 91 n.1 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          The district court did not abuse its discretion because\n\nthe recall notice was available to Emmanuel well in advance of the\n\ncourt's summary judgment ruling.   Emmanuel admits as much in his\n\nappellate brief.

The Union unsuccessfully pursued Emmanuel's grievance through arbitration.

On June 14, 2000, Laidlaw asked Emmanuel to drive a bus from its West Roxbury facility to a facility in a neighboring town. Emmanuel claims that, when he entered the bus, he could not find the pre-trip inspection log but recorded his safety observations on the back of his time sheet. He noted that the brake was \"set up a little higher than it was supposed to be\" but that he did not consider this a safety problem. Emmanuel claims that, as he pulled out of the West Roxbury facility, the bus accelerated out of control and the brakes failed. He steered the bus off the road and crashed through several bushes and a fence before stopping in a ditch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emmanuel blamed the accident on defects in the bus's accelerator and brake systems. Laidlaw's investigation revealed that the brakes had been recently serviced and were in working order. After reviewing other relevant materials, including the police report and Emmanuel's statement, Laidlaw determined that Emmanuel was at fault and that the accident was \"serious in nature.\" The CBA permitted Laidlaw to fire an employee without warning for involvement in a \"serious at-fault accident.\" On August 23, 2000, Laidlaw discharged Emmanuel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emmanuel filed a grievance with the Union, claiming that the discharge was \"unjust\" and requesting reinstatement with backpay. The Union business agent, Ritchie Reardon, represented Emmanuel in the grievance proceedings. In October 2000, Reardon, Emmanuel and several Laidlaw officials met to resolve the grievance. At this meeting, Laidlaw proposed to reinstate Emmanuel and to convert the post-termination period into an unpaid suspension. Emmanuel rejected the offer and demanded arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to arbitration, Emmanuel met with Reardon to discuss strategy. Emmanuel urged Reardon to argue that the accident was caused by mechanical defects in the bus. Emmanuel provided Reardon with a list of employees who he claimed would support this theory. Reardon told Emmanuel that he should arrange for these employees to contact him because employees generally resist testifying against their employer after being approached by the Union business agent. None of these employees (only one of whom saw the accident) ever contacted Reardon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reardon investigated Emmanuel's theory by interviewing several Laidlaw mechanics. These individuals were \"hostile\" to Emmanuel's claim because Emmanuel had been in other accidents which he had blamed on mechanical defects, and because the mechanics had taken these excuses \"personally.\" The mechanics told Reardon that the brakes and accelerating system were not defective. Based on these conversations, Reardon believed that, if he were to call \"the mechanics to the witness stand they would actually say things that would have harmed Emmanuel's case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lacking evidence to corroborate the defect theory, Reardon focused on an alternative argument before the arbitrator. The CBA required Laidlaw to impose discipline on an employee within 20 days of the date that the company learned of the accident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Because Laidlaw did not inform Emmanuel of his discharge until 70 days after the accident, the Union argued that Emmanuel's discharge violated the CBA. The arbitrator rejected this argument and concluded that Emmanuel's discharge was justified under the CBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After losing the arbitration, Emmanuel sued the Union for violating the duty of fair representation. His complaint alleged that the Union inadequately investigated his mechanical defect theory and irrationally decided to present the timing issue to the arbitrator. After discovery, the Union moved for summary judgment. The district court concluded, as a matter of law, that the Union had adequately investigated Emmanuel's defect theory and reasonably represented him at the arbitration. Because there was no evidence that the Union's conduct was discriminatory, in bad faith, or arbitrary, the court entered judgment for the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after this ruling, Emmanuel sought reconsideration based on his discovery of \"new evidence.\" Through an internet search, a paralegal working on Emmanuel's case found that the bus involved in the accident had been recalled by the manufacturer to check for a defect in the acceleration system. This recall notice was published and available prior to the arbitration. Emmanuel argued that this evidence established a question of fact concerning the sufficiency of the Union's investigation. The district court denied the motion. Emmanuel appeals both the summary judgment and motion for reconsideration rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, taking all disputed facts in the light most favorable to Emmanuel. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999). In so doing, we do not consider \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990). We will affirm the grant of summary judgment so long as the record reflects that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the Union is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As \"the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees, [a][u]nion [has] a statutory duty fairly to represent all of those employees both in its collective bargaining . . . and in its enforcement of the resulting collective bargaining agreement.\" <i>United Steelworkers of Am., v. Rawson,</i> 495 U.S. 362, 372, 110 S.Ct. 1904, 109 L.Ed.2d 362 (1990) (quoting <i>Vaca v. Sipes,</i> 386 U.S. 171, 177, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967)). This duty is called the \"duty of fair representation.\" <i>BIW Deceived v. Local S6, Indus. Union of Marine &amp; Shipbuilding Workers of Am.,</i> 132 F.3d 824, 830 (1st Cir.1997). A union breaches this duty by acting discriminatorily, in bad faith, or arbitrarily toward a union member. <i>Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter,</i> 339 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir.2003). Proof of any of these bad acts will suffice to establish a claim. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emmanuel argues only that the Union acted arbitrarily in handling his grievance. A union acts arbitrarily \"if, in light of the factual and legal landscape at the time of the union's actions, the union's behavior is so far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be irrational.\" <i>Miller v. United States Postal Service,</i> 985 F.2d 9, 11-12 (1st Cir.1993) (citation omitted). This standard requires the court to examine objectively the competence of the union's representation. <i>See Neal v. Newspaper Holdings, Inc.,</i> 349 F.3d 363, 369 (7th Cir.2003). But in performing this objective evaluation, the reviewing court must accord the union's conduct substantial deference. <i>See Air Line Pilots Ass'n Int'l v. O'Neill,</i> 499 U.S. 65, 78, 111 S.Ct. 1127, 113 L.Ed.2d 51 (1991); <i>Morales-Vallellanes,</i> 339 F.3d at 16. This standard of review recognizes that unions must have ample latitude to perform their representative functions. <i>Miller,</i> 985 F.2d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emmanuel challenges the Union's investigation of his theory of the accident. In particular, he faults the Union for not interviewing the potential witnesses whom he identified for Reardon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The duty of fair representation mandates that a union conduct at least a \"minimal investigation\" into an employee's grievance. <i>Garcia v. Zenith Elec. Corp.,</i> 58 F.3d 1171, 1176 (7th Cir.1995). But under this standard, only an \"egregious disregard for union members' rights constitutes a breach of the union's duty\" to investigate. <i>Castelli v. Douglas Aircraft Co.,</i> 752 F.2d 1480, 1483 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reardon was willing to speak with the potential witnesses that Emmanuel identified. But he told Emmanuel to urge the witnesses to contact him because, in his experience, employees were reluctant to testify against management after being approached by the Union business agent. As Reardon explained, requiring potential employee-witnesses to come to him tested their \"willingness to actually testify or provide evidence that is unfavorable to an employer.\" Reardon's approach was designed with an eye toward assuring that the Union only called helpful witnesses at the arbitration. This strategy does not constitute a wholesale disregard of the Union's duty to investigate Emmanuel's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Emmanuel has not demonstrated, as he must, that any of these employees would have provided beneficial information. <i>See Black v. Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc.,</i> 15 F.3d 573, 585 (6th Cir.1994) (stating that the failure to \"present favorable evidence during the grievance process . . . may constitute a breach of . . . duty . . . only if that evidence probably would have brought about a different decision\"). From our review of the record, none of the witnesses was on the bus at the time of the accident or otherwise was able to offer evidence to corroborate Emmanuel's assertion that the bus was defective. These witnesses would not have provided competent testimony to support Emmanuel's claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the Union did actively investigate Emmanuel's claim. Reardon spoke to several Laidlaw mechanics about the incident and Emmanuel's theory. These individuals would have been critical witnesses at the arbitration because they could have testified about the mechanical condition of the bus. The mechanics told Reardon that the bus was not defective, and they were openly resentful of Emmanuel's claim. These interviews understandably discouraged Reardon from pursuing the defect theory. Reardon's interviews sufficed to discharge the Union's duty to investigate. <i>See Garcia,</i> 58 F.3d at 1177-78 (stating that the union discharged its duty of fair representation by conducting minimally sufficient investigation, even though the grievant would have preferred that the union had investigated his claim more thoroughly); <i>Castelli,</i> 752 F.2d at 1483 (holding that the union met its duty of fair representation where the union business representative spent no more that one and a half hours in investigating the grievance and preparing for the arbitration); <i>Findley v. Jones Motor Freight,</i> 639 F.2d 953, 956-61 (3d Cir.1981) (concluding that the union satisfied its duty of fair representation by conducting some investigation of the grievance, even though it could have conducted a more searching investigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to challenging the quality of the Union's investigation, Emmanuel faults the Union for presenting the argument that Laidlaw's discharge decision violated the CBA's timing provision. He contends that, because the CBA provision establishing time limits for imposing discipline was untested, it was irrational for the Union to rely on this argument before the arbitrator. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is for the union, not the courts to decide whether and in what manner a particular grievance should be pursued.\" <i>Patterson v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 959,</i> 121 F.3d 1345, 1349-50 (9th Cir.1997). A union does not act arbitrarily merely because it errs in interpreting a particular provision of a collective bargaining agreement. <i>Peterson v. Kennedy,</i> 771 F.2d 1244, 1254 (9th Cir.1985). The CBA provision at issue arguably supported the Union's position that Emmanuel's termination was untimely. As Reardon had not discovered evidence to support the mechanical defect theory, it was rational for him to focus on this alternate theory before the arbitrator. <i>See Garcia,</i> 58 F.3d at 1179 (stating that the union satisfied its duty of fair representation where it pursued a rational arbitration strategy even though the employee would have preferred a different strategy).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record demonstrates that the Union investigated the mechanical defect theory and presented a rational argument to support the grievance. That is all that the duty of fair representation requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the district court granted the Union's motion for summary judgment, Emmanuel sought reconsideration on the ground that he had discovered \"new evidence.\" <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Specifically, through an internet search, he found that the bus had been recalled in 1995 because of a problem that resulted in \"the accelerator sticking at the full power position.\" In light of this discovery, Emmanuel argues that the Union was incompetent in not doing this basic research and that, if it had done so, it would have found evidence to support the mechanical defect theory. Emmanuel posits that this recall notice establishes a triable issue on the sufficiency of the Union's investigation, and that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See Vasapolli v. Rostoff,</i> 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.1994). Rule 59(e) provides litigants with a vehicle to present the district court with evidence uncovered after the entry of judgment. <i>Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes,</i> 118 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1997). But it \"does not provide a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures and it certainly does not allow a party to introduce new evidence or advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> (citations omitted). Thus, a district court does not abuse its discretion by denying a motion for reconsideration grounded on the discovery of evidence that, in the exercise of due diligence, could have been presented earlier. <i>See Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc.,</i> 8 F.3d 88, 91 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion because the recall notice was available to Emmanuel well in advance of the court's summary judgment ruling. Emmanuel admits as much in his appellate brief. In arguing that the existence of the recall notice demonstrated arbitrary conduct by the Union, Emmanuel stated that the notice was \"information that was available to anyone\" as it was posted \"on the internet.\" Emmanuel has offered no persuasive reason for waiting until after the entry of judgment to search the internet for publically available documents that could have supported his claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Hayden v.

This recall notice was published and available prior to the arbitration. Emmanuel argued that this evidence established a question of fact concerning the sufficiency of the Union's investigation.

But he told Emmanuel to urge the witnesses to contact him because, in his experience, employees were reluctant to testify against management after being approached by the Union business agent. As Reardon explained, requiring potential employee-witnesses to come to him tested their \"willingness to actually testify or provide evidence that is unfavorable to an employer.\" Reardon's approach was designed with an eye toward assuring that the Union only called helpful witnesses at the arbitration. This strategy does not constitute a wholesale disregard of the Union's duty to investigate Emmanuel's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Emmanuel has not demonstrated, as he must, that any of these employees would have provided beneficial information. <i>See Black v. Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661745\"><a href=\"/opinion/661745/donald-l-black-92-5611-92-5694-v-ryderpie-nationwide-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 585 (6th Cir.1994) (stating that the failure to \"present favorable evidence during the grievance process . . . may constitute a breach of . . . duty . . . only if that evidence probably would have brought about a different decision\"). From our review of the record, none of the witnesses was on the bus at the time of the accident or otherwise was able to offer evidence to corroborate Emmanuel's assertion that the bus was defective. These witnesses would not have provided competent testimony to support Emmanuel's claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the Union did actively investigate Emmanuel's claim. Reardon spoke to several Laidlaw mechanics about the incident and Emmanuel's theory. These individuals would have been critical witnesses at the arbitration because they could have testified about the mechanical condition of the bus. The mechanics told Reardon that the bus was not defective, and they were openly resentful of Emmanuel's claim. These interviews understandably discouraged Reardon from pursuing the defect theory. Reardon's interviews sufficed to discharge the Union's duty to investigate. <i>See Garcia,</i> 58 F.3d at 1177-78 (stating that the union discharged its duty of fair representation by conducting minimally sufficient investigation, even though the grievant would have preferred that the union had investigated his claim more thoroughly); <i>Castelli,</i> 752 F.2d at 1483 (holding that the union met its duty of fair representation where the union business representative spent no more that one and a half hours in investigating the grievance and preparing for the arbitration); <i>Findley v. Jones Motor Freight,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></span>, 956-61 (3d Cir.1981) (concluding that the union satisfied its duty of fair representation by conducting some investigation of the grievance, even though it could have conducted a more searching investigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to challenging the quality of the Union's investigation, Emmanuel faults the Union for presenting the argument that Laidlaw's discharge decision violated the CBA's timing provision. He contends that, because the CBA provision establishing time limits for imposing discipline was untested, it was irrational for the Union to rely on this argument before the arbitrator. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is for the union, not the courts to decide whether and in what manner a particular grievance should be pursued.\" <i>Patterson v.

A union does not act arbitrarily merely because it errs in interpreting a particular provision of a collective bargaining agreement. <i>Peterson v. Kennedy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457776\"><a href=\"/opinion/457776/james-e-peterson-v-harold-kennedy-richard-a-berthelsen-and-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1244</span></a></span>, 1254 (9th Cir.1985). The CBA provision at issue arguably supported the Union's position that Emmanuel's termination was untimely. As Reardon had not discovered evidence to support the mechanical defect theory, it was rational for him to focus on this alternate theory before the arbitrator. <i>See Garcia,</i> 58 F.3d at 1179 (stating that the union satisfied its duty of fair representation where it pursued a rational arbitration strategy even though the employee would have preferred a different strategy).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record demonstrates that the Union investigated the mechanical defect theory and presented a rational argument to support the grievance.

Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the district court granted the Union's motion for summary judgment, Emmanuel sought reconsideration on the ground that he had discovered \"new evidence.\" <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Specifically, through an internet search, he found that the bus had been recalled in 1995 because of a problem that resulted in \"the accelerator sticking at the full power position.\" In light of this discovery, Emmanuel argues that the Union was incompetent in not doing this basic research and that, if it had done so, it would have found evidence to support the mechanical defect theory. Emmanuel posits that this recall notice establishes a triable issue on the sufficiency of the Union's investigation, and that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See Vasapolli v.

Rule 59(e) provides litigants with a vehicle to present the district court with evidence uncovered after the entry of judgment. <i>Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197430\"><a href=\"/opinion/197430/aybar-v-crispin-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1997). But it \"does not provide a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures and it certainly does not allow a party to introduce new evidence or advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> (citations omitted). Thus, a district court does not abuse its discretion by denying a motion for reconsideration grounded on the discovery of evidence that, in the exercise of due diligence, could have been presented earlier. <i>See Hayes v.
