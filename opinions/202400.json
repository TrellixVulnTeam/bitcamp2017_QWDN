Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Nellie Francis on brief pro se.\n     Sara A. Rapport, Senior Assistant City Solicitor, City of\nProvidence, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 7, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam.      Pro se appellant Nellie S. Francis appeals\n\nfrom the district court's judgment granting summary judgment to her\n\nformer employer, appellee Providence School Board, in her action\n\nclaiming violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and related violations of state law.\n\nFrancis   also   appeals   from   the   denial   of   her   motion    for\n\nreconsideration.    The essence of her complaint is the School\n\nBoard's alleged failure to make reasonable accommodations for her\n\ndisabilities.    After careful review of the record and indulging\n\nevery inference in Francis's favor as the non-moving party, Rathbun\n\nv. Autozone, Inc., 361 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2004), we affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court essentially for the reasons outlined\n\nin the district court's Memorandum and Order of September 1, 2005,\n\nand we affirm the court's denial of the motion to reconsider.         We\n\nadd only the following.\n\n          In order to be entitled to a reasonable accommodation, as\n\na threshold matter Francis must show that she is \"disabled,\" that\n\nis, that she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially\n\nlimits a major life activity.      42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); Toyota\n\nMotor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197 (2002).         This\n\nshe has not done.    It is not enough merely to submit a medical\n\ndiagnosis of an impairment; Francis must show that a major life\n\nactivity of central importance to her daily life is substantially\n\nlimited by her impairment, and she must show that the impairment's\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fimpact is permanent or long term.          Toyota Motor, 534 U.S. at 196;\n\nSullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 358 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThe record is silent on each of these fundamental questions.\n\n              Francis claims that her cervical spine and neck injuries\n\ninterfere with bending and stooping, sitting or standing for\n\nprolonged periods of time, and lifting more than 10 lbs.            While we\n\nmay assume the latter activities may, in some circumstances and\n\nupon a proper showing, relate to a major life activity, see, e.g.,\n\nGillen v. Fallon Ambulance Service, Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (lifting), in order to survive summary judgment, it is not\n\nenough simply to assert the limitation; \"[a] plaintiff must proffer\n\nevidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that [a\n\nmajor life] activity is substantially or materially limited.\"           Id.\n\nat 24 (quoting Snow v. Ridgeview Medical Center, 128 F.3d 1201,\n\n1207 (8th Cir. 1997)).        In addition, \"[t]he evidence needed to\n\nestablish the limiting qualities of a particular impairment must\n\nalways   be    unique   to   that   impairment   and   to   the   individual\n\ninvolved.\"     Id. (citing   Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., 527 U.S.\n\n471, 483 (1999)).       Francis offered no evidence showing that her\n\nimpairment substantially or materially limits an activity of major\n\nimportance in her own daily life.          Cf. Toyota Motor, 534 U.S. at\n\n198, 202 (respondent whose medical condition required her to avoid\n\nsweeping, quit dancing, occasionally seek help dressing, reduce how\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\foften    she    plays   with   her   children,    gardens,   and   drives   long\n\ndistances, did not meet her burden of showing she was disabled; she\n\ncould still brush her teeth, wash her face, bathe, tend to her\n\nflower garden, fix breakfast, do laundry, and pick up around the\n\nhouse).\n\n               Moreover, the School Board accommodated most of Francis's\n\nrequests1 -- including assigning her a parking space near the\n\nentrance, providing a locked drawer for storing her teaching\n\nmaterials, and providing a custodian to assist in lifting heavy\n\nobjects -- except her request to start work 30 minutes late every\n\nday and to have a full-time teacher's aide assigned to her.                 It is\n\nnot entirely clear from the record whether Francis sought the late\n\nstart solely in order to avoid being in the halls at the busiest\n\ntime of the day for fear that she might be pushed or shoved by\n\nmilling students, or whether she also believed that she lacked the\n\nstrength to work a full 6½ hour day.               Regardless of the reason,\n\nhowever, the School Board explained that it could not grant these\n\nrequests because to do so would substantially alter the essential\n\nfunctions of Francis's teaching job, which included covering first\n\nperiod home room each morning. Francis does not dispute the School\n\nBoard's explanation for its actions.             Indeed, she asserts that she\n\nwas able to and did, in fact, perform all of her teaching duties\n\n\n\n     1\n       The School Board also explained that it was entirely within\nFrancis's discretion whether to sit or stand while teaching.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fduring the final months she worked, without either a full-time\n\nteacher's aide or a late start to the day.   This admission further\n\nundermines her disability claim.\n\n           In view of the above and for further reasons discussed by\n\nthe district court, we are satisfied that Francis did not establish\n\na viable claim for violation of the Americans With Disabilities\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. (\"ADA\").   Nor is it suggested that\n\nstate law would afford redress not otherwise available under the\n\nADA.   The entry of summary judgment was correct.\n\n           We also find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the\n\nmotion to reconsider.   Cintron-Lorenzo v. Departamento de Asuntos\n\ndel Consumidor, 312 F.3d 522, 527 (1st Cir. 2002); Aybar v.\n\nCrispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 522\n\nU.S. 1078 (1988).\n\n           The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
