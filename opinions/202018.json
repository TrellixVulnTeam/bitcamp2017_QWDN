Martínez-García,\nNora Vargas-Acosta, and Abogados de América Law Offices, were on\nbrief, for Arrieta-Colon et al.\n\n\n\n                        January 13, 2006\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.               A jury awarded Miguel Arrieta-\n\nColon $76,000 in compensatory damages and $160,000 in punitive\n\ndamages against Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Wal-Mart\") on his\n\ndisability      discrimination      claim        under     the       Americans    With\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213.\n\n           Specifically, the jury found Arrieta had proven that he\n\nhad an impairment or was regarded as having an impairment which\n\nsubstantially limited his ability to perform a major life function.\n\nArrieta's claimed impairment was a penile implant used to correct\n\na sexual dysfunction: the implant itself left Arrieta with the\n\nappearance of a constant semi-erection.                 The jury also found that\n\nArrieta was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his\n\ndisability. Arrieta's claim was that, due to his condition, he was\n\nconstantly harassed both by his supervisors and co-workers, and\n\nthat when he complained to his supervisors, no corrective actions\n\nwere   taken.      The   jury    found   that        Arrieta   was    constructively\n\ndischarged; that is, that he resigned from Wal-Mart due to the\n\nintolerable working conditions.\n\n           Wal-Mart appeals from the verdict, arguing that the\n\ndistrict   court    erred   in    failing       to    instruct   the     jury    on   an\n\naffirmative defense under Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,\n\n524 U.S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S.\n\n775 (1998).     Wal-Mart also makes two insufficiency of the evidence\n\narguments as to liability: (1) that Arrieta was not disabled within\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fthe meaning of the ADA, in that his impairment neither affected a\n\nmajor life activity nor was related to working conditions; and (2)\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support the existence of a\n\nhostile work environment.        Of these, the most difficult issue is\n\nthat of whether Arrieta was disabled within the meaning of the ADA.\n\nBut Wal-Mart did not preserve the issue at trial and does not\n\ndemonstrate      circumstances   that    would   warrant   our   taking    the\n\nextraordinary step of reaching the merits of that issue on appeal.\n\n            Wal-Mart also challenges the damages award, arguing (1)\n\nthat the district court erred in its punitive damages instruction\n\nto the jury, (2) that there was insufficient evidence for the jury\n\nto award punitive damages, and (3) that Arrieta failed to mitigate\n\nhis damages by taking advantage of Wal-Mart's open door policy.\n\n            Arrieta, in turn, appeals,1 arguing that the district\n\ncourt    erred    in   denying   his    post-verdict   motion    seeking   an\n\nadditional award of back pay and front pay, adjudicated by the\n\njudge, not the jury.\n\n            In the end, we affirm on both appeals, leaving all\n\nparties in the place the jury and the district court left them.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The jury also concluded that Wal-Mart had not violated Law\n44 of July 2, 1995, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, §§ 501 et seq., the\nPuerto Rico analogue to the federal ADA claim. Arrieta has not\nappealed this determination.\n\n                                       -3-\n\f                                    I.\n\n            We recount the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nupholding   the   jury   verdict   as    to   the    sufficiency    challenge.\n\nTorres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel, 406 F.3d 43, 45 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Arrieta began working at Wal-Mart in 1992.         At the time,\n\nhe suffered from Peyronie's Disease, which made it impossible for\n\nhim to have sexual intercourse. Arrieta had undergone unsuccessful\n\nsurgery in 1992 to attempt to correct the problem.                 In February\n\n1994 Arrieta underwent another surgery, during which the first\n\nimplant was removed and a new penile prosthesis was implanted. The\n\nsecond procedure was successful, but had the side effect, common\n\nwith this procedure, that Arrieta had a constant semi-erection that\n\nwas apparent through his clothing.             His doctor reported that\n\nArrieta had no physical or mental impairment before going back to\n\nwork. The complaints of harassment in this case concern the period\n\nafter the February 1994 surgery.\n\n            Arrieta   filed   paperwork       with     Wal-Mart's personnel\n\ndepartment detailing the February 1994 procedure in order to obtain\n\napproval for medical coverage.      Soon after returning to work after\n\nthe surgery, Arrieta became the subject of harassment by his co-\n\nworkers and supervisors.       Three co-workers, the plaintiff, and\n\nsupervisors all described the numerous incidents. On his first day\n\nback at work, Jorge Ortiz, an assistant manager, asked Arrieta \"how\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fit felt to have [his] new pump.\"2             When Arrieta confronted Ortiz\n\nabout where he got the information, the assistant manager told him\n\nthat       he   learned   about   Arrieta's   surgery   from   the   \"girls    in\n\npersonnel.\"         Arrieta complained to Mara Mieles, the personnel\n\nmanager, about the release of information and the fact that Ortiz\n\nhad taunted him about it, but Mieles said, \"I don't know what\n\nyou're talking about, this is nonsense between guys, these are\n\nthings between men.\"\n\n                Arrieta married his present wife on June 18, 1995.            The\n\ntaunting about Arrieta's surgery continued for the remaining years\n\nthat Arrieta worked at Wal-Mart, and was constant.                   On the one\n\nhand, much of the harassment expressed the view that Arrieta was\n\nimpotent, and that he needed to use a pump to get an erection.                One\n\nof Arrieta's co-workers testified that he thought Arrieta was\n\nimpotent \"[b]ecause according to what I know, a person who has had\n\na little pump put in is because they are disabled as far as\n\nachieving an erection.\" Another co-worker testified that the jokes\n\nwere \"regarding his age, saying that he needed to have a pump in\n\norder to have relations . . . . What they almost always used was\n\nthe part regarding the pump, that he needed to use a pump.\"\n\n                On the other hand, some harassing statements evidenced an\n\nimpression that Arrieta was unusually enabled because of the\n\n\n       2\n       In fact, Arrieta did not have a \"pump,\" but rather had a\nflexible implant.   Eventually, his wife sewed special underwear\nwhich made the abnormality less visible.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fimplant. Assistant manager Ortiz once asked Arrieta, \"old man, I'm\n\ngoing to be going out with someone tomorrow, and I wanted to know\n\nif you'll let me borrow your pump.\"          Another time, Ortiz asked\n\nArrieta, \"Miguelito, did it work with your wife[?]\"             On one\n\noccasion, someone used the store's paging system to announce \"that\n\nif [Arrieta] was close by to ask [Arrieta] to come to the warehouse\n\nto let him borrow a pump so that they could lift a pallet or a\n\nbox.\" On another occasion, when Arrieta was visiting the personnel\n\noffices, a group of department managers in a meeting with personnel\n\nmanager Mieles \"began making comments such as, there is Viagra Man.\n\nNo, he's got force power.\"     As to this event, Arrieta testified, \"I\n\nlooked over at Miss Mieles, and I said this was the nonsense I was\n\ntalking about four years ago.\"      Mieles did not respond in any way.\n\n           In fact, with the implant, Arrieta was initially able to\n\nengage   in    intercourse   with   his   wife.   Later   psychological\n\ndepression, occasioned by the harassment, affected his sexual\n\nfunctioning.\n\n           Assistant manager Ortiz and Jose Ramos, a support manager\n\nunder Ortiz, were initiators of the comments about Arrieta's\n\ncondition, according to the testimony of Rey Rodriguez, one of\n\nArrieta's co-workers.        During meetings at the beginning of the\n\nnight shift, Ortiz \"would come into the warehouse with a joke\n\nregarding the pump.\"     Rodriguez testified that Jose Ramos \"would\n\nuse [the paging system] to make jokes regarding the pump . . . .\n\n                                    -6-\n\f[Ramos] said . . . that Arrieta was ready with his baton.\"         Another\n\nco-worker, Eliezer Ramos, recounted an incident between Arrieta and\n\nassistant manager Ortiz.   Ortiz had been particularly offensive:\n\n          [Arrieta] had been away [on] his honeymoon,\n          and two or three days later, . . . I heard\n          comments from [other employees] saying that\n          [Arrieta] was upset with Jorge, because . . .\n          [Jorge] had asked [Arrieta] if the pump had\n          not worked out with his wife, he should bring\n          her to him.\n\n          Eliezer Ramos also testified that Dennis Baerga, another\n\nassistant manager and yet a third supervisor of Arrieta, once said\n\n\"[L]ook, Miguel Arrieta's pump seems to be working\" within the\n\npresence of assistant manager Ortiz and Gilberto Rosa, who was a\n\ndepartment manager for cosmetics, but not Arrieta's supervisor.\n\n          Arrieta's   former   supervisors,   Ortiz   and   Jose   Ramos,\n\nthemselves admitted key facts. Support manager Jose Ramos admitted\n\nparticipating in the taunting:\n\n          Well, about what could be heard and all the\n          fooling around they had going on in there,\n          . . . where I did participate in those jokes,\n          well, about a condition that was very\n          pronounced under his pants, then . . . like\n          everyone else, they started to make jokes with\n          him [saying] Miguel, what is it that you've\n          got there, come here . . . .\n\n          Assistant manager Ortiz acknowledged that he was aware of\n\nthe taunting, and that Arrieta had complained to him about it:\n\n          Q: Isn't it true that Mr. Arrieta also [on]\n          many occasions went to you to complain about\n          the jokes?\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            A: About the jokes, I remember only one time\n            . . . .\n\n            . . . .\n\n            Q: Isn't it true, Mr. Jorge Ortiz, that\n            employees would see Mr. Arrieta's erection and\n            would joke and laugh about his pump?\n\n            A: That is correct, with him.\n\n            . . . .\n\n            Q: Isn't it true, Mr. Jorge Ortiz, that upon\n            the question of your attorney, you answered\n            that if an inappropriate conduct or a\n            disrespectful conduct was taken to you, you\n            had the duty to immediately report it to your\n            supervisor or store manager?\n\n            A: Yes, that is correct.\n\n            Q: And Mr. Arrieta did complain to you, didn't\n            he?\n\n            A: Yes, that is correct.\n\nOrtiz also admitted knowing that Arrieta went to department manager\n\nGilberto Rosa to complain.    Neither Ortiz nor Rosa took action in\n\nresponse to these complaints.\n\n            The evidence shows that Arrieta complained to superiors\n\nin his chain of command at Wal-Mart, up to the level of store\n\nmanager.3   At no level was effective corrective action taken.   As\n\n\n     3\n      As near as can be told based on the record, the hierarchy at\nthe Wal-Mart store is as follows: The store manager is the top\ncompany official at the store. Assistant managers, such as Ortiz\nand Baerga, report to the store manager. Support managers, like\nJose Ramos, report to an assistant manager. Department managers,\nlike Gilberto Rosa, fall below support managers, and have\nsupervisory duties. Arrieta testified that Rosa, although not his\nsupervisor, was nonetheless above him in Wal-Mart's hierarchy.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fOrtiz admitted, Arrieta complained to him about the taunting.\n\nArrieta asked Ortiz if he could work apart from the other employees\n\nso he would not be subject to their taunting; Ortiz allowed this.\n\nWorking apart from the other employees improved the situation\n\nsomewhat.    But Arrieta still was subject to harassment, especially\n\nas his shift was starting and ending, at which time he was more\n\nfrequently   in    the    presence   of     other   workers.     Arrieta   also\n\ncomplained about the taunting to Rey Font, who was store manager\n\nfrom about 1995 to 1996, and asked if his shift could be changed.\n\nFont denied Arrieta's request, saying, \"look, Don Miguel, what do\n\nyou want me to do, these are things going on between men, and what\n\nam I supposed to do; it's easier to get rid of one than to get rid\n\nof all of them.\"\n\n            In    1997,   Arrieta    made    another   request    that   he   be\n\ntransferred from the overnight shift to the morning shift.                 This\n\ntime, he directed his request to Benjamin Gomez, who was Font's\n\nreplacement as store manager.         He told Gomez that he \"was having\n\ntrouble with the jokes made by the guys.\"                Gomez, rather than\n\ntransferring Arrieta to the morning shift, transferred him to the\n\nafternoon shift, which exacerbated the problem.            Arrieta said that\n\nonce the decision to transfer him was made, he could not decline.\n\nAccording to Arrieta, the change to the afternoon shift only made\n\nhis problems worse -- he was still being harassed, only this time\n\nthe harassment occurred in front of customers in the store, rather\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthan       just    fellow   employees.     He   told   Gomez   this.   In   his\n\nresignation letter, Arrieta noted that when he had complained to\n\nGomez about the change to the afternoon shift, Gomez responded \"in\n\na mocking tone of voice and sarcastically\" that \"we are not here to\n\nmake accommodations for anyone.\"4\n\n                  The harassment took an emotional toll on Arrieta. He had\n\ntrouble sleeping, lost weight, and experienced a loss of libido to\n\nthe point where he became unable to engage in sexual relations.              On\n\nMay 19, 1998, Arrieta complained to his urologist that he had a\n\nloss of sexual desire.          The urologist found no physical reason for\n\nArrieta's loss of libido, and so recommended that Arrieta see a\n\npsychiatrist or psychologist.             On September 9 and October 5 of\n\n1998, Arrieta consulted a psychiatrist, reporting loss of libido,\n\nloss of weight, and a depressive mood.            The psychiatrist diagnosed\n\nArrieta as having a dysthymic disorder with late onset.                     On\n\nFebruary 5, 1999, the psychologist certified that Arrieta was\n\ndisabled on account of dysthymic disorder and that such disability\n\nwas not work related. Arrieta's wife, Nereida Olivencia, testified\n\nthat when they got married they had plans to have children, but\n\nafter Arrieta's problems began, that was no longer possible.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        Arrieta represented in his brief that he also contacted\nWal-Mart's telephone help line. The record citation he provides\ndoes not reflect this assertion, and our own review of the record\nshows no testimony about such a phone call.\n\n                                         -10-\n\f          Co-workers    also   noticed    a   change     for   the    worse    in\n\nArrieta. Rey Rodriguez testified, \"[Y]ou could see that Mr. Miguel\n\nArrieta's emotional system wasn't working the same way anymore.\"\n\nDelio Crespo testified, \"At first, [Arrieta] used to share a lot\n\nwith us, and after [a while], he withdrew from the group to the\n\npoint where I had to ask about where he was, because I couldn't see\n\nhim.\"\n\n          Wal-Mart has an \"open door policy,\" which, according to\n\nWal-Mart, \"permits any employee that has a grievance or is the\n\nobject of illegal discrimination to complain[] to any supervisor,\n\nmanager, officer or the president of the Company.\" (emphasis\n\nadded).   Wal-Mart admits that \"[p]ursuant to the 'open door'\n\npolicy, the grievance need not be reduced to writing; if an oral\n\ngrievance is made, there is a duty to entertain it.\"                 The policy\n\nwas not put into practice and a jury could easily find it existed\n\nonly on paper.\n\n          No recording by the company was ever made of Arrieta's\n\ncomplaints, including his complaints to the Personnel Department.\n\nIn fact, Mieles, the personnel manager, acknowledged that there\n\nmight not be any written record of an employee making use of the\n\nopen door policy and that she had never even seen such a recording\n\nfor any employee, much less one for Arrieta.\n\n          Under   the   open   door      policy,   the     supervisors        had\n\naffirmative obligations as well.      Benjamin Gomez, in response to a\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fquestion by Arrieta's counsel, agreed that \"any manager who would\n\nhave heard or been present\" during the harassment \"would have had\n\nan   obligation    to   investigate.\"    No   investigation   was   ever\n\nundertaken, although Arrieta had complained about the taunting to\n\nat least three supervisors in his immediate chain of command\n\n(assistant manager Ortiz, and store managers Font and Gomez), the\n\npersonnel manager Mieles, and Rosa, who was not Arrieta's immediate\n\nsupervisor but nonetheless a department manager.       Arrieta had been\n\ntaunted by at least three of his supervisors -- assistant managers\n\nBaerga and Ortiz, and support manager Jose Ramos.\n\n           Arrieta concluded it was futile to complain further to\n\nthe supervisors: \"[T]hese jokes . . . had been begun by supervisors\n\nthemselves and had become commonplace.         Who are you going to\n\ncomplain to?\"     Delio Crespo, a co-worker, agreed.   In reference to\n\nthe taunting of Arrieta, Crespo stated: \"I didn't feel the need to\n\n. . . contact any manager, because they were all present.\"\n\n           Arrieta explained that he decided not to escalate his\n\ncomplaints about the harassment to the Wal-Mart home office because\n\nof his prior experience with that office.         He never received a\n\nresponse to a letter he had written to the home office in 1993\n\nabout how his work experience was not meeting his expectations.\n\nArrieta wrote this letter \"because when you're given all the\n\norientation and you're given all the chats, what would happen was\n\nactually totally opposite of the way it was supposed to be.\"\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fArrieta said, \"Since that letter was never answered, I never heard\n\nanything else about it.        Then it seemed to me that with any other\n\nsmall incidents, it would just be wasting my time.\"\n\n           On    October      19,   1998,    Arrieta     filed     a   charge     of\n\ndiscrimination before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(EEOC) and the Department of Labor and Human Resources of Puerto\n\nRico, alleging he had been subjected to a hostile work environment\n\nas a result of his age and medical condition.                    In his charge,\n\nArrieta stated: \"Often, allusions are made to my medical record,\n\nand I am the object of jokes and remarks on the part of my\n\n[s]upervisors and coworkers.         I am told that I am already old, that\n\nI need a new operation because the pump does not work and other\n\nremarks that allude to an operation that I underwent approximately\n\n4 years ago.     Mocking is continuous on the part of my coworkers and\n\n[s]upervisors . . . .\"\n\n           Arrieta received two written reprimands after this date.\n\nOn October 23, 1998, Arrieta was reprimanded for failing to secure\n\nkeys which could be used to access and steal merchandise.                 Then, on\n\nNovember 2, 1998, Arrieta was reprimanded for working twenty-four\n\nminutes of overtime without the prior authorization of an assistant\n\nmanager.        Arrieta    considered       the   reprimands      to   have     been\n\nunwarranted     and   given   in    retaliation    for   his     having   filed   a\n\ndiscrimination complaint with the EEOC.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            An undated document in evidence titled \"Exit Interview\"\n\nindicates that Arrieta's last day of work was November 2, 1998.\n\nWhile the record is not clear about the details of Arrieta's\n\ndeparture from Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart claims that Arrieta was given a\n\nleave of absence on that date.5    Arrieta formally resigned on May\n\n12, 1999.   He left \"because of [his] emotional state and . . . the\n\nemotional state it was causing in [his] wife, and the fact that\n\n[he] had already submitted documentation and filed a complaint\n\nbecause of discrimination, and the fact that back in October when\n\n[he] had returned, they had begun planning or orchestrating a way\n\nto provide me with warnings.\"     At his exit interview at Wal-Mart,\n\nArrieta noted that he was resigning because he was \"constantly\n\nharrass[ed] by supervisor [and] co-workers.\"\n\n                                II.\n\n            On March 22, 2000, the EEOC issued Arrieta a Notice of\n\nRight to Sue.    Arrieta filed suit on June 21, 2000 against Wal-\n\n     5\n       Wal-Mart asserts that Arrieta requested the November leave\nof absence, and that in his request he did not mention the\nharassment he had suffered.     In support, Wal-Mart points to a\nletter in the record written by Arrieta to the Cooperativa de\nSeguros de Vida (COSVI), a Puerto Rico governmental agency. That\nletter does not make mention of harassment. But there is nothing\nin this document itself or in the transcript of the trial\nproceedings to connect this letter to a request for a leave of\nabsence. Also in evidence was a request for a leave of absence\nfilled out by Arrieta in August 1998, in which Arrieta requested a\npersonal leave of absence for \"[h]ealth problems in the family.\"\nAccording to Arrieta, he was given this leave of absence in\nSeptember 1998 for his own illness. Thus, this particular document\nalso seems unrelated to any leave of absence commencing in\nNovember, and Wal-Mart does not assert that it is related.\n\n                                -14-\n\fMart, alleging violations of the ADA, the Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act (ADEA), and several provisions of Puerto Rico law.\n\nOn January 14, 2004, the district court granted Wal-Mart's motion\n\nfor summary judgment as to Arrieta's claims under the ADEA, but\n\nallowed    Arrieta's   hostile    work    environment   and    constructive\n\ndischarge claims under the ADA and state law to go to jury trial.\n\n            During the trial, both Arrieta and Wal-Mart submitted\n\nproposed   jury   instructions.     Wal-Mart    proposed      the   following\n\ninstruction regarding its anti-discrimination policy, as part of a\n\nbroader instruction on the required elements of a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim:\n\n            Defendant, however, has what it calls the Open\n            Doors     Policy     as     part    of     the\n            anti-discrimination policy of Wal-Mart; this\n            procedure has been instituted to vent any\n            serious grievance. In furthering this policy,\n            Wal-Mart submitted evidence that it has\n            implemented continuous training procedures\n            wherein it emphasizes the respect for the\n            individual, the illegality of discrimination\n            and the importance for Associates of utilizing\n            the Open Doors Policy when such recourse is\n            necessary.    The defendant claims that the\n            plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take\n            advantage of any preventive or corrective\n            opportunities provided by the employer or to\n            avoid harm otherwise. If you find that such\n            is the case, in this regard you must find for\n            the defendant, because the plaintiff failed to\n            place the defendant on notice of any grievance\n            that he may have had, and therefore did not\n            place the defendant in a position to do\n            anything on the subject of this litigation.\n\nAt the end of the eighth day of trial, counsel for both sides\n\nconvened with the judge in his conference room to review the\n\n                                   -15-\n\finstructions.       Later, when the judge instructed the jury, Wal-\n\nMart's requested instruction regarding the open door policy was not\n\ngiven.    Wal-Mart, which has raised on appeal the issues regarding\n\nthe jury instructions, has not provided us a transcript of the pre-\n\ncharge discussions.        Wal-Mart has pointed us to two instances in\n\nthe record where it made clear its objections to the instructions,\n\nand both occurred after the jury had heard the instructions.               The\n\nfirst objection was made immediately after the charge to the jury.\n\nThe transcript of this post-charge discussion is fairly sparse, and\n\nrefers to pre-charge discussions that are not in the record.                The\n\nnext objection was made in Wal-Mart's post-verdict motion.                Those\n\nobjections are described later.\n\n            Arrieta, for his part, requested only one additional\n\ninstruction, which sought to avoid having the jury draw a negative\n\ninference    from    the   fact    that   the   EEOC   did   not   make     any\n\ndetermination on Arrieta's complaint; this proposed instruction was\n\ndenied.   Arrieta made no other objections to the instructions.\n\n            At the end of Arrieta's case in chief, Wal-Mart moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 on the grounds\n\nthat Arrieta had failed to establish that he was disabled within\n\nthe meaning of the ADA.           However, Wal-Mart failed to renew its\n\nmotion at the close of all the evidence.         On January 30, 2004, the\n\njury returned a verdict in Arrieta's favor on the ADA claims and in\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fWalmart's favor on the state law claims, and awarded Arrieta\n\ncompensatory damages of $76,000 and punitive damages of $160,000.\n\n          Both Wal-Mart and Arrieta made post-judgment motions.\n\nWal-Mart sought judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n50 (this time, raising the claim that Arrieta had not established\n\nthat he was disabled under the ADA), a new trial under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 59, or vacation of the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).\n\nArrieta sought an award of back pay and front pay.          The district\n\ncourt denied both parties' motions for reasons discussed below.6\n\n                                   III.\n\n                          Wal-Mart's Appeal\n\nA.        Jury Instruction on Ellerth-Faragher Defense\n\n          This   case   involves    evidence   of   both   harassment   by\n\nsupervisors and harassment by co-workers.       In two companion cases\n\ndecided in 1998, the Supreme Court addressed the question of an\n\nemployer's vicarious liability for actionable discrimination by a\n\nsupervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the\n\nplaintiff employee. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742; Faragher, 524 U.S. 775.\n\n          Prior to Ellerth and Faragher, cases had established the\n\nstandard for employer liability for co-worker harassment of the\n\n\n     6\n       We note that this circuit has never squarely answered the\nquestion of whether hostile work environment claims are cognizable\nunder the ADA. Wal-Mart addressed the issue before the district\ncourt, but does not press the issue here, and so we proceed on the\nassumption that such a claim is cognizable. See Rocafort v. IBM\nCorp., 334 F.3d 115, 120-22 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fplaintiff employee.       Ordinarily, where the harassment is by a non-\n\nsupervisory co-worker, the employer is liable only if the plaintiff\n\ncan show that the employer \"knew or should have known of the\n\ncharged . . . harassment and failed to implement prompt and\n\nappropriate action.\" Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 303 F.3d 387, 401\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (quoting White v. N.H. Dep't of Corr., 221 F.3d\n\n253, 261 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n              As to actionable discrimination by supervisors, Faragher\n\narticulated some clear lines:\n\n(1) \"An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized\n\nemployee     for   an   actionable    hostile   environment        created      by   a\n\nsupervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over\n\nthe employee.\"      Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807.\n\n(2) Where \"no tangible employment action is taken, a defending\n\nemployer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages,\n\nsubject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\"                   Id.\n\n(3)    \"No    affirmative   defense    is     available   .    .    .    when    the\n\nsupervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action,\n\nsuch as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\"                     Id. at\n\n808.\n\n(4)    The   affirmative    defense,    when    available,     \"comprises        two\n\nnecessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care\n\nto prevent and correct promptly any . . . harassing behavior, and\n\n(b)that      the   plaintiff   employee      unreasonably     failed      to    take\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fadvantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by\n\nthe employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"                 Id. at 807.         The\n\nemployer bears the burden of proof as to both elements.                    Id. at\n\n807-08.\n\n(5) As to the first element of the defense, proof of an anti-\n\nharassment      policy   with    a   complaint     procedure    available      to\n\nemployees, while not necessarily dispositive, is relevant.                 Id. at\n\n807.\n\n(6) As to the second element of the defense, proof that the\n\nemployee failed to meet his obligation of using reasonable care is\n\nnot limited to an unreasonable failure to use such a procedure,\n\nalthough such proof will normally suffice to meet the employer's\n\nburden.   Id. at 807-08.        See also Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc.,\n\n333 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2003); Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc., 304\n\nF.3d 7, 20 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              After Ellerth and Faragher, the question that arose was\n\nwhether   a     constructive     discharge,      occasioned    by   supervisor\n\nharassment so severe it was intolerable, constituted a per se\n\ntangible employment action so as to preclude the assertion of the\n\nFaragher affirmative defense. This court addressed the question in\n\nReed.   See 333 F.3d at 32-33.        As is often our wont, we said that\n\nwhile other circuits had adopted hard and fast per se rules as to\n\nwhether   a    constructive     discharge   was    or   was   not   a    tangible\n\nemployment action, we would not adopt such a rule.                      Id. at 33\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f(\"[W]e see no reason to adopt a blanket rule one way or the other.\n\nHere, it is clear to us that the constructive discharge label\n\ncannot be used to preclude the affirmative defense.\"). Instead, we\n\nfocused on whether the supervisor's action was an \"official action\"\n\ncomprising the kind of tangible employment action (e.g., discharge,\n\nreduction in pay) that the Supreme Court appeared to have in mind.\n\nId.   Reed did allow for the possibility that, on other facts, the\n\naffirmative defense as to supervisor harassment could be precluded\n\nin a constructive discharge case.\n\n           The   Supreme   Court    addressed     the   same   issue   in\n\nPennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129 (2004), adopting\n\na test similar to that in Reed.           Suders held that constructive\n\ndischarge is not a per se \"tangible employment action.\" Rather, it\n\nheld that a \"tangible employment action\" was an \"official act,\"\n\nthat is, \"an employer-sanctioned adverse action officially changing\n\n[the employee's] employment status or situation, for example, a\n\nhumiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position\n\nin which [the employee] would face unbearable working conditions.\"\n\nId. at 131, 134.    Such an official act can both precipitate an\n\nemployee's constructive discharge and be a \"tangible employment\n\naction\" that would preclude the employer's resort to the Faragher\n\ndefense.   See id. at 148-49.\n\n           Where the evidence shows that the defendant cannot prove\n\nan affirmative defense under the Faragher standard, there is no\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\freason to remand for the giving of a Faragher instruction.                    See\n\nO'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 736 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nIndeed, in Faragher itself, the Supreme Court declined to remand\n\nbecause the factual findings made in the trial court demonstrated\n\nthat the employer was not, on the evidence, entitled to the\n\ndefense.     524 U.S. at 808-10.\n\n             In this case, the court instructed the jury on January\n\n29,    2004,     rejecting     defendant's    proposed     Ellerth-Faragher\n\ninstruction.      At that time, Suders had not yet been decided, but\n\nReed   had     been.      Nonetheless,   Wal-Mart   did    not   ask    for    an\n\ninstruction on whether a tangible employment action, or a \"tangible\n\nevent\" as that term is defined by Reed, had taken place.               Instead,\n\nWal-Mart's instruction assumed there was no tangible employment\n\naction and that it was entitled to assert the Ellerth-Faragher\n\ndefense.\n\n             In its ruling on the post-judgment motion the court said\n\nit had declined to give the proposed instruction because the\n\nEllerth-Faragher defense was not applicable.             The court found, in\n\nessence, that no reasonable jury could have concluded that either\n\nelement of the defense had been met.          First, the court noted that\n\nthe open door policy existed on paper, but had not been put into\n\npractice.       Indeed,    when   Arrieta   complained    to   the   Personnel\n\nDepartment and to several supervisors, no corrective actions were\n\ntaken and his complaints were not even recorded.                 Second, the\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fevidence was that Arrieta had reasonably availed himself of the\n\nprocedures and the company had more than sufficient notice of the\n\nproblems.    We can find no reversible error; as in Faragher, the\n\nevidence did not support giving the instruction, irrespective of\n\nwhether   Wal-Mart's   conduct   amounted   to   a   tangible   employment\n\naction.\n\n            On this record there is and can be no assertion the jury\n\nwas misled or that there has been a miscarriage of justice.           The\n\ninstruction the court gave placed the burden on the plaintiff to\n\nshow not only that his work conditions were intolerable but also\n\nthat his employer knew or should have known about the intolerable\n\nconditions and deliberately allowed them to recur.          Thus, whether\n\nor not the supervisors themselves engaged in harassment, the\n\nsupervisors, including Wal-Mart's own personnel department, were\n\nwell aware of the co-worker harassment and chose to let it occur,\n\nproviding another basis for Wal-Mart's liability.\n\nB.          Sufficiency of Evidence Challenges to Verdict\n\n            1.     Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Finding Arrieta\n                   Was Disabled Within the Meaning of ADA\n\n            Were we forced to squarely confront it, the question of\n\nwhether Arrieta suffered from a disability or was regarded as\n\nhaving a disability within the meaning of the ADA, as found by the\n\njury, would be a difficult one.          However, Wal-Mart failed to\n\npreserve appellate review of the issue by failing to renew its Rule\n\n50 motion at the close of all the evidence.          See Muniz v. Rovira,\n\n                                  -22-\n\f373 F.3d 1, 5 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2004).    Wal-Mart's \"failure rendered\n\ninutile [its] post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict and precluded ordinary appellate review of sufficiency of\n\nthe claim.\"    Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nWe have observed that \"requiring the motion to be made at the close\n\nof all the evidence gives the opposing party an opportunity to\n\nrespond to any evidentiary deficiencies noted by the motion by\n\nseeking to reopen the evidence prior to submission of the case to\n\nthe jury.\"    Keisling v. SER-Jobs for Progress, Inc., 19 F.3d 755,\n\n758-59 (1st Cir. 1994).    For that reason, \"[a] party's failure to\n\nmove under Rule 50 at the close of all evidence 'cannot be taken\n\nlightly.'\"    Castillo v. Autokirey, Inc., 379 F.3d 4, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting Jusino v. Zayas, 875 F.2d 986, 991 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n            Wal-Mart admits the procedural default, but argues that\n\nnonetheless we have some room to review the claim, based on our\n\n\"modicum of residual discretion to inquire whether the record\n\nreflects an absolute dearth of evidentiary support for the jury's\n\nverdict.\"     Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 76 (1st Cir. 1999); see\n\nalso Surprenant, 424 F.3d at 13.        This review is exceedingly\n\nnarrow, and \"only very unusual circumstances will justify treating\n\na motion at the close of the plaintiff's case as a surrogate for a\n\nmotion at the close of all the evidence.\"      Keisling, 19 F.3d at\n\n759.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f          Such   extraordinary    review   is   not   warranted     in   this\n\ncomplicated case.   Under Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624 (1998),\n\n\"reproduction is a major life activity for the purposes of the ADA\"\n\nand \"[r]eproduction and the sexual dynamics surrounding it are\n\ncentral to the life process itself.\"       Id. at 638-39.     But at the\n\nsame time, Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999)\n\nheld that \"if a person is taking measures to correct for, or\n\nmitigate, a physical or mental impairment, the effects of those\n\nmeasures -- both positive and negative -- must be taken into\n\naccount when judging whether that person is 'substantially limited'\n\nin a major life activity and thus 'disabled' under the Act.\"             Id.\n\nat 482.\n\n          Both   Sutton   and    Bragdon   have   to    do   with    actual\n\ndisability.   But here the jury explicitly found that Arrieta was\n\neither disabled or \"regarded as\" disabled.             Under the ADA, a\n\nplaintiff is \"regarded as\" disabled if he:\n\n          (1) Has a physical or mental impairment that\n          does not substantially limit major life\n          activities but is treated by a covered entity\n          as constituting such limitation;\n\n          (2) Has a physical or mental impairment that\n          substantially limits major life activities\n          only as a result of the attitudes of others\n          toward such impairment; or\n\n          (3) Has none of the impairments defined in\n          paragraph (h) (1) or (2) of this section but\n          is treated by a covered entity as having a\n          substantially limiting impairment.\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(l); see Rodriguez v. ConAgra Grocery Prods. Co.,\n\n2005 WL 3036318 (5th Cir. Nov. 14, 2005) (discussing \"regarded as\"\n\nbasis for liability).             Whether Arrieta met either the actual\n\ndisability or the \"regarded as\" test is not an easy issue.\n\n              Absent    preservation        of    the    issue,     and       any   clear\n\nexplication of it even on appeal, we decline to address the issue.\n\n              2.       Sufficiency of Evidence To Support Hostile Work\n                       Environment\n\n              Wal-Mart argues that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport   the      jury's    finding       that   there       was   a   hostile     work\n\nenvironment that reasonably led to a constructive discharge.                        Wal-\n\nMart raised this challenge before the district court as part of its\n\npost-verdict motion for a new trial.7                   The district court denied\n\nthe motion.\n\n              Wal-Mart faces a daunting appellate standard of review.\n\nWe   review    denials      of   motions    for   a     new   trial     for    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion, keeping in mind that \"[a] district court should only\n\ngrant such motions if 'the outcome is against the clear weight of\n\nthe evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.'\"           Johnson v. Spencer Press of Me., Inc.,\n\n\n      7\n       Wal-Mart raised the same argument in a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). The district court noted that \"Wal-\nMart [did] not present an argument for relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\nthat is separate and distinct from its arguments under Rule 59.\"\nTherefore, it recharacterized the motion under Rule 60(b)(6) as one\nunder Rule 59, noting that \"even if Wal-Mart's arguments were\nconsidered under the rubric of Rule 60(b)(6), the outcome would be\nthe same.\"\n\n                                       -25-\n\f364 F.3d 368, 375 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Ramos v. Davis & Geck,\n\nInc., 167 F.3d 727, 731 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n                 There is no abuse of discretion here.           As the district\n\ncourt correctly noted:\n\n                 [T]here was evidence presented as to the\n                 constant mockery and harassment that Arrieta\n                 was subjected to by fellow co-workers and\n                 supervisors alike due to his condition; there\n                 was evidence presented that this harassment\n                 was constant and unbearable, leading to\n                 Arrieta's resignation; and there was evidence\n                 that Arrieta's supervisors knew about the\n                 harassing conduct and rather than stop it,\n                 participated in it.\n\nAs a result, the jury verdict as to the existence of a hostile work\n\nenvironment is not \"against the clear weight of the evidence.\"\n\nC.               Damages\n\n                 1.        Adequacy of Evidence to Support Punitive Damages\n\n                 After the award of punitive damages, Wal-Mart asked that\n\nthe verdict of punitive damages be set aside, altered, or amended\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).8              The court denied the motion, saying\n\nthat it had given the proper instruction under Kolstad v. American\n\nDental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 538, 545 (1999) (holding under Title\n\nVII that punitive damages are available only upon a showing that\n\nthe employer acted with \"reckless indifference\" or \"malice\" and\n\nthat       \"an    employer     may   not    be    vicariously   liable   for   the\n\ndiscriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents where\n\n\n       8\n      The court said it would reach the same outcome if the motion\nwere considered under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60.\n\n                                           -26-\n\fthese decisions are contrary to the employer's good-faith efforts\n\nto comply with Title VII\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The\n\ncourt reasoned that it was up to the jury to weigh each side's\n\ncharacterization of Wal-Mart's open door policy. The jury chose to\n\nbelieve Arrieta.\n\n          Our review of the denial of the motion to alter or amend\n\nthe judgment under Rule 59(e) is for abuse of discretion.     McCord\n\nv. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 390 F.3d 138, 144 (1st Cir. 2004).   If the\n\ndistrict court committed an error of law, such as an improper\n\ninstruction harmful to the outcome of the case, that would be an\n\nabuse of discretion.    Even if an instruction was erroneous, we ask\n\nwhether we can say with fair assurance that the jury verdict was\n\nlikely unaffected.     See Putnam Res. v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 471\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          As to punitive damages, the district court instructed:\n\n                 In order to find punitive damages, you\n          must find that the acts of the Defendant which\n          proximately caused actual damages to the\n          Plaintiff were maliciously or wantonly done.\n                 If you so find, you may add to the\n          award of actual damages such amount as you\n          shall agree to be proper as punitive damages.\n                 An act or failure to act is maliciously\n          done if prompted or accompanied by ill-will,\n          spite or grudge, either toward the injured\n          person individually or towards all persons in\n          one or more groups or categories of which the\n          injured person is a member. An act or failure\n          to act is wantonly done if done in reckless or\n          callous disregard of, or indifference to the\n          rights of one or more persons, including the\n          injured person.\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fWhile this is not a precise Kolstad instruction, it is close.   As\n\nthis court said in Romano v. U-Haul Int'l, 233 F.3d 655 (1st Cir.\n\n2000), in Kolstad the Supreme Court held:\n\n          [A]n employer may be liable for punitive\n          damages under Title VII in four instances: (1)\n          when the agent has been authorized by the\n          principal   to   commit  the   misconduct   in\n          question; (2) when the principal recklessly\n          employed the unfit agent; (3) when the agent,\n          acting in a managerial capacity, committed the\n          misconduct within the scope of the employment;\n          or (4) when the agent's bad act was\n          subsequently approved by the principal. The\n          Court limited the reach of the third situation\n          by absolving an employer from liability for\n          punitive damages if a good-faith effort to\n          comply with the requirements of Title VII is\n          made.\n\nId. at 669 (citations omitted).\n\n          Wal-Mart's objection to the instruction, both before the\n\ndistrict court and on appeal, is unclear.   Wal-Mart does not argue\n\nthat the district court's instruction was erroneous because it did\n\nnot mention the good-faith aspect of Kolstad.     Rather, Wal-Mart\n\nargues that because it had provided ample evidence of its open door\n\npolicy, \"Arrieta's supervisors' misconduct could not be imputed to\n\nWal-Mart and the instructions to the jury should not have been\n\ngiven.\"   In sum, Wal-Mart's position appears to be that, as a\n\nmatter of law, punitive damages are unavailable if there is any\n\nevidence of good-faith efforts by the employer to comply with the\n\nlaw. Wal-Mart's position is wrong and would allow companies to pay\n\nlip service to the law while blatantly violating it.\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f          The difficulty for Wal-Mart is that the Supreme Court did\n\nnot adopt a test that any evidence of a good-faith effort could\n\nshield it from liability; rather, it required a finding of a good-\n\nfaith effort to comply with the law.    On these facts, a jury could\n\neasily conclude that the open door policy was a sham designed to\n\ngive the appearance, but not the reality, of an effort to comply\n\nwith the law, and that Wal-Mart acted with reckless disregard of\n\nArrieta's rights.    Goya, 304 F.3d at 30; Romano, 233 F.3d at 670.\n\n          That   leaves    Wal-Mart's   argument   that   there    was\n\ninsufficient evidence for a jury to award punitive damages.       Wal-\n\nMart argues that any conscious wrongdoing by supervisors could not\n\nbe imputed to Wal-Mart because there was a lack of evidence that\n\nthe managers who taunted Arrieta and ignored his complaints were\n\nacting within the scope of their employment.         We reject this\n\nargument; we agree with the district court that, on these facts, a\n\nreasonable jury could have found that the supervisors were acting\n\nin the scope of their employment.   We agree with the district court\n\nthat a reasonable jury could award punitive damages.\n\n          2.        Mitigation of Damages\n\n          Wal-Mart argues that Arrieta \"failed to mitigate [his\n\ndamages] when he failed to avail himself of Wal-Mart's grievance\n\nprocedures against discrimination.\"     Wal-Mart did not raise this\n\nprecise argument before the district court, and does not here\n\nexplain why the argument ought to change the outcome.     Indeed, the\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fargument may be nothing more than an attempt by Wal-Mart to get in\n\nthrough the back door that which will not fit in the front, namely,\n\nthe Ellerth-Faragher defense.       The argument may also be that the\n\ncompensatory damages awarded by the jury were excessive.\n\n           Whatever the argument may be, it must fail because the\n\nfactual underpinning -- that Arrieta failed to take advantage of\n\nthe open door policy -- is simply not supported by the record taken\n\nin the light most favorable to upholding the jury verdict. Arrieta\n\nmade numerous complaints about the harassment to his immediate\n\nsupervisors and the Personnel Department, and Wal-Mart had ample\n\nnotice of Arrieta's complaints.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n                             Arrieta's Appeal\n\n           Arrieta appeals from the denial of his post-verdict\n\nmotion that he be awarded equitable remedies of nearly five years\n\nof back pay and front pay.         We affirm.      Arrieta brought this\n\nsituation on himself.\n\n           As the district court correctly noted, in this circuit\n\nwhen the jury is asked, as here, to resolve issues of liability and\n\ncompensatory damages, the issue of back pay is normally decided by\n\nthe jury as well.   See Johnson, 364 F.3d at 379-80.         Here, Arrieta\n\ndid not advise the court before the jury was instructed that he\n\nwished to reserve the issue of back pay from the compensatory\n\ndamages   calculation   by   the   jury,   nor   did   he   object   to   the\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\finstructions on compensatory damages.        So the district court was\n\nnot put on notice that Arrieta wished to have the issue of back pay\n\ndecided by the court.     We are not inclined to hold the plaintiff\n\nharmless from the foreseeable consequences of his actions.            See\n\nSaldana Sanchez v. Vega Sosa, 175 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(rejecting plaintiff's claim for back pay where the plaintiff\n\nfailed to request an explicit instruction).\n\n          The district court went on to say that Arrieta had failed\n\nto provide evidence that he had looked for work or was unable to\n\nwork, and so he had not met the mitigation requirement for an\n\nequitable award of back pay.       We cannot say this was plain error,\n\neven giving plaintiff the benefit of plain error review rather than\n\nfinding that he had waived the issue.\n\n          As to front pay, the district court held it would not, on\n\nthe evidence before it, exercise its discretion to make an award.\n\n\"Front   pay   should   not   be   awarded   unless   reinstatement    is\n\nimpracticable or impossible.\" Johnson, 364 F.3d at 380. The court\n\nheld that Arrieta did not request reinstatement, and had set forth\n\nno evidence of impossibility or impracticability of reinstatement,\n\nof inability to work, or of work life expectancy.         There was no\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n                                    V.\n\n          We reject the appeals from both sides and affirm.           No\n\ncosts are awarded.\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\f",

(\"Wal-Mart\") on his disability discrimination claim under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the jury found Arrieta had proven that he had an impairment or was regarded as having an impairment which substantially limited his ability to perform a major life function. Arrieta's claimed impairment was a penile implant used to correct a sexual dysfunction: the implant itself left Arrieta with the appearance of a constant semi-erection. The jury also found that Arrieta was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his disability. Arrieta's claim was that, due to his condition, he was constantly harassed both by his supervisors and co-workers, and that when he complained to his supervisors, no corrective actions were taken. The jury found that Arrieta was constructively discharged; that is, that he resigned from Wal-Mart due to the intolerable working conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wal-Mart appeals from the verdict, arguing that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on an affirmative defense under <i>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998), and <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). Wal-Mart also makes two insufficiency of the evidence arguments as to liability: (1) that Arrieta was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA, in that his impairment neither affected a major life activity nor was related to working conditions; and (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support the existence of a hostile work environment. Of these, the most difficult issue is that of whether Arrieta was disabled within the meaning of the ADA. But Wal-Mart did not preserve the issue at trial and does not demonstrate circumstances that would warrant our taking the extraordinary step of reaching the merits of that issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wal-Mart also challenges the damages award, arguing (1) that the district court erred in its punitive damages instruction to the jury, (2) that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to award punitive damages, and (3) that Arrieta failed to mitigate his damages by taking advantage of Wal-Mart's open door policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta, in turn, appeals,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> arguing that the district court erred in denying his post-verdict motion seeking an additional award of back pay and front pay, adjudicated by the judge, not the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we affirm on both appeals, leaving all parties in the place the jury and the district court left them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts in the light most favorable to upholding the jury verdict as to the sufficiency challenge. <i>Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel,</i> 406 F.3d 43, 45 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta began working at Wal-Mart in 1992. At the time, he suffered from Peyronie's Disease, which made it impossible for him to have sexual intercourse. Arrieta had undergone unsuccessful surgery in 1992 to attempt to correct the problem. In February 1994 Arrieta underwent another surgery, during which the first implant was removed and a new penile prosthesis was implanted. The second procedure was successful, but had the side effect, common with this procedure, that Arrieta had a constant semi-erection that was apparent through his clothing. His doctor reported that Arrieta had no physical or mental impairment before going back to work. The complaints of harassment in this case concern the period after the February 1994 surgery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta filed paperwork with Wal-Mart's personnel department detailing the February 1994 procedure in order to obtain approval for medical coverage. Soon after returning to work after the surgery, Arrieta became the subject of harassment by his co-workers and supervisors. Three co-workers, the plaintiff, and supervisors all described the numerous incidents. On his first day back at work, Jorge Ortiz, an assistant manager, asked Arrieta \"how it felt to have [his] new pump.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> When Arrieta confronted Ortiz about where he got the information, the assistant manager told him that he learned about Arrieta's surgery from the \"girls in personnel.\" Arrieta complained to Mara Mieles, the personnel manager, about the release of information and the fact that Ortiz had taunted him about it, but Mieles said, \"I don't know what you're talking about, this is nonsense between guys, these are things between men.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta married his present wife on June 18, 1995. The taunting about Arrieta's surgery continued for the remaining years that Arrieta worked at Wal-Mart, and was constant. On the one hand, much of the harassment expressed the view that Arrieta was impotent, and that he needed to use a pump to get an erection. One of Arrieta's co-workers testified that he thought Arrieta was impotent \"[b]ecause according to what I know, a person who has had a little pump put in is because they are disabled as far as achieving an erection.\" Another co-worker testified that the jokes were \"regarding his age, saying that he needed to have a pump in order to have relations.... What they almost always used was the part regarding the pump, that he needed to use a pump.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, some harassing statements evidenced an impression that Arrieta was unusually enabled because of the implant. Assistant manager Ortiz once asked Arrieta, \"old man, I'm going to be going out with someone tomorrow, and I wanted to know if you'll let me borrow your pump.\" Another time, Ortiz asked Arrieta, \"Miguelito, did it work with your wife[?]\" On one occasion, someone used the store's paging system to announce \"that if [Arrieta] was close by to ask [Arrieta] to come to the warehouse to let him borrow a pump so that they could lift a pallet or a box.\" On another occasion, when Arrieta was visiting the personnel offices, a group of department managers in a meeting with personnel manager Mieles \"began making comments such as, there is Viagra Man. No, he's got force power.\" As to this event, Arrieta testified, \"I looked over at Miss Mieles, and I said this was the nonsense I was talking about four years ago.\" Mieles did not respond in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, with the implant, Arrieta was initially able to engage in intercourse with his wife. Later psychological depression, occasioned by the harassment, affected his sexual functioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assistant manager Ortiz and Jose Ramos, a support manager under Ortiz, were initiators of the comments about Arrieta's condition, according to the testimony of Rey Rodriguez, one of Arrieta's co-workers. During meetings at the beginning of the night shift, Ortiz \"would come into the warehouse with a joke regarding the pump.\" Rodriguez testified that Jose Ramos \"would use [the paging system] to make jokes regarding the pump.... [Ramos] said ... that Arrieta was ready with his baton.\" Another co-worker, Eliezer Ramos, recounted an incident between Arrieta and assistant manager Ortiz. Ortiz had been particularly offensive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Arrieta] had been away [on] his honeymoon, and two or three days later, ... I heard comments from [other employees] saying that [Arrieta] was upset with Jorge, because ... [Jorge] had asked [Arrieta] if the pump had not worked out with his wife, he should bring her to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eliezer Ramos also testified that Dennis Baerga, another assistant manager and yet a third supervisor of Arrieta, once said \"[L]ook, Miguel Arrieta's pump seems to be working\" within the presence of assistant manager Ortiz and Gilberto Rosa, who was a department manager for cosmetics, but not Arrieta's supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta's former supervisors, Ortiz and Jose Ramos, themselves admitted key facts.

Neither Ortiz nor Rosa took action in response to these complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence shows that Arrieta complained to superiors in his chain of command at Wal-Mart, up to the level of store manager.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At no level was effective corrective action taken. As Ortiz admitted, Arrieta complained to him about the taunting. Arrieta asked Ortiz if he could work apart from the other employees so he would not be subject to their taunting; Ortiz allowed this. Working apart from the other employees improved the situation somewhat. But Arrieta still was subject to harassment, especially as his shift was starting and ending, at which time he was more frequently in the presence of other workers. Arrieta also complained about the taunting to Rey Font, who was store manager from about 1995 to 1996, and asked if his shift could be changed. Font denied Arrieta's request, saying, \"look, Don Miguel, what do you want me to do, these are things going on between men, and what am I supposed to do; it's easier to get rid of one than to get rid of all of them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, Arrieta made another request that he be transferred from the overnight shift to the morning shift. This time, he directed his request to Benjamin Gomez, who was Font's replacement as store manager. He told Gomez that he \"was having trouble with the jokes made by the guys.\" Gomez, rather than transferring Arrieta to the morning shift, transferred him to the afternoon shift, which exacerbated the problem. Arrieta said that once the decision to transfer him was made, he could not decline. According to Arrieta, the change to the afternoon shift only made his problems worse &#8212; he was still being harassed, only this time the harassment occurred in front of customers in the store, rather than just fellow employees. He told Gomez this. In his resignation letter, Arrieta noted that when he had complained to Gomez about the change to the afternoon shift, Gomez responded \"in a mocking tone of voice and sarcastically\" that \"we are not here to make accommodations for anyone.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The harassment took an emotional toll on Arrieta. He had trouble sleeping, lost weight, and experienced a loss of libido to the point where he became unable to engage in sexual relations. On May 19, 1998, Arrieta complained to his urologist that he had a loss of sexual desire. The urologist found no physical reason for Arrieta's loss of libido, and so recommended that Arrieta see a psychiatrist or psychologist. On September 9 and October 5 of 1998, Arrieta consulted a psychiatrist, reporting loss of libido, loss of weight, and a depressive mood. The psychiatrist diagnosed Arrieta as having a dysthymic disorder with late onset. On February 5, 1999, the psychologist certified that Arrieta was disabled on account of dysthymic disorder and that such disability was not work related. Arrieta's wife, Nereida Olivencia, testified that when they got married they had plans to have children, but after Arrieta's problems began, that was no longer possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-workers also noticed a change for the worse in Arrieta. Rey Rodriguez testified, \"[Y]ou could see that Mr. Miguel Arrieta's emotional system wasn't working the same way anymore.\" Delio Crespo testified, \"At first, [Arrieta] used to share a lot with us, and after [a while], he withdrew from the group to the point where I had to ask about where he was, because I couldn't see him.\" Wal-Mart has an \"open door policy,\" which, according to Wal-Mart, \"permits any employee that has a grievance or is the object of illegal discrimination to complain[] to <i>any</i> supervisor, manager, officer or the president of the Company.\" (emphasis added). Wal-Mart admits that \"[p]ursuant to the `open door' policy, the grievance need not be reduced to writing; if an oral grievance is made, there is a duty to entertain it.\" The policy was not put into practice and a jury could easily find it existed only on paper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No recording by the company was ever made of Arrieta's complaints, including his complaints to the Personnel Department. In fact, Mieles, the personnel manager, acknowledged that there might not be any written record of an employee making use of the open door policy and that she had never even seen such a recording for any employee, much less one for Arrieta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the open door policy, the supervisors had affirmative obligations as well. Benjamin Gomez, in response to a question by Arrieta's counsel, agreed that \"any manager who would have heard or been present\" during the harassment \"would have had an obligation to investigate.\" No investigation was ever undertaken, although Arrieta had complained about the taunting to at least three supervisors in his immediate chain of command (assistant manager Ortiz, and store managers Font and Gomez), the personnel manager Mieles, and Rosa, who was not Arrieta's immediate supervisor but nonetheless a department manager. Arrieta had been taunted by at least three of his supervisors &#8212; assistant managers Baerga and Ortiz, and support manager Jose Ramos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta concluded it was futile to complain further to the supervisors: \"[T]hese jokes ... had been begun by supervisors themselves and had become commonplace. Who are you going to complain to?\" Delio Crespo, a co-worker, agreed. In reference to the taunting of Arrieta, Crespo stated: \"I didn't feel the need to ... contact any manager, because they were all present.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta explained that he decided not to escalate his complaints about the harassment to the Wal-Mart home office because of his prior experience with that office. He never received a response to a letter he had written to the home office in 1993 about how his work experience was not meeting his expectations. Arrieta wrote this letter \"because when you're given all the orientation and you're given all the chats, what would happen was actually totally opposite of the way it was supposed to be.\" Arrieta said, \"Since that letter was never answered, I never heard anything else about it. Then it seemed to me that with any other small incidents, it would just be wasting my time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, 1998, Arrieta filed a charge of discrimination before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor and Human Resources of Puerto Rico, alleging he had been subjected to a hostile work environment as a result of his age and medical condition. In his charge, Arrieta stated: \"Often, allusions are made to my medical record, and I am the object of jokes and remarks on the part of my [s]upervisors and coworkers. I am told that I am already old, that I need a new operation because the pump does not work and other remarks that allude to an operation that I underwent approximately 4 years ago. Mocking is continuous on the part of my coworkers and [s]upervisors....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta received two written reprimands after this date. On October 23, 1998, Arrieta was reprimanded for failing to secure keys which could be used to access and steal merchandise. Then, on November 2, 1998, Arrieta was reprimanded for working twenty-four minutes of overtime without the prior authorization of an assistant manager. Arrieta considered the reprimands to have been unwarranted and given in retaliation for his having filed a discrimination complaint with the EEOC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An undated document in evidence titled \"Exit Interview\" indicates that Arrieta's last day of work was November 2, 1998. While the record is not clear about the details of Arrieta's departure from Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart claims that Arrieta was given a leave of absence on that date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Arrieta formally resigned on May 12, 1999. He left \"because of [his] emotional state and ... the emotional state it was causing in [his] wife, and the fact that [he] had already submitted documentation and filed a complaint because of discrimination, and the fact that back in October when [he] had returned, they had begun planning or orchestrating a way to provide me with warnings.\" At his exit interview at Wal-Mart, Arrieta noted that he was resigning because he was \"constantly harrass[ed] by supervisor [and] co-workers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2000, the EEOC issued Arrieta a Notice of Right to Sue. Arrieta filed suit on June 21, 2000 against Wal-Mart, alleging violations of the ADA, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and several provisions of Puerto Rico law. On January 14, 2004, the district court granted Wal-Mart's motion for summary judgment as to Arrieta's claims under the ADEA, but allowed Arrieta's hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims under the ADA and state law to go to jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, both Arrieta and Wal-Mart submitted proposed jury instructions. Wal-Mart proposed the following instruction regarding its anti-discrimination policy, as part of a broader instruction on the required elements of a hostile work environment claim:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant, however, has what it calls the Open Doors Policy as part of the anti-discrimination policy of Wal-Mart; this procedure has been instituted to vent any serious grievance. In furthering this policy, Wal-Mart submitted evidence that it has implemented continuous training procedures wherein it emphasizes the respect for the individual, the illegality of discrimination and the importance for Associates of utilizing the Open Doors Policy when such recourse is necessary. The defendant claims that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. If you find that such is the case, in this regard you must find for the defendant, because the plaintiff failed to place the defendant on notice of any grievance that he may have had, and therefore did not place the defendant in a position to do anything on the subject of this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the eighth day of trial, counsel for both sides convened with the judge in his conference room to review the instructions. Later, when the judge instructed the jury, Wal-Mart's requested instruction regarding the open door policy was not given. Wal-Mart, which has raised on appeal the issues regarding the jury instructions, has not provided us a transcript of the pre-charge discussions. Wal-Mart has pointed us to two instances in the record where it made clear its objections to the instructions, and both occurred after the jury had heard the instructions. The first objection was made immediately after the charge to the jury. The transcript of this post-charge discussion is fairly sparse, and refers to pre-charge discussions that are not in the record. The next objection was made in Wal-Mart's post-verdict motion. Those objections are described later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta, for his part, requested only one additional instruction, which sought to avoid having the jury draw a negative inference from the fact that the EEOC did not make any determination on Arrieta's complaint; this proposed instruction was denied. Arrieta made no other objections to the instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of Arrieta's case in chief, Wal-Mart moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 on the grounds that Arrieta had failed to establish that he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA. However, Wal-Mart failed to renew its motion at the close of all the evidence. On January 30, 2004, the jury returned a verdict in Arrieta's favor on the ADA claims and in Wal-Mart's favor on the state law claims, and awarded Arrieta compensatory damages of $76,000 and punitive damages of $160,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Wal-Mart and Arrieta made post-judgment motions. Wal-Mart sought judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 (this time, raising the claim that Arrieta had not established that he was disabled under the ADA), a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59, or vacation of the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). Arrieta sought an award of back pay and front pay. The district court denied both parties' motions for reasons discussed below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Wal-Mart's Appeal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Jury Instruction on Ellerth-Faragher Defense</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves evidence of both harassment by supervisors and harassment by co-workers. In two companion cases decided in 1998, the Supreme Court addressed the question of an employer's vicarious liability for actionable discrimination by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the plaintiff employee. <i>Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633; <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to <i>Ellerth</i> and <i>Faragher,</i> cases had established the standard for employer liability for co-worker harassment of the plaintiff employee. Ordinarily, where the harassment is by a non-supervisory co-worker, the employer is liable only if the plaintiff can show that the employer \"knew or should have known of the charged ... harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate action.\" <i>Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 387, 401 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>White v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to actionable discrimination by supervisors, <i>Faragher</i> articulated some clear lines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) \"An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Where \"no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) \"No affirmative defense is available ... when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 808, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) The affirmative defense, when available, \"comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any ... harassing behavior, and (b)that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" <i>Id.</i> at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275. The employer bears the burden of proof as to both elements. <i>Id.</i> at 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) As to the first element of the defense, proof of an anti-harassment policy with a complaint procedure available to employees, while not necessarily dispositive, is relevant. <i>Id.</i> at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) As to the second element of the defense, proof that the employee failed to meet his obligation of using reasonable care is not limited to an unreasonable failure to use such a procedure, although such proof will normally suffice to meet the employer's burden. <i>Id.</i> at 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275. <i>See also Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc.,</i> 333 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 20 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After <i>Ellerth</i> and <i>Faragher,</i> the question that arose was whether a constructive discharge, occasioned by supervisor harassment so severe it was intolerable, constituted a per se <i>tangible</i> employment action so as to preclude the assertion of the <i>Faragher</i> affirmative defense. This court addressed the question in <i>Reed. See</i> 333 F.3d at 32-33. As is often our wont, we said that while other circuits had adopted hard and fast per se rules as to whether a constructive discharge was or was not a tangible employment action, we would not adopt such a rule. <i>Id.</i> at 33 (\"[W]e see no reason to adopt a blanket rule one way or the other. Here, it is clear to us that the constructive discharge label cannot be used to preclude the affirmative defense.\"). Instead, we focused on whether the supervisor's action was an \"official action\" comprising the kind of tangible employment action (e.g., discharge, reduction in pay) that the Supreme Court appeared to have in mind. <i>Id. Reed</i> did allow for the possibility that, on other facts, the affirmative defense as to supervisor harassment could be precluded in a constructive discharge case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court addressed the same issue in <i>Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders,</i> 542 U.S. 129, 124 S.Ct. 2342, 159 L.Ed.2d 204 (2004), adopting a test similar to that in <i>Reed. Suders</i> held that constructive discharge is not a per se \"tangible employment action.\" Rather, it held that a \"tangible employment action\" was an \"official act,\" that is, \"an employer-sanctioned adverse action officially changing [the employee's] employment status or situation, for example, a humiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in which [the employee] would face unbearable working conditions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 131, 134, 124 S.Ct. 2342. Such an official act can both precipitate an employee's constructive discharge and be a \"tangible employment action\" that would preclude the employer's resort to the <i>Faragher</i> defense. <i>See id.</i> at 148-49, 124 S.Ct. 2342.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the evidence shows that the defendant cannot prove an affirmative defense under the <i>Faragher</i> standard, there is no reason to remand for the giving of a <i>Faragher</i> instruction. <i>See O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 736 (1st Cir.2001). Indeed, in <i>Faragher</i> itself, the Supreme Court declined to remand because the factual findings made in the trial court demonstrated that the employer was not, on the evidence, entitled to the defense. 524 U.S. at 808-10, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the court instructed the jury on January 29, 2004, rejecting defendant's proposed <i>Ellerth-Faragher</i> instruction. At that time, <i>Suders</i> had not yet been decided, but <i>Reed</i> had been. Nonetheless, Wal-Mart did not ask for an instruction on whether a tangible employment action, or a \"tangible event\" as that term is defined by <i>Reed,</i> had taken place. Instead, Wal-Mart's instruction assumed there was no tangible employment action and that it was entitled to assert the <i>Ellerth-Faragher</i> defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its ruling on the post-judgment motion the court said it had declined to give the proposed instruction because the <i>Ellerth-Faragher</i> defense was not applicable. The court found, in essence, that no reasonable jury could have concluded that either element of the defense had been met. First, the court noted that the open door policy existed on paper, but had not been put into practice. Indeed, when Arrieta complained to the Personnel Department and to several supervisors, no corrective actions were taken and his complaints were not even recorded. Second, the evidence was that Arrieta had reasonably availed himself of the procedures and the company had more than sufficient notice of the problems.

The instruction the court gave placed the burden on the plaintiff to show not only that his work conditions were intolerable but also that his employer knew or should have known about the intolerable conditions and deliberately allowed them to recur. Thus, whether or not the supervisors themselves engaged in harassment, the supervisors, including Wal-Mart's own personnel department, were well aware of the co-worker harassment and chose to let it occur, providing another basis for Wal-Mart's liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence Challenges to Verdict</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Finding Arrieta Was Disabled Within the Meaning of ADA</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were we forced to squarely confront it, the question of whether Arrieta suffered from a disability or was regarded as having a disability within the meaning of the ADA, as found by the jury, would be a difficult one.

The court reasoned that it was up to the jury to weigh each side's characterization of Wal-Mart's open door policy.

Horace Mann Ins. Co.,</i> 390 F.3d 138, 144 (1st Cir.2004). If the district court committed an error of law, such as an improper instruction harmful to the outcome of the case, that would be an abuse of discretion. Even if an instruction was erroneous, we ask whether we can say with fair assurance that the jury verdict was likely unaffected. <i>See Putnam Res. v. Pateman,</i> 958 F.2d 448, 471 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to punitive damages, the district court instructed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to find punitive damages, you must find that the acts of the Defendant which proximately caused actual damages to the Plaintiff were maliciously or wantonly done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you so find, you may add to the award of actual damages such amount as you shall agree to be proper as punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An act or failure to act is maliciously done if prompted or accompanied by ill-will, spite or grudge, either toward the injured person individually or towards all persons in one or more groups or categories of which the injured person is a member. An act or failure to act is wantonly done if done in reckless or callous disregard of, or indifference to the rights of one or more persons, including the injured person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this is not a precise <i>Kolstad</i> instruction, it is close. As this court said in <i>Romano v. U-Haul Int'l,</i> 233 F.3d 655 (1st Cir.2000), in <i>Kolstad</i> the Supreme Court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]n employer may be liable for punitive damages under Title VII in four instances: (1) when the agent has been authorized by the principal to commit the misconduct in question; (2) when the principal recklessly employed the unfit agent; (3) when the agent, acting in a managerial capacity, committed the misconduct within the scope of the employment; or (4) when the agent's bad act was subsequently approved by the principal. The Court limited the reach of the third situation by absolving an employer from liability for punitive damages if a good-faith effort to comply with the requirements of Title VII is made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 669 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wal-Mart's objection to the instruction, both before the district court and on appeal, is unclear. Wal-Mart does not argue that the district court's instruction was erroneous because it did not mention the good-faith aspect of <i>Kolstad.</i> Rather, Wal-Mart argues that because it had provided ample evidence of its open door policy, \"Arrieta's supervisors' misconduct could not be imputed to Wal-Mart and the instructions to the jury should not have been given.\" In sum, Wal-Mart's position appears to be that, as a matter of law, punitive damages are unavailable if there is <i>any</i> evidence of good-faith efforts by the employer to comply with the law. Wal-Mart's position is wrong and would allow companies to pay lip service to the law while blatantly violating it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty for Wal-Mart is that the Supreme Court did not adopt a test that <i>any evidence</i> of a good-faith effort could shield it from liability; rather, it required a finding of a good-faith effort to comply with the law. On these facts, a jury could easily conclude that the open door policy was a sham designed to give the appearance, but not the reality, of an effort to comply with the law, and that Wal-Mart acted with reckless disregard of Arrieta's rights. <i>Goya,</i> 304 F.3d at 30; <i>Romano,</i> 233 F.3d at 670.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves Wal-Mart's argument that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to award punitive damages. Wal-Mart argues that any conscious wrongdoing by supervisors could not be imputed to Wal-Mart because there was a lack of evidence that the managers who taunted Arrieta and ignored his complaints were acting within the scope of their employment. We reject this argument; we agree with the district court that, on these facts, a reasonable jury could have found that the supervisors were acting in the scope of their employment. We agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could award punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Mitigation of Damages</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wal-Mart argues that Arrieta \"failed to mitigate [his damages] when he failed to avail himself of Wal-Mart's grievance procedures against discrimination.\" Wal-Mart did not raise this precise argument before the district court, and does not here explain why the argument ought to change the outcome. Indeed, the argument may be nothing more than an attempt by Wal-Mart to get in through the back door that which will not fit in the front, namely, the <i>Ellerth-Faragher</i> defense. The argument may also be that the compensatory damages awarded by the jury were excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the argument may be, it must fail because the factual underpinning &#8212; that Arrieta failed to take advantage of the open door policy &#8212; is simply not supported by the record taken in the light most favorable to upholding the jury verdict. Arrieta made numerous complaints about the harassment to his immediate supervisors and the Personnel Department, and Wal-Mart had ample notice of Arrieta's complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Arrieta's Appeal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta appeals from the denial of his post-verdict motion that he be awarded equitable remedies of nearly five years of back pay and front pay. We affirm. Arrieta brought this situation on himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly noted, in this circuit when the jury is asked, as here, to resolve issues of liability and compensatory damages, the issue of back pay is normally decided by the jury as well. <i>See Johnson,</i> 364 F.3d at 379-80. Here, Arrieta did not advise the court before the jury was instructed that he wished to reserve the issue of back pay from the compensatory damages calculation by the jury, nor did he object to the instructions on compensatory damages. So the district court was not put on notice that Arrieta wished to have the issue of back pay decided by the court. We are not inclined to hold the plaintiff harmless from the foreseeable consequences of his actions. <i>See Saldana Sanchez v. Vega Sosa,</i> 175 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir.1999) (rejecting plaintiff's claim for back pay where the plaintiff failed to request an explicit instruction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to say that Arrieta had failed to provide evidence that he had looked for work or was unable to work, and so he had not met the mitigation requirement for an equitable award of back pay. We cannot say this was plain error, even giving plaintiff the benefit of plain error review rather than finding that he had waived the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to front pay, the district court held it would not, on the evidence before it, exercise its discretion to make an award. \"Front pay should not be awarded unless reinstatement is impracticable or impossible.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 364 F.3d at 380. The court held that Arrieta did not request reinstatement, and had set forth no evidence of impossibility or impracticability of reinstatement, of inability to work, or of work life expectancy. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the appeals from both sides and <i>affirm.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The jury also concluded that Wal-Mart had not violated Law 44 of July 2, 1995, P.R.

Assistant managers, such as Ortiz and Baerga, report to the store manager. Support managers, like Jose Ramos, report to an assistant manager. Department managers, like Gilberto Rosa, fall below support managers, and have supervisory duties. Arrieta testified that Rosa, although not his supervisor, was nonetheless above him in Wal-Mart's hierarchy</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Arrieta represented in his brief that he also contacted Wal-Mart's telephone help line.

In support, Wal-Mart points to a letter in the record written by Arrieta to the Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida (COSVI), a Puerto Rico governmental agency. That letter does not make mention of harassment. But there is nothing in this document itself or in the transcript of the trial proceedings to connect this letter to a request for a leave of absence. Also in evidence was a request for a leave of absence filled out by Arrieta in August 1998, in which Arrieta requested a personal leave of absence for \"[h]ealth problems in the family.\" According to Arrieta, he was given this leave of absence in September 1998 for his own illness. Thus, this particular document also seems unrelated to any leave of absence commencing in November, and Wal-Mart does not assert that it is related</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We note that this circuit has never squarely answered the question of whether hostile work environment claims are cognizable under the ADA. Wal-Mart addressed the issue before the district court, but does not press the issue here, and so we proceed on the assumption that such a claim is cognizable<i>See Rocafort v. IBM Corp.,</i> 334 F.3d 115, 120-22 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Wal-Mart raised the same argument in a Rule 60(b)(6) motion<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6).

Arrieta's claimed impairment was a penile implant used to correct a sexual dysfunction: the implant itself left Arrieta with the appearance of a constant semi-erection. The jury also found that Arrieta was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his disability. Arrieta's claim was that, due to his condition, he was constantly harassed both by his supervisors and co-workers, and that when he complained to his supervisors, no corrective actions were taken. The jury found that Arrieta was constructively discharged; that is, that he resigned from Wal-Mart due to the intolerable working conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wal-Mart appeals from the verdict, arguing that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on an affirmative defense under <i>Burlington Industries, Inc. v.

Wal-Mart also makes two insufficiency of the evidence arguments as to liability: (1) that Arrieta was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA, in that his impairment neither affected a major life activity nor was related to working conditions; and (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support the existence of a hostile work environment. Of these, the most difficult issue is that of whether Arrieta was disabled within the meaning of the ADA.

At the time, he suffered from Peyronie's Disease, which made it impossible for him to have sexual intercourse. Arrieta had undergone unsuccessful surgery in 1992 to attempt to correct the problem. In February 1994 Arrieta underwent another surgery, during which the first implant was removed and a new penile prosthesis was implanted. The second procedure was successful, but had the side effect, common with this procedure, that Arrieta had a constant semi-erection that was apparent through his clothing. His doctor reported that Arrieta had no physical or mental impairment before going back to work. The complaints of harassment in this case concern the period after the February 1994 surgery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta filed paperwork with Wal-Mart's personnel department detailing the February 1994 procedure in order to obtain approval for medical coverage. Soon after returning to work after the surgery, Arrieta became the subject of harassment by his co-workers and supervisors. Three co-workers, the plaintiff, and supervisors all described the numerous incidents. On his first day back at work, Jorge Ortiz, an assistant manager, asked Arrieta \"how it felt to have [his] new pump.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> When Arrieta confronted Ortiz about where he got the information, the assistant manager told him that he learned about Arrieta's surgery from the \"girls in personnel.\" Arrieta complained to Mara Mieles, the personnel manager, about the release of information and the fact that Ortiz had taunted him about it, but Mieles said, \"I don't know what you're talking about, this is nonsense between guys, these are things between men.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta married his present wife on June 18, 1995. The taunting about Arrieta's surgery continued for the remaining years that Arrieta worked at Wal-Mart, and was constant. On the one hand, much of the harassment expressed the view that Arrieta was impotent, and that he needed to use a pump to get an erection. One of Arrieta's co-workers testified that he thought Arrieta was impotent \"[b]ecause according to what I know, a person who has had a little pump put in is because they are disabled as far as achieving an erection.\" Another co-worker testified that the jokes were \"regarding his age, saying that he needed to have a pump in order to have relations.... What they almost always used was the part regarding the pump, that he needed to use a pump.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, some harassing statements evidenced an impression that Arrieta was unusually enabled because of the implant. Assistant manager Ortiz once asked Arrieta, \"old man, I'm going to be going out with someone tomorrow, and I wanted to know if you'll let me borrow your pump.\" Another time, Ortiz asked Arrieta, \"Miguelito, did it work with your wife[?]\" On one occasion, someone used the store's paging system to announce \"that if [Arrieta] was close by to ask [Arrieta] to come to the warehouse to let him borrow a pump so that they could lift a pallet or a box.\" On another occasion, when Arrieta was visiting the personnel offices, a group of department managers in a meeting with personnel manager Mieles \"began making comments such as, there is Viagra Man. No, he's got force power.\" As to this event, Arrieta testified, \"I looked over at Miss Mieles, and I said this was the nonsense I was talking about four years ago.\" Mieles did not respond in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, with the implant, Arrieta was initially able to engage in intercourse with his wife. Later psychological depression, occasioned by the harassment, affected his sexual functioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assistant manager Ortiz and Jose Ramos, a support manager under Ortiz, were initiators of the comments about Arrieta's condition, according to the testimony of Rey Rodriguez, one of Arrieta's co-workers. During meetings at the beginning of the night shift, Ortiz \"would come into the warehouse with a joke regarding the pump.\" Rodriguez testified that Jose Ramos \"would use [the paging system] to make jokes regarding the pump.... [Ramos] said ... that Arrieta was ready with his baton.\" Another co-worker, Eliezer Ramos, recounted an incident between Arrieta and assistant manager Ortiz. Ortiz had been particularly offensive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Arrieta] had been away [on] his honeymoon, and two or three days later, ... I heard comments from [other employees] saying that [Arrieta] was upset with Jorge, because ... [Jorge] had asked [Arrieta] if the pump had not worked out with his wife, he should bring her to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eliezer Ramos also testified that Dennis Baerga, another assistant manager and yet a third supervisor of Arrieta, once said \"[L]ook, Miguel Arrieta's pump seems to be working\" within the presence of assistant manager Ortiz and Gilberto Rosa, who was a department manager for cosmetics, but not Arrieta's supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta's former supervisors, Ortiz and Jose Ramos, themselves admitted key facts. Support manager Jose Ramos admitted participating in the taunting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well, about what could be heard and all the fooling around they had going on in there, ... <i>where I did participate in those jokes,</i> well, about a condition that was very pronounced under his pants, then ... like everyone else, they started to make jokes with him [saying] Miguel, what is it that you've got there, come here....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assistant manager Ortiz acknowledged that he was aware of the taunting, and that Arrieta had complained to him about it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Isn't it true that Mr. Arrieta also [on] many occasions went to you to complain about the jokes?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: About the jokes, I remember only one time....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Isn't it true, Mr. Jorge Ortiz, that employees would see Mr. Arrieta's erection and would joke and laugh about his pump?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: That is correct, with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Isn't it true, Mr. Jorge Ortiz, that upon the question of your attorney, you answered that if an inappropriate conduct or a disrespectful conduct was taken to you, you had the duty to immediately report it to your supervisor or store manager?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, that is correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And Mr. Arrieta did complain to you, didn't he?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, that is correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz also admitted knowing that Arrieta went to department manager Gilberto Rosa to complain. Neither Ortiz nor Rosa took action in response to these complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence shows that Arrieta complained to superiors in his chain of command at Wal-Mart, up to the level of store manager.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At no level was effective corrective action taken. As Ortiz admitted, Arrieta complained to him about the taunting. Arrieta asked Ortiz if he could work apart from the other employees so he would not be subject to their taunting; Ortiz allowed this. Working apart from the other employees improved the situation somewhat. But Arrieta still was subject to harassment, especially as his shift was starting and ending, at which time he was more frequently in the presence of other workers. Arrieta also complained about the taunting to Rey Font, who was store manager from about 1995 to 1996, and asked if his shift could be changed. Font denied Arrieta's request, saying, \"look, Don Miguel, what do you want me to do, these are things going on between men, and what am I supposed to do; it's easier to get rid of one than to get rid of all of them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, Arrieta made another request that he be transferred from the overnight shift to the morning shift. This time, he directed his request to Benjamin Gomez, who was Font's replacement as store manager. He told Gomez that he \"was having trouble with the jokes made by the guys.\" Gomez, rather than transferring Arrieta to the morning shift, transferred him to the afternoon shift, which exacerbated the problem. Arrieta said that once the decision to transfer him was made, he could not decline. According to Arrieta, the change to the afternoon shift only made his problems worse &#8212; he was still being harassed, only this time the harassment occurred in front of customers in the store, rather than just fellow employees. He told Gomez this. In his resignation letter, Arrieta noted that when he had complained to Gomez about the change to the afternoon shift, Gomez responded \"in a mocking tone of voice and sarcastically\" that \"we are not here to make accommodations for anyone.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The harassment took an emotional toll on Arrieta. He had trouble sleeping, lost weight, and experienced a loss of libido to the point where he became unable to engage in sexual relations. On May 19, 1998, Arrieta complained to his urologist that he had a loss of sexual desire. The urologist found no physical reason for Arrieta's loss of libido, and so recommended that Arrieta see a psychiatrist or psychologist. On September 9 and October 5 of 1998, Arrieta consulted a psychiatrist, reporting loss of libido, loss of weight, and a depressive mood. The psychiatrist diagnosed Arrieta as having a dysthymic disorder with late onset. On February 5, 1999, the psychologist certified that Arrieta was disabled on account of dysthymic disorder and that such disability was not work related. Arrieta's wife, Nereida Olivencia, testified that when they got married they had plans to have children, but after Arrieta's problems began, that was no longer possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-workers also noticed a change for the worse in Arrieta. Rey Rodriguez testified, \"[Y]ou could see that Mr. Miguel Arrieta's emotional system wasn't working the same way anymore.\" Delio Crespo testified, \"At first, [Arrieta] used to share a lot with us, and after [a while], he withdrew from the group to the point where I had to ask about where he was, because I couldn't see him.\" Wal-Mart has an \"open door policy,\" which, according to Wal-Mart, \"permits any employee that has a grievance or is the object of illegal discrimination to complain[] to <i>any</i> supervisor, manager, officer or the president of the Company.\" (emphasis added). Wal-Mart admits that \"[p]ursuant to the `open door' policy, the grievance need not be reduced to writing; if an oral grievance is made, there is a duty to entertain it.\" The policy was not put into practice and a jury could easily find it existed only on paper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No recording by the company was ever made of Arrieta's complaints, including his complaints to the Personnel Department. In fact, Mieles, the personnel manager, acknowledged that there might not be any written record of an employee making use of the open door policy and that she had never even seen such a recording for any employee, much less one for Arrieta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the open door policy, the supervisors had affirmative obligations as well. Benjamin Gomez, in response to a question by Arrieta's counsel, agreed that \"any manager who would have heard or been present\" during the harassment \"would have had an obligation to investigate.\" No investigation was ever undertaken, although Arrieta had complained about the taunting to at least three supervisors in his immediate chain of command (assistant manager Ortiz, and store managers Font and Gomez), the personnel manager Mieles, and Rosa, who was not Arrieta's immediate supervisor but nonetheless a department manager. Arrieta had been taunted by at least three of his supervisors &#8212; assistant managers Baerga and Ortiz, and support manager Jose Ramos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta concluded it was futile to complain further to the supervisors: \"[T]hese jokes ... had been begun by supervisors themselves and had become commonplace. Who are you going to complain to?\" Delio Crespo, a co-worker, agreed. In reference to the taunting of Arrieta, Crespo stated: \"I didn't feel the need to ... contact any manager, because they were all present.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta explained that he decided not to escalate his complaints about the harassment to the Wal-Mart home office because of his prior experience with that office. He never received a response to a letter he had written to the home office in 1993 about how his work experience was not meeting his expectations. Arrieta wrote this letter \"because when you're given all the orientation and you're given all the chats, what would happen was actually totally opposite of the way it was supposed to be.\" Arrieta said, \"Since that letter was never answered, I never heard anything else about it. Then it seemed to me that with any other small incidents, it would just be wasting my time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, 1998, Arrieta filed a charge of discrimination before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor and Human Resources of Puerto Rico, alleging he had been subjected to a hostile work environment as a result of his age and medical condition. In his charge, Arrieta stated: \"Often, allusions are made to my medical record, and I am the object of jokes and remarks on the part of my [s]upervisors and coworkers. I am told that I am already old, that I need a new operation because the pump does not work and other remarks that allude to an operation that I underwent approximately 4 years ago. Mocking is continuous on the part of my coworkers and [s]upervisors....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta received two written reprimands after this date. On October 23, 1998, Arrieta was reprimanded for failing to secure keys which could be used to access and steal merchandise. Then, on November 2, 1998, Arrieta was reprimanded for working twenty-four minutes of overtime without the prior authorization of an assistant manager. Arrieta considered the reprimands to have been unwarranted and given in retaliation for his having filed a discrimination complaint with the EEOC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An undated document in evidence titled \"Exit Interview\" indicates that Arrieta's last day of work was November 2, 1998. While the record is not clear about the details of Arrieta's departure from Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart claims that Arrieta was given a leave of absence on that date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Arrieta formally resigned on May 12, 1999. He left \"because of [his] emotional state and ... the emotional state it was causing in [his] wife, and the fact that [he] had already submitted documentation and filed a complaint because of discrimination, and the fact that back in October when [he] had returned, they had begun planning or orchestrating a way to provide me with warnings.\" At his exit interview at Wal-Mart, Arrieta noted that he was resigning because he was \"constantly harrass[ed] by supervisor [and] co-workers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2000, the EEOC issued Arrieta a Notice of Right to Sue. Arrieta filed suit on June 21, 2000 against Wal-Mart, alleging violations of the ADA, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and several provisions of Puerto Rico law. On January 14, 2004, the district court granted Wal-Mart's motion for summary judgment as to Arrieta's claims under the ADEA, but allowed Arrieta's hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims under the ADA and state law to go to jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, both Arrieta and Wal-Mart submitted proposed jury instructions. Wal-Mart proposed the following instruction regarding its anti-discrimination policy, as part of a broader instruction on the required elements of a hostile work environment claim:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant, however, has what it calls the Open Doors Policy as part of the anti-discrimination policy of Wal-Mart; this procedure has been instituted to vent any serious grievance. In furthering this policy, Wal-Mart submitted evidence that it has implemented continuous training procedures wherein it emphasizes the respect for the individual, the illegality of discrimination and the importance for Associates of utilizing the Open Doors Policy when such recourse is necessary. The defendant claims that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. If you find that such is the case, in this regard you must find for the defendant, because the plaintiff failed to place the defendant on notice of any grievance that he may have had, and therefore did not place the defendant in a position to do anything on the subject of this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the eighth day of trial, counsel for both sides convened with the judge in his conference room to review the instructions. Later, when the judge instructed the jury, Wal-Mart's requested instruction regarding the open door policy was not given. Wal-Mart, which has raised on appeal the issues regarding the jury instructions, has not provided us a transcript of the pre-charge discussions. Wal-Mart has pointed us to two instances in the record where it made clear its objections to the instructions, and both occurred after the jury had heard the instructions. The first objection was made immediately after the charge to the jury. The transcript of this post-charge discussion is fairly sparse, and refers to pre-charge discussions that are not in the record. The next objection was made in Wal-Mart's post-verdict motion. Those objections are described later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta, for his part, requested only one additional instruction, which sought to avoid having the jury draw a negative inference from the fact that the EEOC did not make any determination on Arrieta's complaint; this proposed instruction was denied. Arrieta made no other objections to the instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of Arrieta's case in chief, Wal-Mart moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 on the grounds that Arrieta had failed to establish that he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA. However, Wal-Mart failed to renew its motion at the close of all the evidence. On January 30, 2004, the jury returned a verdict in Arrieta's favor on the ADA claims and in Wal-Mart's favor on the state law claims, and awarded Arrieta compensatory damages of $76,000 and punitive damages of $160,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Wal-Mart and Arrieta made post-judgment motions. Wal-Mart sought judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 (this time, raising the claim that Arrieta had not established that he was disabled under the ADA), a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59, or vacation of the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6).

This court addressed the question in <i>Reed. See</i> 333 F.3d at 32-33. As is often our wont, we said that while other circuits had adopted hard and fast per se rules as to whether a constructive discharge was or was not a tangible employment action, we would not adopt such a rule. <i>Id.</i> at 33 (\"[W]e see no reason to adopt a blanket rule one way or the other. Here, it is clear to us that the constructive discharge label cannot be used to preclude the affirmative defense.\"). Instead, we focused on whether the supervisor's action was an \"official action\" comprising the kind of tangible employment action (e.g., discharge, reduction in pay) that the Supreme Court appeared to have in mind. <i>Id. Reed</i> did allow for the possibility that, on other facts, the affirmative defense as to supervisor harassment could be precluded in a constructive discharge case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court addressed the same issue in <i>Pennsylvania State Police v.

Indeed, in <i>Faragher</i> itself, the Supreme Court declined to remand because the factual findings made in the trial court demonstrated that the employer was not, on the evidence, entitled to the defense. 524 U.S. at 808-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At that time, <i>Suders</i> had not yet been decided, but <i>Reed</i> had been. Nonetheless, Wal-Mart did not ask for an instruction on whether a tangible employment action, or a \"tangible event\" as that term is defined by <i>Reed,</i> had taken place. Instead, Wal-Mart's instruction assumed there was no tangible employment action and that it was entitled to assert the <i>Ellerth-Faragher</i> defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its ruling on the post-judgment motion the court said it had declined to give the proposed instruction because the <i>Ellerth-Faragher</i> defense was not applicable. The court found, in essence, that no reasonable jury could have concluded that either element of the defense had been met. First, the court noted that the open door policy existed on paper, but had not been put into practice. Indeed, when Arrieta complained to the Personnel Department and to several supervisors, no corrective actions were taken and his complaints were not even recorded. Second, the evidence was that Arrieta had reasonably availed himself of the procedures and the company had more than sufficient notice of the problems. We can find no reversible error; as in <i>Faragher,</i> the evidence did not support giving the instruction, irrespective of whether Wal-Mart's conduct amounted to a tangible employment action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record there is and can be no assertion the jury was misled or that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The instruction the court gave placed the burden on the plaintiff to show not only that his work conditions were intolerable but also that his employer knew or should have known about the intolerable conditions and deliberately allowed them to recur. Thus, whether or not the supervisors themselves engaged in harassment, the supervisors, including Wal-Mart's own personnel department, were well aware of the co-worker harassment and chose to let it occur, providing another basis for Wal-Mart's liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence Challenges to Verdict</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Finding Arrieta Was Disabled Within the Meaning of ADA</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were we forced to squarely confront it, the question of whether Arrieta suffered from a disability or was regarded as having a disability within the meaning of the ADA, as found by the jury, would be a difficult one.

The court reasoned that it was up to the jury to weigh each side's characterization of Wal-Mart's open door policy. The jury chose to believe Arrieta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the denial of the motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) is for abuse of discretion. <i>McCord v.

If the district court committed an error of law, such as an improper instruction harmful to the outcome of the case, that would be an abuse of discretion. Even if an instruction was erroneous, we ask whether we can say with fair assurance that the jury verdict was likely unaffected. <i>See Putnam Res. v. Pateman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579198\"><a href=\"/opinion/579198/putnam-resources-v-ronald-m-pateman-ronald-m-pateman-v-frenkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 471 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to punitive damages, the district court instructed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to find punitive damages, you must find that the acts of the Defendant which proximately caused actual damages to the Plaintiff were maliciously or wantonly done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you so find, you may add to the award of actual damages such amount as you shall agree to be proper as punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An act or failure to act is maliciously done if prompted or accompanied by ill-will, spite or grudge, either toward the injured person individually or towards all persons in one or more groups or categories of which the injured person is a member. An act or failure to act is wantonly done if done in reckless or callous disregard of, or indifference to the rights of one or more persons, including the injured person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this is not a precise <i>Kolstad</i> instruction, it is close. As this court said in <i>Romano v. U-Haul Int'l,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771255\"><a href=\"/opinion/771255/karen-romano-v-u-haul-international-u-haul-company-of-maine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000), in <i>Kolstad</i> the Supreme Court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]n employer may be liable for punitive damages under Title VII in four instances: (1) when the agent has been authorized by the principal to commit the misconduct in question; (2) when the principal recklessly employed the unfit agent; (3) when the agent, acting in a managerial capacity, committed the misconduct within the scope of the employment; or (4) when the agent's bad act was subsequently approved by the principal. The Court limited the reach of the third situation by absolving an employer from liability for punitive damages if a good-faith effort to comply with the requirements of Title VII is made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 669 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wal-Mart's objection to the instruction, both before the district court and on appeal, is unclear. Wal-Mart does not argue that the district court's instruction was erroneous because it did not mention the good-faith aspect of <i>Kolstad.</i> Rather, Wal-Mart argues that because it had provided ample evidence of its open door policy, \"Arrieta's supervisors' misconduct could not be imputed to Wal-Mart and the instructions to the jury should not have been given.\" In sum, Wal-Mart's position appears to be that, as a matter of law, punitive damages are unavailable if there is <i>any</i> evidence of good-faith efforts by the employer to comply with the law. Wal-Mart's position is wrong and would allow companies to pay lip service to the law while blatantly violating it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty for Wal-Mart is that the Supreme Court did not adopt a test that <i>any evidence</i> of a good-faith effort could shield it from liability; rather, it required a finding of a good-faith effort to comply with the law. On these facts, a jury could easily conclude that the open door policy was a sham designed to give the appearance, but not the reality, of an effort to comply with the law, and that Wal-Mart acted with reckless disregard of Arrieta's rights. <i>Goya,</i> 304 F.3d at 30; <i>Romano,</i> 233 F.3d at 670.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves Wal-Mart's argument that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to award punitive damages. Wal-Mart argues that any conscious wrongdoing by supervisors could not be imputed to Wal-Mart because there was a lack of evidence that the managers who taunted Arrieta and ignored his complaints were acting within the scope of their employment. We reject this argument; we agree with the district court that, on these facts, a reasonable jury could have found that the supervisors were acting in the scope of their employment. We agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could award punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Mitigation of Damages</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wal-Mart argues that Arrieta \"failed to mitigate [his damages] when he failed to avail himself of Wal-Mart's grievance procedures against discrimination.\" Wal-Mart did not raise this precise argument before the district court, and does not here explain why the argument ought to change the outcome. Indeed, the argument may be nothing more than an attempt by Wal-Mart to get in through the back door that which will not fit in the front, namely, the <i>Ellerth-Faragher</i> defense. The argument may also be that the compensatory damages awarded by the jury were excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the argument may be, it must fail because the factual underpinning &#8212; that Arrieta failed to take advantage of the open door policy &#8212; is simply not supported by the record taken in the light most favorable to upholding the jury verdict. Arrieta made numerous complaints about the harassment to his immediate supervisors and the Personnel Department, and Wal-Mart had ample notice of Arrieta's complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Arrieta's Appeal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrieta appeals from the denial of his post-verdict motion that he be awarded equitable remedies of nearly five years of back pay and front pay. We affirm. Arrieta brought this situation on himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly noted, in this circuit when the jury is asked, as here, to resolve issues of liability and compensatory damages, the issue of back pay is normally decided by the jury as well. <i>See Johnson,</i> 364 F.3d at 379-80. Here, Arrieta did not advise the court before the jury was instructed that he wished to reserve the issue of back pay from the compensatory damages calculation by the jury, nor did he object to the instructions on compensatory damages. So the district court was not put on notice that Arrieta wished to have the issue of back pay decided by the court. We are not inclined to hold the plaintiff harmless from the foreseeable consequences of his actions. <i>See Saldana Sanchez v. Vega Sosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198435\"><a href=\"/opinion/198435/sanchez-v-lopez-gerena/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1999) (rejecting plaintiff's claim for back pay where the plaintiff failed to request an explicit instruction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to say that Arrieta had failed to provide evidence that he had looked for work or was unable to work, and so he had not met the mitigation requirement for an equitable award of back pay. We cannot say this was plain error, even giving plaintiff the benefit of plain error review rather than finding that he had waived the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to front pay, the district court held it would not, on the evidence before it, exercise its discretion to make an award. \"Front pay should not be awarded unless reinstatement is impracticable or impossible.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 364 F.3d at 380. The court held that Arrieta did not request reinstatement, and had set forth no evidence of impossibility or impracticability of reinstatement, of inability to work, or of work life expectancy. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the appeals from both sides and <i>affirm.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The jury also concluded that Wal-Mart had not violated Law 44 of July 2, 1995, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167;&#167; 501<i>et seq.,</i> the Puerto Rico analogue to the federal ADA claim. Arrieta has not appealed this determination.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In fact, Arrieta did not have a \"pump,\" but rather had a flexible implant. Eventually, his wife sewed special underwear which made the abnormality less visible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As near as can be told based on the record, the hierarchy at the Wal-Mart store is as follows: The store manager is the top company official at the store. Assistant managers, such as Ortiz and Baerga, report to the store manager. Support managers, like Jose Ramos, report to an assistant manager. Department managers, like Gilberto Rosa, fall below support managers, and have supervisory duties. Arrieta testified that Rosa, although not his supervisor, was nonetheless above him in Wal-Mart's hierarchy</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Arrieta represented in his brief that he also contacted Wal-Mart's telephone help line. The record citation he provides does not reflect this assertion, and our own review of the record shows no testimony about such a phone call</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Wal-Mart asserts that Arrieta requested the November leave of absence, and that in his request he did not mention the harassment he had suffered. In support, Wal-Mart points to a letter in the record written by Arrieta to the Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida (COSVI), a Puerto Rico governmental agency. That letter does not make mention of harassment. But there is nothing in this document itself or in the transcript of the trial proceedings to connect this letter to a request for a leave of absence. Also in evidence was a request for a leave of absence filled out by Arrieta in August 1998, in which Arrieta requested a personal leave of absence for \"[h]ealth problems in the family.\" According to Arrieta, he was given this leave of absence in September 1998 for his own illness. Thus, this particular document also seems unrelated to any leave of absence commencing in November, and Wal-Mart does not assert that it is related</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We note that this circuit has never squarely answered the question of whether hostile work environment claims are cognizable under the ADA. Wal-Mart addressed the issue before the district court, but does not press the issue here, and so we proceed on the assumption that such a claim is cognizable<i>See Rocafort v. IBM Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200526\"><a href=\"/opinion/200526/rocafort-v-ibm/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 120-22 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Wal-Mart raised the same argument in a Rule 60(b)(6) motion<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). The district court noted that \"Wal-Mart [did] not present an argument for relief under Rule 60(b)(6) that is separate and distinct from its arguments under Rule 59.\" Therefore, it recharacterized the motion under Rule 60(b)(6) as one under Rule 59, noting that \"even if Wal-Mart's arguments were considered under the rubric of Rule 60(b)(6), the outcome would be the same.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The court said it would reach the same outcome if the motion were considered under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
