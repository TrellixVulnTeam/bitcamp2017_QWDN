GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge. The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the seven former employees in\n\nthis action against their former employer, John Hancock Mutual Life\n\nInsurance Company.    The complaint seeks enhanced early retirement\n\nbenefits under the company's pension plan.      The question at issue\n\nis whether a 1994 amendment to the plan, making early retirement\n\nwith full benefits available at age 56 to those with 25 years of\n\nservice, applies to former employees whose jobs ended before they\n\nretired, or only to those who are still employed when they retire.\n\nJohn Hancock appeals, and the former employees cross-appeal the\n\ndistrict court’s calculation of attorney's fees.        We reverse and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                 FACTS\n\n            John Hancock terminated the employment of the seven\n\nplaintiffs in March 1997 as a result of John Hancock's sale of part\n\nof its business to UNICARE of California, Inc.           Despite their\n\ntermination, the former employees remained vested participants in\n\nJohn Hancock’s ERISA-qualified pension plan.\n\n            The company established the John Hancock Mutual Life\n\nInsurance Company Pension Plan in 1938.     The Plan has been amended\n\na number of times since it was established, and these amendments\n\nhave periodically been incorporated in restatements of the Plan.\n\nThe 1995 Restatement is at issue in this case; it was preceded by\n\na   1976   Restatement.   The   Internal   Revenue   Service   issued   a\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\ffavorable determination letter for the 1995 Restatement, meaning\n\nthat the form of the Plan document complies with the Internal\n\nRevenue Code requirements for qualified plans.\n\n            The parties agree that the Plan was amended on October\n\n11, 1994.    Hancock asserts that this amendment was among those\n\nincluded in the Plan’s 1995 Restatement, but the former employees\n\nrefer to the 1995 Restatement as the \"Partial Plan\" and assert that\n\nit is non-integrated and therefore the 1994 amendment must be\n\nconsidered in addition to the 1995 Restatement. The 1994 amendment\n\nlowered   from   55   to    50   the   age   at   which   a   qualifying   Plan\n\nparticipant could elect early retirement at reduced benefits.\n\nEmployees who were at least 56 years old with 25 years of service\n\nbecame    eligible    for   full   retirement      benefits.      Before    the\n\namendment, employees were subject to a rule of 85, which allowed\n\nfull retirement benefits to those with combined age and years of\n\nservice equaling at least 85.          Under the 1994 amendment, eligible\n\nparticipants who choose to retire between the ages of 50 and 56\n\nhave their benefits calculated using a formula that subtracts 0.4%\n\nof a participant’s full retirement benefit for each month that\n\nprecedes the participant’s fifty-sixth birthday.\n\n            The Plan also had a special provision for participants\n\nwhose service with Hancock had been terminated other than by\n\nretirement. Such participants had to choose between a full pension\n\nat age 65, or a reduced pension beginning whenever they became\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\feligible for early retirement (e.g., with 15 years of service, at\n\nage 50). That reduced pension would be calculated according to the\n\n0.4%-per-month formula with a baseline of age 65.\n\n              The former employees, with one exception, fall into a\n\nnarrow category of Plan participants who had accrued more than 25\n\nyears of service with John Hancock but had not reached 50 years of\n\nage   at   the    time   of    their     termination.1          They   claimed     full\n\nretirement       benefits     starting    at   age     56,2    believing    that    the\n\nliberalization of the retirement age in the 1994 amendment applied\n\nto    them.       John   Hancock,       acting    in    its     capacity    as     Plan\n\nAdministrator,       denied     these    former      employees     full    retirement\n\nbenefits at age 56.           Because these individuals’ employment with\n\nJohn Hancock had been terminated before retiring, Hancock concluded\n\nthat they were not eligible for those benefits.                        John Hancock\n\ninterpreted the Plan to preclude this category of participants from\n\nobtaining full pension benefits at age 56.                    Instead, John Hancock\n\ndeemed former employees who left the company prior to age 50\n\nineligible for full pension benefits until age 65 even if they had\n\naccrued 25 years of service.             Under this reading of the Plan, the\n\n\n\n      1\n      One former employee, Mary Ann Diebold, had slightly less than\n25 years of service at the time of her termination but would have\nqualified as having 25 years under a severance offer from John\nHancock.\n      2\n      Former employee Susan Oikelmus elected to begin receiving\nearly retirement benefits at age 53 and asserted that her benefits\nwould be calculated using a full retirement age of 56.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fformer employees were \"early retirees\" whose pensions were reduced\n\nby 0.4% for each month between the age at which they applied for\n\nretirement and age 65.     Although the former employees could elect\n\nto begin receiving reduced benefits as of age 50, those benefits\n\nwould be calculated using the normal retirement age of 65.\n\n            The former employees filed a three-count complaint to\n\nobtain the pension benefits described in the 1994 Plan amendment.\n\nThe first count is a traditional benefits claim in which the former\n\nemployees   seek   a   declaration   of    their   rights   under   the   Plan\n\npursuant to ERISA section 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).\n\nIn the second count, the former employees allege John Hancock\n\nbreached its fiduciary duty under ERISA section 502(a)(3), 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3).      The third count, which asserts relief under\n\nthe federal common law theory of estoppel, is asserted only on\n\nbehalf of former employee Diebold.         The former employees moved for\n\nsummary judgment on Count I of their amended complaint while John\n\nHancock sought summary judgment on all three counts.           The district\n\ncourt granted the former employees' motion, denied John Hancock’s\n\nmotion on Count I, declared moot John Hancock’s motion on Counts II\n\nand III, and awarded attorney’s fees and costs to the former\n\nemployees in the amount of $301,324.24.            John Hancock appeals the\n\nsummary judgment order and the award of fees and costs, and the\n\nformer employees cross-appeal the award of attorney’s fees with\n\nrespect to the rate at which they were calculated.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           I.   STANDARD OF REVIEW, BY COURT OF APPEALS,\n                    OF DISTRICT COURT’S DECISION\n\n\n           We begin by determining the proper standard of review.\n\nThe district court's grant of summary judgment is, of course,\n\nreviewed de novo, with all inferences resolved in favor of John\n\nHancock.   See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 986\n\nF.2d 580, 583 (1st Cir. 1993).     Summary judgment is appropriate\n\nonly if there is no genuine dispute as to material facts and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.    Id.\n\n           The ERISA statute directs the district court to confine\n\nits analysis to the terms of the plan.           ERISA authorizes a\n\nparticipant to bring an action \"to recover benefits due to him\n\nunder the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms\n\nof the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the\n\nterms of the plan.\"    29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).\n\nThe identity of the plan is thus a material fact, and we must\n\ndetermine whether a genuine issue exists as to that identity.\n\n                      II. IDENTIFYING THE PLAN\n\n           Underlying the dispute is a disagreement about which\n\ndocuments constitute the Plan.    John Hancock urges that the Plan\n\nconsists only of the undated version of \"The John Hancock Mutual\n\nLife Insurance Company Pension Plan\" which the former employees\n\nattached to their amended complaint as an exhibit.    We will refer\n\nto this as \"the 1995 Restatement,\" as John Hancock admits it was a\n\n                                 -7-\n\ftrue and correct copy of the Pension Plan as of January 1 of that\n\nyear. John Hancock contends it is the operative Plan document, and\n\nthat it alone governs the former employees’ rights as asserted in\n\nCount I.\n\n           The former employees, by contrast, refer to this document\n\nas \"the Partial Plan\" and describe it as a mere non-integrated\n\ndescription of the technical terms of the Plan which must be\n\nsupplemented in order to present a complete statement of the Plan’s\n\nterms.   The former employees do not present a competing version of\n\nan integrated Plan document.   Rather, they assert that a number of\n\nitems must be considered along with the 1995 Restatement.      They\n\nrefer to the 1994 amendment as the \"cornerstone\" of their claim,\n\nand state that they also \"follow the path carved by the District\n\nCourt\" by relying on the 1991 summary plan description and its 1996\n\nupdate to provide additional terms.    The summary plan description\n\nis a booklet entitled, \"Your Benefits Program: Reflecting Changing\n\nNeeds,\"3 and the 1996 update is labeled as such.         The former\n\nemployees find additional support for their interpretation of the\n\nPlan from documents created around the time of the 1994 Amendment,\n\nincluding a transcript of comments made by Stephen Brown, John\n\n\n     3\n      The plaintiffs recognize this booklet as the Plan’s summary\nplan description, but argue that it is part of the integrated Plan.\nThe document specifically disclaims inclusion in the official Plan:\n\"This summary describes only the highlights of your company’s\nPension Plan and does not attempt to cover all details.        Full\ndetails are provided in the official plan text, which legally\ngoverns the operation of the plan.\"\n\n                                -8-\n\fHancock's Chairman and CEO, at a company meeting on October 20,\n\n1994, and a letter of the same date from Brown to employees.\n\n            In its recitation of undisputed facts, the district court\n\nquoted portions of the 1995 Restatement, the 1994 amendment, the\n\n1996 update to the Plan’s summary plan description, and various\n\nletters, brochures, and other documents distributed by John Hancock\n\nto its employees.     Likewise, the district court considered these\n\ndocuments in granting summary judgment on Count I, the benefits\n\nclaim, but it provided no explanation as to their relevance or\n\nadmissibility.\n\n            John Hancock argues that the summary plan description\n\nmust not be considered in this case unless the former employees\n\nprove reliance on or prejudice resulting from their reading of that\n\ndocument.     The   district   court   directed   the   parties   to   defer\n\nbriefing the reliance issue until after the court ruled on Count I.\n\n            John Hancock’s argument is in line with our holdings in\n\nMauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan, 239 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\nand Bachelder v. Comm. Satellite Corp., 837 F.2d 519 (1st Cir.\n\n1988), where we held that \"other appropriate equitable relief\" may\n\nbe available under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) if the summary plan\n\ndescription violates ERISA’s disclosure provision, Mauser, 239 F.3d\n\nat   54-55,   and   the   participant     demonstrates     reasonable    or\n\nsignificant reliance on the summary plan description, Bachelder,\n\n837 F.2d at 523.    In Mauser, we further held that the availability\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fof \"other appropriate relief\" precludes claims for breach of\n\nfiduciary      duty   and   equitable    estoppel     based      on   alleged\n\nmisrepresentations in the summary plan description.              239 F.3d at\n\n57-58.   See also Govoni v.    Bricklayers, Masons & Plasterers Int’l\n\nUnion, 732 F.2d 250, 252 (1st Cir. 1984) (Breyer, J.)             (To secure\n\nrelief based on the summary plan description, the plan participant\n\n\"must show some significant reliance upon, or possible prejudice\n\nflowing from, the faulty plan description.\").            Not all circuits\n\nhave this requirement.      See, e.g., Burstein v.     Ret.   Account Plan\n\nFor Employees of Allegheny Health Educ. & Research Found., 334 F.3d\n\n365, 380-81 (3d Cir. 2003) (collecting cases and concluding: \"Upon\n\nconsideration of the ‘reliance’ issue, we now hold that a plan\n\nparticipant who bases a claim for plan benefits on a conflict\n\nbetween an SPD and plan document need neither plead nor prove\n\nreliance on the SPD.\").\n\n            John Hancock further asserts that the other documents\n\nmust not be considered with respect to any of the claims.                 The\n\ndistrict court took the plaintiffs’ approach, considering the 1995\n\nRestatement, various summary plan descriptions, benefits statements\n\nthe   former    employees   received    from   John   Hancock,    and   other\n\nunidentified documents attributed to John Hancock’s CEO and its\n\nHuman Resources Department.\n\n            John Hancock contends that the 1995 Restatement is the\n\noperative version of its pension benefit plan, and the former\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\femployees offer no competing version.             We must identify the plan\n\nfor a number of reasons.            First, ERISA requires that a qualified\n\nplan be governed by written documents.            The statute requires that\n\nevery qualified employee benefit plan \"shall be established and\n\nmaintained    pursuant     to   a    written   instrument.\"      29   U.S.C.   §\n\n1102(a)(1).      The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that\n\nparticipants know their rights and obligations under the plan,\n\nWilson v. Moog Auto., Inc. Pension Plan & Trust for UAW Employees,\n\n193 F.3d 1004, 1008 (8th Cir. 1999), and to provide some degree of\n\ncertainty in the administration of benefits, Feifer v. Prudential\n\nIns. Co. of America, 306 F.3d 1202, 1208 (2d Cir. 2002).               Second,\n\nERISA   requires    that    the      plan’s    administrator   must   act   \"in\n\naccordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,\"\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(D).            A court cannot determine whether an\n\nadministrator reasonably interpreted a plan without knowing what\n\ndocuments and instruments set forth the terms of the plan.\n\n           The    1995   Restatement      constitutes   the    governing    Plan\n\ndocument in this case.          As John Hancock points out, it is the\n\nrestated version of the Plan that includes all of the amendments\n\nthrough January 1 of that year.                The 1994 amendment has been\n\nintegrated into the 1995 Restatement and is not a document to be\n\nseparately considered.          The 1995 Restatement is a comprehensive\n\nrecitation of the terms of the Plan that, standing alone, informs\n\nparticipants of their rights and obligations.                  See Pegram v.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fHerdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 223 (2000) (\"Rules governing collection of\n\npremiums,    definition    of     benefits,       submission   of   claims,    and\n\nresolution of disagreements over entitlement to services are the\n\nsorts   of   provisions    that    constitute       a   plan.\").      The   former\n\nemployees offer no competing version of the governing Plan document\n\nand point to no ambiguous language in the 1995 Restatement.                  Thus,\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to the identity of the plan.                      Our\n\ntask, therefore, is to determine whether John Hancock abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying liberalized retirement benefits to the former\n\nemployees under the terms of the 1995 Restatement.                      With the\n\ngoverning    plan   document      identified,      extraneous      documents   are\n\nirrelevant to our determination of the former employees’ right to\n\nrelief under Count I.

Schlumberger Techs., Inc., 944\n\nF.2d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Basic contract and trust principles\n\npreclude federal courts from considering extrinsic evidence where\n\nthe ERISA terms in question are unambiguous.\").

STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR’S\n                    INTERPRETATION OF THE 1995 RESTATEMENT\n\n                 The parties disagree on the appropriate standard of\n\nreview of the plan administrator’s decision to deny benefits.                         The\n\ndistrict court determined that John Hancock acted in an arbitrary\n\nand capricious manner by interpreting its pension plan to deny the\n\nformer employees’ requests for early retirement benefits.                       This is\n\nthe appropriate standard of review for a benefits claim under\n\nsection     1132(a)(1)(B)         where    the    plan   gives    the    administrator\n\ndiscretionary authority to construe the plan.                       Firestone Tire &\n\nRubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 113-15 (1989).                              The Plan\n\ndocument contains a clear grant of discretionary authority to John\n\nHancock as plan administrator, so we will review John Hancock's\n\ninterpretation of its Plan under an arbitrary and capricious\n\nstandard.        See Bellino v. Schlumberger Techs., Inc., 944 F.2d 26,\n\n29 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Federal courts review ERISA claims de novo,\n\n                                           -13-\n\f'unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary\n\ndiscretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to\n\nconstrue the terms of the plan.'\") (quoting Firestone Tire & Rubber\n\nCo., 489 U.S. at 115).    The grant of authority is found in Section\n\n11.1 of the 1995 Restatement, which states:\n\n          The Company shall be the named fiduciary and the\n     administrator of the Plan for purposes of ERISA and shall\n     have the authority to control and manage the operation\n     and administration of the Plan. The Company shall have\n     the power to adopt such rules and regulations as it may\n     deem necessary or appropriate for the efficient operation\n     and administration of the Plan . . . . The Company shall\n     interpret the Plan and determine all questions arising\n     under it. Any such determination by the Company shall be\n     binding on all persons affected thereby.\n\n          Despite this language, the former employees contend that\n\nthe arbitrary and capricious standard is inapplicable when, as\n\nhere, a grant of discretionary authority is not found in the\n\nsummary plan description.    We are unpersuaded.   The silence of the\n\nsummary plan description on the issue of the administrator's\n\ndiscretion does not create a direct conflict with any particular\n\nPlan provision and therefore does not warrant de novo review.        See\n\nMartin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc., 115 F.3d\n\n1201, 1205 (4th Cir. 1997) (\"Vesting the plan administrator with\n\ndiscretion in making coverage decisions simply does not conflict\n\nwith the SPD's silence on the matter.\"); Wald v. Southwestern Bell\n\nCorp. Customcare Med. Plan, 83 F.3d 1002, 1006 (8th Cir. 1996)\n\n(rejecting argument that summary plan description must contain\n\ndescription   of   the   administrator's   discretion   in   order   for\n\n                                 -14-\n\farbitrary and capricious review to apply).\n\n           Contrary to the former employees' assertion, we also\n\nconclude that John Hancock does not suffer from a conflict of\n\ninterest warranting less deferential review.            We have recognized\n\nthat the financial self-interest of a plan administrator may\n\nwarrant arbitrary and capricious review with \"more bite.\" Doyle v.\n\nPaul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nHowever, we have restricted this type of review to situations where\n\nthe plan participant shows that an adverse determination was\n\nimproperly motivated.    Id.    The former employees have made no such\n\nshowing here.\n\n           Finally, there is no merit to the former employees'\n\nargument that the administrator's interpretation of Plan language\n\nis not a \"discretionary function\" and therefore not entitled to\n\narbitrary and capricious review.         In addition to conflicting with\n\nthe actual language of the 1995 Restatement, which states that John\n\nHancock   \"shall   interpret    the    Plan,\"   this   argument   is   wholly\n\ninconsistent with our repeated recognition that arbitrary and\n\ncapricious   review   applies    when    a   plan   reserves   discretionary\n\nauthority to its administrator.          See, e.g., Kolling v. Am. Power\n\nConversion Corp., 347 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                        IV.    THE BENEFITS CLAIM\n\n           We turn to the substance of the claim in Count I: the\n\nPlan entitles the former employees to receive full retirement\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fbenefits once they reach age 56 or, if they elect to retire between\n\nages 50 and 56, benefits with a reduction calculated only from age\n\n56.    John Hancock rejects this interpretation and asserts that the\n\nPlan instead entitles each former employee to full pension benefits\n\nbeginning at age 65 or reduced benefits calculated from the same\n\nage.\n\n            The 1995 Restatement, like its 1976 predecessor, is\n\norganized by Articles.    Article III, \"Retirement Dates,\" addresses\n\nthe timing of retirement from the earliest dates on which a\n\nparticipant may elect to retire to the mandatory retirement age.\n\nArticle IV, \"Amount of Pension,\" enumerates the amount of pension\n\na participant is entitled to receive.     Article VIII, \"Benefits on\n\nTermination of Service, Death or Return to Employment,\"4 describes\n\nbenefits available to participants whose employment is terminated\n\nother than by retirement.\n\n            Because the former employees left John Hancock before\n\nthey reached the age of 50, their service to the company was\n\nterminated \"other than by retirement.\"         Their entitlement to\n\nbenefits, therefore, is determined first by section 8.1 of the\n\nPlan:\n\n       If the Service of a Participant who has completed at\n       least five (5) Years of Service is terminated, other than\n       by retirement, such Participant will, subject to Article\n       V, be entitled to receive\n\n\n       4\n      The title was \"Benefits on Termination of Service or Death\"\nin the 1976 version.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f        (A)    a yearly amount of Pension determined in accordance\n               with Section 4.1 commencing on the first day of the\n               month in which he attains age sixty-five (65), or\n\n        (B)    the Pension described in (A) above subject to a\n               reduction as described in Section 4.3, commencing on\n               the first day of any month on or after the month in\n               which he meets any of the requirements for Early\n               Retirement described in Section 3.2.\n\nThus, the former employees were not entitled to receive full\n\npensions until they reached the age of 65.        The amount of such full\n\npension would be determined by looking to Section 4.1 (contained in\n\nArticle IV, \"Amount of Pension\"), which lists formulas that involve\n\nyears of service and final average salary. If the former employees\n\nwere to choose early retirement, the amount would be determined by\n\nSection 4.3, which contains the 0.4% per month reduction, and the\n\neligibility would be determined by Section 3.2 (contained in\n\nArticle III, \"Retirement Dates\"), which allows early retirement at\n\nage 50 with 15 years of service.\n\n               Although the former employees rely on the 1994 amendment\n\nto the Plan, that amendment affected only Sections 3.2, 4.2, and\n\n4.3.5       It made no changes to Article VIII.    Section 8.1 continued\n\nto direct that participants whose employment terminated other than\n\nby retirement were not eligible for full benefits before age 65.\n\n\n        5\n      The 1994 amendment says that it affects Sections 3.2, 4.4(A),\nand 4.5, but those section numbers correspond to the 1976\nRestatement.     In terms of the 1995 Restatement, the 1994\namendment’s changes reside in Sections 3.2 (which stayed the same),\n4.2, and 4.3.    Old Sections 4.1 - 4.3 were collapsed into new\nSection 4.1, old Section 4.4 became new Section 4.2, and old\nSection 4.5 became new Section 4.3.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fThe amendment did lower the age at which the former employees could\n\nelect early reduced retirement benefits from 55 to 50, as it\n\namended Section 3.2 which is referred to in Section 8.1.                   It did\n\nnot change the age at which they could retire with full benefits.\n\n             John Hancock’s response to the former employees’ request\n\nfor    liberalized     pension   benefits       was    consistent   with     this\n\ninterpretation, and it should not be disturbed.\n\n             When plaintiffs do make an argument based solely on the\n\ntext of the Plan, they fail to offer a coherent or persuasive\n\ninterpretation.       From their scattershot offering, we extract one\n\nmain contention -- that the sole criterion for determining whether\n\na participant is entitled to a full pension at age 56 (or a reduced\n\npension calculated from age 56) is whether she has achieved 25\n\nyears of service. So, for example, plaintiffs say that Section 8.1\n\napplies only to participants with less than 25 years of service.\n\nOn    its   own   terms,   however,   Section    8.1    applies   simply    to   a\n\nparticipant \"who has completed at least five years of Service\" and\n\nwhose service is \"terminated, other than by retirement;\" the text\n\nsays nothing about any upper limit on service, nor can such a limit\n\nbe read into the test by \"harmonizing\" it with other sections, as\n\nplaintiffs urge. Still, plaintiffs try to argue that full pensions\n\nat age 56 must be available to any participant who has at least 25\n\nyears of service, regardless of how that service was terminated.\n\nAgain, this argument avoids Section 8.1's bite only by ignoring its\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fplain language; moreover, if there were any doubt, the section that\n\nplaintiffs    invoke    for    this    proposition     (Section   4.2)    states\n\nexplicitly that it is \"subject to any applicable Section of . . .\n\nArticle . . . VIII.\"          Plaintiffs’ attempts at \"harmonizing\" the\n\nvarious sections cannot escape this conclusion.                 We reverse the\n\ndistrict court order of summary judgment and remand for entry of\n\nsummary judgment on Count I in favor of John Hancock.\n\n                                V. CONCLUSION\n\n            Having     concluded      that    the   district   court   erred   in\n\ngranting summary judgment for the former employees on Count I, we\n\nremand.     We note that the parties’ briefs addressed reliance and\n\nprejudice with respect to what evidence is relevant to Count I.\n\nThe district court appropriately deferred consideration of reliance\n\nuntil after it decided the summary judgment motions as to the first\n\ncount.     On remand, the issue of reliance may be relevant to the\n\nformer employees’ second count claiming breach of fiduciary duty\n\nunder Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan, 239 F.3d 51, 54-58 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).     Similarly, the district court will consider whether\n\nrelief is available to plaintiff Diebold in Count III.                 Id. at 57-\n\n58.\n\n            Our holding makes it unnecessary to consider the former\n\nemployees' cross-appeal regarding the calculation of attorney's\n\nfees.     We reverse the entry of summary judgment and the award of\n\nattorney's fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                -20-\n\f",

The complaint seeks enhanced early retirement benefits under the company's pension plan. The question at issue is whether a 1994 amendment to the plan, making early retirement with full benefits available at age 56 to those with 25 years of service, applies to former employees whose jobs ended before they retired, or only to those who are still employed when they retire. John Hancock appeals, and the former employees cross-appeal the district court's calculation of attorney's fees. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>FACTS</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hancock terminated the employment of the seven plaintiffs in March 1997 as a result of John Hancock's sale of part of its business to UNICARE of California, Inc. Despite their termination, the former employees remained vested participants in John Hancock's ERISA-qualified pension plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company established the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company Pension Plan in 1938. The Plan has been amended a number of times since it was established, and these amendments have periodically been incorporated in restatements of the Plan. The 1995 Restatement is at issue in this case; it was preceded by a 1976 Restatement. The Internal Revenue Service issued a favorable determination letter for the 1995 Restatement, meaning that the form of the Plan document complies with the Internal Revenue Code requirements for qualified plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that the Plan was amended on October 11, 1994. Hancock asserts that this amendment was among those included in the Plan's 1995 Restatement, but the former employees refer to the 1995 Restatement as the \"Partial Plan\" and assert that it is non-integrated and therefore the 1994 amendment must be considered in addition to the 1995 Restatement. The 1994 amendment lowered from 55 to 50 the age at which a qualifying Plan participant could elect early retirement at reduced benefits. Employees who were at least 56 years old with 25 years of service became eligible for full retirement benefits. Before the amendment, employees were subject to a rule of 85, which allowed full retirement benefits to those with combined age and years of service equaling at least 85. Under the 1994 amendment, eligible participants who choose to retire between the ages of 50 and 56 have their benefits calculated using a formula that subtracts 0.4% of a participant's full retirement benefit for each month that precedes the participant's fifty-sixth birthday.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan also had a special provision for participants whose service with Hancock had been terminated other than by retirement. Such participants had to choose between a full pension at age 65, or a reduced pension beginning whenever they became eligible for early retirement (e.g., with 15 years of service, at age 50). That reduced pension would be calculated according to the 0.4%-per-month formula with a baseline of age 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The former employees, with one exception, fall into a narrow category of Plan participants who had accrued more than 25 years of service with John Hancock but had not reached 50 years of age at the time of their termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They claimed full retirement benefits starting at age 56,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> believing that the liberalization of the retirement age in the 1994 amendment applied to them. John Hancock, acting in its capacity as Plan Administrator, denied these former employees full retirement benefits at age 56. Because these individuals' employment with John Hancock had been terminated before retiring, Hancock concluded that they were not eligible for those benefits. John Hancock interpreted the Plan to preclude this category of participants from obtaining full pension benefits at age 56. Instead, John Hancock deemed former employees who left the company prior to age 50 ineligible for full pension benefits until age 65 even if they had accrued 25 years of service. Under this reading of the Plan, the former employees were \"early retirees\" whose pensions were reduced by 0.4% for each month between the age at which they applied for retirement and age 65. Although the former employees could elect to begin receiving reduced benefits as of age 50, those benefits would be calculated using the normal retirement age of 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The former employees filed a three-count complaint to obtain the pension benefits described in the 1994 Plan amendment. The first count is a traditional benefits claim in which the former employees seek a declaration of their rights under the Plan pursuant to ERISA section 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B). In the second count, the former employees allege John Hancock breached its fiduciary duty under ERISA section 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3). The third count, which asserts relief under the federal common law theory of estoppel, is asserted only on behalf of former employee Diebold. The former employees moved for summary judgment on Count I of their amended complaint while John Hancock sought summary judgment on all three counts. The district court granted the former employees' motion, denied John Hancock's motion on Count I, declared moot John Hancock's motion on Counts II and III, and awarded attorney's fees and costs to the former employees in the amount of $301,324.24. John Hancock appeals the summary judgment order and the award of fees and costs, and the former employees cross-appeal the award of attorney's fees with respect to the rate at which they were calculated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>STANDARD OF REVIEW, BY COURT OF APPEALS, OF DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by determining the proper standard of review. The district court's grant of summary judgment is, of course, reviewed <i>de novo,</i> with all inferences resolved in favor of John Hancock. <i>See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.,</i> 986 F.2d 580, 583 (1st Cir.1993). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine dispute as to material facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ERISA statute directs the district court to confine its analysis to the terms of the plan. ERISA authorizes a participant to bring an action \"to recover benefits due to him <i>under the terms of his plan,</i> to enforce his rights <i>under the terms of the plan,</i> or to clarify his rights to future benefits <i>under the terms of the plan.</i>\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). The identity of the plan is thus a material fact, and we must determine whether a genuine issue exists as to that identity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>IDENTIFYING THE PLAN</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Underlying the dispute is a disagreement about which documents constitute the Plan. John Hancock urges that the Plan consists only of the undated version of \"The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company Pension Plan\" which the former employees attached to their amended complaint as an exhibit. We will refer to this as \"the 1995 Restatement,\" as John Hancock admits it was a true and correct copy of the Pension Plan as of January 1 of that year. John Hancock contends it is the operative Plan document, and that it alone governs the former employees' rights as asserted in Count I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The former employees, by contrast, refer to this document as \"the Partial Plan\" and describe it as a mere non-integrated description of the technical terms of the Plan which must be supplemented in order to present a complete statement of the Plan's terms. The former employees do not present a competing version of an integrated Plan document. Rather, they assert that a number of items must be considered along with the 1995 Restatement. They refer to the 1994 amendment as the \"cornerstone\" of their claim, and state that they also \"follow the path carved by the District Court\" by relying on the 1991 summary plan description and its 1996 update to provide additional terms. The summary plan description is a booklet entitled, \"Your Benefits Program: Reflecting Changing Needs,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and the 1996 update is labeled as such. The former employees find additional support for their interpretation of the Plan from documents created around the time of the 1994 Amendment, including a transcript of comments made by Stephen Brown, John Hancock's Chairman and CEO, at a company meeting on October 20, 1994, and a letter of the same date from Brown to employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its recitation of undisputed facts, the district court quoted portions of the 1995 Restatement, the 1994 amendment, the 1996 update to the Plan's summary plan description, and various letters, brochures, and other documents distributed by John Hancock to its employees. Likewise, the district court considered these documents in granting summary judgment on Count I, the benefits claim, but it provided no explanation as to their relevance or admissibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hancock argues that the summary plan description must not be considered in this case unless the former employees prove reliance on or prejudice resulting from their reading of that document. The district court directed the parties to defer briefing the reliance issue until after the court ruled on Count I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hancock's argument is in line with our holdings in <i>Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan,</i> 239 F.3d 51 (1st Cir.2001) and <i>Bachelder v. Comm. Satellite Corp.,</i> 837 F.2d 519 (1st Cir.1988), where we held that \"other appropriate equitable relief\" may be available under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3) if the summary plan description violates ERISA's disclosure provision, <i>Mauser,</i> 239 F.3d at 54-55, and the participant demonstrates reasonable or significant reliance on the summary plan description, <i>Bachelder,</i> 837 F.2d at 523. In <i>Mauser,</i> we further held that the availability of \"other appropriate relief\" precludes claims for breach of fiduciary duty and equitable estoppel based on alleged misrepresentations in the summary plan description. 239 F.3d at 57-58. <i>See also Govoni v. Bricklayers, Masons &amp; Plasterers Int'l Union,</i> 732 F.2d 250, 252 (1st Cir.1984) (Breyer, J.) (To secure relief based on the summary plan description, the plan participant \"must show some significant reliance upon, or possible prejudice flowing from, the faulty plan description.\"). Not all circuits have this requirement. <i>See, e.g., Burstein v. Ret. Account Plan For Employees of Allegheny Health Educ. &amp; Research Found.,</i> 334 F.3d 365, 380-81 (3d Cir.2003) (collecting cases and concluding: \"Upon consideration of the `reliance' issue, we now hold that a plan participant who bases a claim for plan benefits on a conflict between an SPD and plan document need neither plead nor prove reliance on the SPD.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hancock further asserts that the other documents must not be considered with respect to any of the claims. The district court took the plaintiffs' approach, considering the 1995 Restatement, various summary plan descriptions, benefits statements the former employees received from John Hancock, and other unidentified documents attributed to John Hancock's CEO and its Human Resources Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hancock contends that the 1995 Restatement is the operative version of its pension benefit plan, and the former employees offer no competing version. We must identify the plan for a number of reasons. First, ERISA requires that a qualified plan be governed by written documents. The statute requires that every qualified employee benefit plan \"shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1102(a)(1). The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that participants know their rights and obligations under the plan, <i>Wilson v. Moog Auto., Inc. Pension Plan &amp; Trust for UAW Employees,</i> 193 F.3d 1004, 1008 (8th Cir.1999), and to provide some degree of certainty in the administration of benefits, <i>Feifer v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America,</i> 306 F.3d 1202, 1208 (2d Cir.2002). Second, ERISA requires that the plan's administrator must act \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(a)(1)(D). A court cannot determine whether an administrator reasonably interpreted a plan without knowing what documents and instruments set forth the terms of the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1995 Restatement constitutes the governing Plan document in this case. As John Hancock points out, it is the restated version of the Plan that includes all of the amendments through January 1 of that year. The 1994 amendment has been integrated into the 1995 Restatement and is not a document to be separately considered. The 1995 Restatement is a comprehensive recitation of the terms of the Plan that, standing alone, informs participants of their rights and obligations. <i>See Pegram</i> v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 223, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000) (\"Rules governing collection of premiums, definition of benefits, submission of claims, and resolution of disagreements over entitlement to services are the sorts of provisions that constitute a plan.\"). The former employees offer no competing version of the governing Plan document and point to no ambiguous language in the 1995 Restatement. Thus, there is no genuine issue as to the identity of the plan. Our task, therefore, is to determine whether John Hancock abused its discretion in denying liberalized retirement benefits to the former employees under the terms of the 1995 Restatement. With the governing plan document identified, extraneous documents are irrelevant to our determination of the former employees' right to relief under Count I. <i>Bellino v. Schlumberger Techs., Inc.,</i> 944 F.2d 26, 32 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Basic contract and trust principles preclude federal courts from considering extrinsic evidence where the ERISA terms in question are unambiguous.\"). <i>See also Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan,</i> 330 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Liston's suit is for benefits that Liston says were promised to her by the plan, ... so the central issue must always be what the plan promised to Liston and whether the plan delivered.\"); <i>Harris v. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc.,</i> 208 F.3d 274, 279 (1st Cir.2000) (\"A <i>primary</i> purpose of ERISA is to ensure the integrity and primacy of written plans....\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Perry v. New England Bus. Svc., Inc.,</i> 347 F.3d 343, 346 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.2003) (the court gives \"the straightforward language in the Plan its natural meaning\" and stating that extrinsic evidence &#8212; i.e., \"informal communications\" &#8212; \"cannot alter the clear and unambiguous terms of the Plan\"); <i>Helfrich v. Carle Clinic Ass'n P.C.,</i> 328 F.3d 915, 917 (7th Cir.) (\"Employer-prepared summaries, by contrast [to SPDs], have no footing in ERISA and could not be enforced against the plan without disregarding the boundary between two distinct entities: the plan and the employer.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1073, 124 S.Ct. 924, 157 L.Ed.2d 743 (2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR'S INTERPRETATION OF THE 1995 RESTATEMENT</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree on the appropriate standard of review of the plan administrator's decision to deny benefits. The district court determined that John Hancock acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by interpreting its pension plan to deny the former employees' requests for early retirement benefits. This is the appropriate standard of review for a benefits claim under section 1132(a)(1)(B) where the plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to construe the plan. <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,</i> 489 U.S. 101, 113-15, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). The Plan document contains a clear grant of discretionary authority to John Hancock as plan administrator, so we will review John Hancock's interpretation of its Plan under an arbitrary and capricious standard. <i>See Bellino v. Schlumberger Techs., Inc.,</i> 944 F.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Federal courts review ERISA claims <i>de novo,</i> `unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.'\") (quoting <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</i> 489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. 948). The grant of authority is found in Section 11.1 of the 1995 Restatement, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company shall be the named fiduciary and the administrator of the Plan for purposes of ERISA and shall have the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan. The Company shall have the power to adopt such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the efficient operation and administration of the Plan.... The Company shall interpret the Plan and determine all questions arising under it. Any such determination by the Company shall be binding on all persons affected thereby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this language, the former employees contend that the arbitrary and capricious standard is inapplicable when, as here, a grant of discretionary authority is not found in the summary plan description. We are unpersuaded. The silence of the summary plan description on the issue of the administrator's discretion does not create a direct conflict with any particular Plan provision and therefore does not warrant <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See Martin v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc.,</i> 115 F.3d 1201, 1205 (4th Cir.1997) (\"Vesting the plan administrator with discretion in making coverage decisions simply does not conflict with the SPD's silence on the matter.\"); <i>Wald v. Southwestern Bell Corp. Customcare Med. Plan,</i> 83 F.3d 1002, 1006 (8th Cir.1996) (rejecting argument that summary plan description must contain description of the administrator's discretion in order for arbitrary and capricious review to apply).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the former employees' assertion, we also conclude that John Hancock does not suffer from a conflict of interest warranting less deferential review. We have recognized that the financial self-interest of a plan administrator may warrant arbitrary and capricious review with \"more bite.\" <i>Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir.1998). However, we have restricted this type of review to situations where the plan participant shows that an adverse determination was improperly motivated. <i>Id.</i> The former employees have made no such showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no merit to the former employees' argument that the administrator's interpretation of Plan language is not a \"discretionary function\" and therefore not entitled to arbitrary and capricious review. In addition to conflicting with the actual language of the 1995 Restatement, which states that John Hancock \"shall interpret the Plan,\" this argument is wholly inconsistent with our repeated recognition that arbitrary and capricious review applies when a plan reserves discretionary authority to its administrator. <i>See, e.g., Kolling v. Am. Power Conversion Corp.,</i> 347 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>THE BENEFITS CLAIM</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the substance of the claim in Count I: the Plan entitles the former employees to receive full retirement benefits once they reach age 56 or, if they elect to retire between ages 50 and 56, benefits with a reduction calculated only from age 56. John Hancock rejects this interpretation and asserts that the Plan instead entitles each former employee to full pension benefits beginning at age 65 or reduced benefits calculated from the same age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1995 Restatement, like its 1976 predecessor, is organized by Articles. Article III, \"Retirement Dates,\" addresses the timing of retirement from the earliest dates on which a participant may elect to retire to the mandatory retirement age. Article IV, \"Amount of Pension,\" enumerates the amount of pension a participant is entitled to receive. Article VIII, \"Benefits on Termination of Service, Death or Return to Employment,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> describes benefits available to participants whose employment is terminated other than by retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the former employees left John Hancock before they reached the age of 50, their service to the company was terminated \"other than by retirement.\" Their entitlement to benefits, therefore, is determined first by section 8.1 of the Plan:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Service of a Participant who has completed at least five (5) Years of Service is terminated, other than by retirement, such Participant will, subject to Article V, be entitled to receive</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) a yearly amount of Pension determined in accordance with Section 4.1 commencing on the first day of the month in which he attains age sixty-five (65), or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) the Pension described in (A) above subject to a reduction as described in Section 4.3, commencing on the first day of any month on or after the month in which he meets any of the requirements for Early Retirement described in Section 3.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the former employees were not entitled to receive full pensions until they reached the age of 65. The amount of such full pension would be determined by looking to Section 4.1 (contained in Article IV, \"Amount of Pension\"), which lists formulas that involve years of service and final average salary. If the former employees were to choose early retirement, the amount would be determined by Section 4.3, which contains the 0.4% per month reduction, and the eligibility would be determined by Section 3.2 (contained in Article III, \"Retirement Dates\"), which allows early retirement at age 50 with 15 years of service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the former employees rely on the 1994 amendment to the Plan, that amendment affected only Sections 3.2, 4.2, and 4.3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> It made no changes to Article VIII. Section 8.1 continued to direct that participants whose employment terminated other than by retirement were not eligible for full benefits before age 65. The amendment did lower the age at which the former employees could elect early reduced retirement benefits from 55 to 50, as it amended Section 3.2 which is referred to in Section 8.1. It did not change the age at which they could retire with full benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hancock's response to the former employees' request for liberalized pension benefits was consistent with this interpretation, and it should not be disturbed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When plaintiffs do make an argument based solely on the text of the Plan, they fail to offer a coherent or persuasive interpretation. From their scattershot offering, we extract one main contention &#8212; that the sole criterion for determining whether a participant is entitled to a full pension at age 56 (or a reduced pension calculated from age 56) is whether she has achieved 25 years of service. So, for example, plaintiffs say that Section 8.1 applies only to participants with less than 25 years of service. On its own terms, however, Section 8.1 applies simply to a participant \"who has completed at least five years of Service\" and whose service is \"terminated, other than by retirement;\" the text says nothing about any upper limit on service, nor can such a limit be read into the test by \"harmonizing\" it with other sections, as plaintiffs urge. Still, plaintiffs try to argue that full pensions at age 56 must be available to any participant who has at least 25 years of service, regardless of how that service was terminated. Again, this argument avoids Section 8.1's bite only by ignoring its plain language; moreover, if there were any doubt, the section that plaintiffs invoke for this proposition (Section 4.2) states explicitly that it is \"subject to any applicable Section of ... Article ... VIII.\" Plaintiffs' attempts at \"harmonizing\" the various sections cannot escape this conclusion. We reverse the district court order of summary judgment and remand for entry of summary judgment on Count I in favor of John Hancock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">V. <i>CONCLUSION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the former employees on Count I, we remand. We note that the parties' briefs addressed reliance and prejudice with respect to what evidence is relevant to Count I. The district court appropriately deferred consideration of reliance until after it decided the summary judgment motions as to the first count. On remand, the issue of reliance may be relevant to the former employees' second count claiming breach of fiduciary duty under <i>Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan,</i> 239 F.3d 51, 54-58 (1st Cir.2001). Similarly, the district court will consider whether relief is available to plaintiff Diebold in Count III. <i>Id.</i> at 57-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding makes it unnecessary to consider the former employees' cross-appeal regarding the calculation of attorney's fees. We reverse the entry of summary judgment and the award of attorney's fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

The complaint seeks enhanced early retirement benefits under the company's pension plan. The question at issue is whether a 1994 amendment to the plan, making early retirement with full benefits available at age 56 to those with 25 years of service, applies to former employees whose jobs ended before they retired, or only to those who are still employed when they retire. John Hancock appeals, and the former employees cross-appeal the district court's calculation of attorney's fees. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>FACTS</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hancock terminated the employment of the seven plaintiffs in March 1997 as a result of John Hancock's sale of part of its business to UNICARE of California, Inc. Despite their termination, the former employees remained vested participants in John Hancock's ERISA-qualified pension plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company established the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company Pension Plan in 1938. The Plan has been amended a number of times since it was established, and these amendments have periodically been incorporated in restatements of the Plan. The 1995 Restatement is at issue in this case; it was preceded by a 1976 Restatement. The Internal Revenue Service issued a favorable determination letter for the 1995 Restatement, meaning that the form of the Plan document complies with the Internal Revenue Code requirements for qualified plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that the Plan was amended on October 11, 1994. Hancock asserts that this amendment was among those included in the Plan's 1995 Restatement, but the former employees refer to the 1995 Restatement as the \"Partial Plan\" and assert that it is non-integrated and therefore the 1994 amendment must be considered in addition to the 1995 Restatement. The 1994 amendment lowered from 55 to 50 the age at which a qualifying Plan participant could elect early retirement at reduced benefits. Employees who were at least 56 years old with 25 years of service became eligible for full retirement benefits. Before the amendment, employees were subject to a rule of 85, which allowed full retirement benefits to those with combined age and years of service equaling at least 85. Under the 1994 amendment, eligible participants who choose to retire between the ages of 50 and 56 have their benefits calculated using a formula that subtracts 0.4% of a participant's full retirement benefit for each month that precedes the participant's fifty-sixth birthday.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan also had a special provision for participants whose service with Hancock had been terminated other than by retirement. Such participants had to choose between a full pension at age 65, or a reduced pension beginning whenever they became eligible for early retirement (e.g., with 15 years of service, at age 50). That reduced pension would be calculated according to the 0.4%-per-month formula with a baseline of age 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The former employees, with one exception, fall into a narrow category of Plan participants who had accrued more than 25 years of service with John Hancock but had not reached 50 years of age at the time of their termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They claimed full retirement benefits starting at age 56,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> believing that the liberalization of the retirement age in the 1994 amendment applied to them. John Hancock, acting in its capacity as Plan Administrator, denied these former employees full retirement benefits at age 56. Because these individuals' employment with John Hancock had been terminated before retiring, Hancock concluded that they were not eligible for those benefits. John Hancock interpreted the Plan to preclude this category of participants from obtaining full pension benefits at age 56. Instead, John Hancock deemed former employees who left the company prior to age 50 ineligible for full pension benefits until age 65 even if they had accrued 25 years of service. Under this reading of the Plan, the former employees were \"early retirees\" whose pensions were reduced by 0.4% for each month between the age at which they applied for retirement and age 65. Although the former employees could elect to begin receiving reduced benefits as of age 50, those benefits would be calculated using the normal retirement age of 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The former employees filed a three-count complaint to obtain the pension benefits described in the 1994 Plan amendment. The first count is a traditional benefits claim in which the former employees seek a declaration of their rights under the Plan pursuant to ERISA section 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B). In the second count, the former employees allege John Hancock breached its fiduciary duty under ERISA section 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3). The third count, which asserts relief under the federal common law theory of estoppel, is asserted only on behalf of former employee Diebold. The former employees moved for summary judgment on Count I of their amended complaint while John Hancock sought summary judgment on all three counts. The district court granted the former employees' motion, denied John Hancock's motion on Count I, declared moot John Hancock's motion on Counts II and III, and awarded attorney's fees and costs to the former employees in the amount of $301,324.24. John Hancock appeals the summary judgment order and the award of fees and costs, and the former employees cross-appeal the award of attorney's fees with respect to the rate at which they were calculated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>STANDARD OF REVIEW, BY COURT OF APPEALS, OF DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by determining the proper standard of review. The district court's grant of summary judgment is, of course, reviewed <i>de novo,</i> with all inferences resolved in favor of John Hancock. <i>See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600732\"><a href=\"/opinion/600732/luis-e-rodriguez-abreu-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 583 (1st Cir.1993). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine dispute as to material facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ERISA statute directs the district court to confine its analysis to the terms of the plan. ERISA authorizes a participant to bring an action \"to recover benefits due to him <i>under the terms of his plan,</i> to enforce his rights <i>under the terms of the plan,</i> or to clarify his rights to future benefits <i>under the terms of the plan.</i>\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). The identity of the plan is thus a material fact, and we must determine whether a genuine issue exists as to that identity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>IDENTIFYING THE PLAN</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Underlying the dispute is a disagreement about which documents constitute the Plan. John Hancock urges that the Plan consists only of the undated version of \"The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company Pension Plan\" which the former employees attached to their amended complaint as an exhibit. We will refer to this as \"the 1995 Restatement,\" as John Hancock admits it was a true and correct copy of the Pension Plan as of January 1 of that year.

The former employees do not present a competing version of an integrated Plan document. Rather, they assert that a number of items must be considered along with the 1995 Restatement. They refer to the 1994 amendment as the \"cornerstone\" of their claim, and state that they also \"follow the path carved by the District Court\" by relying on the 1991 summary plan description and its 1996 update to provide additional terms. The summary plan description is a booklet entitled, \"Your Benefits Program: Reflecting Changing Needs,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and the 1996 update is labeled as such. The former employees find additional support for their interpretation of the Plan from documents created around the time of the 1994 Amendment, including a transcript of comments made by Stephen Brown, John Hancock's Chairman and CEO, at a company meeting on October 20, 1994, and a letter of the same date from Brown to employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its recitation of undisputed facts, the district court quoted portions of the 1995 Restatement, the 1994 amendment, the 1996 update to the Plan's summary plan description, and various letters, brochures, and other documents distributed by John Hancock to its employees.

We must identify the plan for a number of reasons. First, ERISA requires that a qualified plan be governed by written documents. The statute requires that every qualified employee benefit plan \"shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1102(a)(1). The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that participants know their rights and obligations under the plan, <i>Wilson v. Moog Auto., Inc. Pension Plan &amp; Trust for UAW Employees,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766438\"><a href=\"/opinion/766438/harold-g-wilson-robert-n-goodwin-calvin-smith-james-r-brinker-jerry/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1008 (8th Cir.1999), and to provide some degree of certainty in the administration of benefits, <i>Feifer v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779421\"><a href=\"/opinion/779421/raymond-feifer-nicholas-pocchia-and-edwin-molina-v-prudential-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span>, 1208 (2d Cir.2002). Second, ERISA requires that the plan's administrator must act \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(a)(1)(D). A court cannot determine whether an administrator reasonably interpreted a plan without knowing what documents and instruments set forth the terms of the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1995 Restatement constitutes the governing Plan document in this case. As John Hancock points out, it is the restated version of the Plan that includes all of the amendments through January 1 of that year. The 1994 amendment has been integrated into the 1995 Restatement and is not a document to be separately considered. The 1995 Restatement is a comprehensive recitation of the terms of the Plan that, standing alone, informs participants of their rights and obligations. <i>See Pegram</i> v. Herdrich, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118372\"><a href=\"/opinion/118372/pegram-v-herdrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 223, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118372\"><a href=\"/opinion/118372/pegram-v-herdrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The former employees offer no competing version of the governing Plan document and point to no ambiguous language in the 1995 Restatement. Thus, there is no genuine issue as to the identity of the plan. Our task, therefore, is to determine whether John Hancock abused its discretion in denying liberalized retirement benefits to the former employees under the terms of the 1995 Restatement. With the governing plan document identified, extraneous documents are irrelevant to our determination of the former employees' right to relief under Count I. <i>Bellino v.

The district court determined that John Hancock acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by interpreting its pension plan to deny the former employees' requests for early retirement benefits. This is the appropriate standard of review for a benefits claim under section 1132(a)(1)(B) where the plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to construe the plan. <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1989). The Plan document contains a clear grant of discretionary authority to John Hancock as plan administrator, so we will review John Hancock's interpretation of its Plan under an arbitrary and capricious standard. <i>See Bellino v. Schlumberger Techs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567921\"><a href=\"/opinion/567921/james-bellino-v-schlumberger-technologies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Federal courts review ERISA claims <i>de novo,</i> `unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.'\") (quoting <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</i> 489 U.S. at 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>). The grant of authority is found in Section 11.1 of the 1995 Restatement, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company shall be the named fiduciary and the administrator of the Plan for purposes of ERISA and shall have the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan.

We are unpersuaded. The silence of the summary plan description on the issue of the administrator's discretion does not create a direct conflict with any particular Plan provision and therefore does not warrant <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See Martin v.

We have recognized that the financial self-interest of a plan administrator may warrant arbitrary and capricious review with \"more bite.\" <i>Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197983\"><a href=\"/opinion/197983/doyle-v-paul-revere-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>, 184 (1st Cir.1998). However, we have restricted this type of review to situations where the plan participant shows that an adverse determination was improperly motivated. <i>Id.</i> The former employees have made no such showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no merit to the former employees' argument that the administrator's interpretation of Plan language is not a \"discretionary function\" and therefore not entitled to arbitrary and capricious review. In addition to conflicting with the actual language of the 1995 Restatement, which states that John Hancock \"shall interpret the Plan,\" this argument is wholly inconsistent with our repeated recognition that arbitrary and capricious review applies when a plan reserves discretionary authority to its administrator. <i>See, e.g., Kolling v. Am. Power Conversion Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200694\"><a href=\"/opinion/200694/kolling-v-american-power-conv/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>THE BENEFITS CLAIM</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the substance of the claim in Count I: the Plan entitles the former employees to receive full retirement benefits once they reach age 56 or, if they elect to retire between ages 50 and 56, benefits with a reduction calculated only from age 56. John Hancock rejects this interpretation and asserts that the Plan instead entitles each former employee to full pension benefits beginning at age 65 or reduced benefits calculated from the same age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1995 Restatement, like its 1976 predecessor, is organized by Articles. Article III, \"Retirement Dates,\" addresses the timing of retirement from the earliest dates on which a participant may elect to retire to the mandatory retirement age. Article IV, \"Amount of Pension,\" enumerates the amount of pension a participant is entitled to receive. Article VIII, \"Benefits on Termination of Service, Death or Return to Employment,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> describes benefits available to participants whose employment is terminated other than by retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the former employees left John Hancock before they reached the age of 50, their service to the company was terminated \"other than by retirement.\" Their entitlement to benefits, therefore, is determined first by section 8.1 of the Plan:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Service of a Participant who has completed at least five (5) Years of Service is terminated, other than by retirement, such Participant will, subject to Article V, be entitled to receive</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) a yearly amount of Pension determined in accordance with Section 4.1 commencing on the first day of the month in which he attains age sixty-five (65), or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) the Pension described in (A) above subject to a reduction as described in Section 4.3, commencing on the first day of any month on or after the month in which he meets any of the requirements for Early Retirement described in Section 3.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the former employees were not entitled to receive full pensions until they reached the age of 65. The amount of such full pension would be determined by looking to Section 4.1 (contained in Article IV, \"Amount of Pension\"), which lists formulas that involve years of service and final average salary. If the former employees were to choose early retirement, the amount would be determined by Section 4.3, which contains the 0.4% per month reduction, and the eligibility would be determined by Section 3.2 (contained in Article III, \"Retirement Dates\"), which allows early retirement at age 50 with 15 years of service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the former employees rely on the 1994 amendment to the Plan, that amendment affected only Sections 3.2, 4.2, and 4.3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> It made no changes to Article VIII. Section 8.1 continued to direct that participants whose employment terminated other than by retirement were not eligible for full benefits before age 65. The amendment did lower the age at which the former employees could elect early reduced retirement benefits from 55 to 50, as it amended Section 3.2 which is referred to in Section 8.1. It did not change the age at which they could retire with full benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hancock's response to the former employees' request for liberalized pension benefits was consistent with this interpretation, and it should not be disturbed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When plaintiffs do make an argument based solely on the text of the Plan, they fail to offer a coherent or persuasive interpretation. From their scattershot offering, we extract one main contention &#8212; that the sole criterion for determining whether a participant is entitled to a full pension at age 56 (or a reduced pension calculated from age 56) is whether she has achieved 25 years of service. So, for example, plaintiffs say that Section 8.1 applies only to participants with less than 25 years of service. On its own terms, however, Section 8.1 applies simply to a participant \"who has completed at least five years of Service\" and whose service is \"terminated, other than by retirement;\" the text says nothing about any upper limit on service, nor can such a limit be read into the test by \"harmonizing\" it with other sections, as plaintiffs urge. Still, plaintiffs try to argue that full pensions at age 56 must be available to any participant who has at least 25 years of service, regardless of how that service was terminated. Again, this argument avoids Section 8.1's bite only by ignoring its plain language; moreover, if there were any doubt, the section that plaintiffs invoke for this proposition (Section 4.2) states explicitly that it is \"subject to any applicable Section of ... Article ... VIII.\" Plaintiffs' attempts at \"harmonizing\" the various sections cannot escape this conclusion. We reverse the district court order of summary judgment and remand for entry of summary judgment on Count I in favor of John Hancock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">V. <i>CONCLUSION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the former employees on Count I, we remand. We note that the parties' briefs addressed reliance and prejudice with respect to what evidence is relevant to Count I. The district court appropriately deferred consideration of reliance until after it decided the summary judgment motions as to the first count. On remand, the issue of reliance may be relevant to the former employees' second count claiming breach of fiduciary duty under <i>Mauser v. Raytheon Co.

In terms of the 1995 Restatement, the 1994 amendment's changes reside in Sections 3.2 (which stayed the same), 4.2, and 4.3. Old Sections 4.1-4.3 were collapsed into new Section 4.1, old Section 4.4 became new Section 4.2, and old Section 4.5 became new Section 4.3</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
