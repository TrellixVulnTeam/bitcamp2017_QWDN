Daniel R.

This case raises several questions\n\nof first impression for this circuit regarding the scope of the\n\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1602-\n\n1611.   The FSIA provides the exclusive basis for acquiring subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over foreign states and their agencies and\n\ninstrumentalities.     Id. §§ 1330, 1604. Under the statute, \"a\n\nforeign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts\n\nof the United States,\" id. § 1604, unless the case falls within one\n\nof the exceptions to immunity set out in § 1605.          At issue here are\n\nthe exceptions   for   actions   arising   out   of   a   foreign   state's\ncommercial or tortious activity, id. §§ 1605(a)(2) & (5), or\n\ninvolving rights in immovable property, id. § 1605(a)(4).               The\ndistrict court concluded that none of the exceptions applied.           We\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           The relevant facts are not disputed. Appellants, Gabriel\n\nFagot Rodriguez and Angeles Diaz Rivera (\"the Fagots\"), own a house\nand surrounding property in San Juan, Puerto Rico.           In September,\n1991, the Fagots agreed to lease the property to Hilda Fournier and\nAngelo Greco Fournier (\"the Fourniers\") for two years, at a rate of\n\n$2,500 per month.    Although the Fourniers were then the Consul and\n\nVice-Consul of the Republic of Costa Rica, they signed the lease in\n\ntheir individual capacities. The lease agreement provided that the\n\nFourniers were to use the property for residential purposes only\n\nand prohibited them from subleasing to third parties without the\n\nFagots' prior written consent.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f          Notwithstanding the restrictions in the lease agreement,\n\nthe Fourniers began to operate the Costa Rican Consulate (\"the\n\nConsulate\") from the property.    The Fagots were unaware of their\nactions, however, and the Fourniers remained on the property\n\nwithout conflict for most of the two-year lease term.   The trouble\n\nbegan in June of 1993, when -- following a dispute over an air\nconditioner -- the Fourniers failed to pay the monthly rent.    On\n\nJune 16, 1993, the Fagots notified the Fourniers by letter that the\n\nlease was terminated effective immediately, and that the Fourniers\n\nhad to vacate the premises by July 16, 1993.      The Fagots also\n\ndemanded that the Fourniers pay them $10,000 -- the total rent due\n\nfor the balance of the lease term.1\n\n          Two months passed, and the Fourniers neither vacated the\nproperty, nor paid the requested amount.   On August 19, 1993, the\n\nFagots sent another letter informing the Fourniers that \"since a\n\nlease contract no longer exists that stipulates the rent to be paid\nfor the use and enjoyment of the property, you will pay monthly,\n\nretroactively to July 16, 1993, the sum of $5,000.00, that is from\n\nthe date you should have vacated the property.\"         The letter\n\nspecified that the new $5,000 rental charge was to be paid \"for the\n\nmonths of July, August and September 1993.\"\n\n          Some time after mailing the August demand letter, the\n\nFagots learned that the Fourniers had been operating the Consulate\n\n     1\n       The lease agreement provided that, \"[i]f the LESSEES [do]\nnot pay any monthly lease payment on the date the same is due, then\nthe lease contract will be considered to be totally due and the\nLESSORS have the right to collect from the LESSEES the rent for the\nduration of the contract.\"\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffrom the property.2   On September 30, 1993 -- the last day of the\n\noriginal lease term -- they filed suit against the Fourniers, the\n\nConsulate, and the Republic of Costa Rica (\"Costa Rica\"), alleging\nbreach of contract, personal injury, and damage to or loss of\n\nproperty.     The complaint sought eviction as well as monetary\n\ndamages.\n            The parties quickly filed a flurry of motions.      The\n\nFagots sought immediate eviction.      Costa Rica and the Consulate\n\nrejoined with claims of sovereign immunity and inadequate service.\n\nIn the meantime, the Fourniers and the Consulate remained on the\n\nproperty, still without paying rent.      They finally vacated the\n\nproperty in October of 1994, 16 months after the Fagots terminated\n\nthe lease.\n            In December of 1994, Costa Rica and the Consulate moved\n\nfor summary judgment on the ground that they were immune from suit\n\nunder the FSIA.    The Fagots responded that the case fell into the\nexceptions to immunity for actions involving rights in immovable\n\nproperty, or arising out of commercial or tortious activity by a\n\nforeign state. The district court initially concluded that none of\n\nthose exceptions applied and entered summary judgment for Costa\n\nRica.    Fagot Rodriguez v. Republic of Costa Rica, 934 F. Supp. 493\n\n     2\n       It is unclear from the record when, exactly, the Fagots\nlearned that the Consulate was located on the property. However,\nin a memorandum supporting their motion for summary judgment, the\nFagots represented that the August letter \"was specifically\naddressed to the Fourniers\" because \"at that particular point in\ntime (August 1993), the Fagots were unaware that Costa Rica and the\nConsulate occupied the Property.\"     Accordingly, we view it as\nsettled that the Fagots were unaware of the Consulate's presence\nwhen they mailed the August demand letter.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f(D.P.R.   1996)    (Fagot   Rodriguez    I).3   The   Fagots   moved   for\n\nreconsideration and for additional discovery.         The court granted\n\ntheir requests and vacated its judgment.        Eventually, the Fagots\nfiled their own motion for summary judgment on the question of\n\njurisdiction under the FSIA.     This time, the court determined that\n\nthe case could proceed under the commercial activity and tortious\nactivity exceptions. Fagot Rodriguez v. Republic of Costa Rica, 99\n\nF. Supp. 2d 157 (D.P.R. 1999) (Fagot Rodriguez II).        After holding\n\na hearing on the question of damages, it entered an order holding\n\nCosta Rica and the Consulate jointly liable with the Fourniers for\n\nnon-payment of rent between August, 1993 and October, 1994.            The\n\ncourt concluded that the Fourniers -- but not Costa Rica and the\n\nConsulate -- also were liable for rent due prior to August, 1993,\nand for property damage and mental distress.          Fagot Rodriguez v.\n\nRepublic of Costa Rica, 99 F. Supp. 2d 170 (D.P.R. 1999) (Fagot\n\nRodriguez III).       The Fagots again moved for reconsideration,\narguing that Costa Rica and the Consulate were jointly liable for\n\nall damages.      Again, the district court agreed to reconsider its\njudgment. However, instead of holding Costa Rica and the Consulate\n\nliable for more damages, it reverted to its earlier view that none\n\nof the exceptions provided a basis for jurisdiction under the FSIA,\n\nand dismissed the claims against Costa Rica and the Consulate.\n\nFagot Rodriguez v. Republic of Costa Rica, 139 F. Supp. 2d 173\n\n(D.P.R. 2001) (Fagot Rodriguez IV).        This appeal followed.\n\n\n     3\n       At the same time, the court entered a default judgment\nagainst the Fourniers. That judgment has not been appealed.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f                                      II.\n\n              We review de novo the district court's conclusion that it\n\nlacked      jurisdiction   under   the    FSIA.      See     Honduras    Aircraft\n\nRegistry, Ltd. v. Gov't of Honduras, 129 F.3d 543, 546 (11th Cir.\n\n1997) (conducting de novo review of FSIA jurisdictional question);\n\nExport Group v. Reef Indus., Inc., 54 F.3d 1466, 1469 (9th Cir.\n\n1995) (\"[T]he existence of subject matter jurisdiction under the\n\nFSIA is a question of law subject to de novo review.\"); cf. Irving\n\nv. United States, 162 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc)\n\n(applying \"plenary review\" to the question of jurisdiction over the\nUnited States government under the Federal Tort Claims Act).                  As\n\nnoted, the Fagots assert several bases for jurisdiction.                  First,\nthey argue that Costa Rica4 can be held liable for non-payment of\nrent       under   the   commercial      activity    exception,     28     U.S.C.\n\n§ 1605(a)(2), based on an implied lease contract created by the\nAugust, 1993, demand letter.             Second, they maintain that Costa\nRica's use of the property amounted to a trespass, thus supporting\n\njurisdiction       under    the    tortious       activity     exception,     id.\n\n§ 1605(a)(5).      Finally, the Fagots argue that they can recover for\nnonpayment of rent (or, in the alternative, damages for trespass)\n\nunder the exception for actions involving \"rights in immovable\nproperty,\" id., § 1605(a)(4).         We address those claims in turn.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       For ease of reference, we omit any further mention of the\nConsulate in its role as defendant.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fA.          Commercial Activity\n\n            Under    §     1605(a)(2),       a    foreign          state   is   subject   to\n\njurisdiction in any case \"in which the action is based upon a\n\ncommercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign\n\nstate.\" The term \"commercial activity\" encompasses both \"a regular\n\ncourse    of     commercial       conduct\"       and     \"a    particular        commercial\n\ntransaction or act.\"             Id. § 1603(d).               In assessing whether a\n\ncertain    transaction       or    course        of    conduct        is   commercial     in\n\ncharacter, courts must look to the \"nature\" of the activity rather\n\nthan its \"purpose.\"         Id.    Thus,\n            the question is not whether the foreign\n            government [was] acting with a profit motive\n            or instead with the aim of fulfilling uniquely\n            sovereign objectives.    Rather, the issue is\n            whether the particular actions that the\n            foreign state perform[ed] (whatever the motive\n            behind them) [were] the type of actions by\n            which a private party engages in \"trade and\n            traffic or commerce.\"\nRep. of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 614 (1992).\n\n            In     order    to     qualify       for     the        commercial       activity\n\nexception, an action must be \"based upon\" commercial activity by\nthe defendant foreign state.             28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2).                The Supreme\nCourt     has    explained        that   a       claim        is    \"based\"     on     \"those\n\nelements . . . that, if proven, would entitle [the] plaintiff to\nrelief under his theory of the case.\"                  Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507\n\nU.S. 349, 357 (1993).            Here, the Fagots seek damages for, inter\n\nalia, breach of contract.                There is no dispute that contract\nformation is an essential element of that claim, and that entering\n\ninto a contract for lease of property constitutes \"commercial\n\n                                           -7-\n\factivity.\" See, e.g., Joseph v. Office of the Consulate General of\n\nNigeria, 830 F.2d 1018, 1024 (9th Cir. 1987); see also Walter\n\nFuller Aircraft Sales, Inc. v. Rep. of the Philippines, 965 F.2d\n1375, 1386 (5th Cir. 1992) (noting the commercial nature of the\n\nmaking or breaching of a contract); Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's\n\nMed. Ctr. v. Hellenic Rep., 877 F.2d 574, 578 (7th Cir. 1989)\n(noting that \"contracts for the purchase or sale of goods or\n\nservices   are     presumptively     'commercial       activities'\").     The\n\nimportant question is whether Costa Rica in fact contracted with\n\nthe Fagots for use of the property.\n\n           In the district court, the parties argued extensively\n\nover whether Costa Rica was bound by the original lease agreement\n\nbetween the Fourniers and the Fagots.            The Fagots insisted that,\nalthough   the    Fourniers     signed   the   lease   in   their   individual\n\ncapacities,      Costa   Rica    could   be    held    liable   under   agency\n\nprinciples.   They do not press that claim on appeal.5           Instead, the\nFagots argue that the events in the summer of 1993 gave rise to an\n\nimplied lease contract between themselves and Costa Rica.\n\n\n\n     5\n       Puerto Rico's Civil Code states:\n     When an agent acts in his own name the principal shall\n     have no action against the person with whom the agent has\n     contracted, nor the said persons against the principal.\n     In such case, the agent is directly liable to the person\n     with whom he has contracted, as if the transaction were\n     his own.\nLaws of P.R. Ann. tit. 31, § 4429. Relying on that provision, the\ndistrict could held that Costa Rica was not liable for the\nFourniers' breach of the original lease agreement, since they\nsigned that contract \"in [their] own name[s],\" id., rather than as\nagents of Costa Rica. See Fagot Rodriguez IV, 139 F. Supp. 2d at\n186.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f          The Fagots offer two versions of an implied contract\n\ntheory.   On the first theory, the August, 1993, demand letter --\n\nstating that, in the absence of a lease agreement, the Fourniers\nwould be charged $5,000 for each month they remained on the\n\nproperty -- constituted an offer for a month-to-month lease, at a\n\nrate of $5,000.   By remaining on the property, the argument goes,\nCosta Rica accepted the offer and created a contract implied in\n\nfact.\n\n          The Fagots recognize that an implied-in-fact contract\n\nrequires a \"mutual intent to contract.\"      Nevertheless, they have\n\nnot even attempted to show such mutual intent here.        To begin with,\n\nthe Fagots have not argued -- much less established -- that they\n\nintended to enter into a month-to-month lease agreement with Costa\nRica. The August demand letter was addressed to the Fourniers, not\n\nCosta Rica.    In the course of the proceedings before the district\n\ncourt, the Fagots explained that \"at that particular point in time\n(August, 1993), the Fagots were unaware that Costa Rica and the\n\nConsulate occupied the property.\" They argued that \"[s]uch lack of\n\nknowledge should not operate against them.\" That generalization is\n\nnot helpful.    On the issue of an implied-in-fact contract, the\n\nFagots' lack of knowledge about the involvement of Costa Rica\n\nundermines their claim that the demand letter was an offer to Costa\n\nRica.\n\n          Moreover,   whatever   the   Fagots'   intent,    there   is   no\n\nsuggestion in the record that Costa Rica agreed to pay the Fagots\n\n$5,000 per month for its use of the property.        Thus, even if we\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\ftreat the Fagots' demand letter as an offer to Costa Rica, there is\n\nno evidence that Costa Rica accepted it.   Given the absence of any\n\nevidence showing a mutual intent to contract, we conclude that\nCosta Rica did not enter into an implied-in-fact lease for the\n\nproperty.\n\n            The Fagots' second theory posits a contract implied in\nlaw, or \"quasi contract.\"6   They point out correctly that a quasi\n\ncontract does not depend on the consent of the parties but is\n\n\"implied in law to prevent unjust enrichment of one party at the\n\nexpense of another.\"    However, the Fagots have made no effort to\n\napply the general principles of quasi contract to the facts of this\n\ncase.    Their sole authority is International General Electric v.\n\nConcrete Builders of Puerto Rico, Inc., 104 P.R.R. 1221 (1976), in\nwhich the Puerto Rico Supreme Court found a contract implied in law\n\nwhere the plaintiff reasonably relied on the defendant's assurance\n\nthat it would pay for certain services.    The court noted that it\nwas immaterial that the defendant did not actually intend to pay\n\nfor the services; it was enough that \"the terms of [the defendant's\n\ncorrespondence] were worthy of the trust of the [plaintiff] which\n\nhad no reason to doubt of the good faith of the representation it\n\nwas given.\"    Id. at 1228-29.   Thus, the court concluded, because\n\nthe defendant \"caused a legal situation upon which [plaintiff]\n\nrelied, it cannot assume now a conduct contradictory to the one\n\n\n     6\n       The Fagots' claim of an implied-in-law contract was poorly\ndeveloped both before the district court and on appeal.       Not\nsurprisingly, therefore, the district court did not mention that\nclaim in any of its four published opinions in this case.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fwhich    gained   [plaintiff's]    trust.\"      Id.   at   1229   (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            Notwithstanding their reliance on Concrete Builders, the\nFagots did not attempt to show before the district court that Costa\n\nRica's conduct reasonably led them to believe that $5,000 in rent\n\nper month would be forthcoming, such that Costa Rica should be\nestopped from resisting such payment.        See id. at 1231 (explaining\n\nthat the defendant's behavior must \"be the basis of the trust of\n\n[the plaintiff who] has acted in good faith and . . . in a manner\n\nwhich would cause him prejudice if his trust was defrauded\").             The\n\nFagots' only interaction with Costa Rica was through its agents,\n\nthe Fourniers, who refused to pay any rent after the dispute over\n\nthe air conditioner in June of 1993, and who stubbornly ignored the\nFagots' repeated requests that they vacate the property.                  Such\n\nactions would not reasonably inspire trust.\n\n            Moreover, the Fagots' own conduct in the summer of 1993\nbelies   any   suggestion   of    detrimental    reliance.        The   Fagots\n\ninstructed the Fourniers to vacate the property by July 16, 1993.\n\nWhen the Fourniers did not comply, the Fagots mailed them a letter\n\ndemanding $5,000 for every month they remained on the property\n\nwithout a lease agreement.         The Fagots then learned that the\n\nFourniers had been operating the Consulate from the property.\n\nRoughly one month later, they filed suit against Costa Rica, the\n\nConsulate, and the Fourniers, alleging that the lease agreement was\n\nterminated in June of 1993, and that the defendants had since been\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fin \"adverse possession.\"        Their complaint sought, among other\n\nthings, to evict the defendants from the property.\n\n            Given the Fagots' repeated attempts to terminate their\nrelationship with Costa Rica and the Fourniers, they cannot now be\n\nheard to argue that they were lulled into inaction by Costa Rica's\n\npurported willingness to compensate them fully for its use of the\nproperty.    Accordingly, we conclude that there was no implied-in-\n\nlaw contract between Costa Rica and the Fagots under the principles\n\ndescribed in Concrete Builders.\n\nB.          Tortious Activity\n\n            We turn, then, to the tortious activity exception to\n\nforeign sovereign immunity.     Section 1605(a)(5) removes sovereign\nimmunity for actions in which\n            money damages are sought against a foreign\n            state for . . . damage to or loss of property,\n            occurring in the United States and caused by\n            the tortious act or omission of that foreign\n            state or of any official or employee of that\n            foreign state while acting within the scope of\n            his office or employment.\n\nThat exception extends only to non-discretionary torts; it does not\napply to \"any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the\nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless\n\nof whether the discretion be abused.\"     28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5)(A).\n            Here, the Fagots seek damages for tortious trespass.\nThey argue, first, that both Costa Rica and the Fourniers were\n\ntrespassing at least from July of 1993 -- the date by which they\nhad been instructed to leave -- until they vacated the property in\n\nOctober of 1994.      Second, they maintain that Costa Rica was\n\n                                  -12-\n\ftrespassing on the property from the beginning of the lease period\n\nin September, 1991.         In support of that more expansive claim, the\n\nFagots argue that the lease agreement prohibited the Fourniers from\nsubletting the property or using it for non-residential purposes;\n\nthat the Consulate is a separate legal entity from the Fourniers;\n\nand,   therefore,    that     Costa   Rica   (through     the    Consulate)    was\ntrespassing on the property even when the Fourniers were not.\n\n             We assume, without deciding, that the Fagots have stated\n\na claim for tortious trespass for the entire period of tenancy --\n\nthat is, from September of 1991 until October of 1994.                 We further\n\nassume that the Fourniers were acting within the scope of their\n\nemployment when they committed the alleged trespass. See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1605(a)(5).       We need not dwell on such questions because we\nconclude that the Fagots' trespass claims are \"based upon the\n\nexercise or performance . . . [of] a discretionary function,\" id.\n\n§   1605(a)(5)(A),      and     therefore    are      outside    the   scope     of\n§ 1605(a)(5).\n\n             The so-called \"discretionary function\" limitation set out\nin § 1605(a)(5)(A) of the FSIA is modeled on a similar exception to\n\njurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2680(a).     See H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 21 (1976), reprinted in\n\n1976 U.S.S.C.A.N. 6604, 6620 (hereafter \"House Report\").                       The\n\nlatter statute has received extensive judicial treatment, and\n\ndecisions    construing      its   discretionary      function    exception    are\n\nuseful in applying the parallel provision in the FSIA. The Supreme\n\nCourt has     crafted   a     two-part   test   for    determining     whether    a\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fchallenged government action is protected as \"discretionary\" under\n\nthe FTCA.    The first question is whether the conduct in question\n\n\"is a matter of choice for the acting employee.\"        Berkovitz v.\nUnited States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988).     If a \"federal statute,\n\nregulation or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for\n\nan employee to follow,\" then there is no room for choice and the\ndiscretionary function exception does not apply.     Id.\n\n            Second, assuming that the challenged conduct \"involves an\n\nelement of judgment,\" that judgment must be \"of the kind that the\n\ndiscretionary function exception was designed to shield.\" Id. The\n\npurpose of the exception is to \"prevent judicial 'second guessing'\n\nof legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,\n\neconomic and political policy through the medium of an action in\ntort.\" United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense\n\n(Varig Airlines), 467 U.S. 797, 814 (1984).      Thus, it \"protects\n\nonly governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of\npublic policy.\"    Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 537 (citing Dalehite v.\n\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 15, 36 (1953) (\"Where there is room for\n\npolicy judgment and decision there is discretion.\")).\n\n            With respect to the first prong of the test, the Fagots\n\ndo not dispute that the Fourniers had authority to set up a\n\nconsulate in Puerto Rico, and that, generally speaking, that task\n\ninvolved an element of choice or judgment.    However, they maintain\n\nthat the particular choices the Fourniers made -- namely, to\n\ninstall the Consulate on the property in violation of the terms of\n\nthe lease agreement, and to remain on the property without paying\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\frent after the lease was terminated -- were impermissible ones. In\n\nother words, although the Fourniers' authority was essentially\n\ndiscretionary, they acted outside that authority when they set up\nthe Consulate in violation of Puerto Rico landlord-tenant and\n\ntrespass law.\n\n           The Fagots' primary support for that argument is a 1948\ntreaty between the United States and Costa Rica, which provides\n\nthat either country may establish consulates in the other, and may\n\nbuy or lease land for that purpose \"in accordance with such\n\nconditions as may be prescribed by the laws of the receiving\n\nstate.\"    Consular Convention, Jan. 12, 1948, U.S.-Costa Rica,\n\nart. V, para. 1, 1 U.S.T. 247.            The Fagots argue that \"it is\n\naxiomatic that the laws of Puerto Rico and the United States, as\nthe receiving state, require the landowners' consent for the use of\n\nproperty.\"     Under the treaty, therefore, the Fourniers had no\n\ndiscretion to use the property in a manner proscribed by the lease\nagreement.\n\n             We note that it is unclear whether the phrase \"the laws\n\nof the receiving state\" is meant to refer to local Puerto Rican law\n\nas well as federal law.    Moreover, it is unlikely that the drafters\n\nof the treaty intended that every violation of local or federal law\n\nwould translate into a breach of the treaty itself.              We need not\n\nresolve those questions, however, because even if we adopt the\n\nFagots'   reading   of   the   treaty,    it   does   not   follow   that   the\n\nFourniers' actions were non-discretionary.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f            Treaty or no treaty, the Fourniers were bound to comply\n\nwith United States law, both local and federal.            The treaty does\n\nnot impose any special obligations on foreign officials; nor does\nit \"specifically prescribe[] a course of action\" for such officials\n\nto follow when setting up a Consulate in the United States.\n\nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536. A general obligation to avoid unlawful\n\nactivity -- applicable to everyone in the United States -- is\n\nhardly sufficient to remove all room for choice.           See Shansky v.\n\nUnited States, 164 F.3d 688, 691 (1st Cir. 1999) (concluding that\n\n\"statements     at     [a   high]   level    of     generality    do   not\n\nsatisfy . . . Berkovitz's specific prescription requirement\").           A\n\nmore specific directive is required before we can conclude that the\n\nFourniers' conduct was non-discretionary in the sense that it was\nnot \"the product of judgment or choice.\"          Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at\n\n536.7\n\n            The Fagots' argument suffers from a still more basic\nflaw.       Although    they   acknowledge   that    the   Fourniers   had\n\n\n\n        7\n       The Fagots also argue that, under the Foreign Missions Act\n(\"FMA\"), 22 U.S.C. § 4304(b), Costa Rica was obligated to acquire\nany \"benefits\" in the United States -- including \"the acquisition\nof real property by purchase [or] lease\" -- only through the\nSecretary of State. They point out that there is no evidence that\nthe Fourniers complied with that provision. However, § 4304(b)\nprovides only that \"[i]f the Secretary determines that such action\nis reasonably necessary on the basis of reciprocity or\notherwise . . . then the Secretary may require a foreign\nmission . . . to obtain benefits from or through the Secretary.\"\n(Emphasis added.)     Thus, if the Secretary of State has not\nexercised his authority under § 4304 -- and the Fagots do not argue\nthat he has -- then there is no basis for the claim that the\nFourniers violated the FMA by failing to obtain the Secretary's\nconsent before entering into the lease agreement.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fdiscretionary authority in general, they maintain that the Fagots\n\nhad no discretion to violate Puerto Rican landlord-tenant or\n\ntrespass law.      The crux of their claim, therefore, is that the\nFourniers'      actions    were   non-discretionary      because    they   were\n\nwrongful.\n\n            That argument conflates an abuse of discretion with an\nabsence    of   discretion.       The    discretionary   function    exception\n\nexplicitly extends to abuses of discretionary authority.                    See\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5)(A) (excepting claims based on the exercise\n\nof discretion \"regardless of whether the discretion be abused\").\n\n\"The exercise of discretion could not be abused without negligence\n\nor a wrongful act.\"         Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 33.      Accordingly, the\n\nfact that the Fourniers' actions may have been wrongful under\nPuerto    Rican   law     governing   landlord   and   tenant   relationships\n\ncannot, by itself, render those actions non-discretionary.\n\n             Indeed,       the    Fagots'      interpretation      reads    the\ndiscretionary function exception out of the statute entirely.                As\n\nexplained above, the exception functions as a limitation on the\n\ngeneral rule that a foreign sovereign is susceptible to suit for\n\nthe tortious acts of its employees.            The only cases in which the\n\nexception can possibly apply are those in which a foreign sovereign\n\nor one of its agents or employees is accused of a wrongful,\n\ntortious act.      Thus, if a tortious act were, by definition, non-\n\ndiscretionary, the discretionary functions exception would be a\n\ndead letter.      See Fagot Rodriguez IV, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 190 n.16\n\n(noting that the Fagots' argument \"effectively means that Costa\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fRica, as a result of that innocuous clause [in the treaty], may\n\nnever enjoy sovereign immunity in any claim dealing with embassy\n\nproperty and real estate since any claim for money damages under\nthe FSIA would obviously be founded on a violation of the law\").\n\nWe reject such a reading of the statute, and conclude that the\n\nFourniers'      conduct    was    \"discretionary\"      in   the   sense    that    it\ninvolved an element of judgment or choice.\n\n               We turn, therefore, to the second prong of the test, and\n\nask    whether    the   Fourniers'        choices   were    the   type    that    the\n\ndiscretionary function exception was designed to protect.                    As we\n\nhave explained in the context of the FTCA, the critical question\n\nhere is \"whether the acts or omissions that form the basis of the\n\nsuit     are    susceptible      to   a   policy-driven     analysis\"     or,     put\ndifferently, \"whether some plausible policy justification could\n\nhave undergirded the challenged conduct.\" Shansky, 164 F.3d at 692;\n\naccord    United    States       v.   Gaubert,   499   U.S.   315,   325    (1991)\n(explaining that \"[t]he focus of the inquiry is not on the agent's\n\nsubjective intent in exercising the discretion . . . , but on the\nnature of the actions taken and on whether they are susceptible to\n\npolicy    analysis\").         The     Fourniers'    decisions     regarding       the\n\nConsulate satisfy         that    standard.      The   initial    choices    as    to\n\nwhether, where, and how to set up the Consulate clearly implicated\n\npolicy issues.      See MacArthur Area Citizens Ass'n v. Rep. of Peru,\n\n809 F.2d 918, 922 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (\"It is beyond serious question\n\nthat establishing a chancery in the District of Columbia to conduct\n\nforeign relations is a discretionary public policy decision and\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fthat   this     decision   undergirds   the   specific   acts   which   the\n\nAssociation bewails.\"); cf. Joseph, 830 F.2d at 1020 n.1, 1027\n\n(concluding that \"the acquisition and operation of [a consular\nresidence] was a discretionary policy decision,\" but finding that\n\ntenants' \"purely destructive acts\" -- including extensive damage to\n\nthe property and the removal of fully grown trees, appliances,\nfurniture, light fixtures, shutters and drapes -- \"can hardly be\n\nconsidered part of [that] policy decision\").         The same is true of\n\nthe Fourniers' actions in the summer of 1993, when they were\n\nconfronted with early termination of the lease agreement and the\n\nFagots' demand for $5,000 monthly rent.           As the district court\n\nexplained:\n\n              [A]n evaluation of the range of alternatives\n              available to the [Fourniers] at the time of\n              the June termination notice reveals that there\n              were countervailing political and economic\n              costs and benefits attendant to each course of\n              action.   Perhaps Costa Rica and the consuls\n              could have moved the Consulate to a different\n              building, increased their diplomatic relations\n              budget, temporarily shut down the Consulate or\n              scrapped it altogether.    However, the Court\n              cannot sit in de novo review and select a\n              lawful alternative that would have been\n              superior.\n\nFagot Rodriguez IV, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 190.\n\n           We agree, and hold that the Fagots' trespass claims are\n\n\"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise\n\nor perform a discretionary function.\"         28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5)(A).\n\nAs such, they are excluded from the exception to immunity for\n\ntortious activity.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fC.          Immovable Property\n\n            The Fagots contend that their claims fall within the\n\nexception to sovereign immunity for \"any case in which . . . rights\n\nin immovable property situated in the United States are at issue.\"\n\nId. § 1605(a)(4). The district court disagreed, reasoning that the\n\nimmovable property exception extends only to actions involving\n\nrights to \"actual possession or title.\" Fagot Rodriguez IV, 139 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 195.    Neither of those rights is at issue here:              none\n\nof the defendants has used or possessed the Fagots' property since\n\nOctober of 1994, and they never challenged the Fagots' title.\nThus, the only right at stake is the Fagots' right to compensation\n\nfor non-payment of rent or for trespass.          Like the district court,\nwe conclude that purely compensatory rights, without more, are\ninsufficient to sustain jurisdiction under the immovable property\n\nexception.\n            The legislative history to the FSIA indicates that the\nimmovable    property   exception     was   intended   to   codify      existing\n\ninternational practice.      See House Report, supra, at *20.              Under\nthat practice, a foreign sovereign generally was not immune from\n\"an action to obtain possession of or establish a property interest\n\nin   immovable   property   located    in   the   territory   of     the   state\nexercising    jurisdiction.\"        Restatement     (Second)       of    Foreign\n\nRelations Law of the United States § 68(b) (1965), quoted in\n\nAsociacion de Reclamantes v. United Mexican States, 735 F.2d 1517,\n1521 (D.C. Cir. 1984).       However, the exception to immunity for\n\nclaims involving immovable property did not extend to cases, such\n\n                                    -20-\n\fas slip-and-fall suits seeking damages for injury suffered on a\n\nforeign state's property, in which the state's title or rights of\n\nuse and possession were not contested.          See Restatement, supra,\n§ 68(b) cmt. d.\n\n          The traditional real property exception was founded on\n\nthe view that \"[a] territorial sovereign has a primeval interest in\nresolving all disputes over use or right to use of real property\n\nwithin its own domain.\"       Asociacion de Reclamantes, 735 F.2d at\n\n1521. Such disputes not only implicate core sovereignty interests;\n\nthey also raise questions of institutional competence. Put simply,\n\nforeign courts typically are \"not well equipped to decide property\n\ninterests or rights to possession with regard to land outside their\n\njurisdiction, particularly land located in a foreign nation.\"          Id.\n\nThus, it is important for property disputes to be adjudicated by\n\nlocal courts, notwithstanding foreign sovereign immunity.\n\n          Those    concerns   suggest    that   the   immovable   property\nexception \"was not intended broadly to abrogate immunity for any\n\naction touching upon real estate.\"       MacArthur Area Citizens Ass'n,\n\n809 F.2d at 921.     Rather, like the traditional exception it was\n\nintended to codify, its purpose is to permit jurisdiction in cases\n\nwhere the United States' interests in adjudicating the dispute are\n\nparticularly strong.    It is difficult to understand how a simple\n\ncontract dispute over nonpayment of rent -- without more -- falls\n\nwithin that category.   The Fagots do not cite, nor can we find, any\n\ncase so holding.      To the contrary, courts have construed the\n\nimmovable property exception to apply only in cases that implicate\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\frights of ownership, use, or possession.                    See, e.g., City of\n\nEnglewood v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 773 F.2d\n\n31, 36 (3d Cir. 1985) (describing immovable property exception as\na \"title dispute exception\" codifying \"the recognized principle of\n\ninternational law that a sovereign may resolve disputes over title\n\nto real estate within its geographic limits\"); cf. Logan v. Dupuis,\n\n990 F. Supp. 26, 29 (D.D.C. 1997) (interpreting the analogous\n\nexception to diplomatic immunity to exclude suits for breach of a\n\nrental contract).\n\n            In support of their expansive reading of the immovable\n\nproperty exception, the Fagots point to the legislative history of\n\nthe FSIA.     They emphasize certain language in the House Report\n\nsuggesting    that    the      pre-existing      real    property     exception     to\nsovereign    immunity     extended       to   suits     involving   \"questions      of\n\nownership, rent, servitudes, and similar matters.\"                   House Report,\n\nsupra, at *20 (emphasis added).8                 We do not believe that one\npassing    reference      to    \"rent\"    in    the     legislative      history    is\n\nsufficient to show that Congress intended the immovable property\nexception to apply broadly to garden-variety contract disputes in\n\nwhich title or possession is not in dispute.                        As the court\n\nexplained in Asociacion de Reclamantes, 735 F.2d at 1522 n.5,\n\n\"actions     for   rent     frequently        involve    issues     of   title     and\n\npossession.\"       Thus, the reference to \"rent\" in the House Report\n\n     8\n       Specifically, the House Report stated that such suits \"seem\nto be permitted\" under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic\nRelations, which exempts diplomatic or consular property from\n\"search, requisition, attachment or execution.\"     House Report,\nsupra, at *20 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                         -22-\n\f\"does not establish any departure from the traditional principle\n\nthat the real estate exception to sovereign immunity is bounded by\n\nconcern for those issues.\"           Id.\n\n            The Fagots also rely on the Restatement (Third) of\n\nForeign Relations § 455, cmt. b, which states that the immovable\n\nproperty exception includes \"controversies concerning payment of\nrent, taxes, and other fees concerning [consular premises].\"                   Like\n\nthe legislative history, however, the Restatement is silent on the\n\nquestion    whether    such    controversies     are      cognizable    when   they\n\ninvolve only the payment of rent or other debts.                  Comment b to\n\n§ 455 states in full:\n\n             Title to land and to buildings on land\n             traditionally is subject to adjudication by\n             the courts of the state where the land is\n             situated.   The  fact   that   the  land   (or\n             buildings, apartments, or appurtenances) in\n             controversy is owned or leased by a foreign\n             state does not detract from the desirability\n             of adjudicating controversies in local courts.\n             Premises used for an embassy, consulate, or\n             diplomatic mission come under this rule, so\n             that controversies relating to rights of\n             ownership, possession, occupation, or use, as\n             well as controversies concerning payment of\n             rent, taxes, and other fees concerning such\n             premises are subject to adjudication in local\n             courts.\n\nThe phrase \"as well as\"        certainly could mean that \"controversies\n\nconcerning    the    payment    of   rent\"    can,   by    themselves,     support\n\njurisdiction under the immovable property exception.                   However, it\n\nalso could mean that a plaintiff can recover \"rent, taxes, and\n\nother fees\" in the process of adjudicating \"rights of ownership,\n\npossession, occupation or use.\"            The latter reading finds support\n\nin   the   first    sentence   of    the   comment,    which    emphasizes      the\n\n                                       -23-\n\ftraditional importance of settling questions about \"title\" to real\n\nproperty.      Although     actions   for     rent    sometimes     involve     such\n\nquestions,    a    simple   controversy      over    the   breach   of    a   rental\ncontract -- unaccompanied by issues of ownership, possession, or\n\nuse -- usually will not implicate the special concerns regarding\n\nreal property located on United States territory.\n            We conclude that the immovable property exception applies\n\nonly in cases in which rights of ownership, use, or possession are\n\nat issue.     As noted, those rights are not implicated here:                   the\n\ndefendants voluntarily vacated the property in October of 1994, and\n\nthey never questioned the Fagots' ownership.                The only remaining\n\ndispute concerns Costa Rica's liability for non-payment of rent.\n\nThe peculiar circumstances of this case should not obscure the fact\nthat such a dispute is, first and foremost, a contract dispute.\n\nThus, plaintiffs seeking to recover unpaid rent usually will be\n\nable to proceed under the commercial activity exception to foreign\nsovereign immunity.\n\n             That approach may fail where -- as here -- the foreign\n\nsovereign did not in fact agree to pay the rent demanded.                 However,\n\nthe possibility that jurisdiction will be lacking in some cases\n\nshould not lead us to adopt an unduly broad reading of the\n\nimmovable property exception.         The very purpose of the FSIA is to\n\nrestrict the class of cases in which United States courts can\n\nadjudicate claims against foreign sovereigns.                 As we have seen,\n\neach   of    the   exceptions    to   the     FSIA    has    its    own   specific\n\nrequirements designed to identify cases in which immunity is or is\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fnot appropriate.    Plaintiffs should not be allowed to circumvent\n\nthose requirements simply because their claims are somehow related\n\nto real property.\n\n                                III.\n\n            One final matter requires our attention.    The Fagots\n\nclaim that Costa Rica failed to produce certain documents in its\n\npossession relevant to the exceptions for commercial and tortious\n\nactivity.    They argue that the district court erred in entering\n\njudgment \"without affording [the Fagots] an opportunity to conclude\n\njurisdictional discovery\" as to those exceptions, and without\nimposing sanctions on Costa Rica for its failure to comply with the\n\nFagots' discovery requests. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d) (authorizing\n\nsanctions for discovery misconduct). \"We review a district court's\nhandling of pretrial matters, including discovery, for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\"    Cummings v. Standard Register Co., 265 F.3d 56, 68\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); see also Guex v. Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. &\n\nAnnuity Co., 146 F.3d 40, 41 (1st Cir. 1998) (explaining that\n\ndistrict court's decisions regarding sanctions under Rule 37 are\nsubject to abuse of discretion review).   Assuming, arguendo, that\n\nthe requested documents might have been important in establishing\n\nan implied contract or a non-discretionary tort, we find no abuse\nhere.\n            The Fagots do not seriously dispute that the district\n\ncourt gave them an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery. They\n\nargue instead that the court did not do enough to ensure that Costa\n\nRica responded to their requests for documents. However, they have\n\n                                -25-\n\fgiven us no basis to believe that any problem existed for the\n\ndistrict court to remedy.       Costa Rica insists that it turned over\n\nall the documents in its possession, and the Fagots have not\nsuggested any reason why we should doubt that claim.\n\n           Nor did the Fagots present a coherent claim of discovery\n\nabuse to the district court.          As noted above, the court first\nentered summary judgment for Costa Rica and the Consulate in its\n\n1996   decision   in    Fagot   Rodriguez   I.        The   Fagots    moved   for\n\nreconsideration and for additional discovery, and the court allowed\n\nthem 60 days for discovery on the commercial and tortious activity\n\nexceptions.   At that point, the Fagots submitted a request for\n\ndocuments, which they claim Costa Rica ignored.                      (Costa Rica\n\nresponds   that   the    request   mirrored      an    earlier    request     for\nproduction, with which they already had complied fully.)                Although\n\nthe Fagots mentioned the matter at a hearing in 1997 -- prior to\n\nthe court's decision in Fagot Rodriguez II -- they never lodged a\n\nformal objection regarding Costa Rica's alleged non-compliance, or\n\nmoved to compel disclosure under Rule 37(a)(2).                  Instead, they\nforged ahead with their motion for summary judgment, relying on\n\nfacts obtained through a request for admissions.              Indeed, between\n\nthe hearing in 1997 and the court's final decision in 2001, the\n\nFagots did not mention the discovery issue. Given that history, we\n\nhave no trouble concluding that the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion by failing to take some unspecified initiative\n\ndirected at some unspecified discovery abuse by Costa Rica.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n                                    -26-\n\f",

The FSIA provides the exclusive basis for acquiring subject matter jurisdiction over foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1330, 1604. Under the statute, \"a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1604, unless the case falls within one of the exceptions to immunity set out in &#167; 1605. At issue here are the exceptions for actions arising out of a foreign state's commercial or tortious activity, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1605(a)(2) &amp; (5), or involving rights in immovable property, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1605(a)(4). The district court concluded that none of the exceptions applied. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are not disputed. Appellants, Gabriel Fagot Rodriguez and Angeles Diaz Rivera (\"the Fagots\"), own a house and surrounding property in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In September, 1991, the Fagots agreed to lease the property to Hilda Fournier and Angelo Greco Fournier (\"the Fourniers\") for two years, at a rate of $2,500 per month. Although the Fourniers were then the Consul and Vice-Consul of the Republic of Costa Rica, they signed the lease in their individual capacities. The lease agreement provided that the Fourniers were to use the property for residential purposes only and prohibited them from subleasing to third parties without the Fagots' prior written consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the restrictions in the lease agreement, the Fourniers began to operate the Costa Rican Consulate (\"the Consulate\") from the property. The Fagots were unaware of their actions, however, and the Fourniers remained on the property without conflict for most of the two-year lease term. The trouble began in June of 1993, when &#8212; following a dispute over an air conditioner &#8212; the Fourniers failed to pay the monthly rent. On June 16, 1993, the Fagots notified the Fourniers by letter that the lease was terminated effective immediately, and that the Fourniers had to vacate the premises by July 16, 1993. The Fagots also demanded that the Fourniers pay them $10,000 &#8212; the total rent due for the balance of the lease term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two months passed, and the Fourniers neither vacated the property, nor paid the requested amount. On August 19, 1993, the Fagots sent another letter informing the Fourniers that \"since a lease contract no longer exists that stipulates the rent to be paid for the use and enjoyment of the property, you will pay monthly, retroactively to July 16, 1993, the sum of $5,000.00, that is from the date you should have vacated the property.\" The letter specified that the new $5,000 rental charge was to be paid \"for the months of July, August and September 1993.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time after mailing the August demand letter, the Fagots learned that the Fourniers had been operating the Consulate from the property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On September 30, 1993 &#8212; the last day of the original lease term &#8212; they filed suit against the Fourniers, the Consulate, and the Republic of Costa Rica (\"Costa Rica\"), alleging breach of contract, personal injury, and damage to or loss of property. The complaint sought eviction as well as monetary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties quickly filed a flurry of motions. The Fagots sought immediate eviction. Costa Rica and the Consulate rejoined with claims of sovereign immunity and inadequate service. In the meantime, the Fourniers and the Consulate remained on the property, still without paying rent. They finally vacated the property in October of 1994, 16 months after the Fagots terminated the lease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 1994, Costa Rica and the Consulate moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were immune from suit under the FSIA. The Fagots responded that the case fell into the exceptions to immunity for actions involving rights in immovable property, or arising out of commercial or tortious activity by a foreign state. The district court initially concluded that none of those exceptions applied and entered summary judgment for Costa Rica. <i>Fagot Rodriguez v. Republic of Costa Rica,</i> 934 F.Supp. 493 (D.P.R.1996) (<i>Fagot Rodriguez I</i>).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Fagots moved for reconsideration and for additional discovery. The court granted their requests and vacated its judgment. Eventually, the Fagots filed their own motion for summary judgment on the question of jurisdiction under the FSIA. This time, the court determined that the case could proceed under the commercial activity and tortious activity exceptions. <i>Fagot Rodriguez v. Republic of Costa Rica,</i> 99 F.Supp.2d 157 (D.P.R.1999) (<i>Fagot Rodriguez II</i>). After holding a hearing on the question of damages, it entered an order holding Costa Rica and the Consulate jointly liable with the Fourniers for non-payment of rent between August, 1993 and October, 1994. The court concluded that the Fourniers &#8212; but not Costa Rica and the Consulate &#8212; also were liable for rent due prior to August, 1993, and for property damage and mental distress. <i>Fagot Rodriguez v. Republic of Costa Rica,</i> 99 F.Supp.2d 170 (D.P.R.1999) (<i>Fagot Rodriguez III</i>). The Fagots again moved for reconsideration, arguing that Costa Rica and the Consulate were jointly liable for all damages. Again, the district court agreed to reconsider its judgment. However, instead of holding Costa Rica and the Consulate liable for more damages, it reverted to its earlier view that none of the exceptions provided a basis for jurisdiction under the FSIA, and dismissed the claims against Costa Rica and the Consulate. <i>Fagot Rodriguez v. Republic of Costa Rica,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d 173 (D.P.R.2001) (<i>Fagot Rodriguez IV</i>). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction under the FSIA. <i>See Honduras Aircraft Registry, Ltd. v. Gov't of Honduras,</i> 129 F.3d 543, 546 (11th Cir.1997) (conducting de novo review of FSIA jurisdictional question); <i>Export Group v. Reef Indus., Inc.,</i> 54 F.3d 1466, 1469 (9th Cir.1995) (\"[T]he existence of subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA is a question of law subject to de novo review.\"); <i>cf. Irving v. United States,</i> 162 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc) (applying \"plenary review\" to the question of jurisdiction over the United States government under the Federal Tort Claims Act). As noted, the Fagots assert several bases for jurisdiction. First, they argue that Costa Rica<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> can be held liable for non-payment of rent under the commercial activity exception, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(2), based on an implied lease contract created by the August, 1993, demand letter. Second, they maintain that Costa Rica's use of the property amounted to a trespass, thus supporting jurisdiction under the tortious activity exception, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1605(a)(5). Finally, the Fagots argue that they can recover for nonpayment of rent (or, in the alternative, damages for trespass) under the exception for actions involving \"rights in immovable property,\" <i>id.,</i> &#167; 1605(a)(4). We address those claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Commercial Activity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 1605(a)(2), a foreign state is subject to jurisdiction in any case \"in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state.\" The term \"commercial activity\" encompasses both \"a regular course of commercial conduct\" and \"a particular commercial transaction or act.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1603(d). In assessing whether a certain transaction or course of conduct is commercial in character, courts must look to the \"nature\" of the activity rather than its \"purpose.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the question is not whether the foreign government [was] acting with a profit motive or instead with the aim of fulfilling uniquely sovereign objectives. Rather, the issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state perform[ed] (whatever the motive behind them) [were] the <i>type</i> of actions by which a private party engages in \"trade and traffic or commerce.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Rep. of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc.,</i> 504 U.S. 607, 614, 112 S.Ct. 2160, 119 L.Ed.2d 394 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to qualify for the commercial activity exception, an action must be \"based upon\" commercial activity by the defendant foreign state. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(2). The Supreme Court has explained that a claim is \"based\" on \"those elements ... that, if proven, would entitle [the] plaintiff to relief under his theory of the case.\" <i>Saudi Arabia v. Nelson,</i> 507 U.S. 349, 357, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993). Here, the Fagots seek damages for, <i>inter alia,</i> breach of contract. There is no dispute that contract formation is an essential element of that claim, and that entering into a contract for lease of property constitutes \"commercial activity.\" <i>See, e.g., Joseph v. Office of the Consulate General of Nigeria,</i> 830 F.2d 1018, 1024 (9th Cir.1987); <i>see also Walter Fuller Aircraft Sales, Inc. v. Rep. of the Philippines,</i> 965 F.2d 1375, 1386 (5th Cir.1992) (noting the commercial nature of the making or breaching of a contract); <i>Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Med. Ctr. v. Hellenic Rep.,</i> 877 F.2d 574, 578 (7th Cir.1989) (noting that \"contracts for the purchase or sale of goods or services are presumptively `commercial activities'\"). The important question is whether Costa Rica in fact contracted with the Fagots for use of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the parties argued extensively over whether Costa Rica was bound by the original lease agreement between the Fourniers and the Fagots. The Fagots insisted that, although the Fourniers signed the lease in their individual capacities, Costa Rica could be held liable under agency principles. They do not press that claim on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Instead, the Fagots argue that the events in the summer of 1993 gave rise to an <i>implied</i> lease contract between themselves and Costa Rica.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots offer two versions of an implied contract theory. On the first theory, the August, 1993, demand letter &#8212; stating that, in the absence of a lease agreement, the Fourniers would be charged $5,000 for each month they remained on the property &#8212; constituted an offer for a month-to-month lease, at a rate of $5,000. By remaining on the property, the argument goes, Costa Rica accepted the offer and created a contract implied in fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots recognize that an implied-in-fact contract requires a \"mutual intent to contract.\" Nevertheless, they have not even attempted to show such mutual intent here. To begin with, the Fagots have not argued &#8212; much less established &#8212; that they intended to enter into a month-to-month lease agreement with Costa Rica. The August demand letter was addressed to the Fourniers, not Costa Rica. In the course of the proceedings before the district court, the Fagots explained that \"at that particular point in time (August, 1993), the Fagots were unaware that Costa Rica and the Consulate occupied the property.\" They argued that \"[s]uch lack of knowledge should not operate against them.\" That generalization is not helpful. On the issue of an implied-in-fact contract, the Fagots' lack of knowledge about the involvement of Costa Rica undermines their claim that the demand letter was an offer <i>to Costa Rica.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, whatever the Fagots' intent, there is no suggestion in the record that Costa Rica agreed to pay the Fagots $5,000 per month for its use of the property. Thus, even if we treat the Fagots' demand letter as an offer to Costa Rica, there is no evidence that Costa Rica accepted it. Given the absence of any evidence showing a mutual intent to contract, we conclude that Costa Rica did not enter into an implied-in-fact lease for the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots' second theory posits a contract implied in law, or \"quasi contract.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> They point out correctly that a quasi contract does not depend on the consent of the parties but is \"implied in law to prevent unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of another.\" However, the Fagots have made no effort to apply the general principles of quasi contract to the facts of this case. Their sole authority is <i>International General Electric v. Concrete Builders of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 104 P.R.R. 1221 (1976), in which the Puerto Rico Supreme Court found a contract implied in law where the plaintiff reasonably relied on the defendant's assurance that it would pay for certain services. The court noted that it was immaterial that the defendant did not <i>actually</i> intend to pay for the services; it was enough that \"the terms of [the defendant's correspondence] were worthy of the trust of the [plaintiff] which had no reason to doubt of the good faith of the representation it was given.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1228-29. Thus, the court concluded, because the defendant \"caused a legal situation upon which [plaintiff] relied, it cannot assume now a conduct contradictory to the one which gained [plaintiff's] trust.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1229 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding their reliance on <i>Concrete Builders,</i> the Fagots did not attempt to show before the district court that Costa Rica's conduct reasonably led them to believe that $5,000 in rent per month would be forthcoming, such that Costa Rica should be estopped from resisting such payment. <i>See id.</i> at 1231 (explaining that the defendant's behavior must \"be the basis of the trust of [the plaintiff who] has acted in good faith and ... in a manner which would cause him prejudice if his trust was defrauded\"). The Fagots' only interaction with Costa Rica was through its agents, the Fourniers, who refused to pay <i>any</i> rent after the dispute over the air conditioner in June of 1993, and who stubbornly ignored the Fagots' repeated requests that they vacate the property. Such actions would not reasonably inspire trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Fagots' own conduct in the summer of 1993 belies any suggestion of detrimental reliance. The Fagots instructed the Fourniers to vacate the property by July 16, 1993. When the Fourniers did not comply, the Fagots mailed them a letter demanding $5,000 for every month they remained on the property without a lease agreement. The Fagots then learned that the Fourniers had been operating the Consulate from the property. Roughly one month later, they filed suit against Costa Rica, the Consulate, and the Fourniers, alleging that the lease agreement was terminated in June of 1993, and that the defendants had since been in \"adverse possession.\" Their complaint sought, among other things, to evict the defendants from the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the Fagots' repeated attempts to terminate their relationship with Costa Rica and the Fourniers, they cannot now be heard to argue that they were lulled into inaction by Costa Rica's purported willingness to compensate them fully for its use of the property. Accordingly, we conclude that there was no implied-in-law contract between Costa Rica and the Fagots under the principles described in <i>Concrete Builders.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Tortious Activity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the tortious activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity. Section 1605(a)(5) removes sovereign immunity for actions in which</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">money damages are sought against a foreign state for ... damage to or loss of property, occurring in the United States and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That exception extends only to non-discretionary torts; it does not apply to \"any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Fagots seek damages for tortious trespass. They argue, first, that both Costa Rica and the Fourniers were trespassing at least from July of 1993 &#8212; the date by which they had been instructed to leave &#8212; until they vacated the property in October of 1994. Second, they maintain that Costa Rica was trespassing on the property from the beginning of the lease period in September, 1991. In support of that more expansive claim, the Fagots argue that the lease agreement prohibited the Fourniers from subletting the property or using it for non-residential purposes; that the Consulate is a separate legal entity from the Fourniers; and, therefore, that Costa Rica (through the Consulate) was trespassing on the property even when the Fourniers were not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, without deciding, that the Fagots have stated a claim for tortious trespass for the entire period of tenancy &#8212; that is, from September of 1991 until October of 1994. We further assume that the Fourniers were acting within the scope of their employment when they committed the alleged trespass. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(5). We need not dwell on such questions because we conclude that the Fagots' trespass claims are \"based upon the exercise or performance ... [of] a discretionary function,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A), and therefore are outside the scope of &#167; 1605(a)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The so-called \"discretionary function\" limitation set out in &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A) of the FSIA is modeled on a similar exception to jurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a). <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, at 21 (1976), <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.S.C.A.N. 6604, 6620 (hereafter \"House Report\"). The latter statute has received extensive judicial treatment, and decisions construing its discretionary function exception are useful in applying the parallel provision in the FSIA. The Supreme Court has crafted a two-part test for determining whether a challenged government action is protected as \"discretionary\" under the FTCA. The first question is whether the conduct in question \"is a matter of choice for the acting employee.\" <i>Berkovitz v. United States,</i> 486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988). If a \"federal statute, regulation or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,\" then there is no room for choice and the discretionary function exception does not apply. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, assuming that the challenged conduct \"involves an element of judgment,\" that judgment must be \"of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.\" <i>Id.</i> The purpose of the exception is to \"prevent judicial `second guessing' of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.\" <i>United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines),</i> 467 U.S. 797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984). Thus, it \"protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.\" <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 537, 108 S.Ct. 1954 (citing <i>Dalehite v. United States,</i> 346 U.S. 15, 36, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953) (\"Where there is room for policy judgment and decision there is discretion.\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first prong of the test, the Fagots do not dispute that the Fourniers had authority to set up a consulate in Puerto Rico, and that, generally speaking, that task involved an element of choice or judgment. However, they maintain that the particular choices the Fourniers made &#8212; namely, to install the Consulate on the property in violation of the terms of the lease agreement, and to remain on the property without paying rent after the lease was terminated &#8212; were impermissible ones. In other words, although the Fourniers' authority was essentially discretionary, they acted outside that authority when they set up the Consulate in violation of Puerto Rico landlord-tenant and trespass law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots' primary support for that argument is a 1948 treaty between the United States and Costa Rica, which provides that either country may establish consulates in the other, and may buy or lease land for that purpose \"in accordance with such conditions as may be prescribed by the laws of the receiving state.\" Consular Convention, Jan. 12, 1948, U.S.-Costa Rica, art. V, para. 1, 1 U.S.T. 247. The Fagots argue that \"it is axiomatic that the laws of Puerto Rico and the United States, as the receiving state, require the landowners' consent for the use of property.\" Under the treaty, therefore, the Fourniers had no discretion to use the property in a manner proscribed by the lease agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that it is unclear whether the phrase \"the laws of the receiving state\" is meant to refer to local Puerto Rican law as well as federal law. Moreover, it is unlikely that the drafters of the treaty intended that every violation of local or federal law would translate into a breach of the treaty itself. We need not resolve those questions, however, because even if we adopt the Fagots' reading of the treaty, it does not follow that the Fourniers' actions were non-discretionary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treaty or no treaty, the Fourniers were bound to comply with United States law, both local and federal. The treaty does not impose any special obligations on foreign officials; nor does it \"specifically prescribe[] a course of action\" for such officials to follow when setting up a Consulate in the United States. <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954. A general obligation to avoid unlawful activity &#8212; applicable to everyone in the United States &#8212; is hardly sufficient to remove all room for choice. <i>See Shansky v. United States,</i> 164 F.3d 688, 691 (1st Cir.1999) (concluding that \"statements at [a high] level of generality do not satisfy ... <i>Berkovitz</i>'s specific prescription requirement\"). A more specific directive is required before we can conclude that the Fourniers' conduct was non-discretionary in the sense that it was not \"the product of judgment or choice.\" <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots' argument suffers from a still more basic flaw. Although they acknowledge that the Fourniers had discretionary authority in general, they maintain that the Fourniers had no discretion to violate Puerto Rican landlord-tenant or trespass law. The crux of their claim, therefore, is that the Fourniers' actions were non-discretionary <i>because</i> they were wrongful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That argument conflates an abuse of discretion with an absence of discretion. The discretionary function exception explicitly extends to abuses of discretionary authority. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A) (excepting claims based on the exercise of discretion \"regardless of whether the discretion be abused\"). \"The exercise of discretion could not be abused without negligence or a wrongful act.\" <i>Dalehite,</i> 346 U.S. at 33, 73 S.Ct. 956. Accordingly, the fact that the Fourniers' actions may have been wrongful under Puerto Rican law governing landlord and tenant relationships cannot, by itself, render those actions non-discretionary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Fagots' interpretation reads the discretionary function exception out of the statute entirely. As explained above, the exception functions as a limitation on the general rule that a foreign sovereign is susceptible to suit for the tortious acts of its employees. The only cases in which the exception can <i>possibly</i> apply are those in which a foreign sovereign or one of its agents or employees is accused of a wrongful, tortious act. Thus, if a tortious act were, by definition, non-discretionary, the discretionary functions exception would be a dead letter. <i>See Fagot Rodriguez IV,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d at 190 n. 16 (noting that the Fagots' argument \"effectively means that Costa Rica, as a result of that innocuous clause [in the treaty], may never enjoy sovereign immunity in any claim dealing with embassy property and real estate since any claim for money damages under the FSIA would obviously be founded on a violation of the law\"). We reject such a reading of the statute, and conclude that the Fourniers' conduct was \"discretionary\" in the sense that it involved an element of judgment or choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, therefore, to the second prong of the test, and ask whether the Fourniers' choices were the type that the discretionary function exception was designed to protect. As we have explained in the context of the FTCA, the critical question here is \"whether the acts or omissions that form the basis of the suit are susceptible to a policy-driven analysis\" or, put differently, \"whether some plausible policy justification could have undergirded the challenged conduct.\" <i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 692; <i>accord United States v. Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. 315, 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991) (explaining that \"[t]he focus of the inquiry is not on the agent's subjective intent in exercising the discretion ..., but on the nature of the actions taken and on whether they are susceptible to policy analysis\"). The Fourniers' decisions regarding the Consulate satisfy that standard. The initial choices as to whether, where, and how to set up the Consulate clearly implicated policy issues. <i>See MacArthur Area Citizens Ass'n v. Rep. of Peru,</i> 809 F.2d 918, 922 (D.C.Cir.1987) (\"It is beyond serious question that establishing a chancery in the District of Columbia to conduct foreign relations is a discretionary public policy decision and that this decision undergirds the specific acts which the Association bewails.\"); <i>cf. Joseph,</i> 830 F.2d at 1020 n. 1, 1027 (concluding that \"the <i>acquisition and operation</i> of [a consular residence] was a discretionary policy decision,\" but finding that tenants' \"purely destructive acts\" &#8212; including extensive damage to the property and the removal of fully grown trees, appliances, furniture, light fixtures, shutters and drapes &#8212; \"can hardly be considered part of [that] policy decision\"). The same is true of the Fourniers' actions in the summer of 1993, when they were confronted with early termination of the lease agreement and the Fagots' demand for $5,000 monthly rent. As the district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]n evaluation of the range of alternatives available to the [Fourniers] at the time of the June termination notice reveals that there were countervailing political and economic costs and benefits attendant to each course of action. Perhaps Costa Rica and the consuls could have moved the Consulate to a different building, increased their diplomatic relations budget, temporarily shut down the Consulate or scrapped it altogether. However, the Court cannot sit in de novo review and select a lawful alternative that would have been superior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Fagot Rodriguez IV,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d at 190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree, and hold that the Fagots' trespass claims are \"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A). As such, they are excluded from the exception to immunity for tortious activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Immovable Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots contend that their claims fall within the exception to sovereign immunity for \"any case in which ... rights in immovable property situated in the United States are at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1605(a)(4). The district court disagreed, reasoning that the immovable property exception extends only to actions involving rights to \"actual possession or title.\" <i>Fagot Rodriguez IV,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d at 195. Neither of those rights is at issue here: none of the defendants has used or possessed the Fagots' property since October of 1994, and they never challenged the Fagots' title. Thus, the only right at stake is the Fagots' right to compensation for non-payment of rent or for trespass. Like the district court, we conclude that purely compensatory rights, without more, are insufficient to sustain jurisdiction under the immovable property exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history to the FSIA indicates that the immovable property exception was intended to codify existing international practice. <i>See</i> House Report, <i>supra,</i> at *20. Under that practice, a foreign sovereign generally was not immune from \"an action to obtain possession of or establish a property interest in immovable property located in the territory of the state exercising jurisdiction.\" <i>Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States</i> &#167; 68(b) (1965), <i>quoted in Asociacion de Reclamantes v. United Mexican States,</i> 735 F.2d 1517, 1521 (D.C.Cir.1984). However, the exception to immunity for claims involving immovable property did not extend to cases, such as slip-and-fall suits seeking damages for injury suffered on a foreign state's property, in which the state's title or rights of use and possession were not contested. <i>See Restatement, supra,</i> &#167; 68(b) cmt. d.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The traditional real property exception was founded on the view that \"[a] territorial sovereign has a primeval interest in resolving all disputes over use or right to use of real property within its own domain.\" <i>Asociacion de Reclamantes,</i> 735 F.2d at 1521. Such disputes not only implicate core sovereignty interests; they also raise questions of institutional competence. Put simply, foreign courts typically are \"not well equipped to decide property interests or rights to possession with regard to land outside their jurisdiction, particularly land located in a foreign nation.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, it is important for property disputes to be adjudicated by local courts, notwithstanding foreign sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those concerns suggest that the immovable property exception \"was not intended broadly to abrogate immunity for any action touching upon real estate.\" <i>MacArthur Area Citizens Ass'n,</i> 809 F.2d at 921. Rather, like the traditional exception it was intended to codify, its purpose is to permit jurisdiction in cases where the United States' interests in adjudicating the dispute are particularly strong. It is difficult to understand how a simple contract dispute over nonpayment of rent &#8212; without more &#8212; falls within that category. The Fagots do not cite, nor can we find, any case so holding. To the contrary, courts have construed the immovable property exception to apply only in cases that implicate rights of ownership, use, or possession. <i>See, e.g., City of Englewood v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,</i> 773 F.2d 31, 36 (3d Cir.1985) (describing immovable property exception as a \"title dispute exception\" codifying \"the recognized principle of international law that a sovereign may resolve disputes over title to real estate within its geographic limits\"); <i>cf. Logan v. Dupuis,</i> 990 F.Supp. 26, 29 (D.D.C.1997) (interpreting the analogous exception to diplomatic immunity to exclude suits for breach of a rental contract).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their expansive reading of the immovable property exception, the Fagots point to the legislative history of the FSIA. They emphasize certain language in the House Report suggesting that the pre-existing real property exception to sovereign immunity extended to suits involving \"questions of ownership, <i>rent,</i> servitudes, and similar matters.\" House Report, <i>supra,</i> at *20 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We do not believe that one passing reference to \"rent\" in the legislative history is sufficient to show that Congress intended the immovable property exception to apply broadly to garden-variety contract disputes in which title or possession is not in dispute. As the court explained in <i>Asociacion de Reclamantes,</i> 735 F.2d at 1522 n. 5, \"actions for rent frequently involve issues of title and possession.\" Thus, the reference to \"rent\" in the House Report \"does not establish any departure from the traditional principle that the real estate exception to sovereign immunity is bounded by concern for those issues.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots also rely on the <i>Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations</i> &#167; 455, cmt. b, which states that the immovable property exception includes \"controversies concerning payment of rent, taxes, and other fees concerning [consular premises].\" Like the legislative history, however, the <i>Restatement</i> is silent on the question whether such controversies are cognizable when they involve <i>only</i> the payment of rent or other debts. Comment b to &#167; 455 states in full:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title to land and to buildings on land traditionally is subject to adjudication by the courts of the state where the land is situated. The fact that the land (or buildings, apartments, or appurtenances) in controversy is owned or leased by a foreign state does not detract from the desirability of adjudicating controversies in local courts. Premises used for an embassy, consulate, or diplomatic mission come under this rule, so that controversies relating to rights of ownership, possession, occupation, or use, as well as controversies concerning payment of rent, taxes, and other fees concerning such premises are subject to adjudication in local courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"as well as\" certainly <i>could</i> mean that \"controversies concerning the payment of rent\" can, by themselves, support jurisdiction under the immovable property exception. However, it also could mean that a plaintiff can recover \"rent, taxes, and other fees\" in the process of adjudicating \"rights of ownership, possession, occupation or use.\" The latter reading finds support in the first sentence of the comment, which emphasizes the traditional importance of settling questions about \"title\" to real property. Although actions for rent sometimes involve such questions, a simple controversy over the breach of a rental contract &#8212; unaccompanied by issues of ownership, possession, or use &#8212; usually will not implicate the special concerns regarding real property located on United States territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the immovable property exception applies only in cases in which rights of ownership, use, or possession are at issue. As noted, those rights are not implicated here: the defendants voluntarily vacated the property in October of 1994, and they never questioned the Fagots' ownership. The only remaining dispute concerns Costa Rica's liability for non-payment of rent. The peculiar circumstances of this case should not obscure the fact that such a dispute is, first and foremost, a contract dispute. Thus, plaintiffs seeking to recover unpaid rent usually will be able to proceed under the commercial activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That approach may fail where &#8212; as here &#8212; the foreign sovereign did not in fact agree to pay the rent demanded. However, the possibility that jurisdiction will be lacking in some cases should not lead us to adopt an unduly broad reading of the immovable property exception. The very purpose of the FSIA is to restrict the class of cases in which United States courts can adjudicate claims against foreign sovereigns. As we have seen, each of the exceptions to the FSIA has its own specific requirements designed to identify cases in which immunity is or is not appropriate. Plaintiffs should not be allowed to circumvent those requirements simply because their claims are somehow related to real property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final matter requires our attention. The Fagots claim that Costa Rica failed to produce certain documents in its possession relevant to the exceptions for commercial and tortious activity. They argue that the district court erred in entering judgment \"without affording [the Fagots] an opportunity to conclude jurisdictional discovery\" as to those exceptions, and without imposing sanctions on Costa Rica for its failure to comply with the Fagots' discovery requests. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(d) (authorizing sanctions for discovery misconduct). \"We review a district court's handling of pretrial matters, including discovery, for an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Cummings v. Standard Register Co.,</i> 265 F.3d 56, 68 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also Guex v. Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. &amp; Annuity Co.,</i> 146 F.3d 40, 41 (1st Cir.1998) (explaining that district court's decisions regarding sanctions under Rule 37 are subject to abuse of discretion review). Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the requested documents might have been important in establishing an implied contract or a non-discretionary tort, we find no abuse here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots do not seriously dispute that the district court gave them an adequate <i>opportunity</i> to conduct discovery. They argue instead that the court did not do enough to ensure that Costa Rica responded to their requests for documents. However, they have given us no basis to believe that any problem existed for the district court to remedy. Costa Rica insists that it turned over all the documents in its possession, and the Fagots have not suggested any reason why we should doubt that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the Fagots present a coherent claim of discovery abuse to the district court. As noted above, the court first entered summary judgment for Costa Rica and the Consulate in its 1996 decision in <i>Fagot Rodriguez I.</i> The Fagots moved for reconsideration and for additional discovery, and the court allowed them 60 days for discovery on the commercial and tortious activity exceptions. At that point, the Fagots submitted a request for documents, which they claim Costa Rica ignored. (Costa Rica responds that the request mirrored an earlier request for production, with which they already had complied fully.) Although the Fagots mentioned the matter at a hearing in 1997 &#8212; prior to the court's decision in <i>Fagot Rodriguez II</i> &#8212; they never lodged a formal objection regarding Costa Rica's alleged non-compliance, or moved to compel disclosure under Rule 37(a)(2). Instead, they forged ahead with their motion for summary judgment, relying on facts obtained through a request for admissions. Indeed, between the hearing in 1997 and the court's final decision in 2001, the Fagots did not mention the discovery issue. Given that history, we have no trouble concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to take some unspecified initiative directed at some unspecified discovery abuse by Costa Rica.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The lease agreement provided that, \"[i]f the LESSEES [do] not pay any monthly lease payment on the date the same is due, then the lease contract will be considered to be totally due and the LESSORS have the right to collect from the LESSEES the rent for the duration of the contract.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the record when, exactly, the Fagots learned that the Consulate was located on the property.

They point out that there is no evidence that the Fourniers complied with that provision. However, &#167; 4304(b) provides only that \"<i>[i]f</i> the Secretary determines that such action is reasonably necessary on the basis of reciprocity or otherwise ... <i>then</i> the Secretary <i>may</i> require a foreign mission ... to obtain benefits from or through the Secretary.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, if the Secretary of State has not exercised his authority under &#167; 4304 &#8212; and the Fagots do not argue that he has &#8212; then there is no basis for the claim that the Fourniers violated the FMA by failing to obtain the Secretary's consent before entering into the lease agreement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Specifically, the House Report stated that such suits \"seem to be permitted\" under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which exempts diplomatic or consular property from \"search, requisition, attachment or execution.\" House Report,<i>supra,</i> at *20 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The FSIA provides the exclusive basis for acquiring subject matter jurisdiction over foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1330, 1604. Under the statute, \"a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1604, unless the case falls within one of the exceptions to immunity set out in &#167; 1605. At issue here are the exceptions for actions arising out of a foreign state's commercial or tortious activity, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1605(a)(2) &amp; (5), or involving rights in immovable property, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1605(a)(4). The district court concluded that none of the exceptions applied. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are not disputed. Appellants, Gabriel Fagot Rodriguez and Angeles Diaz Rivera (\"the Fagots\"), own a house and surrounding property in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In September, 1991, the Fagots agreed to lease the property to Hilda Fournier and Angelo Greco Fournier (\"the Fourniers\") for two years, at a rate of $2,500 per month. Although the Fourniers were then the Consul and Vice-Consul of the Republic of Costa Rica, they signed the lease in their individual capacities. The lease agreement provided that the Fourniers were to use the property for residential purposes only and prohibited them from subleasing to third parties without the Fagots' prior written consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the restrictions in the lease agreement, the Fourniers began to operate the Costa Rican Consulate (\"the Consulate\") from the property. The Fagots were unaware of their actions, however, and the Fourniers remained on the property without conflict for most of the two-year lease term. The trouble began in June of 1993, when &#8212; following a dispute over an air conditioner &#8212; the Fourniers failed to pay the monthly rent. On June 16, 1993, the Fagots notified the Fourniers by letter that the lease was terminated effective immediately, and that the Fourniers had to vacate the premises by July 16, 1993. The Fagots also demanded that the Fourniers pay them $10,000 &#8212; the total rent due for the balance of the lease term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two months passed, and the Fourniers neither vacated the property, nor paid the requested amount. On August 19, 1993, the Fagots sent another letter informing the Fourniers that \"since a lease contract no longer exists that stipulates the rent to be paid for the use and enjoyment of the property, you will pay monthly, retroactively to July 16, 1993, the sum of $5,000.00, that is from the date you should have vacated the property.\" The letter specified that the new $5,000 rental charge was to be paid \"for the months of July, August and September 1993.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time after mailing the August demand letter, the Fagots learned that the Fourniers had been operating the Consulate from the property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On September 30, 1993 &#8212; the last day of the original lease term &#8212; they filed suit against the Fourniers, the Consulate, and the Republic of Costa Rica (\"Costa Rica\"), alleging breach of contract, personal injury, and damage to or loss of property. The complaint sought eviction as well as monetary damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties quickly filed a flurry of motions. The Fagots sought immediate eviction. Costa Rica and the Consulate rejoined with claims of sovereign immunity and inadequate service. In the meantime, the Fourniers and the Consulate remained on the property, still without paying rent. They finally vacated the property in October of 1994, 16 months after the Fagots terminated the lease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 1994, Costa Rica and the Consulate moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were immune from suit under the FSIA. The Fagots responded that the case fell into the exceptions to immunity for actions involving rights in immovable property, or arising out of commercial or tortious activity by a foreign state. The district court initially concluded that none of those exceptions applied and entered summary judgment for Costa Rica. <i>Fagot Rodriguez v. Republic of Costa Rica,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1956143\"><a href=\"/opinion/1956143/rodriguez-v-republic-of-costa-rica/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court granted their requests and vacated its judgment. Eventually, the Fagots filed their own motion for summary judgment on the question of jurisdiction under the FSIA. This time, the court determined that the case could proceed under the commercial activity and tortious activity exceptions. <i>Fagot Rodriguez v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1999) (<i>Fagot Rodriguez II</i>). After holding a hearing on the question of damages, it entered an order holding Costa Rica and the Consulate jointly liable with the Fourniers for non-payment of rent between August, 1993 and October, 1994. The court concluded that the Fourniers &#8212; but not Costa Rica and the Consulate &#8212; also were liable for rent due prior to August, 1993, and for property damage and mental distress. <i>Fagot Rodriguez v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></span> (D.P.R.1999) (<i>Fagot Rodriguez III</i>). The Fagots again moved for reconsideration, arguing that Costa Rica and the Consulate were jointly liable for all damages. Again, the district court agreed to reconsider its judgment. However, instead of holding Costa Rica and the Consulate liable for more damages, it reverted to its earlier view that none of the exceptions provided a basis for jurisdiction under the FSIA, and dismissed the claims against Costa Rica and the Consulate. <i>Fagot Rodriguez v.

As noted, the Fagots assert several bases for jurisdiction. First, they argue that Costa Rica<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> can be held liable for non-payment of rent under the commercial activity exception, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(2), based on an implied lease contract created by the August, 1993, demand letter. Second, they maintain that Costa Rica's use of the property amounted to a trespass, thus supporting jurisdiction under the tortious activity exception, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1605(a)(5). Finally, the Fagots argue that they can recover for nonpayment of rent (or, in the alternative, damages for trespass) under the exception for actions involving \"rights in immovable property,\" <i>id.,</i> &#167; 1605(a)(4). We address those claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Commercial Activity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 1605(a)(2), a foreign state is subject to jurisdiction in any case \"in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state.\" The term \"commercial activity\" encompasses both \"a regular course of commercial conduct\" and \"a particular commercial transaction or act.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1603(d).

The important question is whether Costa Rica in fact contracted with the Fagots for use of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the parties argued extensively over whether Costa Rica was bound by the original lease agreement between the Fourniers and the Fagots. The Fagots insisted that, although the Fourniers signed the lease in their individual capacities, Costa Rica could be held liable under agency principles. They do not press that claim on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Instead, the Fagots argue that the events in the summer of 1993 gave rise to an <i>implied</i> lease contract between themselves and Costa Rica.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots offer two versions of an implied contract theory. On the first theory, the August, 1993, demand letter &#8212; stating that, in the absence of a lease agreement, the Fourniers would be charged $5,000 for each month they remained on the property &#8212; constituted an offer for a month-to-month lease, at a rate of $5,000. By remaining on the property, the argument goes, Costa Rica accepted the offer and created a contract implied in fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots recognize that an implied-in-fact contract requires a \"mutual intent to contract.\" Nevertheless, they have not even attempted to show such mutual intent here. To begin with, the Fagots have not argued &#8212; much less established &#8212; that they intended to enter into a month-to-month lease agreement with Costa Rica. The August demand letter was addressed to the Fourniers, not Costa Rica. In the course of the proceedings before the district court, the Fagots explained that \"at that particular point in time (August, 1993), the Fagots were unaware that Costa Rica and the Consulate occupied the property.\" They argued that \"[s]uch lack of knowledge should not operate against them.\" That generalization is not helpful. On the issue of an implied-in-fact contract, the Fagots' lack of knowledge about the involvement of Costa Rica undermines their claim that the demand letter was an offer <i>to Costa Rica.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, whatever the Fagots' intent, there is no suggestion in the record that Costa Rica agreed to pay the Fagots $5,000 per month for its use of the property. Thus, even if we treat the Fagots' demand letter as an offer to Costa Rica, there is no evidence that Costa Rica accepted it. Given the absence of any evidence showing a mutual intent to contract, we conclude that Costa Rica did not enter into an implied-in-fact lease for the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots' second theory posits a contract implied in law, or \"quasi contract.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> They point out correctly that a quasi contract does not depend on the consent of the parties but is \"implied in law to prevent unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of another.\" However, the Fagots have made no effort to apply the general principles of quasi contract to the facts of this case. Their sole authority is <i>International General Electric v. Concrete Builders of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></span> (1976), in which the Puerto Rico Supreme Court found a contract implied in law where the plaintiff reasonably relied on the defendant's assurance that it would pay for certain services. The court noted that it was immaterial that the defendant did not <i>actually</i> intend to pay for the services; it was enough that \"the terms of [the defendant's correspondence] were worthy of the trust of the [plaintiff] which had no reason to doubt of the good faith of the representation it was given.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1228-29. Thus, the court concluded, because the defendant \"caused a legal situation upon which [plaintiff] relied, it cannot assume now a conduct contradictory to the one which gained [plaintiff's] trust.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1229 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding their reliance on <i>Concrete Builders,</i> the Fagots did not attempt to show before the district court that Costa Rica's conduct reasonably led them to believe that $5,000 in rent per month would be forthcoming, such that Costa Rica should be estopped from resisting such payment. <i>See id.</i> at 1231 (explaining that the defendant's behavior must \"be the basis of the trust of [the plaintiff who] has acted in good faith and ... in a manner which would cause him prejudice if his trust was defrauded\"). The Fagots' only interaction with Costa Rica was through its agents, the Fourniers, who refused to pay <i>any</i> rent after the dispute over the air conditioner in June of 1993, and who stubbornly ignored the Fagots' repeated requests that they vacate the property. Such actions would not reasonably inspire trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Fagots' own conduct in the summer of 1993 belies any suggestion of detrimental reliance. The Fagots instructed the Fourniers to vacate the property by July 16, 1993. When the Fourniers did not comply, the Fagots mailed them a letter demanding $5,000 for every month they remained on the property without a lease agreement. The Fagots then learned that the Fourniers had been operating the Consulate from the property. Roughly one month later, they filed suit against Costa Rica, the Consulate, and the Fourniers, alleging that the lease agreement was terminated in June of 1993, and that the defendants had since been in \"adverse possession.\" Their complaint sought, among other things, to evict the defendants from the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the Fagots' repeated attempts to terminate their relationship with Costa Rica and the Fourniers, they cannot now be heard to argue that they were lulled into inaction by Costa Rica's purported willingness to compensate them fully for its use of the property. Accordingly, we conclude that there was no implied-in-law contract between Costa Rica and the Fagots under the principles described in <i>Concrete Builders.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Tortious Activity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the tortious activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity. Section 1605(a)(5) removes sovereign immunity for actions in which</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">money damages are sought against a foreign state for ... damage to or loss of property, occurring in the United States and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That exception extends only to non-discretionary torts; it does not apply to \"any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Fagots seek damages for tortious trespass. They argue, first, that both Costa Rica and the Fourniers were trespassing at least from July of 1993 &#8212; the date by which they had been instructed to leave &#8212; until they vacated the property in October of 1994. Second, they maintain that Costa Rica was trespassing on the property from the beginning of the lease period in September, 1991. In support of that more expansive claim, the Fagots argue that the lease agreement prohibited the Fourniers from subletting the property or using it for non-residential purposes; that the Consulate is a separate legal entity from the Fourniers; and, therefore, that Costa Rica (through the Consulate) was trespassing on the property even when the Fourniers were not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, without deciding, that the Fagots have stated a claim for tortious trespass for the entire period of tenancy &#8212; that is, from September of 1991 until October of 1994. We further assume that the Fourniers were acting within the scope of their employment when they committed the alleged trespass. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(5). We need not dwell on such questions because we conclude that the Fagots' trespass claims are \"based upon the exercise or performance ... [of] a discretionary function,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A), and therefore are outside the scope of &#167; 1605(a)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The so-called \"discretionary function\" limitation set out in &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A) of the FSIA is modeled on a similar exception to jurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a). <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, at 21 (1976), <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.S.C.A.N. 6604, 6620 (hereafter \"House Report\"). The latter statute has received extensive judicial treatment, and decisions construing its discretionary function exception are useful in applying the parallel provision in the FSIA. The Supreme Court has crafted a two-part test for determining whether a challenged government action is protected as \"discretionary\" under the FTCA. The first question is whether the conduct in question \"is a matter of choice for the acting employee.\" <i>Berkovitz v.

However, they maintain that the particular choices the Fourniers made &#8212; namely, to install the Consulate on the property in violation of the terms of the lease agreement, and to remain on the property without paying rent after the lease was terminated &#8212; were impermissible ones. In other words, although the Fourniers' authority was essentially discretionary, they acted outside that authority when they set up the Consulate in violation of Puerto Rico landlord-tenant and trespass law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots' primary support for that argument is a 1948 treaty between the United States and Costa Rica, which provides that either country may establish consulates in the other, and may buy or lease land for that purpose \"in accordance with such conditions as may be prescribed by the laws of the receiving state.\" Consular Convention, Jan. 12, 1948, U.S.-Costa Rica, art. V, para. 1, 1 U.S.T. 247. The Fagots argue that \"it is axiomatic that the laws of Puerto Rico and the United States, as the receiving state, require the landowners' consent for the use of property.\" Under the treaty, therefore, the Fourniers had no discretion to use the property in a manner proscribed by the lease agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that it is unclear whether the phrase \"the laws of the receiving state\" is meant to refer to local Puerto Rican law as well as federal law. Moreover, it is unlikely that the drafters of the treaty intended that every violation of local or federal law would translate into a breach of the treaty itself. We need not resolve those questions, however, because even if we adopt the Fagots' reading of the treaty, it does not follow that the Fourniers' actions were non-discretionary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treaty or no treaty, the Fourniers were bound to comply with United States law, both local and federal. The treaty does not impose any special obligations on foreign officials; nor does it \"specifically prescribe[] a course of action\" for such officials to follow when setting up a Consulate in the United States. <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 536, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112093\"><a href=\"/opinion/112093/berkovitz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1954</span></a></span>. A general obligation to avoid unlawful activity &#8212; applicable to everyone in the United States &#8212; is hardly sufficient to remove all room for choice. <i>See Shansky v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198282\"><a href=\"/opinion/198282/shansky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, 691 (1st Cir.1999) (concluding that \"statements at [a high] level of generality do not satisfy ... <i>Berkovitz</i>'s specific prescription requirement\"). A more specific directive is required before we can conclude that the Fourniers' conduct was non-discretionary in the sense that it was not \"the product of judgment or choice.\" <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 536, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112093\"><a href=\"/opinion/112093/berkovitz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although they acknowledge that the Fourniers had discretionary authority in general, they maintain that the Fourniers had no discretion to violate Puerto Rican landlord-tenant or trespass law. The crux of their claim, therefore, is that the Fourniers' actions were non-discretionary <i>because</i> they were wrongful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That argument conflates an abuse of discretion with an absence of discretion. The discretionary function exception explicitly extends to abuses of discretionary authority. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A) (excepting claims based on the exercise of discretion \"regardless of whether the discretion be abused\"). \"The exercise of discretion could not be abused without negligence or a wrongful act.\" <i>Dalehite,</i> 346 U.S. at 33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105142\"><a href=\"/opinion/105142/dalehite-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span>. Accordingly, the fact that the Fourniers' actions may have been wrongful under Puerto Rican law governing landlord and tenant relationships cannot, by itself, render those actions non-discretionary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Fagots' interpretation reads the discretionary function exception out of the statute entirely. As explained above, the exception functions as a limitation on the general rule that a foreign sovereign is susceptible to suit for the tortious acts of its employees. The only cases in which the exception can <i>possibly</i> apply are those in which a foreign sovereign or one of its agents or employees is accused of a wrongful, tortious act. Thus, if a tortious act were, by definition, non-discretionary, the discretionary functions exception would be a dead letter. <i>See Fagot Rodriguez IV,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d at 190 n. 16 (noting that the Fagots' argument \"effectively means that Costa Rica, as a result of that innocuous clause [in the treaty], may never enjoy sovereign immunity in any claim dealing with embassy property and real estate since any claim for money damages under the FSIA would obviously be founded on a violation of the law\"). We reject such a reading of the statute, and conclude that the Fourniers' conduct was \"discretionary\" in the sense that it involved an element of judgment or choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, therefore, to the second prong of the test, and ask whether the Fourniers' choices were the type that the discretionary function exception was designed to protect. As we have explained in the context of the FTCA, the critical question here is \"whether the acts or omissions that form the basis of the suit are susceptible to a policy-driven analysis\" or, put differently, \"whether some plausible policy justification could have undergirded the challenged conduct.\" <i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 692; <i>accord United States v. Gaubert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Fourniers' decisions regarding the Consulate satisfy that standard. The initial choices as to whether, where, and how to set up the Consulate clearly implicated policy issues. <i>See MacArthur Area Citizens Ass'n v. Rep. of Peru,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481980\"><a href=\"/opinion/481980/macarthur-area-citizens-association-v-republic-of-peru/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span>, 922 (D.C.Cir.1987) (\"It is beyond serious question that establishing a chancery in the District of Columbia to conduct foreign relations is a discretionary public policy decision and that this decision undergirds the specific acts which the Association bewails.\"); <i>cf. Joseph,</i> 830 F.2d at 1020 n. 1, 1027 (concluding that \"the <i>acquisition and operation</i> of [a consular residence] was a discretionary policy decision,\" but finding that tenants' \"purely destructive acts\" &#8212; including extensive damage to the property and the removal of fully grown trees, appliances, furniture, light fixtures, shutters and drapes &#8212; \"can hardly be considered part of [that] policy decision\"). The same is true of the Fourniers' actions in the summer of 1993, when they were confronted with early termination of the lease agreement and the Fagots' demand for $5,000 monthly rent. As the district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]n evaluation of the range of alternatives available to the [Fourniers] at the time of the June termination notice reveals that there were countervailing political and economic costs and benefits attendant to each course of action. Perhaps Costa Rica and the consuls could have moved the Consulate to a different building, increased their diplomatic relations budget, temporarily shut down the Consulate or scrapped it altogether. However, the Court cannot sit in de novo review and select a lawful alternative that would have been superior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Fagot Rodriguez IV,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d at 190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree, and hold that the Fagots' trespass claims are \"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(5)(A). As such, they are excluded from the exception to immunity for tortious activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Immovable Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots contend that their claims fall within the exception to sovereign immunity for \"any case in which ... rights in immovable property situated in the United States are at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1605(a)(4). The district court disagreed, reasoning that the immovable property exception extends only to actions involving rights to \"actual possession or title.\" <i>Fagot Rodriguez IV,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d at 195. Neither of those rights is at issue here: none of the defendants has used or possessed the Fagots' property since October of 1994, and they never challenged the Fagots' title. Thus, the only right at stake is the Fagots' right to compensation for non-payment of rent or for trespass. Like the district court, we conclude that purely compensatory rights, without more, are insufficient to sustain jurisdiction under the immovable property exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history to the FSIA indicates that the immovable property exception was intended to codify existing international practice. <i>See</i> House Report, <i>supra,</i> at *20. Under that practice, a foreign sovereign generally was not immune from \"an action to obtain possession of or establish a property interest in immovable property located in the territory of the state exercising jurisdiction.\" <i>Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States</i> &#167; 68(b) (1965), <i>quoted in Asociacion de Reclamantes v. United Mexican States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437083\"><a href=\"/opinion/437083/asociacion-de-reclamantes-v-the-united-mexican-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1517</span></a></span>, 1521 (D.C.Cir.1984). However, the exception to immunity for claims involving immovable property did not extend to cases, such as slip-and-fall suits seeking damages for injury suffered on a foreign state's property, in which the state's title or rights of use and possession were not contested. <i>See Restatement, supra,</i> &#167; 68(b) cmt. d.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The traditional real property exception was founded on the view that \"[a] territorial sovereign has a primeval interest in resolving all disputes over use or right to use of real property within its own domain.\" <i>Asociacion de Reclamantes,</i> 735 F.2d at 1521. Such disputes not only implicate core sovereignty interests; they also raise questions of institutional competence. Put simply, foreign courts typically are \"not well equipped to decide property interests or rights to possession with regard to land outside their jurisdiction, particularly land located in a foreign nation.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, it is important for property disputes to be adjudicated by local courts, notwithstanding foreign sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those concerns suggest that the immovable property exception \"was not intended broadly to abrogate immunity for any action touching upon real estate.\" <i>MacArthur Area Citizens Ass'n,</i> 809 F.2d at 921. Rather, like the traditional exception it was intended to codify, its purpose is to permit jurisdiction in cases where the United States' interests in adjudicating the dispute are particularly strong. It is difficult to understand how a simple contract dispute over nonpayment of rent &#8212; without more &#8212; falls within that category. The Fagots do not cite, nor can we find, any case so holding. To the contrary, courts have construed the immovable property exception to apply only in cases that implicate rights of ownership, use, or possession. <i>See, e.g., City of Englewood v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458612\"><a href=\"/opinion/458612/city-of-englewood-v-socialist-peoples-libyan-arab-jamahiriya/\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 36 (3d Cir.1985) (describing immovable property exception as a \"title dispute exception\" codifying \"the recognized principle of international law that a sovereign may resolve disputes over title to real estate within its geographic limits\"); <i>cf. Logan v. Dupuis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405610\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405610/logan-v-dupuis/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

They emphasize certain language in the House Report suggesting that the pre-existing real property exception to sovereign immunity extended to suits involving \"questions of ownership, <i>rent,</i> servitudes, and similar matters.\" House Report, <i>supra,</i> at *20 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We do not believe that one passing reference to \"rent\" in the legislative history is sufficient to show that Congress intended the immovable property exception to apply broadly to garden-variety contract disputes in which title or possession is not in dispute. As the court explained in <i>Asociacion de Reclamantes,</i> 735 F.2d at 1522 n. 5, \"actions for rent frequently involve issues of title and possession.\" Thus, the reference to \"rent\" in the House Report \"does not establish any departure from the traditional principle that the real estate exception to sovereign immunity is bounded by concern for those issues.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots also rely on the <i>Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations</i> &#167; 455, cmt. b, which states that the immovable property exception includes \"controversies concerning payment of rent, taxes, and other fees concerning [consular premises].\" Like the legislative history, however, the <i>Restatement</i> is silent on the question whether such controversies are cognizable when they involve <i>only</i> the payment of rent or other debts. Comment b to &#167; 455 states in full:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title to land and to buildings on land traditionally is subject to adjudication by the courts of the state where the land is situated. The fact that the land (or buildings, apartments, or appurtenances) in controversy is owned or leased by a foreign state does not detract from the desirability of adjudicating controversies in local courts. Premises used for an embassy, consulate, or diplomatic mission come under this rule, so that controversies relating to rights of ownership, possession, occupation, or use, as well as controversies concerning payment of rent, taxes, and other fees concerning such premises are subject to adjudication in local courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"as well as\" certainly <i>could</i> mean that \"controversies concerning the payment of rent\" can, by themselves, support jurisdiction under the immovable property exception. However, it also could mean that a plaintiff can recover \"rent, taxes, and other fees\" in the process of adjudicating \"rights of ownership, possession, occupation or use.\" The latter reading finds support in the first sentence of the comment, which emphasizes the traditional importance of settling questions about \"title\" to real property. Although actions for rent sometimes involve such questions, a simple controversy over the breach of a rental contract &#8212; unaccompanied by issues of ownership, possession, or use &#8212; usually will not implicate the special concerns regarding real property located on United States territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the immovable property exception applies only in cases in which rights of ownership, use, or possession are at issue. As noted, those rights are not implicated here: the defendants voluntarily vacated the property in October of 1994, and they never questioned the Fagots' ownership. The only remaining dispute concerns Costa Rica's liability for non-payment of rent. The peculiar circumstances of this case should not obscure the fact that such a dispute is, first and foremost, a contract dispute. Thus, plaintiffs seeking to recover unpaid rent usually will be able to proceed under the commercial activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That approach may fail where &#8212; as here &#8212; the foreign sovereign did not in fact agree to pay the rent demanded. However, the possibility that jurisdiction will be lacking in some cases should not lead us to adopt an unduly broad reading of the immovable property exception. The very purpose of the FSIA is to restrict the class of cases in which United States courts can adjudicate claims against foreign sovereigns. As we have seen, each of the exceptions to the FSIA has its own specific requirements designed to identify cases in which immunity is or is not appropriate. Plaintiffs should not be allowed to circumvent those requirements simply because their claims are somehow related to real property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final matter requires our attention. The Fagots claim that Costa Rica failed to produce certain documents in its possession relevant to the exceptions for commercial and tortious activity. They argue that the district court erred in entering judgment \"without affording [the Fagots] an opportunity to conclude jurisdictional discovery\" as to those exceptions, and without imposing sanctions on Costa Rica for its failure to comply with the Fagots' discovery requests. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(d) (authorizing sanctions for discovery misconduct). \"We review a district court's handling of pretrial matters, including discovery, for an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Cummings v. Standard Register Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199597\"><a href=\"/opinion/199597/cummings-v-standard-register/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also Guex v. Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. &amp; Annuity Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755142\"><a href=\"/opinion/755142/christian-guex-v-allmerica-financial-life-insurance-and-annuity-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.1998) (explaining that district court's decisions regarding sanctions under Rule 37 are subject to abuse of discretion review). Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the requested documents might have been important in establishing an implied contract or a non-discretionary tort, we find no abuse here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fagots do not seriously dispute that the district court gave them an adequate <i>opportunity</i> to conduct discovery. They argue instead that the court did not do enough to ensure that Costa Rica responded to their requests for documents. However, they have given us no basis to believe that any problem existed for the district court to remedy. Costa Rica insists that it turned over all the documents in its possession, and the Fagots have not suggested any reason why we should doubt that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the Fagots present a coherent claim of discovery abuse to the district court. As noted above, the court first entered summary judgment for Costa Rica and the Consulate in its 1996 decision in <i>Fagot Rodriguez I.</i> The Fagots moved for reconsideration and for additional discovery, and the court allowed them 60 days for discovery on the commercial and tortious activity exceptions. At that point, the Fagots submitted a request for documents, which they claim Costa Rica ignored. (Costa Rica responds that the request mirrored an earlier request for production, with which they already had complied fully.) Although the Fagots mentioned the matter at a hearing in 1997 &#8212; prior to the court's decision in <i>Fagot Rodriguez II</i> &#8212; they never lodged a formal objection regarding Costa Rica's alleged non-compliance, or moved to compel disclosure under Rule 37(a)(2). Instead, they forged ahead with their motion for summary judgment, relying on facts obtained through a request for admissions. Indeed, between the hearing in 1997 and the court's final decision in 2001, the Fagots did not mention the discovery issue. Given that history, we have no trouble concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to take some unspecified initiative directed at some unspecified discovery abuse by Costa Rica.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The lease agreement provided that, \"[i]f the LESSEES [do] not pay any monthly lease payment on the date the same is due, then the lease contract will be considered to be totally due and the LESSORS have the right to collect from the LESSEES the rent for the duration of the contract.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the record when, exactly, the Fagots learned that the Consulate was located on the property. However, in a memorandum supporting their motion for summary judgment, the Fagots represented that the August letter \"was specifically addressed to the Fourniers\" because \"at that particular point in time (August 1993), the Fagots were unaware that Costa Rica and the Consulate occupied the Property.\" Accordingly, we view it as settled that the Fagots were unaware of the Consulate's presence when they mailed the August demand letter</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> At the same time, the court entered a default judgment against the Fourniers. That judgment has not been appealed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For ease of reference, we omit any further mention of the Consulate in its role as defendant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Puerto Rico's Civil Code states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">When an agent acts in his own name the principal shall have no action against the person with whom the agent has contracted, nor the said persons against the principal. In such case, the agent is directly liable to the person with whom he has contracted, as if the transaction were his own.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Laws of P.R. Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 4429. Relying on that provision, the district court held that Costa Rica was not liable for the Fourniers' breach of the original lease agreement, since they signed that contract \"in [their] own name[s],\" <i>id.,</i> rather than as agents of Costa Rica. <i>See Fagot Rodriguez IV,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d at 186.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Fagots' claim of an implied-in-law contract was poorly developed both before the district court and on appeal. Not surprisingly, therefore, the district court did not mention that claim in any of its four published opinions in this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Fagots also argue that, under the Foreign Missions Act (\"FMA\"), 22 U.S.C. &#167; 4304(b), Costa Rica was obligated to acquire any \"benefits\" in the United States &#8212; including \"the acquisition of real property by purchase [or] lease\" &#8212; only through the Secretary of State. They point out that there is no evidence that the Fourniers complied with that provision. However, &#167; 4304(b) provides only that \"<i>[i]f</i> the Secretary determines that such action is reasonably necessary on the basis of reciprocity or otherwise ... <i>then</i> the Secretary <i>may</i> require a foreign mission ... to obtain benefits from or through the Secretary.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, if the Secretary of State has not exercised his authority under &#167; 4304 &#8212; and the Fagots do not argue that he has &#8212; then there is no basis for the claim that the Fourniers violated the FMA by failing to obtain the Secretary's consent before entering into the lease agreement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Specifically, the House Report stated that such suits \"seem to be permitted\" under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which exempts diplomatic or consular property from \"search, requisition, attachment or execution.\" House Report,<i>supra,</i> at *20 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
