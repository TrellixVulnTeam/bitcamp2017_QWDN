Tauro,           U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n          Coffin and Porfilio,* Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Francis J. DiMento, with whom DiMento & Sullivan and Jason A.\nKosow were on brief, for appellant.\n     Samuel W. Buell, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                               May 14, 2003\n\n\n\n\n____________\n*Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f                Per Curiam. At sentencing in this case, the defendant\n\nsought      a    downward   departure    on    a    number    of   stated      grounds.\n\nAlthough these included several familiar departure categories, the\n\ndistrict court said that \"as a matter of law [it] ha[d] no power to\n\ngrant [the] request for downward departure.\"                       In context, this\n\nstatement partakes of the same inherent ambiguity as the comparable\n\nstatement made by the same judge in United States v. Rodriguez, No.\n\n02-1861 (1st Cir. Apr. 30, 2003).                   For all practical purposes,\n\nthen, the disposition of this appeal is controlled by our opinion\n\nin Rodriguez.         We therefore vacate the defendant's sentence and\n\nremand to the district court for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith Rodriguez.\n\n                On   remand,    the   district      court    may   either      essay   a\n\ndeparture, making factual findings sufficient to justify such a\n\nstep, or decline to depart and say, as to each of the proffered\n\ngrounds for departure, whether its decision rests on a categorical\n\nrejection of the reason offered (because the court deems it legally\n\nunavailable) or whether, accepting or at least not categorically\n\nrejecting the ground, it thinks that \"degree,\" lack of persuasive\n\nproof, or other considerations do not justify a departure.                           The\n\ndistrict court should then resentence the defendant and, if either\n\nside   is       dissatisfied,    that   side       can   appeal    so   long    as   the\n\nsentencing determination entails an appealable issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f          We need go no further.   We take no view, at this time, as\n\nto whether the facts proffered by the defendant would, if proven,\n\njustify the district court in departing downward.     That judgment\n\ncannot be made in a vacuum, but, rather, requires particularized\n\nfactual findings.\n\n\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
