Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     R. Mark Petersen with whom Michelle M. Hansen was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Michael L. Snyder with whom McGovern & Ganem, P.C. was on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n                           December 1, 2004\n\f          CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.              Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\nDarlene M. McCord, brought an action in the district court against\n\nDefendant-Appellee, Horace Mann Insurance Company (\"Horace Mann\"),\n\nfor breach of its insurance policy insuring her home (the \"Policy\")\n\nand for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.              Horace Mann moved\n\nfor judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) on\n\nthe grounds that McCord failed to comply with a condition precedent\n\nin the Policy, inserted under Massachusetts law, that required the\n\namount of loss to be submitted to a panel of referees prior to the\n\nbringing of an action to recover for the loss.          See Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 175, § 99.       The district court entered judgment in Horace\n\nMann's favor   and    dismissed   the     case   without    prejudice.    The\n\ndistrict court subsequently denied McCord's motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).              We affirm.\n\n                            I.    Background\n\n          On   February    5,     2002,     McCord’s       home   in   Holden,\n\nMassachusetts was destroyed by a fire.           McCord sought to recover\n\ninsurance under the Policy issued by Horace Mann.            McCord’s public\n\nadjuster, Sadick Public Insurance Adjusters (\"Sadick\"), submitted\n\na statement to Horace Mann, estimating that the damages caused by\n\nthe fire were $162,553.22.      On November 15, 2002, Horace Mann sent\n\na letter to McCord, formally denying all coverage or liability\n\nunder the Policy, on the grounds that she, or persons acting at her\n\ndirection, intentionally set the fire at her home.                 The letter\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fquoted excerpts from the Policy, including the requirement that \"a\n\ndisagreement as to the dollar amount of loss\" be \"referred to a\n\nthree member board of referees\" in accordance with Massachusetts\n\nlaw. The letter also referred to a provision of the Policy stating\n\nthat \"no suit may be brought against [Horace Mann] unless all the\n\nterms of [the Policy] have been complied with.\" The letter further\n\nstated:\n\n          Horace Mann specifically reserves all of its\n          rights and defenses with regard to the\n          resolution of amount of loss. . . . Horace\n          Mann    specifically     rejects    [Sadick's]\n          calculation as being an accurate determination\n          of the amount of loss.     Accordingly, Horace\n          Mann specifically reserves all of its rights\n          and defenses with regard to resolution of any\n          dispute about the amount of loss as a result\n          of the subject fire.\n\nOn December 4, 2002, counsel for McCord sent Horace Mann a demand\n\nletter in accordance with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.         Horace Mann's\n\nresponse, dated December 19, 2002, denied liability and stated:\n\n          Notwithstanding   Horace   Mann's   denial  of\n          coverage to [McCord], Horace Mann specifically\n          reserves all of its rights under the [Policy]\n          and M.G.L. c. 175, § 99 with regard to\n          resolution of any dispute about the amount of\n          loss caused by the subject fire. Horace Mann\n          specifically rejects [McCord's] assertion that\n          she sustained $66,205.86 in personal property\n          damage and $162,553.22 in property damage as a\n          result of the subject fire.\n\n          McCord brought an action against Horace Mann in the\n\nMassachusetts   state   court,   seeking   damages   for   Horace   Mann’s\n\nrefusal to pay her claim under the Policy.       On February 7, 2003,\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fHorace Mann, a resident of the State of Illinois, removed the case\n\nto federal court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1446, alleging diversity\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).   In its answer to McCord's\n\ncomplaint, Horace Mann raised McCord's \"fail[ure] to comply with\n\nthe condition precedent of reference pursuant to M.G.L. c. 175,\n\n§99\" as one of its affirmative defenses.       In its counterclaim\n\nagainst McCord for breach of contract and deceit, Horace Mann also\n\nstated that \"McCord and Horace Mann have never reached an agreement\n\nas to the amount of loss caused by the subject fire.\"        McCord\n\nadmitted this statement in her answer to the counterclaim.\n\n          On June 11, 2003, Horace Mann moved for judgment on the\n\npleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).   It asserted that the\n\nparties had failed to agree on the amount of loss caused by the\n\nfire, and that McCord's failure to submit her claim to a reference\n\nproceeding, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99, barred her\n\nsuit.   McCord argued in opposition that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175,\n\n§ 99 was inapplicable, because 1) the case was about a complete\n\ndenial of coverage rather than any disagreement over the amount of\n\nloss and 2) Horace Mann had waived its rights to a reference\n\nproceeding.   In the alternative, McCord requested a stay of the\n\ncase pending the outcome of a reference proceeding.\n\n          On March 16, 2004, the district court dismissed the case\n\nwithout prejudice, citing McCord's failure to have submitted her\n\nclaim to a reference proceeding prior to commencement of the\n\n\n                               -4-\n\faction.     The district court declined to issue a stay, because\n\nMcCord had not initiated reference proceedings before bringing\n\nsuit.    The court noted it had granted a stay in another case where\n\na reference proceeding had been begun but was not completed by the\n\ntime the action was filed.         See M.A.S. Realty Corp. v. Travelers\n\nCas. & Sur. Co. of Ill., 196 F. Supp. 2d 41, 47 (D. Mass. 2002).\n\nIt was not until after the dismissal of her case that McCord\n\nrequested a reference proceeding with Horace Mann. We were advised\n\nby    counsel   at   oral   argument   that   Horace   Mann   refused     to\n\nparticipate, citing as a reason the expiration of the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99.\n\nOn March 29, 2004, McCord filed a motion to alter or amend judgment\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), which the district court denied.           This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                             II.    Discussion\n\n            We review de novo both a district court's entry of\n\njudgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) and the\n\ncourt's allowance of summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56.     Rafferty v. Cranston Pub. Sch. Comm., 315 F.3d 21, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     However, the standard governing the allowance of a\n\nRule 12(c) motion is generally more generous to the nonmovant.\n\n\"Judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) may not be entered\n\nunless it appears beyond a doubt that the nonmoving party can prove\n\nno set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\frelief.\"    Feliciano v. State of R.I., 160 F.3d 780, 788 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (citations omitted).\n\n            On occasion -- and this is such a case -- the parties'\n\nactions during the proceeding will result in converting what begins\n\nas a motion under Rule 12(c) to one for summary judgment under Rule\n\n56.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) (\"If, on a motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and\n\nnot excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for\n\nsummary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 . . . .\");\n\nGulf Coast Bank & Trust Co. v. Reder, 355 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).     When this happens, the governing standard becomes that\n\napplicable to summary judgment.         See id.\n\n            Here,   Horace   Mann's    Rule   12(c)   motion   relied   upon\n\nevidentiary submissions outside the pleadings, and McCord filed an\n\nopposition that appended additional, outside evidentiary materials.\n\nThere is no indication the district court excluded these materials\n\nfrom its consideration.      The motion accordingly converted to one\n\nfor summary judgment.    While a conversion cannot take place unless\n\nthe nonmoving party \"is given adequate notice of the conversion and\n\na 'reasonable opportunity to present material made pertinent to\n\nsuch a motion by Rule 56,'\" McCord had constructive notice of the\n\npotential conversion and, as noted, responded by attaching outside\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fmaterials to its opposition. Collier v. City of Chicopee, 158 F.3d\n\n601, 603 (1st Cir. 1998).1\n\n          Under Rule 56, the nonmovant has a heavier burden than\n\nwould be posed by Rule 12(c).   Once the moving party has served a\n\nsupported motion asserting entitlement to summary judgment, the\n\nparty opposing the motion must demonstrate, by competent evidence,\n\na genuine issue of a material fact.   Gulf Coast Bank, 355 F.3d at\n\n39; see Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.\n\n1990). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we construe the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolve all\n\nreasonable inferences in her favor.   Rosenberg v. City of Everett,\n\n328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          There are two issues on appeal:      1) whether McCord's\n\nfailure to submit her claim to a reference proceeding bars her\n\nlawsuit pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99, and 2) whether\n\nHorace Mann waived the reference condition precedent.2\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In opposition to Horace Mann's motion for judgment on the\npleadings, McCord stated that the motion was a motion for summary\njudgment. On appeal, neither party raises the issue of the nature\nof the motion, although they refer to it as one for judgment on the\npleadings.\n     2\n      McCord has not briefed her Chapter 93A claim separately from\nher contract claim, applying to both the general arguments\ndiscussed herein. Accordingly, any separate arguments that might\nbe made with respect to the 93A claim alone, if such there be, are\nwaived for purposes of this appeal. See Frazier v. Bailey, 957\nF.2d 920, 932, n.14 (1st Cir. 1992) (ruling that state law claims\nnot fully addressed in an appellate brief are waived).\n\n                                -7-\n\fA.   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99\n\n           Both parties rely upon Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99 and\n\nMassachusetts state case law.    In so doing, they implicitly agree\n\nthat Massachusetts law governs.3     The Policy itself appears to be\n\ndrafted in accordance with the standard form for Massachusetts fire\n\ninsurance policies as required and set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n175, § 99.    Section 99 states in pertinent part:\n\n           In case of loss under this policy and a\n           failure of the parties to agree as to the\n           amount of loss, it is mutually agreed that the\n           amount of such loss shall be referred to three\n           disinterested men . . . and such reference,\n           unless waived by the parties, shall be a\n           condition precedent to any right of action in\n           law or equity to recover for such loss . . . .\n\nMcCord argues that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99 is not applicable,\n\nbecause there was no dispute as to the amount of loss but only a\n\ntotal denial of coverage by Horace Mann.       According to McCord,\n\nHorace Mann did not state any amount of loss or provide specific\n\ncriticism of her public adjuster's statement.\n\n             But Section 99 is explicit that \"[i]n case of . . . a\n\nfailure of the parties to agree as to the amount of loss,\"\n\nreference, unless waived, shall be a \"condition precedent\" to any\n\n\n\n     3\n      The choice of law analysis of the forum state, Massachusetts,\nalso warrants this result. Massachusetts state courts follow \"a\nfunctional choice of law approach that responds to the interests of\nthe parties, the States involved, and the interstate system as a\nwhole.\" Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 473 N.E.2d 662, 668\n(Mass. 1985). Massachusetts has a strong interest in regulating\ninsurance policies covering homes in Massachusetts.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fright of action to recover for such loss. The Massachusetts courts\n\nhave enforced that requirement.         See, e.g., Employers' Liab.\n\nAssurance Corp. v. Traynor, 237 N.E.2d 34, 34-35 (Mass. 1968);\n\nMolea v. Aetna Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn., 95 N.E.2d 749, 752\n\n(Mass. 1950); Bergeron v. Mechanics’ & Traders’ Ins. Co., 115 N.E.\n\n318, 319 (Mass. 1917).\n\n             Even though an insurer denies liability, the reference\n\ncondition must be observed absent agreement as to the loss amount.\n\nIn Employers' Liability Assurance Corp. v. Traynor, an insurer\n\nsought declaratory relief to determine whether it was liable for\n\nthe loss by theft of the defendants' property covered in an\n\ninsurance policy.     237 N.E.2d at 34.    The Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (\"SJC\") held that the trial court had properly\n\ndismissed the bill as the insurer was initially required to refer\n\nthe issue of the value of the items stolen to referees pursuant to\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99 and the provisions of the policy.\n\nId. at 35.    The SJC stated:   \"Questions of ultimate liability are\n\ndeterminable following action on the reference, pending which the\n\ninsurer's rights relative thereto are protected.\"     Id.   See also\n\nF.C.I. Realty Trust v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 906 F. Supp. 30, 33-\n\n34 (D. Mass. 1995) (granting summary judgment to insurer, which\n\ndenied coverage except as to certain costs, because the insured\n\nfailed to comply with the reference condition precedent).    Parties\n\nare free to litigate questions of liability after resolving any\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fdispute about the amount of loss in a reference proceeding.    See\n\nF.C.I. Realty Trust, 906 F. Supp. at 33 (\"If the referees reach\n\nquestions of ultimate liability, those issues can be relitigated;\n\nbut that eventuality does not excuse the contractual requirement\n\nthat there be a reference before there be a law suit.\"); Fox v.\n\nEmployers' Fire Ins. Co., 113 N.E.2d 63, 66 (Mass. 1953) (\"[The\n\nreferees'] views so far as ultimate liability goes are wholly\n\ntentative and in no sense a decision on that underlying question.\")\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n          Drawing all reasonable inferences in McCord's favor,\n\nthere is no question that she failed to request a reference\n\nproceeding prior to bringing suit.4   Therefore, absent waiver, the\n\nreference condition precedent, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175,\n\n§ 99 and the provisions of the Policy, barred McCord from bringing\n\nsuit.5\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      It was not until after the district court dismissed the case\nthat McCord requested a reference proceeding.\n     5\n      McCord also argues that the district court should not have\ndismissed her complaint, because a request for a reference\nproceeding would have been futile. McCord speculates that Horace\nMann would not have agreed to a reference request on the ground\nthat Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99 was not applicable, given its\ndenial of coverage. The law does not provide that such speculation\ncan permit a party to disregard the reference condition precedent\nprior to filing suit.    Cf. Molea, 95 N.E.2d at 751 (rejecting\ninsured's argument that reference would have been \"a useless waste\nof time and money\").\n\n                               -10-\n\fB.   Waiver\n\n           Even if a reference were a condition precedent, McCord\n\npoints out that the condition precedent can be waived.                       McCord\n\ncontends that Horace Mann waived its right to a reference by\n\ncompletely denying any liability under the Policy.               Because waiver\n\nis a question of fact, McCord further argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying her right to a trial by jury on this issue.\n\nThe burden of proving waiver rests upon McCord who seeks to rely\n\nupon it.      Molea, 95 N.E.2d at 752.\n\n           In urging waiver, McCord points to the case of Lancaster\n\nv.   General     Accident   Insurance      Co.    of       America,    where    the\n\nMassachusetts     Appeals   Court   held     that      a    question    of     fact,\n\nprecluding summary judgment, existed as to whether the insurer\n\nwaived a reference condition precedent. 587 N.E.2d 246, 247 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1992).       In that case, the insurer sent the insured a\n\nletter denying any coverage on the claim, but the letter made no\n\nmention of any     reference requirement.        Id. at 246.     The court held\n\nthat the insurer's denial of liability coupled with its failure to\n\nmention in its letter the reference condition \"could, in these\n\ncircumstances, be found to be a waiver.\"               Id. at 247.       In other\n\ncases finding waiver, there was an absence of evidence that the\n\ninsurer disputed the amount of loss.         See, e.g., Goodman v. Quaker\n\nCity Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 241 F.2d 432, 436 (1st Cir. 1957)\n\n(holding that an insurer's letter denying any liability constituted\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fa waiver of any right to require arbitration); Moran v. Phoenix\n\nIns. Co., 390 N.E.2d 1139, 1140 (Mass. App. Ct. 1979) (error to\n\nallow summary judgment where the sole basis of the insurer's\n\nrefusal to pay was a denial of liability and there was no evidence\n\nthat insurer disputed the amount of loss).\n\n              Besides    denying     liability,         Horace   Mann   disputed    the\n\namount   of    the   loss      and   repeatedly         called   attention     in   its\n\ncorrespondence with McCord to the existence of the reference\n\ncondition.       Horace Mann's November 25, 2002 letter to McCord\n\nreferred to and quoted the provision of the Policy that sets forth\n\nthe reference condition precedent.                    In that same letter, Horace\n\nMann specifically rejected the amount of loss submitted by McCord's\n\npublic   adjuster       and    reserved    its        rights   with   regard   to   the\n\nresolution of the amount of loss.                       Horace Mann repeated its\n\nrejection of the amount of loss submitted by McCord in its response\n\nto her demand under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.                            Horace Mann's\n\nreliance on the reference condition as an affirmative defense and\n\nits allegation in its counterclaims, admitted by McCord, that they\n\nhad   never    reached    an    agreement        on    the   amount   of   loss,    also\n\nindicates a dispute about the amount of loss.                     See F.C.I. Realty\n\nTrust, 906 F. Supp. at 33-34 (finding no waiver where the insurer\n\nraised the reference issue as an affirmative defense in its answer\n\nand repeatedly refused to waive its rights under the policy).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f            McCord argues, based on a footnote in Lancaster, that a\n\nmere failure to agree as to the amount of loss does not mean that\n\nthere was ever a disagreement as to the amount.         See Lancaster, 587\n\nN.E.2d at 247 n.3.        But here, unlike in Lancaster, Horace Mann\n\nexpressly rejected McCord's public adjuster's figure as to the\n\namount of loss.        Horace Mann, moreover, in correspondence with\n\nMcCord,    mentioned    the   reference    condition   several   times,   and\n\nspecifically reserved its rights as to a dispute about the amount\n\nof loss.     Considering the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nMcCord, she has failed to demonstrate, by competent evidence, the\n\nexistence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to\n\nwaiver.\n\nC.   Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment\n\n            McCord's motion to alter or amend judgment, filed after\n\ndismissal of her Rule 12(c) motion, did little more than reargue\n\nthe above-described grounds pursued in the Rule 12(c) motion.              No\n\nmaterially new grounds were raised.          We review a district court's\n\ndenial of a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) for manifest abuse\n\nof discretion.     Vasapolli v. Rostoff, 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).    Once a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment\n\nhas been allowed, we will overturn the district court's refusal to\n\nreopen the proceedings \"only if an appellant can persuade us that\n\nthe refusal to grant favorable reconsideration was a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\"     Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f1997) (quoting Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273, 1279 (1st\n\nCir. 1992)).\n\n            As noted, McCord made no arguments in her Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion above and beyond those already raised under her Rule 12(c)\n\nmotion.     As   already    discussed,    the   district   court   properly\n\ndetermined that McCord's action was barred by Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n175, § 99, suit having been commenced without observance of the\n\nreference   condition      precedent.     The   district   court   did   not\n\nmanifestly abuse its discretion in refusing to alter or amend its\n\njudgment for these same earlier-considered reasons.\n\n            Whether McCord might still be entitled, even now, to\n\ninsist upon a reference proceeding and, upon compliance with that\n\ncondition, to sue within the one additional year provided in Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 175, § 99 (see also Policy language set forth in\n\nParagraph 10 of the \"Massachusetts amendatory endorsement\") is a\n\nquestion nowhere raised, hence one we do not consider and upon\n\nwhich we express no opinion.

McCord, brought an action in the district court against Defendant-Appellee, Horace Mann Insurance Company (\"Horace Mann\"), for breach of its insurance policy insuring her home (the \"Policy\") and for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Horace Mann moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) on the grounds that McCord failed to comply with a condition precedent in the Policy, inserted under Massachusetts law, that required the amount of loss to be submitted to a panel of referees prior to the bringing of an action to recover for the loss. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99. The district court entered judgment in Horace Mann's favor and dismissed the case without prejudice. The district court subsequently denied McCord's motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 5, 2002, McCord's home in Holden, Massachusetts was destroyed by a fire. McCord sought to recover insurance under the Policy issued by Horace Mann. McCord's public adjuster, Sadick Public Insurance Adjusters (\"Sadick\"), submitted a statement to Horace Mann, estimating that the damages caused by the fire were $162,553.22. On November 15, 2002, Horace Mann sent a letter to McCord, formally denying all coverage or liability under the Policy, on the grounds that she, or persons acting at her direction, intentionally set the fire at her home. The letter quoted excerpts from the Policy, including the requirement that \"a disagreement as to the dollar amount of loss\" be \"referred to a three member board of referees\" in accordance with Massachusetts law. The letter also referred to a provision of the Policy stating that \"no suit may be brought against [Horace Mann] unless all the terms of [the Policy] have been complied with.\" The letter further stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horace Mann specifically reserves all of its rights and defenses with regard to the resolution of amount of loss.... Horace Mann specifically rejects [Sadick's] calculation as being an accurate determination of the amount of loss. Accordingly, Horace Mann specifically reserves all of its rights and defenses with regard to resolution of any dispute about the amount of loss as a result of the subject fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2002, counsel for McCord sent Horace Mann a demand letter in accordance with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Horace Mann's response, dated December 19, 2002, denied liability and stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding Horace Mann's denial of coverage to [McCord], Horace Mann specifically reserves all of its rights under the [Policy] and M.G.L. c. 175, &#167; 99 with regard to resolution of any dispute about the amount of loss caused by the subject fire. Horace Mann specifically rejects [McCord's] assertion that she sustained $66,205.86 in personal property damage and $162,553.22 in property damage as a result of the subject fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCord brought an action against Horace Mann in the Massachusetts state court, seeking damages for Horace Mann's refusal to pay her claim under the Policy. On February 7, 2003, Horace Mann, a resident of the State of Illinois, removed the case to federal court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1446, alleging diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). In its answer to McCord's complaint, Horace Mann raised McCord's \"fail[ure] to comply with the condition precedent of reference pursuant to M.G.L. c. 175, &#167; 99\" as one of its affirmative defenses. In its counterclaim against McCord for breach of contract and deceit, Horace Mann also stated that \"McCord and Horace Mann have never reached an agreement as to the amount of loss caused by the subject fire.\" McCord admitted this statement in her answer to the counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 2003, Horace Mann moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). It asserted that the parties had failed to agree on the amount of loss caused by the fire, and that McCord's failure to submit her claim to a reference proceeding, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99, barred her suit. McCord argued in opposition that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 was inapplicable, because 1) the case was about a complete denial of coverage rather than any disagreement over the amount of loss and 2) Horace Mann had waived its rights to a reference proceeding. In the alternative, McCord requested a stay of the case pending the outcome of a reference proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 2004, the district court dismissed the case without prejudice, citing McCord's failure to have submitted her claim to a reference proceeding prior to commencement of the action. The district court declined to issue a stay, because McCord had not initiated reference proceedings before bringing suit. The court noted it had granted a stay in another case where a reference proceeding had been begun but was not completed by the time the action was filed. <i>See M.A.S. Realty Corp. v. Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Ill.,</i> 196 F.Supp.2d 41, 47 (D.Mass.2002). It was not until after the dismissal of her case that McCord requested a reference proceeding with Horace Mann. We were advised by counsel at oral argument that Horace Mann refused to participate, citing as a reason the expiration of the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99. On March 29, 2004, McCord filed a motion to alter or amend judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), which the district court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> both a district court's entry of judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) and the court's allowance of summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. <i>Rafferty v. Cranston Pub. Sch. Comm.,</i> 315 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2002). However, the standard governing the allowance of a Rule 12(c) motion is generally more generous to the nonmovant. \"Judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) may not be entered unless it appears beyond a doubt that the nonmoving party can prove no set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.\" <i>Feliciano v. State of R.I.,</i> 160 F.3d 780, 788 (1st Cir.1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On occasion&#8212;and this is such a case&#8212;the parties' actions during the proceeding will result in converting what begins as a motion under Rule 12(c) to one for summary judgment under Rule 56. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) (\"If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56....\"); <i>Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Reder,</i> 355 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir.2004). When this happens, the governing standard becomes that applicable to summary judgment. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Horace Mann's Rule 12(c) motion relied upon evidentiary submissions outside the pleadings, and McCord filed an opposition that appended additional, outside evidentiary materials. There is no indication the district court excluded these materials from its consideration. The motion accordingly converted to one for summary judgment. While a conversion cannot take place unless the nonmoving party \"is given adequate notice of the conversion and a `reasonable opportunity to present material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56,'\" McCord had constructive notice of the potential conversion and, as noted, responded by attaching outside materials to its opposition. <i>Collier v. City of Chicopee,</i> 158 F.3d 601, 603 (1st Cir.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 56, the nonmovant has a heavier burden than would be posed by Rule 12(c). Once the moving party has served a supported motion asserting entitlement to summary judgment, the party opposing the motion must demonstrate, by competent evidence, a genuine issue of a material fact. <i>Gulf Coast Bank,</i> 355 F.3d at 39; <i>see Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we construe the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolve all reasonable inferences in her favor. <i>Rosenberg v. City of Everett,</i> 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two issues on appeal: 1) whether McCord's failure to submit her claim to a reference proceeding bars her lawsuit pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99, and 2) whether Horace Mann waived the reference condition precedent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties rely upon Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 and Massachusetts state case law. In so doing, they implicitly agree that Massachusetts law governs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Policy itself appears to be drafted in accordance with the standard form for Massachusetts fire insurance policies as required and set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99. Section 99 states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In case of loss under this policy and a failure of the parties to agree as to the amount of loss, it is mutually agreed that the amount of such loss shall be referred to three disinterested men ... and such reference, unless waived by the parties, shall be a condition precedent to any right of action in law or equity to recover for such loss....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCord argues that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 is not applicable, because there was no dispute as to the amount of loss but only a total denial of coverage by Horace Mann. According to McCord, Horace Mann did not state any amount of loss or provide specific criticism of her public adjuster's statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Section 99 is explicit that \"[i]n case of ... a failure of the parties to agree as to the amount of loss,\" reference, unless waived, shall be a \"condition precedent\" to any right of action to recover for such loss. The Massachusetts courts have enforced that requirement. <i>See, e.g., Employers' Liab. Assurance Corp. v. Traynor,</i> 354 Mass. 763, 237 N.E.2d 34, 34-35 (1968); <i>Molea v. Aetna Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn.,</i> 326 Mass. 542, 95 N.E.2d 749, 752 (1950); <i>Bergeron v. Mechanics' &amp; Traders' Ins. Co.,</i> 226 Mass. 236, 115 N.E. 318, 319 (1917).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though an insurer denies liability, the reference condition must be observed absent agreement as to the loss amount. In <i>Employers' Liability Assurance Corp. v. Traynor,</i> an insurer sought declaratory relief to determine whether it was liable for the loss by theft of the defendants' property covered in an insurance policy. 237 N.E.2d at 34. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") held that the trial court had properly dismissed the bill as the insurer was initially required to refer the issue of the value of the items stolen to referees pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 and the provisions of the policy. <i>Id.</i> at 35. The SJC stated: \"Questions of ultimate liability are determinable following action on the reference, pending which the insurer's rights relative thereto are protected.\" <i>Id. See also F.C.I. Realty Trust v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> 906 F.Supp. 30, 33-34 (D.Mass.1995) (granting summary judgment to insurer, which denied coverage except as to certain costs, because the insured failed to comply with the reference condition precedent). Parties are free to litigate questions of liability after resolving any dispute about the amount of loss in a reference proceeding. <i>See F.C.I. Realty Trust,</i> 906 F.Supp. at 33 (\"If the referees reach questions of ultimate liability, those issues can be relitigated; but that eventuality does not excuse the contractual requirement that there be a reference before there be a law suit.\"); <i>Fox v. Employers' Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 330 Mass. 283, 113 N.E.2d 63, 66 (1953) (\"[The referees'] views so far as ultimate liability goes are wholly tentative and in no sense a decision on that underlying question.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in McCord's favor, there is no question that she failed to request a reference proceeding prior to bringing suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Therefore, absent waiver, the reference condition precedent, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 and the provisions of the Policy, barred McCord from bringing suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if a reference were a condition precedent, McCord points out that the condition precedent can be waived. McCord contends that Horace Mann waived its right to a reference by completely denying any liability under the Policy. Because waiver is a question of fact, McCord further argues that the district court erred in denying her right to a trial by jury on this issue. The burden of proving waiver rests upon McCord who seeks to rely upon it. <i>Molea,</i> 95 N.E.2d at 752.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In urging waiver, McCord points to the case of <i>Lancaster v. General Accident Insurance Co. of America,</i> where the Massachusetts Appeals Court held that a question of fact, precluding summary judgment, existed as to whether the insurer waived a reference condition precedent. 32 Mass.App.Ct. 925, 587 N.E.2d 246, 247 (1992). In that case, the insurer sent the insured a letter denying any coverage on the claim, but the letter made no mention of any reference requirement. <i>Id.</i> at 246. The court held that the insurer's denial of liability coupled with its failure to mention in its letter the reference condition \"could, in these circumstances, be found to be a waiver.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247. In other cases finding waiver, there was an absence of evidence that the insurer disputed the amount of loss. <i>See, e.g., Goodman v. Quaker City Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 241 F.2d 432, 436 (1st Cir.1957) (holding that an insurer's letter denying any liability constituted a waiver of any right to require arbitration); <i>Moran v. Phoenix Ins. Co.,</i> 7 Mass.App.Ct. 822, 390 N.E.2d 1139, 1140 (1979) (error to allow summary judgment where the sole basis of the insurer's refusal to pay was a denial of liability and there was no evidence that insurer disputed the amount of loss).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides denying liability, Horace Mann disputed the amount of the loss and repeatedly called attention in its correspondence with McCord to the existence of the reference condition. Horace Mann's November 25, 2002 letter to McCord referred to and quoted the provision of the Policy that sets forth the reference condition precedent. In that same letter, Horace Mann specifically rejected the amount of loss submitted by McCord's public adjuster and reserved its rights with regard to the resolution of the amount of loss. Horace Mann repeated its rejection of the amount of loss submitted by McCord in its response to her demand under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Horace Mann's reliance on the reference condition as an affirmative defense and its allegation in its counterclaims, admitted by McCord, that they had never reached an agreement on the amount of loss, also indicates a dispute about the amount of loss. <i>See F.C.I. Realty Trust,</i> 906 F.Supp. at 33-34 (finding no waiver where the insurer raised the reference issue as an affirmative defense in its answer and repeatedly refused to waive its rights under the policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCord argues, based on a footnote in <i>Lancaster,</i> that a mere failure to agree as to the amount of loss does not mean that there was ever a disagreement as to the amount. <i>See Lancaster,</i> 587 N.E.2d at 247 n. 3. But here, unlike in <i>Lancaster,</i> Horace Mann expressly rejected McCord's public adjuster's figure as to the amount of loss. Horace Mann, moreover, in correspondence with McCord, mentioned the reference condition several times, and specifically reserved its rights as to a dispute about the amount of loss. Considering the facts in the light most favorable to McCord, she has failed to demonstrate, by competent evidence, the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCord's motion to alter or amend judgment, filed after dismissal of her Rule 12(c) motion, did little more than reargue the above-described grounds pursued in the Rule 12(c) motion. No materially new grounds were raised. We review a district court's denial of a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>Vasapolli v. Rostoff,</i> 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.1994). Once a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment has been allowed, we will overturn the district court's refusal to reopen the proceedings \"only if an appellant can persuade us that the refusal to grant favorable reconsideration was a clear abuse of discretion.\" <i>Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes,</i> 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Mackin v. City of Boston,</i> 969 F.2d 1273, 1279 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, McCord made no arguments in her Rule 59(e) motion above and beyond those already raised under her Rule 12(c) motion. As already discussed, the district court properly determined that McCord's action was barred by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99, suit having been commenced without observance of the reference condition precedent. The district court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in refusing to alter or amend its judgment for these same earlier-considered reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether McCord might still be entitled, even now, to insist upon a reference proceeding and, upon compliance with that condition, to sue within the one additional year provided in Mass. Gen.

McCord, brought an action in the district court against Defendant-Appellee, Horace Mann Insurance Company (\"Horace Mann\"), for breach of its insurance policy insuring her home (the \"Policy\") and for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Horace Mann moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) on the grounds that McCord failed to comply with a condition precedent in the Policy, inserted under Massachusetts law, that required the amount of loss to be submitted to a panel of referees prior to the bringing of an action to recover for the loss. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99. The district court entered judgment in Horace Mann's favor and dismissed the case without prejudice. The district court subsequently denied McCord's motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 5, 2002, McCord's home in Holden, Massachusetts was destroyed by a fire. McCord sought to recover insurance under the Policy issued by Horace Mann. McCord's public adjuster, Sadick Public Insurance Adjusters (\"Sadick\"), submitted a statement to Horace Mann, estimating that the damages caused by the fire were $162,553.22. On November 15, 2002, Horace Mann sent a letter to McCord, formally denying all coverage or liability under the Policy, on the grounds that she, or persons acting at her direction, intentionally set the fire at her home. The letter quoted excerpts from the Policy, including the requirement that \"a disagreement as to the dollar amount of loss\" be \"referred to a three member board of referees\" in accordance with Massachusetts law. The letter also referred to a provision of the Policy stating that \"no suit may be brought against [Horace Mann] unless all the terms of [the Policy] have been complied with.\" The letter further stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horace Mann specifically reserves all of its rights and defenses with regard to the resolution of amount of loss.... Horace Mann specifically rejects [Sadick's] calculation as being an accurate determination of the amount of loss. Accordingly, Horace Mann specifically reserves all of its rights and defenses with regard to resolution of any dispute about the amount of loss as a result of the subject fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2002, counsel for McCord sent Horace Mann a demand letter in accordance with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Horace Mann's response, dated December 19, 2002, denied liability and stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding Horace Mann's denial of coverage to [McCord], Horace Mann specifically reserves all of its rights under the [Policy] and M.G.L. c. 175, &#167; 99 with regard to resolution of any dispute about the amount of loss caused by the subject fire. Horace Mann specifically rejects [McCord's] assertion that she sustained $66,205.86 in personal property damage and $162,553.22 in property damage as a result of the subject fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCord brought an action against Horace Mann in the Massachusetts state court, seeking damages for Horace Mann's refusal to pay her claim under the Policy. On February 7, 2003, Horace Mann, a resident of the State of Illinois, removed the case to federal court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1446, alleging diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). In its answer to McCord's complaint, Horace Mann raised McCord's \"fail[ure] to comply with the condition precedent of reference pursuant to M.G.L. c. 175, &#167; 99\" as one of its affirmative defenses. In its counterclaim against McCord for breach of contract and deceit, Horace Mann also stated that \"McCord and Horace Mann have never reached an agreement as to the amount of loss caused by the subject fire.\" McCord admitted this statement in her answer to the counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 2003, Horace Mann moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). It asserted that the parties had failed to agree on the amount of loss caused by the fire, and that McCord's failure to submit her claim to a reference proceeding, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99, barred her suit. McCord argued in opposition that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 was inapplicable, because 1) the case was about a complete denial of coverage rather than any disagreement over the amount of loss and 2) Horace Mann had waived its rights to a reference proceeding. In the alternative, McCord requested a stay of the case pending the outcome of a reference proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 2004, the district court dismissed the case without prejudice, citing McCord's failure to have submitted her claim to a reference proceeding prior to commencement of the action. The district court declined to issue a stay, because McCord had not initiated reference proceedings before bringing suit. The court noted it had granted a stay in another case where a reference proceeding had been begun but was not completed by the time the action was filed. <i>See M.A.S. Realty Corp. v. Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Ill.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></span>, 47 (D.Mass.2002). It was not until after the dismissal of her case that McCord requested a reference proceeding with Horace Mann. We were advised by counsel at oral argument that Horace Mann refused to participate, citing as a reason the expiration of the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99. On March 29, 2004, McCord filed a motion to alter or amend judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), which the district court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> both a district court's entry of judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) and the court's allowance of summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. <i>Rafferty v. Cranston Pub. Sch. Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200256\"><a href=\"/opinion/200256/rafferty-v-cranston-school-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2002). However, the standard governing the allowance of a Rule 12(c) motion is generally more generous to the nonmovant. \"Judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) may not be entered unless it appears beyond a doubt that the nonmoving party can prove no set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.\" <i>Feliciano v. State of R.I.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759220\"><a href=\"/opinion/759220/rosemary-feliciano-v-state-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span>, 788 (1st Cir.1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On occasion&#8212;and this is such a case&#8212;the parties' actions during the proceeding will result in converting what begins as a motion under Rule 12(c) to one for summary judgment under Rule 56. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) (\"If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56....\"); <i>Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Reder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200814\"><a href=\"/opinion/200814/gulf-coast-bank-v-reder/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2004). When this happens, the governing standard becomes that applicable to summary judgment. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Horace Mann's Rule 12(c) motion relied upon evidentiary submissions outside the pleadings, and McCord filed an opposition that appended additional, outside evidentiary materials. There is no indication the district court excluded these materials from its consideration. The motion accordingly converted to one for summary judgment. While a conversion cannot take place unless the nonmoving party \"is given adequate notice of the conversion and a `reasonable opportunity to present material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56,'\" McCord had constructive notice of the potential conversion and, as noted, responded by attaching outside materials to its opposition. <i>Collier v. City of Chicopee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198170\"><a href=\"/opinion/198170/collier-v-city-of-chicopee/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 603 (1st Cir.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 56, the nonmovant has a heavier burden than would be posed by Rule 12(c). Once the moving party has served a supported motion asserting entitlement to summary judgment, the party opposing the motion must demonstrate, by competent evidence, a genuine issue of a material fact. <i>Gulf Coast Bank,</i> 355 F.3d at 39; <i>see Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.1990). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we construe the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolve all reasonable inferences in her favor. <i>Rosenberg v. City of Everett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200451\"><a href=\"/opinion/200451/rosenberg-v-city-of-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two issues on appeal: 1) whether McCord's failure to submit her claim to a reference proceeding bars her lawsuit pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99, and 2) whether Horace Mann waived the reference condition precedent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties rely upon Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 and Massachusetts state case law. In so doing, they implicitly agree that Massachusetts law governs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Policy itself appears to be drafted in accordance with the standard form for Massachusetts fire insurance policies as required and set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99. Section 99 states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In case of loss under this policy and a failure of the parties to agree as to the amount of loss, it is mutually agreed that the amount of such loss shall be referred to three disinterested men ... and such reference, unless waived by the parties, shall be a condition precedent to any right of action in law or equity to recover for such loss....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCord argues that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 is not applicable, because there was no dispute as to the amount of loss but only a total denial of coverage by Horace Mann. According to McCord, Horace Mann did not state any amount of loss or provide specific criticism of her public adjuster's statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Section 99 is explicit that \"[i]n case of ... a failure of the parties to agree as to the amount of loss,\" reference, unless waived, shall be a \"condition precedent\" to any right of action to recover for such loss. The Massachusetts courts have enforced that requirement. <i>See, e.g., Employers' Liab. Assurance Corp. v. Traynor,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span>, 34-35 (1968); <i>Molea v.

In <i>Employers' Liability Assurance Corp. v. Traynor,</i> an insurer sought declaratory relief to determine whether it was liable for the loss by theft of the defendants' property covered in an insurance policy. 237 N.E.2d at 34. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") held that the trial court had properly dismissed the bill as the insurer was initially required to refer the issue of the value of the items stolen to referees pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 and the provisions of the policy. <i>Id.</i> at 35. The SJC stated: \"Questions of ultimate liability are determinable following action on the reference, pending which the insurer's rights relative thereto are protected.\" <i>Id. See also F.C.I.

Parties are free to litigate questions of liability after resolving any dispute about the amount of loss in a reference proceeding. <i>See F.C.I. Realty Trust,</i> 906 F.Supp. at 33 (\"If the referees reach questions of ultimate liability, those issues can be relitigated; but that eventuality does not excuse the contractual requirement that there be a reference before there be a law suit.\"); <i>Fox v.

Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 and the provisions of the Policy, barred McCord from bringing suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if a reference were a condition precedent, McCord points out that the condition precedent can be waived. McCord contends that Horace Mann waived its right to a reference by completely denying any liability under the Policy. Because waiver is a question of fact, McCord further argues that the district court erred in denying her right to a trial by jury on this issue. The burden of proving waiver rests upon McCord who seeks to rely upon it. <i>Molea,</i> 95 N.E.2d at 752.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In urging waiver, McCord points to the case of <i>Lancaster v. General Accident Insurance Co. of America,</i> where the Massachusetts Appeals Court held that a question of fact, precluding summary judgment, existed as to whether the insurer waived a reference condition precedent. 32 Mass.App.Ct. 925, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></span>, 247 (1992). In that case, the insurer sent the insured a letter denying any coverage on the claim, but the letter made no mention of any reference requirement. <i>Id.</i> at 246. The court held that the insurer's denial of liability coupled with its failure to mention in its letter the reference condition \"could, in these circumstances, be found to be a waiver.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247. In other cases finding waiver, there was an absence of evidence that the insurer disputed the amount of loss. <i>See, e.g., Goodman v. Quaker City Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"241457\"><a href=\"/opinion/241457/arnold-goodman-v-quaker-city-fire-and-marine-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 436 (1st Cir.1957) (holding that an insurer's letter denying any liability constituted a waiver of any right to require arbitration); <i>Moran v. Phoenix Ins. Co.,</i> 7 Mass.App.Ct. 822, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1990667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1990667/moran-v-phoenix-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1139</span></a></span>, 1140 (1979) (error to allow summary judgment where the sole basis of the insurer's refusal to pay was a denial of liability and there was no evidence that insurer disputed the amount of loss).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides denying liability, Horace Mann disputed the amount of the loss and repeatedly called attention in its correspondence with McCord to the existence of the reference condition. Horace Mann's November 25, 2002 letter to McCord referred to and quoted the provision of the Policy that sets forth the reference condition precedent. In that same letter, Horace Mann specifically rejected the amount of loss submitted by McCord's public adjuster and reserved its rights with regard to the resolution of the amount of loss. Horace Mann repeated its rejection of the amount of loss submitted by McCord in its response to her demand under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Horace Mann's reliance on the reference condition as an affirmative defense and its allegation in its counterclaims, admitted by McCord, that they had never reached an agreement on the amount of loss, also indicates a dispute about the amount of loss. <i>See F.C.I. Realty Trust,</i> 906 F.Supp. at 33-34 (finding no waiver where the insurer raised the reference issue as an affirmative defense in its answer and repeatedly refused to waive its rights under the policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCord argues, based on a footnote in <i>Lancaster,</i> that a mere failure to agree as to the amount of loss does not mean that there was ever a disagreement as to the amount. <i>See Lancaster,</i> 587 N.E.2d at 247 n. 3. But here, unlike in <i>Lancaster,</i> Horace Mann expressly rejected McCord's public adjuster's figure as to the amount of loss. Horace Mann, moreover, in correspondence with McCord, mentioned the reference condition several times, and specifically reserved its rights as to a dispute about the amount of loss. Considering the facts in the light most favorable to McCord, she has failed to demonstrate, by competent evidence, the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCord's motion to alter or amend judgment, filed after dismissal of her Rule 12(c) motion, did little more than reargue the above-described grounds pursued in the Rule 12(c) motion. No materially new grounds were raised. We review a district court's denial of a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>Vasapolli v.

Once a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment has been allowed, we will overturn the district court's refusal to reopen the proceedings \"only if an appellant can persuade us that the refusal to grant favorable reconsideration was a clear abuse of discretion.\" <i>Aybar v.

As already discussed, the district court properly determined that McCord's action was barred by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99, suit having been commenced without observance of the reference condition precedent. The district court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in refusing to alter or amend its judgment for these same earlier-considered reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether McCord might still be entitled, even now, to insist upon a reference proceeding and, upon compliance with that condition, to sue within the one additional year provided in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 (see also Policy language set forth in Paragraph 10 of the \"Massachusetts amendatory endorsement\") is a question nowhere raised, hence one we do not consider and upon which we express no opinion. <i>See United States v.

Accordingly, any separate arguments that might be made with respect to the 93A claim alone, if such there be, are waived for purposes of this appeal<i>See Frazier v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578605\"><a href=\"/opinion/578605/kevin-frazier-v-edward-n-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 932, n. 14 (1st Cir.1992) (ruling that state law claims not fully addressed in an appellate brief are waived).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The choice of law analysis of the forum state, Massachusetts, also warrants this result. Massachusetts state courts follow \"a functional choice of law approach that responds to the interests of the parties, the States involved, and the interstate system as a whole.\"<i>Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v.

McCord speculates that Horace Mann would not have agreed to a reference request on the ground that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 was not applicable, given its denial of coverage. The law does not provide that such speculation can permit a party to disregard the reference condition precedent prior to filing suit<i>Cf. Molea,</i> 95 N.E.2d at 751 (rejecting insured's argument that reference would have been \"a useless waste of time and money\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
