Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Michael M.

Pro se plaintiff-appellant Michael M. Mills\n\nappeals from the grant of summary judgment for defendants and the\n\ndenial of his motion for reconsideration.         We review the summary\n\njudgment order de novo, and the order denying reconsideration for\n\nabuse of discretion.       Reid v. State of NH, 56 F.3d 332, 341 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).    We affirm, essentially for the reasons stated in the\n\ndistrict court's May 11 and June 25, 2004 orders.         We add only the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n            Although Mills argues that the district court relied on\n\ncontested facts, the court only accepted as true those facts\n\nproperly supported by defendants that were not contested by Mills\n\nin his opposition to the motion for summary judgment.             See N.H.\n\nDist. Ct. Rule 7.2(b)(2) (\"All properly supported material facts\n\nset forth in the moving party's factual statement shall be deemed\n\nadmitted unless properly opposed by the adverse party.\").                For\n\ninstance, the court accepted as true defendants' statement that the\n\npolice investigation was based in part on their receipt of an\n\nanonymous   letter.       Although   Mills   disputed   the   identity   and\n\ncredibility of the letter's author, he did not contest that police\n\nhad received this letter.     Thus, the court did not err in accepting\n\nthat fact as true.\n\n            Mills also argues that the court erred in concluding that\n\nan undercover police officer's use of a body wire was permissible.\n\nAs the court noted, however, New Hampshire allows a police officer\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fto wear a body wire for officer safety when investigating a\n\nspecific set of crimes.          See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 570-A:2, II(c).\n\nThe list of offenses includes \"organized crime,\" which is defined\n\nto include the \"unlawful activities of the members of a highly\n\norganized, disciplined association engaged in supplying illegal\n\ngoods    and     services,     including        but    not       limited      to     .    .    .\n\nprostitution.\"       Id. §§ 570-A:1, XI; 570-A:7.                 The court's findings\n\nthat police had sufficient information to suspect Mills of running\n\na prostitution ring, and that the undercover officer was entitled\n\nby § 570-A:2, II(c) to wear a body wire for her safety while\n\ninvestigating him, were well warranted.                     See State v. Ayres, 118\n\nN.H.    90,     92   (1978)    (holding    that        §    570-A:2,         II(c)       allows\n\ninterception and transmission of conversation to protect undercover\n\npolice officer's safety).          Mills' reliance on a different section\n\nof the statute, § 570-A:2, II(d), which requires authorization from\n\nthe    state    attorney      general's    office          to    tape    a    conversation\n\nconcerning certain enumerated offenses, is misplaced.                           The police\n\ndid not tape his conversation with the undercover officer.                                    Cf.\n\nState    v.     Kilgus,    128    N.H.    577,        590       (1986)   (holding          that\n\ninterception under § 570-A:2, II(d) may be recorded and used as\n\nevidence at trial).\n\n               Mills further argues that the court erred in finding that\n\nhis theft claim was barred based on res judicata.                        Mills contends\n\nthat defendants failed to return items seized during the search of\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fhis home.    This claim was adjudicated in the prior criminal case.\n\nMills does not dispute that the parties are the same, that the\n\nproperty at issue is the same, or that a final judgment on the\n\nmerits had     been    entered   in   the   criminal   case   regarding   this\n\nproperty.    Rather, Mills argues that the cause of action is not the\n\nsame because this is a civil case.            Because Mills is seeking \"a\n\nsecond bite at the very same apple,\" it is irrelevant that the\n\nproperty dispute was resolved in a different forum.                See United\n\nStates v. Cunan, 156 F.3d 110, 116, 120 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding\n\nthat   res   judicata    bars    criminal    forfeiture   action    following\n\ndismissal with prejudice of prior civil forfeiture action involving\n\nsame property).       Thus, the court properly held that this claim was\n\nbarred by res judicata.\n\n             Mills also argues that the court erred in finding that\n\nthe search and seizure of certain personal property was within the\n\nscope of the search warrant.          Specifically, Mills complains that\n\npolice improperly seized \"extremely personal\" records, including\n\npersonal family files and health records.              The inventory return\n\nsimply listed the removal of \"misc. paperwork\" and \"(2) metal\n\nfiling cabinets w/ misc. paperwork.\"           The district court did not\n\nspecifically address this claim.        We conclude it has no merit.       The\n\nwarrant authorized police to search the house for various papers,\n\nincluding certain bills, receipts and bank statements.             Mills does\n\nnot dispute that some of the files seized by police fell within the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwarrant.     Nor does he assert that police acted in bad faith by\n\nseizing additional records.           He is essentially arguing that police\n\nshould have parsed out the \"extremely personal\" and irrelevant\n\nrecords intermingled with those files.                   Even assuming, however,\n\nthat police seized some irrelevant records, the doctrine of good\n\nfaith immunity applies to shield the police officers from liability\n\nfor damages for the seizure of those records.                      See Crooker v.\n\nMulligan,    788   F.2d     809,    812    (1st   Cir.    1986)   (holding,   under\n\ncircumstances      of   case,      that    doctrine   of   good    faith   immunity\n\nprotected officers from liability where they seized non-warrant\n\nitems intermingled with warrant items); see also United States v.\n\nHillyard, 677 F.2d 1336, 1340 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding that, if\n\ncommingling of seizable and non-seizable items prevents on-site\n\ninspection, and no other practical alternative exists, entire\n\nproperty may be seized, at least temporarily).                    Thus, defendants\n\nwere entitled to summary judgment on this claim.                  See Four Corners\n\nServ. Station, Inc. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 51 F.3d 306, 314 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (noting that appellate court is free to affirm district court\n\njudgment on any ground supported by the record).\n\n            Mills also asserts that the court erred in addressing\n\nfour of his claims in summary fashion.                   Because Mills offers no\n\nargument in support of his position, we may treat the issue as\n\nwaived.     United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(noting    that    issues    raised       in   perfunctory   manner    are    deemed\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fwaived).   We conclude in any event that the court succinctly and\n\naptly disposed of each claim.\n\n           We have considered Mills' other arguments and deem them\n\nwithout merit.   Accordingly, the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for defendants is affirmed.\n\n           Because Mills does not make any separate argument as to\n\nwhy his motion for reconsideration was improperly denied, the\n\ncourt's order denying reconsideration also is affirmed. The denial\n\nwas proper in any event.   Relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) is for\n\nmanifest errors of law or newly discovered evidence.       Landrau-\n\nRomero v. Banco Popular De Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   Mills pointed to neither.\n\n           Affirmed.   See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",

We conclude in any event that the court succinctly and\n\naptly disposed of each claim.\n\n           We have considered Mills' other arguments and deem them\n\nwithout merit.   Accordingly, the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for defendants is affirmed.\n\n           Because Mills does not make any separate argument as to\n\nwhy his motion for reconsideration was improperly denied, the\n\ncourt's order denying reconsideration also is affirmed. The denial\n\nwas proper in any event.   Relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) is for\n\nmanifest errors of law or newly discovered evidence.       Landrau-\n\nRomero v.
