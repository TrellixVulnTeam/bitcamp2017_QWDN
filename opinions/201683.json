McGonagle, Stephen Burke, Anthony Shea, Matthew\nMcDonald and Michael K. O'Halloran, pro se, on memoranda in support\nof applications for a certificate of appealability.\n\n\n\n                           July 8, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam.     These are five pro se applications for a\n\ncertificate of appealability (COA), filed by petitioners Anthony\n\nShea, Matthew McDonald, Stephen Burke, Michael O'Halloran, and\n\nPatrick McGonagle.     Petitioners were convicted at a joint trial of\n\nvarious offenses related to a series of bank and armored-car\n\nrobberies and were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.              Except in\n\none minor respect, this court affirmed their convictions and\n\nsentences on direct appeal.       United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).    Petitioners then filed petitions under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§   2255   advancing   an   assortment   of    claims,    mostly   under      an\n\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel        rubric.        The   district    court\n\ndenied relief in a comprehensive opinion and later declined to\n\ncertify the appeals.      Our task is to determine whether petitioners\n\nhave raised one or more claims that are debatable among jurists of\n\nreason.     See, e.g., Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336\n\n(2003).     Finding that they have not done so, we deny the COA\n\napplications     substantially   for   the    reasons    enumerated      by   the\n\ndistrict court, adding only the following comments.\n\n            1.   Petitioners complain that the district court allowed\n\nthe jurors to take written copies of the jury instructions home\n\nwith them, especially prior to closing arguments. At the outset of\n\ntrial, the court informed the jurors that they would receive a\n\nwritten copy of the instructions at the appropriate time.                At the\n\nclose of evidence, and with the acquiescence of all parties, the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fcourt chose    to   deliver   the   jury   charge   before   the   attorneys\n\ndelivered their closing arguments.         On that date (a Monday), the\n\njurors were each given a written copy of the 94-page set of\n\ninstructions, which the court proceeded to read to them out loud.\n\nThe jurors were then excused for the day with the following\n\ndirectives: that they could take the written copies of the charge\n\nhome with them; that if possible they should \"try to familiarize\"\n\nthemselves with the instructions when they had \"a chance to be\n\nquiet and think about\" them; that they could make personal notes on\n\nthe written copies; and that they should not discuss the charge\n\nwith anyone.    Closing arguments consumed the next three days, and\n\ndeliberations began on Friday morning.          The jurors thus were in\n\npossession of the written charge for four days (and evenings)\n\nbefore actually starting to deliberate.\n\n           Petitioners do not now complain about written copies of\n\nthe charge being provided to the jury–-a practice endorsed by this\n\ncourt. See, e.g., United States v. Parent, 954 F.2d 23, 24 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).    Nor do they complain about the charge being delivered\n\nbefore closing arguments–-a practice endorsed by Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n30(c).1   Instead, they argue that the procedure followed here made\n\nit likely that one or more jurors consulted a dictionary or other\n\nreference material while reviewing the instructions–-a form of\n\n\n     1\n        Rule 30(c) provides: \"The court may instruct the jury\nbefore or after the arguments are completed, or at both times.\"\nOur Parent decision does not affect the operation of this rule.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fmisconduct that in their view would amount to \"structural error.\"\n\nThey fault trial and appellate counsel for not objecting to this\n\nprocedure, and they fault the habeas court for not undertaking a\n\nsuitable factual inquiry.\n\n           This claim fails because it is entirely conjectural.\n\nPetitioners     have     adduced   no    evidence     suggesting     that   such\n\nconsultation of extrinsic materials occurred.               Nor is there any\n\nparticular      reason    to   suspect        that   the   court's    procedure\n\nsignificantly enhanced the likelihood of such an occurrence.                 For\n\none thing, the concern voiced by petitioners is not limited to\n\nsituations where jurors have been allowed to take a written charge\n\nhome with them.      Even if the charge had only been delivered orally,\n\nor even if a written charge had been distributed for use only in\n\nthe jury room, the possibility would still arise that a juror would\n\nremember or write down specific words or terms to be researched at\n\nhome.    For another thing, while petitioners are correct that the\n\ncourt    gave   no   cautionary    instructions       in   this    regard   when\n\ndelivering the written charge to the jury, it did give explicit\n\nsuch directives at the outset of trial.2               Although considerable\n\ntime thereafter elapsed before the written charge was distributed,\n\n\"[a]ppellate courts ordinarily presume that a jury will follow the\n\n\n     2\n        During its preliminary instructions, the court admonished\nthe jurors not to \"engage in any outside reading of the case,\"\n\"investigate the case on their own,\" \"educate [themselves] on any\nof the subjects that might come up,\" or \"do any outside\ninvestigative work, preparation, study, anything like that.\"\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftrial judge's specific instructions.\"     United States v. Bradshaw,\n\n281 F.3d 278, 292 (1st Cir. 2002).      And the court instructed the\n\njurors on the later date to follow \"all of the instructions that I\n\ngave during the course of the trial\" and to decide the case based\n\n\"solely on the evidence received at trial.\"\n\n          On this record, the habeas court did not err in rejecting\n\npetitioners' attempt to interrogate the jury members.      When juror\n\nmisconduct is alleged, \"a convicted defendant cannot lay claim to\n\na constitutional right to cross-question jurors in the absence of\n\nan adequate evidentiary predicate.\"      Neron v. Tierney, 841 F.2d\n\n1197, 1205 (1st Cir. 1988) (habeas); accord, e.g., United States v.\n\nConnolly, 341 F.3d 16, 34 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding on direct appeal\n\nthat court should only permit post-verdict interrogation of jurors\n\n\"when reasonable grounds for investigation exist, i.e., there is\n\nclear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a\n\nspecific, nonspeculative impropriety has occurred which could have\n\nprejudiced the trial of a defendant\") (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); Taylor v. Mabry, 593 F.2d 318, 320 (8th Cir. 1979) (per\n\ncuriam) (holding in habeas case that request for jury interviews\n\nwas   properly   denied   where   allegations   of   misconduct   were\n\n\"speculative\"; petitioner was \"requesting permission to conduct a\n\nfishing expedition\") (quoted in Neron, 841 F.2d at 1206).3\n\n\n      3\n       Petitioners' analogy to cases involving \"structural error\"\nis also misplaced. See, e.g., United States v. Rogers, 121 F.3d\n12, 17 n.5 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"Courts that have considered the issue\n\n                                  -6-\n\f           Petitioners also complain that the challenged procedure\n\nencouraged    jurors     to   start   deliberating   individually      before\n\nactually convening in the jury room.4           Yet as the district court\n\nnoted, there is nothing wrong with jurors engaging in \"mental\n\ndeliberations\" during trial–-in the sense of weighing evidence,\n\nassessing credibility, and the like–-so long as they do not make up\n\ntheir minds about guilt or innocence until the appropriate time.\n\nMoreover, this same objection could be voiced whenever the charge\n\npreceded     closing     arguments.         Petitioners'   grievance     thus\n\neffectively amounts to a challenge to that sequence of events–-\n\nwhich, as mentioned, is specifically endorsed by Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n30(c).\n\n             2.   Petitioners also fault their counsel for failing to\n\nrequest, or object to the absence of, an alibi instruction.                At\n\ntrial,   Burke,    O'Halloran,    and   McGonagle    had   each   sought   to\n\nestablish alibis regarding one or more of the offenses (mainly the\n\nHudson robbery).       The habeas court rejected this claim for lack of\n\nprejudice, citing three factors.            First, the jury was properly\n\ninstructed on the presumption of innocence and the government's\n\n\n\nof juror dictionary use have not generally considered such use to\nbe prejudicial per se.\").\n     4\n        It is argued that the jurors' review of the charge on\nTuesday evening could have been especially prejudicial, since they\nhad only heard closing argument from the government by that time.\nYet defense counsel reasonably asked to wait until Wednesday to\nbegin their arguments, in order to avoid facing a fatigued jury.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fburden       of     proof.      Second,      counsel      for     petitioners,     where\n\nappropriate, addressed the alibi issue in their closings.                            And\n\nthird, the jury appears to have credited McGonagle's alibi defense\n\nto the carjacking charge, insofar as its acquittal rested on a\n\nconclusion that he was not physically present.5\n\n                  While we think such analysis suffices to dispose of the\n\ninstant      claim      (particularly       given   the    lack    of   rebuttal    from\n\npetitioners), we elaborate slightly as follows.                         The concern in\n\nthis       area    is   that   the   jury    will   mistakenly       believe     that   a\n\ndefendant's failure to prove an alibi defense is evidence of guilt-\n\n–i.e., that the burden shifts to the defendant to prove an alibi,\n\nrather than remaining with the government to disprove it.                           This\n\ncourt, while declining to adopt any per se rule, has stated that\n\n\"alibi instructions should contain adequate safeguards against jury\n\nconfusion and should indicate that the burden of proof remains on\n\nthe government despite disbelief of the alibi witnesses.\"                        United\n\nStates v. Fortes, 619 F.2d 108, 123 (1st Cir. 1980).                           Yet the\n\ncircumstances here minimized any such concern about jury confusion.\n\nThe district court provided a general instruction about burden\n\nshifting, stating:\n\n\n       5\n        The district court relied on United States v. McCall, 85\nF.3d 1193 (6th Cir. 1996), which held on direct appeal that omission\nof an alibi instruction is not plain error \"as long as the jury is\notherwise correctly instructed concerning the government's burden\nof proving every element of the crimes charged, and the defendant\nis given a full opportunity to present his alibi defense in closing\nargument.\" Id. at 1196.\n\n                                            -8-\n\f                The burden is always on the government to\n           prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That\n           burden never shifts to a defendant. The law\n           does not impose upon a defendant in a criminal\n           case the burden or duty to call any witnesses\n           or to produce any evidence.\n\nAnd the attorneys for Burke and O'Halloran emphasized this point in\n\ntheir closings while discussing alibi evidence.\n\n           Even more important, the alibi defenses of the three\n\npetitioners in question were insubstantial. Those offered by Burke\n\nand O'Halloran, involving general references to daily routines\n\nhaving been followed, were devoid of specificity.               Only McGonagle\n\nmade more than a token effort in this regard, presenting several\n\nwitnesses that placed him in a neighboring state around the time of\n\nthe Hudson robbery.        Yet this evidence was largely beside the\n\npoint, since his presence at the Hudson site was not an element of\n\nany   offense.      The   jury   convicted    McGonagle    on    four   counts:\n\nconspiring to commit, and aiding and abetting the commission of,\n\nrobbery and armed robbery.       Various courts have held that, because\n\na conspiracy or an accomplice charge ordinarily does not require\n\nproof of physical presence at the crime scene, the failure to give\n\nan alibi instruction with regard thereto is harmless error (or not\n\nerror at all).     See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, 34 F.3d 44, 50\n\n(2d Cir. 1994); United States v. Agofsky, 20 F.3d 866, 871-72 (8th\n\nCir. 1994).      Nor did the prosecution's theory of the case rest on\n\nhis presence at the Hudson site.           Compare, e.g., United States v.\n\nBurse, 531 F.2d 1151, 1153 (2d Cir. 1976).                And the fact that\n\n                                     -9-\n\fMcGonagle was acquitted of the carjacking charge suggests that the\n\njury credited his alibi evidence.\n\n            3.   In a related argument, McDonald complains about the\n\nfailure of his counsel to present alibi evidence regarding the\n\nHudson robbery. Yet he acknowledges that counsel twice interviewed\n\nthe source of such evidence (McDonald's sister).            His claim thus\n\nfails, since \"[t]he decision whether to call a particular witness\n\nis almost always strategic.\"         Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48,\n\n54 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n690 (1984) (\"strategic choices made after thorough investigation of\n\nlaw   and   facts    relevant   to    plausible   options   are   virtually\n\nunchallengeable\").\n\n            4.      Petitioners advance a vague complaint involving\n\nclosure of the courtroom.       At times, they seem to argue that the\n\ncourtroom was closed to the public during the entire voir dire\n\nprocess.    Yet the record instead indicates that the courtroom was\n\ntemporarily closed for a narrower purpose: to investigate a report\n\nof tainted venire members.      To the extent petitioners are faulting\n\ncounsel for not opposing this procedure, their claim is unavailing.\n\nIt is true that the guarantee of a public trial extends to voir\n\ndire proceedings.      See Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464\n\nU.S. 501 (1984).        Yet the temporary closure here was likely\n\npermissible under the circumstances, especially where \"a transcript\n\nof the closed proceedings [was made] available within a reasonable\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\ftime.\"    Id. at 512.   And even if not, counsel cannot be faulted for\n\nthinking that private questioning of the two venire members would\n\nbe more conducive to eliciting candor about a possibly sensitive\n\ntopic.    See, e.g., Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 81-83 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (rejecting similar claim), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 971\n\n(2005).\n\n            5.   McGonagle raises a sentencing issue, challenging the\n\ncourt's reliance on a cross-reference to the guideline for first-\n\ndegree murder.       See   U.S.S.G.   §   2B3.1(c)   (1996)   (calling   for\n\napplication of § 2A1.1 if victim was killed \"under circumstances\n\nthat would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111\" had killing\n\ntaken place within jurisdiction of United States).               On direct\n\nappeal, the other four petitioners advanced a similar challenge.\n\nThey objected that it was unclear who had actually killed the\n\nHudson guards and whether any particular individual had intended to\n\ncause their deaths.        We responded that § 1111 \"was intended to\n\nadopt the felony murder rule\" and that, under that rule, \"the\n\nkilling of the guards in the Hudson robbery was first-degree murder\n\nby those who perpetrated the robbery, regardless of who pulled the\n\ntrigger or any individual intent.\"        Shea, 211 F.3d at 674; accord,\n\ne.g., United States v. Martinez-Bermudez, 387 F.3d 98, 101 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n            McGonagle argues that a different result should obtain in\n\nhis case because of his relatively tangential involvement–-i.e.,\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fbecause it is unclear that he was even present at the Hudson site.\n\nIn his view, a defendant who lacked intent to kill and was absent\n\nfrom the crime scene cannot be held liable for first-degree murder\n\nat sentencing.    As support, however, he relies on inapposite case\n\nlaw involving Eighth Amendment claims in death-penalty cases. See,\n\ne.g., Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 797 (1982).             His argument\n\noverlooks the operation of the felony-murder rule, as explicated on\n\ndirect appeal, and ignores the fact that physical presence is not\n\nnecessarily required under an accomplice or conspiracy theory.\n\nInstead, as the district court properly noted, the level of a\n\ndefendant's involvement is accounted for in the commentary to the\n\nfirst-degree murder guideline.        See U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1, cmt. n.1;\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. Hansen, 256 F. Supp. 2d 65, 71-72 (D.\n\nMass.   2003).    The    district   court    invoked   this    provision   at\n\nsentencing and departed downward accordingly.\n\n           6.    Petitioners each filed their § 2255 petitions in\n\ntimely fashion.      Some   four    months   later,    after   the   one-year\n\nlimitations period had expired, they each sought leave to amend to\n\nadd a new claim.        The district court denied such leave on the\n\nground that the new claim did not \"relate back\" to the original\n\npetitions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) and thus was time-barred.            In\n\nthe alternative, it indicated that, even if timely, the proffered\n\nclaim would fall short on the merits.          The district court's Rule\n\n15(c) analysis has just recently been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fSee Mayle v. Felix, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2005 WL 1469153 (June 23,\n\n2005).    And its alternative rationale proves equally supportable.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we explain briefly.\n\n            Petitioners' new claim faults counsel for failing to\n\npresent additional impeachment material regarding John Ferguson,\n\none of the government's key witnesses.              On the stand, Ferguson\n\nrecounted separate conversations he had had with Shea, Burke and\n\nMcDonald while jointly incarcerated with each of them–-testimony\n\nwhich, inter alia, implicated all five petitioners in the Hudson\n\nrobbery.    He was cross-examined at length over the course of two\n\ndays.    In now claiming that such cross-examination was inadequate,\n\npetitioners point to Ferguson's appearance shortly thereafter at an\n\nunrelated bank-robbery trial in Massachusetts.            See United States\n\nv. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72 (1st Cir. 2000).           In particular, relying on\n\na government memorandum filed in a habeas proceeding brought by a\n\nBalsam defendant, they complain that Ferguson was there impeached\n\non various grounds that were never raised at their own trial.\n\n            This    argument   fails    because   there   is   no   reasonable\n\nprobability that the results of the trial would have been different\n\nhad Ferguson been impeached more extensively.             See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 685 (1985) (plurality and\n\nconcurring opinions); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.             In part, this\n\nis because of the extent to which he was impeached at petitioners'\n\ntrial.      In     addition    to   recounting    his   extensive     criminal\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fbackground, Ferguson there admitted, inter alia, to the following:\n\nsuborning perjury before several grand juries; testifying falsely\n\nduring a civil deposition; uttering myriad falsehoods under an\n\narray    of   circumstances;          and    making      inaccurate        and   incomplete\n\nstatements while being interviewed by investigators.                               The key\n\nimpeachment items presented for the first time at the Balsam trial\n\nappear   to    be    a    pair   of    false      affidavits,        the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding which are not explained.                    Regardless, such additional\n\nevidence of Ferguson's mendacity would have been largely cumulative\n\nof that adduced at petitioners' trial.\n\n              In    any    event,      even       if   Ferguson's      testimony       were\n\ndiscounted,        the    amount      of    other      incriminatory        evidence   was\n\nsubstantial.         For    example,        all   five    of   the    petitioners      were\n\nimplicated in the Hudson robbery by one or more other witnesses.6\n\nIndeed, an analogous claim arose on direct appeal, involving new\n\nevidence that might have further impeached John Burke (a named\n\ndefendant turned cooperating witness). In rejecting this claim, we\n\nnoted the following:\n\n              The evidence against the defendants was\n              substantial and rested on a number of\n              witnesses, much forensic evidence, and a\n              series   of  admissions   and   co-conspirator\n              statements.      Further,   John   Burke   was\n              extensively impeached ... [regarding] subjects\n              that might fairly cast doubt on his veracity.\n\n\n     6\n       We take particular note in this regard of the testimony of\nSteven Connolly, Edwin McDonald, James Tracy, Michael Yandle, and\nDavid Kelley.\n\n                                            -14-\n\f            The outcome would not have changed [had the\n            new material been used].\n\nShea, 211 F.3d at 675-76.       The instant claim fails for similar\n\nreasons.\n\n            7.    McDonald seeks to amend his COA application to\n\nadvance a claim under Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).\n\nIt is doubtful that Crawford applies retroactively to cases on\n\ncollateral review. See, e.g., Murillo v. Frank, 402 F.3d 786, 789-\n\n91 (7th Cir. 2005).     It is also doubtful that the hearsay remarks\n\ncited by McDonald constitute \"testimonial\" statements within the\n\nreach of Crawford.     See, e.g., Horton, 370 F.3d at 84.      We need not\n\nresolve these matters, however, since \"a party may not unveil an\n\nargument in the court of appeals that he did not seasonably raise\n\nin the district court.\"     David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).     While an appellate court does have discretion to\n\noverlook this rule \"in an exceptional case,\" Castillo v. Matesanz,\n\n348 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2003), the instant cases cannot be so\n\ncharacterized.     Whether McDonald or the other petitioners might be\n\nable to file a second or successive petition seeking relief under\n\nCrawford,   should    the   Supreme   Court   ever   make   that   decision\n\nretroactive to cases on collateral review, is a matter we need not\n\ndecide.\n\n            8.   We have reviewed petitioners' remaining claims and,\n\nto the extent not explicitly addressed in the district court's\n\nopinion, deem them unworthy of separate comment.\n\n                                  -15-\n\f          The applications for a COA are denied, and the appeals\n\nare terminated.   McDonald's motion for leave to amend his COA\n\napplication and his motion for appointment of counsel are denied.\n\n\n\n\n                              -16-\n\f",

Petitioners then filed petitions under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§   2255   advancing   an   assortment   of    claims,    mostly   under      an\n\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel        rubric.        The   district    court\n\ndenied relief in a comprehensive opinion and later declined to\n\ncertify the appeals.      Our task is to determine whether petitioners\n\nhave raised one or more claims that are debatable among jurists of\n\nreason.     See, e.g., Miller-El v. Cockrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122258\"><a href=\"/opinion/122258/miller-el-v-cockrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 336\n\n(2003).     Finding that they have not done so, we deny the COA\n\napplications     substantially   for   the    reasons    enumerated      by   the\n\ndistrict court, adding only the following comments.\n\n            1.   Petitioners complain that the district court allowed\n\nthe jurors to take written copies of the jury instructions home\n\nwith them, especially prior to closing arguments. At the outset of\n\ntrial, the court informed the jurors that they would receive a\n\nwritten copy of the instructions at the appropriate time.                At the\n\nclose of evidence, and with the acquiescence of all parties, the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fcourt chose    to   deliver   the   jury   charge   before   the   attorneys\n\ndelivered their closing arguments.         On that date (a Monday), the\n\njurors were each given a written copy of the 94-page set of\n\ninstructions, which the court proceeded to read to them out loud.\n\nThe jurors were then excused for the day with the following\n\ndirectives: that they could take the written copies of the charge\n\nhome with them; that if possible they should \"try to familiarize\"\n\nthemselves with the instructions when they had \"a chance to be\n\nquiet and think about\" them; that they could make personal notes on\n\nthe written copies; and that they should not discuss the charge\n\nwith anyone.    Closing arguments consumed the next three days, and\n\ndeliberations began on Friday morning.          The jurors thus were in\n\npossession of the written charge for four days (and evenings)\n\nbefore actually starting to deliberate.\n\n           Petitioners do not now complain about written copies of\n\nthe charge being provided to the jury–-a practice endorsed by this\n\ncourt. See, e.g., United States v. Parent, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576215\"><a href=\"/opinion/576215/united-states-v-barry-h-parent/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).    Nor do they complain about the charge being delivered\n\nbefore closing arguments–-a practice endorsed by Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n30(c).1   Instead, they argue that the procedure followed here made\n\nit likely that one or more jurors consulted a dictionary or other\n\nreference material while reviewing the instructions–-a form of\n\n\n     1\n        Rule 30(c) provides: \"The court may instruct the jury\nbefore or after the arguments are completed, or at both times.\"\nOur Parent decision does not affect the operation of this rule.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fmisconduct that in their view would amount to \"structural error.\"\n\nThey fault trial and appellate counsel for not objecting to this\n\nprocedure, and they fault the habeas court for not undertaking a\n\nsuitable factual inquiry.\n\n           This claim fails because it is entirely conjectural.\n\nPetitioners     have     adduced   no    evidence     suggesting     that   such\n\nconsultation of extrinsic materials occurred.               Nor is there any\n\nparticular      reason    to   suspect        that   the   court's    procedure\n\nsignificantly enhanced the likelihood of such an occurrence.                 For\n\none thing, the concern voiced by petitioners is not limited to\n\nsituations where jurors have been allowed to take a written charge\n\nhome with them.      Even if the charge had only been delivered orally,\n\nor even if a written charge had been distributed for use only in\n\nthe jury room, the possibility would still arise that a juror would\n\nremember or write down specific words or terms to be researched at\n\nhome.    For another thing, while petitioners are correct that the\n\ncourt    gave   no   cautionary    instructions       in   this    regard   when\n\ndelivering the written charge to the jury, it did give explicit\n\nsuch directives at the outset of trial.2               Although considerable\n\ntime thereafter elapsed before the written charge was distributed,\n\n\"[a]ppellate courts ordinarily presume that a jury will follow the\n\n\n     2\n        During its preliminary instructions, the court admonished\nthe jurors not to \"engage in any outside reading of the case,\"\n\"investigate the case on their own,\" \"educate [themselves] on any\nof the subjects that might come up,\" or \"do any outside\ninvestigative work, preparation, study, anything like that.\"\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftrial judge's specific instructions.\"     United States v.

Petitioners'   grievance     thus\n\neffectively amounts to a challenge to that sequence of events–-\n\nwhich, as mentioned, is specifically endorsed by Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n30(c).\n\n             2.   Petitioners also fault their counsel for failing to\n\nrequest, or object to the absence of, an alibi instruction.                At\n\ntrial,   Burke,    O'Halloran,    and   McGonagle    had   each   sought   to\n\nestablish alibis regarding one or more of the offenses (mainly the\n\nHudson robbery).       The habeas court rejected this claim for lack of\n\nprejudice, citing three factors.            First, the jury was properly\n\ninstructed on the presumption of innocence and the government's\n\n\n\nof juror dictionary use have not generally considered such use to\nbe prejudicial per se.\").\n     4\n        It is argued that the jurors' review of the charge on\nTuesday evening could have been especially prejudicial, since they\nhad only heard closing argument from the government by that time.\nYet defense counsel reasonably asked to wait until Wednesday to\nbegin their arguments, in order to avoid facing a fatigued jury.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fburden       of     proof.      Second,      counsel      for     petitioners,     where\n\nappropriate, addressed the alibi issue in their closings.                            And\n\nthird, the jury appears to have credited McGonagle's alibi defense\n\nto the carjacking charge, insofar as its acquittal rested on a\n\nconclusion that he was not physically present.5\n\n                  While we think such analysis suffices to dispose of the\n\ninstant      claim      (particularly       given   the    lack    of   rebuttal    from\n\npetitioners), we elaborate slightly as follows.                         The concern in\n\nthis       area    is   that   the   jury    will   mistakenly       believe     that   a\n\ndefendant's failure to prove an alibi defense is evidence of guilt-\n\n–i.e., that the burden shifts to the defendant to prove an alibi,\n\nrather than remaining with the government to disprove it.                           This\n\ncourt, while declining to adopt any per se rule, has stated that\n\n\"alibi instructions should contain adequate safeguards against jury\n\nconfusion and should indicate that the burden of proof remains on\n\nthe government despite disbelief of the alibi witnesses.\"                        United\n\nStates v.

The law\n           does not impose upon a defendant in a criminal\n           case the burden or duty to call any witnesses\n           or to produce any evidence.\n\nAnd the attorneys for Burke and O'Halloran emphasized this point in\n\ntheir closings while discussing alibi evidence.\n\n           Even more important, the alibi defenses of the three\n\npetitioners in question were insubstantial. Those offered by Burke\n\nand O'Halloran, involving general references to daily routines\n\nhaving been followed, were devoid of specificity.               Only McGonagle\n\nmade more than a token effort in this regard, presenting several\n\nwitnesses that placed him in a neighboring state around the time of\n\nthe Hudson robbery.        Yet this evidence was largely beside the\n\npoint, since his presence at the Hudson site was not an element of\n\nany   offense.      The   jury   convicted    McGonagle    on    four   counts:\n\nconspiring to commit, and aiding and abetting the commission of,\n\nrobbery and armed robbery.       Various courts have held that, because\n\na conspiracy or an accomplice charge ordinarily does not require\n\nproof of physical presence at the crime scene, the failure to give\n\nan alibi instruction with regard thereto is harmless error (or not\n\nerror at all).     See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677319\"><a href=\"/opinion/677319/united-states-v-dean-thomas-also-known-as-dino-jaime-a-davidson-also/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50\n\n(2d Cir. 1994); United States v.

Nor did the prosecution's theory of the case rest on\n\nhis presence at the Hudson site.           Compare, e.g., United States v.\n\nBurse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"333982\"><a href=\"/opinion/333982/united-states-v-maurice-burse/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1153 (2d Cir. 1976).                And the fact that\n\n                                     -9-\n\fMcGonagle was acquitted of the carjacking charge suggests that the\n\njury credited his alibi evidence.\n\n            3.   In a related argument, McDonald complains about the\n\nfailure of his counsel to present alibi evidence regarding the\n\nHudson robbery. Yet he acknowledges that counsel twice interviewed\n\nthe source of such evidence (McDonald's sister).            His claim thus\n\nfails, since \"[t]he decision whether to call a particular witness\n\nis almost always strategic.\"         Lema v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601483\"><a href=\"/opinion/601483/charles-d-lema-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n54 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Strickland v.

Petitioners advance a vague complaint involving\n\nclosure of the courtroom.       At times, they seem to argue that the\n\ncourtroom was closed to the public during the entire voir dire\n\nprocess.    Yet the record instead indicates that the courtroom was\n\ntemporarily closed for a narrower purpose: to investigate a report\n\nof tainted venire members.      To the extent petitioners are faulting\n\ncounsel for not opposing this procedure, their claim is unavailing.\n\nIt is true that the guarantee of a public trial extends to voir\n\ndire proceedings.      See Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111063\"><a href=\"/opinion/111063/press-enterprise-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-riverside-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984).        Yet the temporary closure here was likely\n\npermissible under the circumstances, especially where \"a transcript\n\nof the closed proceedings [was made] available within a reasonable\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\ftime.\"    Id. at 512.   And even if not, counsel cannot be faulted for\n\nthinking that private questioning of the two venire members would\n\nbe more conducive to eliciting candor about a possibly sensitive\n\ntopic.    See, e.g., Horton v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201031\"><a href=\"/opinion/201031/horton-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81-83 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (rejecting similar claim), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

McGonagle raises a sentencing issue, challenging the\n\ncourt's reliance on a cross-reference to the guideline for first-\n\ndegree murder.       See   U.S.S.G.   §   2B3.1(c)   (1996)   (calling   for\n\napplication of § 2A1.1 if victim was killed \"under circumstances\n\nthat would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111\" had killing\n\ntaken place within jurisdiction of United States).               On direct\n\nappeal, the other four petitioners advanced a similar challenge.\n\nThey objected that it was unclear who had actually killed the\n\nHudson guards and whether any particular individual had intended to\n\ncause their deaths.        We responded that § 1111 \"was intended to\n\nadopt the felony murder rule\" and that, under that rule, \"the\n\nkilling of the guards in the Hudson robbery was first-degree murder\n\nby those who perpetrated the robbery, regardless of who pulled the\n\ntrigger or any individual intent.\"        Shea, 211 F.3d at 674; accord,\n\ne.g., United States v. Martinez-Bermudez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201315\"><a href=\"/opinion/201315/united-states-v-martinez-bermudez/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n            McGonagle argues that a different result should obtain in\n\nhis case because of his relatively tangential involvement–-i.e.,\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fbecause it is unclear that he was even present at the Hudson site.\n\nIn his view, a defendant who lacked intent to kill and was absent\n\nfrom the crime scene cannot be held liable for first-degree murder\n\nat sentencing.    As support, however, he relies on inapposite case\n\nlaw involving Eighth Amendment claims in death-penalty cases. See,\n\ne.g., Enmund v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110795\"><a href=\"/opinion/110795/enmund-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 797 (1982).             His argument\n\noverlooks the operation of the felony-murder rule, as explicated on\n\ndirect appeal, and ignores the fact that physical presence is not\n\nnecessarily required under an accomplice or conspiracy theory.\n\nInstead, as the district court properly noted, the level of a\n\ndefendant's involvement is accounted for in the commentary to the\n\nfirst-degree murder guideline.        See U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1, cmt. n.1;\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. Hansen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2390585\"><a href=\"/opinion/2390585/united-states-v-hansen/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71-72 (D.\n\nMass.   2003).    The    district   court    invoked   this    provision   at\n\nsentencing and departed downward accordingly.\n\n           6.    Petitioners each filed their § 2255 petitions in\n\ntimely fashion.      Some   four    months   later,    after   the   one-year\n\nlimitations period had expired, they each sought leave to amend to\n\nadd a new claim.        The district court denied such leave on the\n\nground that the new claim did not \"relate back\" to the original\n\npetitions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) and thus was time-barred.            In\n\nthe alternative, it indicated that, even if timely, the proffered\n\nclaim would fall short on the merits.          The district court's Rule\n\n15(c) analysis has just recently been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fSee Mayle v. Felix, ___ S. Ct. ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1469153</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (June 23,\n\n2005).    And its alternative rationale proves equally supportable.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we explain briefly.\n\n            Petitioners' new claim faults counsel for failing to\n\npresent additional impeachment material regarding John Ferguson,\n\none of the government's key witnesses.              On the stand, Ferguson\n\nrecounted separate conversations he had had with Shea, Burke and\n\nMcDonald while jointly incarcerated with each of them–-testimony\n\nwhich, inter alia, implicated all five petitioners in the Hudson\n\nrobbery.    He was cross-examined at length over the course of two\n\ndays.    In now claiming that such cross-examination was inadequate,\n\npetitioners point to Ferguson's appearance shortly thereafter at an\n\nunrelated bank-robbery trial in Massachusetts.            See United States\n\nv. Balsam, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198819\"><a href=\"/opinion/198819/united-states-v-balsam/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2000).           In particular, relying on\n\na government memorandum filed in a habeas proceeding brought by a\n\nBalsam defendant, they complain that Ferguson was there impeached\n\non various grounds that were never raised at their own trial.\n\n            This    argument   fails    because   there   is   no   reasonable\n\nprobability that the results of the trial would have been different\n\nhad Ferguson been impeached more extensively.             See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Bagley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682, 685 (1985) (plurality and\n\nconcurring opinions); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.             In part, this\n\nis because of the extent to which he was impeached at petitioners'\n\ntrial.      In     addition    to   recounting    his   extensive     criminal\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fbackground, Ferguson there admitted, inter alia, to the following:\n\nsuborning perjury before several grand juries; testifying falsely\n\nduring a civil deposition; uttering myriad falsehoods under an\n\narray    of   circumstances;          and    making      inaccurate        and   incomplete\n\nstatements while being interviewed by investigators.                               The key\n\nimpeachment items presented for the first time at the Balsam trial\n\nappear   to    be    a    pair   of    false      affidavits,        the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding which are not explained.                    Regardless, such additional\n\nevidence of Ferguson's mendacity would have been largely cumulative\n\nof that adduced at petitioners' trial.\n\n              In    any    event,      even       if   Ferguson's      testimony       were\n\ndiscounted,        the    amount      of    other      incriminatory        evidence   was\n\nsubstantial.         For    example,        all   five    of   the    petitioners      were\n\nimplicated in the Hudson robbery by one or more other witnesses.6\n\nIndeed, an analogous claim arose on direct appeal, involving new\n\nevidence that might have further impeached John Burke (a named\n\ndefendant turned cooperating witness). In rejecting this claim, we\n\nnoted the following:\n\n              The evidence against the defendants was\n              substantial and rested on a number of\n              witnesses, much forensic evidence, and a\n              series   of  admissions   and   co-conspirator\n              statements.      Further,   John   Burke   was\n              extensively impeached ... [regarding] subjects\n              that might fairly cast doubt on his veracity.\n\n\n     6\n       We take particular note in this regard of the testimony of\nSteven Connolly, Edwin McDonald, James Tracy, Michael Yandle, and\nDavid Kelley.\n\n                                            -14-\n\f            The outcome would not have changed [had the\n            new material been used].\n\nShea, 211 F.3d at 675-76.       The instant claim fails for similar\n\nreasons.\n\n            7.    McDonald seeks to amend his COA application to\n\nadvance a claim under Crawford v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).\n\nIt is doubtful that Crawford applies retroactively to cases on\n\ncollateral review. See, e.g., Murillo v. Frank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789724\"><a href=\"/opinion/789724/edward-a-murillo-v-matthew-j-frank-secretary-wisconsin-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 789-\n\n91 (7th Cir. 2005).     It is also doubtful that the hearsay remarks\n\ncited by McDonald constitute \"testimonial\" statements within the\n\nreach of Crawford.     See, e.g., Horton, 370 F.3d at 84.      We need not\n\nresolve these matters, however, since \"a party may not unveil an\n\nargument in the court of appeals that he did not seasonably raise\n\nin the district court.\"     David v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197753\"><a href=\"/opinion/197753/david-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 474\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).     While an appellate court does have discretion to\n\noverlook this rule \"in an exceptional case,\" Castillo v. Matesanz,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200697\"><a href=\"/opinion/200697/castillo-v-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir. 2003), the instant cases cannot be so\n\ncharacterized.     Whether McDonald or the other petitioners might be\n\nable to file a second or successive petition seeking relief under\n\nCrawford,   should    the   Supreme   Court   ever   make   that   decision\n\nretroactive to cases on collateral review, is a matter we need not\n\ndecide.\n\n            8.   We have reviewed petitioners' remaining claims and,\n\nto the extent not explicitly addressed in the district court's\n\nopinion, deem them unworthy of separate comment.\n\n                                  -15-\n\f          The applications for a COA are denied, and the appeals\n\nare terminated.   McDonald's motion for leave to amend his COA\n\napplication and his motion for appointment of counsel are denied.\n\n\n\n\n                              -16-\n\f</pre>",
