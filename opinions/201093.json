Plaintiff-appellants are family members of\n\nthe decedent, Vicente Molina-Velez, who died of cigarette-related\n\nillnesses.      They appeal from the district court's statute of\n\nlimitation-based dismissal of their complaint against defendant-\n\nappellee cigarette manufacturers.          We affirm the dismissal.\n\n                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n             Plaintiffs    alleged   the     following   facts   in   their\n\ncomplaint.     In 1987, Molina died at the age of 89 from cigarette-\n\nrelated illnesses.1        In 1981, he began to experience persistent\n\ncoughing, shortness of breath, and bronchitis; in 1986 he was\n\nhospitalized with these symptoms and diagnosed with a lung abscess;\n\nlater he was diagnosed with emphysema. Plaintiffs allege that they\n\ndid not become aware of any cause of action against the defendants\n\nuntil November 2001, fourteen years after Molina's death.               On\n\nAugust 8, 2002, they filed a complaint in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico alleging that the\n\ndefendants engaged in conspiracy and fraud.\n\n             On September 30, 2003, in a published opinion, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims on timeliness\n\ngrounds.     In re Molina-Velez v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 286 F.\n\nSupp.2d 185, 190 (D.P.R. 2003).       It held that that plaintiffs had\n\n\n     1\n      In the complaint, plaintiffs first allege that Molina had\nsmoked cigarettes for about twenty years before his death; later\nthey contend that he had been a smoker \"since a young age.\" As\nMolina died at age 89, these two statements are factually\ncontradictory.\n\n                                     -2-\n\ffailed to allege the requisite diligence in attempting to ascertain\n\nthe cause of Molina's illness, hence they were not entitled to\n\ntolling of the applicable one-year statute of limitations on their\n\nclaims.      Id.   On November 21, 2003, the district court denied\n\nplaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.         This appeal followed.\n\n                              II. DISCUSSION\n\n             After careful review of the record, we hold that the\n\ndistrict court correctly concluded that plaintiffs' claims were\n\nuntimely under Puerto Rico law because of their failure to exercise\n\nthe requisite diligence in discovering their cause of action.           We\n\nneed not repeat the district court's able reasoning.\n\n             Only one issue bears elaboration.       In their appellate\n\nbrief, plaintiffs contend that \"because of the effects of the\n\nconspiracy perpetrated by Defendants, Plaintiffs were ignorant as\n\nto the cause of decedent's illness and their damages.\" They assert\n\nthat   the    statute   of   limitation   was   tolled   by    defendants'\n\ndissemination of \"false information to contradict the true facts of\n\nthe dangers related to cigarette smoking.\"\n\n             It is true that under Puerto Rico law, the applicable\n\nstatute of limitation can be tolled \"if a plaintiff's suspicions\n\nthat she may have been the victim of a tort are assuaged by the\n\nperson who caused the injury.\"      Espada v. Lugo, 312 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (quoting Rodriguez-Suris v. Montesinos, 123 F.3d 10, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1997)(internal quotation marks omitted)).           Such reliance\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fmust be reasonable, however.            Rodriguez-Suris, 123 F.3d at 16.\n\nIndeed, \"such tolling may be halted by further information that\n\nrenders   plaintiff's        reliance    on   those    assurances    no   longer\n\nreasonable, so that plaintiff then has an obligation of diligent\n\ninvestigation.\" Espada, 312 F.3d at 4 (citing Rodriguez-Suris, 123\n\nF.3d at 17).\n\n          Nowhere in their filings do plaintiffs offer specific\n\nfacts as to defendants' conduct after Molina's death that assured\n\nthem that they did not have a cause of action.             Hence, there is no\n\nfoundation     for   their    contention      that    defendants    effectively\n\nnullified the common knowledge about the dangers of smoking and\n\nprevented plaintiffs from perceiving the link between smoking and\n\nMolina's illnesses. See Estate of Alicano Ayala v. Phillip Morris,\n\nInc., 263 F. Supp.2d 311, 319 (D.P.R. 2003).\n\n          Even if Plaintiffs were legitimately confused\n          . . ., the easy access to public sources of\n          information confirming the health hazards of\n          smoking--including government reports, warning\n          labels, and the health care industry--imposed\n          on the Plaintiffs an obligation to at least\n          investigate   further.   .    .   .   Inertia,\n          passiveness, and indifference in the face of\n          confusing or contradictory information is\n          inconsistent with the due diligence standard.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted.)              In sum, the allegations in\n\nplaintiffs' complaint do not support the diligence or reasonable\n\nreliance necessary to toll the applicable statute of limitation.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the dismissal.\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f             Two motions also are before us: (1) defendants' motion to\n\nfile a pamphlet containing the complaint filed in United States v.\n\nPhilip    Morris   USA,    Inc.,    No.     99-CV-02496        (D.D.C.),     and   (2)\n\nplaintiffs' motion for sanctions on the ground that defendants\n\nengaged in excessive designation with respect to the contents of\n\nthe appendix.        As to defendants' motion, because we affirm the\n\ndecision below without reliance on the pamphlet, we see no need to\n\ndetermine the admissibility of this evidence.\n\n             Plaintiffs'    motion       for   sanctions        is   based    on    the\n\ncontention    that    defendants        required   them    to    file   an    amended\n\nappendix that included both the original complaint and an amended\n\ncomplaint filed in this case.              See Fed. R. App. P. 30(b); L.R.\n\n30(e).2    They maintain that the inclusion of these documents was\n\n\"unnecessary,\"     but    offer    no    explanation      or    support      for   this\n\nstatement.    Moreover, it appears that defendants agreed to pay the\n\ncosts of including the requested documents, as required by Rule\n\n30(b)(2). Accordingly, we discern no reason to impose sanctions on\n\ndefendants, and deny plaintiffs' motion.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Fed. R. App. P. 30(b)(2) provides that \"if any party causes\nunnecessary parts of the record to be included in the appendix, the\ncourt may impose the cost of those parts on that party.\".        In\naddition, Rule 30(b)(2) states, \"Each circuit must, by local rule,\nprovide for sanctions against attorneys who unreasonably and\nvexatiously increase litigation costs by including unnecessary\nmaterial in the appendix.\" Our Local Rule 30(e) so provides.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f          For the reasons set forth supra, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the complaint and deny plaintiffs' motion for\n\nsanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
