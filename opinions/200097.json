This product design case tests\n\nsome of the limits of the minority rule, adopted by Puerto Rico and\n\nCalifornia, that the defendant bears the burden of proving that the\n\nutility of a product's design outweighs the risks.            Aponte Rivera\n\nv. Sears Roebuck de P.R., Inc., 144 P.R. Dec. 830, 840 n.9, 1998\n\nP.R.-Eng. 324486 n.9 (1998); Barker v. Lull Eng'r Co., 573 P.2d 443\n\n(Cal. 1978).    The question here is whether a jury may find for a\n\nplaintiff, injured when her airbag properly deployed in an auto\n\naccident, when the evidence is that the overall utility of the\n\ndesign exceeds the overall risk, there is no evidence of the\nexistence of an alternative safer design, and the jury verdict is\n\nbased either on a misunderstanding of the law or solely on the\njury's rejection of the testimony of the experts retained by the\ndefendant.     We hold that such a jury verdict is not sustainable.\n\nIt   effectively,   in   these   circumstances,      either   converts   the\ndefendant to the status of an insurer or creates liability based on\na consumer expectation theory.        Since neither of these outcomes is\n\npermissible under Puerto Rican law, we reverse and direct entry of\njudgment for defendant.\n                                 I.    FACTS\n\n             Early in the morning of August 10, 1996, Ines Reyes-\nQuintana, then fifteen years old, was returning from a party in a\n1996 Hyundai Accent.     Reyes-Quintana's brother was driving the car\n\nand Reyes-Quintana was in the front passenger's seat.           The Hyundai\nwas in the left lane of a two-lane road.           A Nissan station wagon,\n\ntraveling at a substantially slower speed, crossed from the right\n\n                                      -2-\n\flane into the left lane, in front of the Hyundai.           The Hyundai\n\nbraked, leaving about 163 feet worth of skid marks on the road.\n\nThe Hyundai then rear-ended the Nissan at a speed differential of\nabout 30 miles per hour.          The passenger-side airbag deployed,\n\nstriking Reyes-Quintana's hand, which she had raised as if to brace\n\nherself.\n              The force of the airbag striking her arm fractured Reyes-\n\nQuintana's arm and wrist in four places.            These were the only\n\ninjuries Reyes-Quintana sustained in the accident.1       The fractures\n\nrequired three surgeries, including the permanent attachment of two\n\nmetal plates and sixteen metal screws.         Reyes-Quintana has also\n\nexperienced some permanent loss of strength and scarring in that\n\narm.       The Hyundai sustained significant damage, estimated at over\n$11,300.\n\n                          II.   TRIAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n               Only two experts testified on the airbag's design.   Both\nexperts were retained by the defendant, Hyundai.          The plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The parties contest whether Reyes-Quintana was wearing\nher seatbelt at the time of the crash. Reyes-Quintana maintains\nthat she was, and that this was a factual question for the jury,\nwhich she says the jury must have found in her favor because they\nfound that she was not comparatively negligent.          The judge\nspecifically instructed the jury that if it found that she was not\nwearing her seat belt and that contributed to her injuries, the\njury should determine what percentage of the damages was\nattributable to the failure to wear the seat belt. Because the\ndefendant's experts did not include any conclusions about whether\nReyes-Quintana was wearing her seatbelt at the time of the crash in\ntheir reports, the judge forbade them from offering an opinion on\nthis point at trial.\n\n                                    -3-\n\falso offered the testimony of a medical expert to establish Reyes-\n\nQuintana's injuries.\n\nA.   Testimony of Dr. Martinez\n\n           Dr. Jose Martinez, formerly of Texas A & M University,\n\ntestified as an accident reconstruction expert, providing the\n\nprobable explanation of how the accident took place.       He testified\nthat the police reports showed 163 feet of braking marks before\n\nimpact. Based on the damage sustained by the Hyundai, Dr. Martinez\n\nconcluded that it was traveling thirty miles per hour faster than\n\nthe Nissan at the point of impact.       Based on this conclusion and\n\nthe length of the skid marks, Dr. Martinez opined that the Hyundai\n\nhad to be traveling at least 63 miles per hour before the driver\n\nbegan to brake.\n           Dr.    Martinez   explained   the   mechanics   of    accident\n\nreconstruction, a short summary of which is necessary in order to\n\nunderstand the issues in this case.      Barrier equivalent velocity,\nreferred to as BEV, is the speed at which a vehicle goes into a\n\nbarrier, measured in miles per hour.      BEV is used for setting the\n\ndeployment level for airbags, and it is the measurement used in the\n\nrelevant federal regulations. Delta V, a related but not identical\n\nconcept, is the change in velocity of a vehicle, usually at the\n\ncenter of gravity, also measured in miles per hour.             Generally,\n\naccident reconstruction experts measure the Delta V of the car\n\nenvironment, rather than that of a specific occupant. In accidents\n\ninvolving impact into a barrier, the BEV is often slightly less\n\nthan the Delta V.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f            The higher the Delta V is, the more serious the injuries\n\nare likely to be.        Conversely, the lower the Delta V, the less\n\nserious the injuries are likely to be.         The majority of accidents\n\noccur in the 10 to 15 Delta V range.         Generally, accidents with a\n\nDelta V under 15 are considered to be of lower severity.             Middle\n\nseverity accidents are in the 15 to 25 Delta V range; above 25 is\n\nconsidered high severity.       Dr. Martinez testified that a BEV of 15\n\"is where you start to get serious injuries, according to the\n\nstatistics\" and that is \"where you want that air bag to go off.\"\n\nHe also     testified that even an accident referred to as \"low\n\nseverity\" is not mild because, if you are unrestrained, such an\n\naccident can \"put your head in the windshield\" and cause serious\n\ninjuries.     Although he could not provide the specific percentiles\n\nof how many people would get hurt in an accident with a BEV under\n\n14, he stated that \"people do get hurt and will get hurt\" in those\n\ntypes of accidents.      Dr. Martinez testified that an accident with\n\na BEV of 12 would cause an unbelted test dummy to go through the\n\nwindshield.      Based    on   his   reconstruction   of   the   plaintiff’s\n\naccident, Dr. Martinez estimated the BEV of the accident at \"14 to\n\n16, or maybe thirteen and change\" and the Delta V at \"15 to 16,\n\ncould be 15 to 17.\"\n            The airbag in this Hyundai model is designed to always\ndeploy in accidents with a BEV of 12 or greater, and so the\n\ndeployment of the airbag was in keeping with its intended design.\nDr. Martinez testified that, in any American car with an airbag,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe airbag would have deployed in an accident of the type at issue\n\nhere. Nothing in the cross-examination impeached any of these\n\nconclusions.      The   plaintiff's   counsel    attempted    to   make    Dr.\nMartinez concede that Hyundai could have chosen an airbag design\n\nthat would deploy at a higher BEV; Dr. Martinez responded that he\n\ndid not know whether it was possible to create a design that would\nonly deploy at a BEV of over 14 and still meet the federal\n\nperformance standards.\n\n            The   plaintiff's   counsel   also   attempted    to     get   Dr.\n\nMartinez to concede that he knew of studies indicating that airbag\n\ndeployment at a BEV of less than 15 causes more injuries than it\n\nprevents;    Dr. Martinez responded that he had no knowledge of such\n\nstudies.    No such studies were introduced.      Dr. Martinez's overall\nconclusion was that, even at accidents with a BEV of 14 and less,\n\nthe airbag \"does more good than harm.\"\n\nB. Testimony of Dr. Benedict\n\n            Dr. James Benedict, an expert in the response of the\n\nhuman body to acceleration and impact forces, such as in accidents,\n\nalso testified.     Specifically, he is an expert in biomechanical\n\nanalysis,    occupant   kinematics,   injury     causation,    and    airbag\n\nperformance.      Although the defense retained Dr. Benedict, the\n\nplaintiff called him as a witness and presented his testimony.             He\n\ntestified that Reyes-Quintana's arm injuries were consistent with\n\nimpact with the deploying passenger airbag.        He estimated that her\n\nforearm was one to three inches from the dashboard at the time of\n\nthe injury, based on the fact that forearm fractures rarely occur\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fwhen the arm is three or more inches away from the airbag.                 He also\n\ntestified that even if the airbag had not deployed, Reyes-Quintana\n\ncould have received the same fractures in her forearm.\n\n           According to Dr. Benedict's testimony, the airbag deploys\n\nwhen sensors in the car detect a change in acceleration level; the\n\nairbag is essentially \"predictive in nature,\" in that it must\n\npredict the severity of the collision based on the initial change\n\nin acceleration.    The airbag deploys in about one-fourth of the\n\ntime it takes to blink an eye.        Dr. Benedict testified that he knew\n\nof no way for an airbag to deploy more slowly and still provide the\nrequired   protection.        As   for    the    Hyundai   involved    in    this\n\nparticular accident, Dr. Benedict testified that the airbag was\ndesigned   to   deploy   in   every      accident   with   a   BEV    of    12   or\nhigher(which he referred to as the \"must fire\" level), but because\n\nof variances in vehicle tolerances, could deploy at a BEV of as low\n\nas 8.9.    He agreed that in any car in America in 1996, the airbag\n\nwould deploy during a crash with a BEV of 15.\n           Like Dr. Martinez, Dr. Benedict testified that he would\nclassify an accident occurring at zero to 14 or 15 Delta V as a low\nseverity accident; an accident occurring at 15 to 25 Delta V as a\n\nmoderate severity accident; an accident occurring at 25 to 35 Delta\n\nV as a severe accident; and any accident over 35 Delta V as very\n\nsevere.    He   testified     that       these    are   \"ranges,\"      and       the\n\ncategorization may vary from expert to expert.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          Dr. Benedict testified that the effects of a crash with\n\na BEV of 15 could vary.    Some occupants will emerge from such an\n\naccident with minor or moderate injuries, referred to as \"AIS-I\" or\n\"AIS-II\" injuries, in reference to the Abbreviated Injury Scale\n\nsystem for categorizing the severity of injuries.    Perhaps as many\n\nas half of those involved in such crashes would walk away from the\naccident with no injuries.      An unbelted individual without an\n\nairbag in the type of crash experienced by Reyes-Quintana, however,\n\ncould hit and shatter the windshield, sustaining facial bone\n\nfractures, lacerations to the face, and perhaps neck injuries.\n\nDeath could even result.     Accidents with a Delta V of 15 account\n\nfor twenty percent of all AIS-III or greater injuries.       AIS-III\n\ninjuries are severe, serious or critical, including injuries such\nas contusions to the lung or a penetrating injury to the skull, and\n\nmay pose a threat to life.\n\n          Dr. Benedict acknowledged that there have been injuries\n\nand some deaths caused by deployment of airbags.    At the same time,\n\nover six thousand lives had been saved by the presence of airbags.\nHe characterized this as a \"trade-off.\"       Airbags are meant to\nprotect the primary systems that keep people alive: the head, neck,\n\nspine, chest, heart, and lungs.    Airbag systems are most effective\nin preventing these head, neck, and chest injuries, although they\nmay increase the risk of less severe injuries in some crashes.\n\n          As he had with Dr. Martinez, the plaintiff's counsel\nattempted to get Dr. Benedict to admit that reports had concluded\n\nthat, in low severity crashes, occupants are more likely to be\n\n                                  -8-\n\finjured by the airbag than by the accident itself.       Dr. Benedict\n\nresponded that he knew of one study concerning driver's side\nairbags, but denied that he knew of any such conclusion.       At no\npoint did any expert testify that such a conclusion would be\n\naccurate.\n            The plaintiff's counsel attempted to focus Dr. Benedict's\n\ntestimony specifically on a belted passenger's risk of injuries.\n\nOn examination by the plaintiff, Dr. Benedict testified that \"you\ncan have significant injury in Delta Vs of 15, 14, 13,\" even when\n\nwearing a seat belt, although he conceded that \"it's less likely\n\nwearing a seat belt\" and the \"probability of the head hitting\nsomething [when a passenger is wearing a seat belt] is low.\"\nAccording to Dr. Benedict, however, federal law requires that\n\nairbags be designed to protect unrestrained passengers as well as\n\nrestrained passengers.\n            Quintana-Ruiz offered no evidence to contradict any of\n\nthe evidence described.\n\nC. Proceedings After Close of Evidence\n\n            After all the evidence had been introduced, Hyundai moved\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law.       The district court granted the\nmotion on the plaintiff's failure to warn claim,2 but denied it on\n\nthe plaintiff's design defect claim.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          The judge held that federal law preempted any failure to\nwarn claim, because the federal regulations specify what warnings\nmanufacturers must provide.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          In closing, the plaintiff's attorney argued that the\n\n\"only question\" for the jury was \"whether the damages suffered by\nInes [Reyes-Quintana] would have been less had the airbag not been\nin the car or not deployed in the car.\"   He argued that the Delta\n\nV was around 15 and the BEV was in the 12 to 14 range, classifying\nthe accident as a \"minor collision,\"3 and that there should not be\nairbag deployment \"at these speeds.\" In referring to Dr. Martinez,\nthe plaintiff's attorney specifically said \"believe him on just\nabout everything.\"   With regard to Dr. Benedict, the plaintiff's\nattorney said that \"he knew what the truth was.   He was an honest\n\nman.\"\n\n          The judge instructed the jury, in relevant part, that:\n\n          Because a manufacturer of a product is not the insurer of\n          all the damages its product may cause, you must weigh the\n          evidence according to the following legal theories:\n          Under the doctrine of product liability, a plaintiff may\n          bring an action against a manufacturer who defectively\n          designed a product, or in the alternative, failed to\n          provide instructions or warnings.\n                 Under the design theory, a plaintiff must\n          establish that, first, the product failed to perform as\n          safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in\n          an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner; or the\n          product's design is the proximate cause of the\n          plaintiff's injury and the defendant failed to establish,\n          in light of the relevant factors, that, on balance, the\n          benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of\n          danger inherent in such a design. . . .\n\n          . . . If you find that the benefits surpass the risks,\n          then the defendants are not liable under this theory.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          There was no evidence that the BEV could have been as low\nas 12. The expert testimony was that the BEV was \"14 to 16, or\nmaybe thirteen and change.\" The experts classified this accident\nas a \"moderate\" severity accident.\n\n                               -10-\n\f                  On the other hand, if you find that the benefits\n           do not surpass the risks, then you find for the\n           plaintiffs.\n           After deliberations, the jury found for the plaintiff,\nand also found that the plaintiff bore no share of the comparative\n\nfault.   The jury awarded $400,000 to Ines Reyes-Quintana (who had\nsued through her mother, plaintiff Quintana-Ruiz) and $150,000 in\nemotional distress damages to Reyes-Quintana's mother, plaintiff\nQuintana-Ruiz.\n           Hyundai again moved for judgment as a matter of law or,\nin the alternative, a new trial or remittitur of damages.             The\n\ntrial court denied the motions for judgment as a matter of law, but\n\nfound the damages to be excessive and ordered a new trial unless\n\nthe plaintiff accepted a remittitur to $90,000 of the emotional\ndistress   damages    awarded   to   Quintana-Ruiz,   the   mother.   The\n\ndistrict court did not order remittitur of the $400,000 award to\n\nReyes-Quintana.      Quintana Ruiz v. Hyundai Motor Co., No. 98-1858\n\n(D.P.R. Mar. 12, 2001).     In denying the motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law, the district court held that there was sufficient\nevidence for the jury to conclude \"that the deployment of the\n\nairbag in an accident of this type was unwarranted given the risks\nposed by the high speed at which the airbag deploys\" or that, given\n\nthe evidence that airbags are designed to protect the upper body\nareas, \"the jury may have reasonably found that the risk posed to\nother parts of the body, like plaintiff's arm, were too high and\n\nthat the overall design was defective.\"       Id., slip op. at 6.     The\ndistrict court further reasoned that, even if all the experts\n\n                                     -11-\n\ftestified that the utility of the airbag design outweighed the\n\nrisk, \"there was testimony from which the jury could have found\n\nthat defendant's experts' testimony was biased and unreliable.\" Id.\n\nThe judge also found that Hyundai had forfeited any claim of error\n\nregarding   the   consumer    expectation   test   by   not   specifically\n\nobjecting to its inclusion in the jury instructions, and that,\n\nregardless, the fleeting reference to consumer expectations in the\n\njury instructions was harmless error.4       Id. at 9.\n\n                                  III.\n\n            On appeal, Hyundai argues that there is insufficient\nevidence, as a matter of law, to support the jury verdict.              We\nreview the district court's denial of judgment as a matter of law\n\nde novo, reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\njury verdict to determine if the verdict is supported by the\nevidence.   See Rodowicz v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 279 F.3d 36,\n\n41-42 (1st Cir. 2002).       \"We assume the veracity, however, of any\n\nadmissions made and stipulations entered into by the party opposing\n\nthe Rule 50 motion, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b), as well as any\n\nevidence derived from disinterested witnesses that has not been\ncontradicted or impeached.\"      Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of P.R.\n\nBottling Co., 152 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nA. Evidence of Design Defect\n\n\n     4\n          Hyundai had specifically opposed the consumer expectation\ntheory in its pre-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law,\narguing that \"the ordinary consumer has no knowledge or expectation\nas to how an airbag could or should perform\" and therefore it is\nnot a proper theory for a defect claim based on an airbag's design.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f            Under Puerto Rican tort law governing design defect\n\nclaims, if the plaintiff proves that \"the product's design is the\nproximate cause of the damage,\" the burden shifts to the defendant\nto prove that \"the benefits of the design at issue outweigh the\n\nrisk of danger inherent in such a design.\"            Aponte Rivera v.

Ford Motor Co., 407 N.W.2d 92, 95-96 (Minn. 1987) (same);\nWilson v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 579 P.2d 1287, 1287-88 (Ore. 1978)\n\n(same); Ray v. Bic Corp., 925 S.W.2d 527, 532-33 (Tenn. 1996)\n\n(same), with Keogh v. W.R. Grasle, Inc., 816 P.2d 1343, 1346 (Ala.\n\n1991) (following Barker); Ontai v. Straub Clinic & Hosp. Inc., 659\nP.2d 734, 739-40 (Haw. 1983) (same). The rationale articulated for\n\nthis burden shifting is that \"most of the evidentiary matters which\n\nmay be relevant to the determination of the adequacy of a product's\n\ndesign under the 'risk-benefit' standard e.g., the feasibility and\n\ncost of    alternative    designs    .   .   .   involve   technical    matters\n\npeculiarly within the knowledge of the manufacturer.\"             Barker, 573\n\nP.2d at 455.        The goal of the Barker rule, therefore, was to\n\n                                     -13-\n\f\"lighten the plaintiff's burden\" in proving a design defect, id. at\n456, not to radically expand the scope of products considered\ndefective by design.\n             In this case, the defendant concedes that the plaintiff\n\nhas    met   her   burden   of    establishing   that    the    airbag    was       the\nproximate cause of Reyes-Quintana's injuries.                  The question is\nwhether the defendant has met its burden of showing that the\nbenefits accruing from the airbag's design outweigh the risks.\n             The defect claimed in this case is that the airbag was\ndesigned to deploy at a BEV of 14, the BEV level of the crash in\n\nthis case.     Both parties agree that the airbag operated exactly as\n\nit was intended and that the challenged design aspect was a\n\nconscious design decision, rather than an unforeseen consequence\n(for    instance,    a   premature    or    unexpected      deployment)       of    the\n\nairbag's     design.        Cf.   Collazo-Santiago,      149    F.3d     at    25-26\n\n(challenged design aspect involved whether airbag could have been\nbetter designed to minimize injuries when it did deploy).\n\n             In    Collazo-Santiago,       another   case    from   Puerto         Rico\n\ninvolving a design defect claim based on airbag-related injuries,\nwe noted that \"[a]s identified in Barker, factors to be considered\n\nby the jury\" in evaluating whether the defendant has met its burden\n\nof establishing that the design benefits outweighed its risks\n\ninclude:\n             the gravity of the danger posed by the challenged design,\n             the likelihood that such a danger would occur, the\n             mechanical feasibility of a safer alternative design, the\n             financial cost of an improved design, and the adverse\n             consequences to the product and to the consumer that\n             would result from an alternative design.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fId. at 25 (quoting Barker, 573 P.2d at 455).                    The Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court has also quoted this language approvingly.                   Rivera\n\nSantana, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830 n.9.\n\n1.   Risk Utility Balancing\n\n             There is little guidance from the Puerto Rico Supreme\nCourt on how the risk-utility test should be applied.                    The case\n\nthat first adopted the rule, Rivera Santana, 1992 P.R.-Eng 754830,\n\nwas resolved on another ground -- the manufacturer's failure to\nwarn   of    the   inherently    dangerous     nature    of    the   product.   A\n\nsubsequent case reiterating the risk-utility rule, Aponte Rivera,\n\n1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486, was also resolved on a failure to warn\ntheory.\n             The plaintiff's attorney argued in his closing that the\n\nquestion was \"whether the damages suffered by Ines [Reyes-Quintana]\n\nwould have been less had the air bag not been in the car or not\ndeployed in the car.\"        That, however, is not the correct question\n\nin a design defect case.          The question posed by the plaintiff's\n\nattorney unfairly stacks the deck in the risk-utility equation --\nwhen   the    question      is   based    on    the   plaintiff's      particular\n\ncircumstances, the \"risk\" of injury is 100%, as the plaintiff in\nquestion has by definition been injured, and therefore the risk\n\nwill   almost      always   outweigh     the   utility   for    that   particular\n\nplaintiff in that particular instance.                   Similarly, the trial\n\ncourt's conclusion that, given the evidence that airbags are\n\ndesigned to protect the upper body areas, \"the jury may have\n\nreasonably found that the risk posed to other parts of the body,\n\n                                       -15-\n\flike plaintiff's arm, were too high and that the overall design was\n\ndefective,\" Quintana Ruiz, slip op. at 6, misstates the test.       The\nissue is not whether the design posed too great a risk to the\npassenger's arm, or any one specific body part.\n\n          Instead,   the   question    for   the   jury   was   whether,\ngenerally, the benefits imposed by the airbag's challenged design\naspect (here, the fact that the passenger side airbag deploys in\naccidents with a BEV in the range of 14 to 16) outweigh its risks.\nIn this inquiry, the jury should have considered the risk and\nutility to unbelted passengers, as well as the risk to belted\n\npassengers.   The evidence was that unbelted passengers receive a\n\nconsiderable utility from airbags in such accidents, as, absent the\n\nairbag, there is a substantial risk of severe facial, head and\nspinal injuries.5\n\n           There was much evidence presented at trial on the risks\n\nposed by, and the utility created by, airbag deployment at a BEV of\n14.   The uncontradicted evidence was that the benefits outweighed\n\nthe risks.    No expert testified that the risk of harm posed to\n\npassengers by airbags in accidents with a BEV of 14 exceeded the\nbenefits of airbags deploying in those types of crashes.        In fact,\n\nboth Dr. Martinez and Dr. Benedict testified that they knew of no\n\nstudies coming to such a conclusion.         Dr. Martinez specifically\n\n\n\n      5\n          Reyes-Quintana herself admitted that, until just prior to\nthe accident, she was not wearing her seatbelt. Had the accident\noccurred at an earlier point in the evening, when she was not\nbelted, she would have benefitted tremendously from the airbag\ndeployment.\n\n                                -16-\n\ftestified that, at accidents with a BEV of 14 and under, the airbag\n\n\"does more good than harm.\"         The evidence was that airbags are\n\ndesigned    to   prevent   the   most   serious   types   of   injuries   and\n\ntherefore to preserve lives, although the cost of preserving these\n\nlives may be an increased risk of injuries of a less serious\n\nvariety in some crashes.\n\n            The plaintiff's argument that these serious injuries do\n\nnot occur in the type of accident she had was not supported by the\n\nevidence.    The evidence was that 20% of all AIS-III injuries occur\n\nat a Delta V of 15 or below -- therefore, a significant percentage\n\nof serious injuries are the result of these \"moderate\" severity\n\naccidents.       Reyes-Quintana had the benefit of the protection\nagainst these types of injuries afforded by the airbag.             She did\nnot suffer any head, face or brain injuries, precisely the types of\n\ninjuries an airbag protects against in an accident with a Delta V\nof 15.\n            Much of the plaintiff’s examination of Dr. Benedict\n\nconcerned whether the airbag would deploy at a BEV of 8.9, and with\nthe fact that Hyundai does not warn consumers that airbags may\ncause serious bodily injury.       Neither of those topics was material\n\nto the risk-utility questions before the jury.            It was undisputed\nthat the BEV (and Delta V) were well above 8.9 (and therefore a\ndesign choice to make the airbag deploy at a BEV of 8.9 could not\n\nbe a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries).             And, because\nthe matter of labels is so extensively regulated by federal law,\n\nthere was no viable claim for failure to warn.\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f                 Many   products,    like      airbags,     involve   a   \"trade      off\"\n\nbetween the benefits offered to the consumer and the risk created\n\nby the product.           The risk-utility balancing test is designed to\navoid converting the manufacturer into the insurer of every harm\n\nthat arises out of a product from which the consumer derives\n\nutility.         The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has emphasized that \"[t]he\nmanufacturer . . . is not the insurer of every damage his products\n\nmay cause.\"           Aponte Rivera, 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486; accord Rivera\n\nSantana, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830 (same language) (quoting Mendoza v.\n\nCerveceria Corona, Inc., 977 P.R.R. 487, 499 (1969)); see also\n\nBarker, 573 P.2d at 456 (noting that this test \"stop[s] short of\n\nmaking the manufacturer an insurer for all injuries which may\n\nresult from the use of its product\").                 The plaintiff is entitled to\ncompensation only if the challenged design aspect does more harm\n\nthan good, overall, for the consumer.\n\n2. Alternative Design\n\n                 An   important    part   of    the    risk-utility       test   is    the\n\nquestion         of   whether    there    is    a   mechanically      feasible     safer\n\nalternative design.6            See Barker, 573 P.2d at 455; Rivera Santana,\n\n1992 P.R.-Eng. 75830 n.9.\n\n                 There are at least three views of how the existence, or\n\nnon-existence, of a mechanically feasible alternative design fits\n\ninto       the    risk-utility      balancing       test:    1)   a   showing    of     an\n\nalternative design is the sine qua non of a design defect claim,\n\n\n       6\n          The trial court's instructions to the jury did not\ninclude instructions on alternative design. Neither party objected\nto this omission.\n\n                                            -18-\n\fmeaning that a plaintiff cannot prevail even if the risk exceeds\n\nthe utility unless there is a showing of alternative design, see J.\n\nHenderson Jr. & A. Twerski, Achieving Consensus on Defective\n\nProduct Design, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 867, 883-84 (1998); 2) the\n\nplaintiff cannot prevail if there is no showing of a feasible\n\nalternative design, unless the risk so far outweighs the utility\nthat no reasonable person would market the product, see id.;\n\nRestatement (Third) of Torts: Product Liability, § 2 cmt. b (1998)\n\n(\"[P]roduct sellers may be subject to liability even absent a\n\nreasonable alternative design when the product design is manifestly\n\nunreasonable.\"); and 3) it is not necessary to show the existence\n\nof an alternative design if the risk outweighs the utility, but if\n\nthe actual utility exceeds the actual risk, then the plaintiff may\nstill prevail if there is a showing of a feasible alternate design\n\nthat would achieve the same utility with a lesser degree of risk,7\n\nsee Prosser & Keeton on Torts, § 99 at 699 (W. Keeton et al. eds.,\n\n5th ed. 1984).        It is not clear what view the Puerto Rico courts\n\nwould      follow,    but   none   of   the    three   approaches   assists   the\n\nplaintiff.        As discussed above, the evidence shows that the actual\nutility of an airbag deploying at a BEV of 14 outweighs the actual\n\nrisk posed by such an airbag.                 Therefore, even under the third\n\nview       of   alternate   design   (the     most   plaintiff-friendly   view),\n\n\n\n\n       7\n          This approach has been criticized as limiting market\nchoice -- a fully-informed consumer may wish to have the option of\na design that has a slightly higher risk level than another design,\nbut has the advantage in other areas, such as aesthetics.       See\nHenderson & Twerski, supra, at 886.\n\n                                        -19-\n\fQuintana-Ruiz cannot prevail unless there is a feasible alternative\n\ndesign.\n\n                Even taking this third view, it is well-established that\nthe inquiry into the \"mechanical feasibility\" of an alternative\n\ndesign must        be     determined    based   on    the   universe   of   existing\n\ntechnology at the time of manufacture and design (or possibly the\ntime       of   sale),8    not   some    future      development   leading    to   a\n\npotentially feasible possibility.               See Prosser & Keeton on Torts,\n\nsupra, § 99, at 701 (\"The courts have almost universally held that\n\nthe feasibility of designing a safer product must be determined as\n\nof the time the product was designed.\");9 Restatement (Third) of\n\n\n       8\n          The Puerto Rico courts have not resolved the issue of\nwhether the alternative design must be feasible at the time of the\nproduct's design and manufacture, or at the time of the product's\nsale. The Restatement (Third) and Prosser and Keeton on Torts, as\ncited above, take divergent approaches. There are competing policy\ninterests -- on the one hand is the possibility that a manufacturer\nmay continue to sell an outmoded design long after a safer\nalternative becomes feasible, while on the other hand is the\nabsolutely inevitable lag time between when a product is designed\nand when it is sold and the fact that technology may develop during\nthat lag time. There is no need to resolve this question here, as\nit makes no difference for the plaintiff's case.      There was no\nshowing of any feasible safer alternative design at the time of the\nairbag's design or at the time the car was sold.\n       9\n                Prosser and Keeton on Torts also says that:\n\n       An alternative design that was not utilized is to be\n       considered as feasible when a reasonable person would conclude\n       that the (1) magnitude of the danger-in-fact that could have\n       been avoided by such alternative design in the (2) utilization\n       of the scientific technological know-how reasonably available\n       to the defendant outweighed the (1) financial cost of guarding\n       against such avoidable danger, (2) the impairment of the\n       benefits, and (3) any new danger-in-fact that would have been\n       created by the alternative design.\n\nProsser and Keeton on Torts, supra,               § 99, at 700.\n\n                                         -20-\n\fTorts: Product Liability, supra, § 2 cmt. f (\"[Q]ualified expert\n\ntestimony   on    the   issue   suffices,   even    though   the   expert   has\n\nproduced no prototype, if it reasonably supports the conclusion\nthat a reasonable alternative design could have been practically\n\nadopted at the time of sale.\").\n\n            California courts as well have accepted the principle\nthat feasibility is determined in light of the technology extant at\n\nthe relevant time.      See Brown v. Superior Court, 751 P.2d 470, 478\n\n(Cal. 1988) (\"Barker contemplates a safer alternative design is\n\npossible . . . .\"); cf. Buccery v. Gen. Motors Corp., 60 Cal. App.\n\n3d 533, 547 (1976) (\"[A]ny product so designed that it causes\n\ninjury when used or misused in a foreseeable fashion is defective\n\nif the design feature which caused the injury created a danger\nwhich was readily preventable through the employment of existing\n\ntechnology at a cost consonant with the economical use of the\n\nproduct.\").      In Aguayo v. Crompton & Knowles Corp., 183 Cal. App.\n\n3d 1032 (1986), the plaintiff attempted to introduce evidence that\n\nthe defendant's successor had instituted a safer alternative design\n\nin subsequent versions of the product.             The appeals court upheld\nthe district court's ruling excluding the evidence.                Noting that\n\nwhile \"[p]laintiff's experts had described how this alternate\n\nsafety system would operate using technology available at the time\n\nof manufacture [of the original machine]\" which \"does have a\n\ntendency to show it is feasible,\" the plaintiff's \"offer of proof\n\nomitted facts that would show that the knowledge and technology\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fused to manufacture and design the [original] machine was the same\n\nused to produce the [proffered] machine.\"            Id. at 1038-39.\n\n          In    light   of   this,   the    Barker    burden-shifting   rule\npotentially puts defendants in an impossible situation with regard\n\nto alternative designs -- that of trying to prove a negative (that\nthere is no alternative design that was feasible at the relevant\ntime that would not cause greater risk).             Barker itself, and the\n\nPuerto Rico cases adopting it, say only that the burden lies with\nthe defendant of proving that the overall utility exceeds the\noverall risk, not that the burden is on the defendant to prove the\n\nimpossible.10   The courts of Puerto Rico will ultimately have to\n\nsort through the precise role played by evidence of alternative\n\ndesign.\n          In this case, no expert presented any evidence that there\n\nwas any alternative design that would have posed less of a risk to\n\npassengers while still providing the same level of protection.            In\nfact, the expert testimony was just the opposite.                 The only\n\nalternative design suggested by the plaintiff was an airbag with a\n\nhigher deployment level (presumably a deployment level at a BEV\ngreater than 16, given that the expert testimony placed the BEV of\n\n     10\n           In some instances, the plaintiff may bear some degree of\nburden -- whether of production or of proof -- with regard to the\nsubsidiary issue of alternative design.       For instance, it is\nconceivable that once the defendant proves that the design's actual\nutility exceeds actual risk, the burden may shift back to the\nplaintiff to prove that an alternative design exists that would\nmake liability possible. Or alternatively, the plaintiff may bear\na burden of production with regard to an alternative design,\nthereby giving the defendant something to prove or disprove. For\npurposes of this case, it is not necessary for us to clarify these\ngray areas.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fthis   accident   at   between   14    and   16).      The    expert   testimony\n\neffectively refuted this as a feasible alternative that would\n\ndecrease overall risk to passengers.              \"[F]easibility [is] not the\n\nsole issue, for another relevant consideration [is] whether an\n\nalternative design of the car, while averting the particular [harm\nhere], would have created a greater risk of injury in other . . .\n\nsituations.\"      Barker,   573       P.2d   at    456.      Expert    testimony\n\nestablished that a deployment trigger above a BEV of 12 would leave\n\nmany individuals unprotected from serious injuries of AIS-III and\n\nhigher.\n           Further, Dr. Benedict testified that airbags cannot be\ndesigned to trigger at one specific BEV level.               Rather, because of\n\nvariations in cars, any one design will result in a range of\ndeployment levels.      If a designer wants an airbag to definitely\ndeploy at a BEV of 12 (what Dr. Benedict referred to as a \"must\n\nfire\" level), the airbag will sometimes deploy at as low as a BEV\nof 8.9.    The plaintiff's suggestion in closing arguments that\nHyundai should have designed a bag that would deploy at a BEV of 16\n\nand above, but never at a BEV of 14 or 15, is inconsistent with the\nevidence presented at trial on mechanical feasibility.\n\n           In addition, federal regulations governing the design of\n\nairbags must factor into the jury's consideration of whether there\n\nis any feasible alternative design.           The National Highway Traffic\n\nSafety Administration has mandated that airbags be designed to\n\nprotect unbelted occupants, as well as belted occupants. 49 C.F.R.\n\n§ 571.208, S5.1 (2001).           This evidence was before the jury.\n\n                                      -23-\n\fAlthough,    \"states   may   impose   liability   under   their   products\n\nliability statutes even if the manufacturer or seller meets the\nminimum federal standards,\" Rivera-Santana, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830,\n\nan alternative design cannot be considered feasible if it would\n\nrequire the manufacturer to run afoul of federal standards.             In\nfact, a state law claim that attempts to impose requirements that\nconflict with the federal standards would most likely be preempted\nby federal law.    See Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861,\n\n871 (2000); Wood v. Gen. Motors Co., 865 F.2d 395, 408-10 (1st Cir.\n1988).\n\n            On our review of the evidence, no rational jury could\n\nhave concluded on these facts that the risks of the airbag design\n\noutweighed the benefits.\nB.   Expert Testimony\n\n            The district court alternatively upheld the jury verdict\n\non the basis that the defendant bore the burden of proof and that\nthe jury was free to reject the defendant's experts' testimony as\n\nbiased.     The only \"bias\" was that Hyundai paid the experts'\n\nconsulting fees (including compensation for time spent testifying),\n\nand that both experts primarily, although not exclusively, work for\n\nthe defense side in such cases.\n\n            Under the burden-shifting rule as stated by Puerto Rico\n\n(albeit without consideration of the factors discussed here), a\nplaintiff need not present any evidence regarding the risk or\n\nutility of the product, or even regarding the design of the\n\nproduct.    Aponte Rivera, 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486 n.9; Rivera Santana\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fv. Superior Packaging, Inc., 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830. From this, the\n\nplaintiff argues that when a plaintiff does not present her own\nexpert testimony and convinces the jury to disregard the defense\nexperts' testimony, a plaintiff can prevail on her design defect\n\nclaim simply by showing that the product caused her injury.\n           The district court thought its alternative ground was\n\ncompelled by Collazo-Santiago, 149 F.3d 23.               See Quintana Ruiz,\n\nslip op. at 6 & n.17.    For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n           Collazo-Santiago was also an airbag design defect case\n\nunder the Puerto Rico burden-shifting rule, in which this court\n\nupheld a jury verdict for the plaintiff where the jury, in a\nparticular context, rejected the defense expert's testimony.                The\nplaintiff has argued that Collazo-Santiago established a flat rule\n\nthat a jury may reject the testimony of an expert witness on a\n\nsubject requiring expert testimony solely on the basis of the\njury's conclusion that the expert is biased in a case where the\n\ndefendant, as a matter of law, bears the burden of proof on the\n\nissue.    We describe the law in this area and apply it in the\ncontext of the case where the burden of proof is put on the party\n\nwhose expert's testimony is rejected.\n           The question on appeal is whether there was sufficient\n\nevidence to justify the jury's rejection of the expert's testimony\non grounds of bias.     A jury is not \"at liberty, under the guise of\npassing upon   the    credibility    of    a   witness,    to   disregard   his\n\ntestimony, when from no reasonable point of view is it open to\ndoubt.\"   Chesapeake & O. Ry. Co. v. Martin, 283 U.S. 209, 216\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f(1931); see also Sonnentheil v. Christian Moerlein Brewing Co., 172\nU.S. 401, 408 (1899); Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. Ry. Co. v.\nHowell, 401 F.2d 752, 754 (10th Cir. 1968) (\"The fundamental rule\n\nwhich makes the jury the sole judge of the weight and credibility\n\nof testimony is subject to the caveat that testimony concerning a\nsimple fact, capable of contradiction, not incredible, and standing\nuncontradicted, unimpeached, or in no way discredited by cross-\nexamination, must be permitted to stand.\").            See generally C.\n\nWright & A. Miller, 9A Federal Practice and Procedure § 2527, at\n286 (1995).\n\n           In Chesapeake & O. Ry. Co., the Supreme Court reversed a\n\njury verdict based on the jury's rejection of a witness's testimony\n\nwhere\n           A reading of [the testimony] discloses no lack of candor\n           on [the witness's] part. It was not shaken by cross-\n           examination . . . . Its accuracy was not controverted by\n           proof or circumstances, directly or inferentially; and it\n           is difficult to see why, if inaccurate, it readily could\n           not have been shown to be so.       The witness was not\n           impeached; and there is nothing in the record which\n           reflects unfavorably upon his credibility.\n283 U.S. at 216.       The only possible basis for questioning the\nwitness's credibility in Chesapeake & O. Ry. was that he was an\n\nemployee   of   the   defendant.     This,   the   Court   held,   was   not\n\nsufficient evidence to support a jury verdict based solely on the\nrejection of his testimony.        Id.\n\n           This rule accords with the standard for reviewing grants\n\nor denials of judgments as a matter of law, where generally we\naccept as true \"any evidence derived from disinterested witnesses\n\nthat has not been contradicted or impeached,\" Alvarez-Fonseca, 152\n\n                                    -26-\n\fF.3d at 23. Cf. Kasper v. St. Mary of Nazareth Hosp., 135 F.3d\n\n1170, 1173 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"When a case turns on credibility,\nneither side is entitled to judgment as a matter of law unless\nobjective evidence shows that it would be unreasonable to believe\n\na critical witness for one side.\").\n          Generally, a jury may not reject testimony that is\nuncontradicted and unimpeached (directly, circumstantially, or\ninferentially) unless credibility is at issue,11 as \"[c]redibility\ndeterminations are uniquely within the jury's province.\"    United\n\nStates v. Calderon, 77 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1996).     Juries, for\n\ninstance, may reject uncontradicted, unimpeached testimony when it\n\nis improbable, inherently contradictory, riddled with omissions, or\n\ndelivered in a manner giving rise to doubts.    See Quock Ting v.\nUnited States, 140 U.S. 417, 420-21 (1891).   There must otherwise\n\n\n\n     11\n          Wright and Miller characterize the Second Circuit as\ndisagreeing with the rule that juries may not reject uncontradicted\nand unimpeached evidence from disinterested witnesses. Wright &\nMiller, supra, at 286. The Second Circuit has expressed the view\nthat juries should be able to reject even uncontradicted evidence\nbecause \"the liar's story may seem uncontradicted to one who merely\nreads it, but it may be 'contradicted' in the trial court by his\nmanner, his intonations, [and] his grimaces.\" Broad. Music, Inc.\nv. Havana Madrid Rest. Corp., 175 F.2d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 1949); see\nalso Purcell v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 221 F.2d 953, 954 (2d Cir.\n1955) (per curiam) (noting that \"there is no rule that the\ntestimony of witnesses must be accepted if they are not\ncontradicted and if their credibility is not impeached\" because the\nwitness's testimony may be \"of no probative weight at all because\nof his address, his bearing and his apparent lack of\nintelligence.\"). Even were we to view this case through that lens,\nthese concerns are directed at cases where credibility is at issue,\nwhich is not the case here.     There was no evidence, direct or\ncircumstantial, to suggest that the witnesses' credibility was in\ndoubt, and the plaintiff's counsel vouched for the credibility of\nthe experts.\n\n                               -27-\n\fbe some affirmative evidence in the record to put the witness's\n\ncredibility in doubt.           See Wright & Miller, supra, at 288.\n             The Supreme Court's seminal opinion in Sonnentheil v.\n\nChristian Moerlein Brewing Co., 172 U.S. 401 (1899), is helpful in\n\nsketching the contours of this rule. Sonnentheil is usually quoted\nas holding that \"the mere fact that the witness is interested in\nthe    result   of    the     suit   is   deemed   sufficient       to   require   the\ncredibility of his testimony to be submitted to the jury as a\nquestion of fact.\"          Id. at 408.       This rule must be understood in\ncontext.     The central issue in Sonnentheil was whether creditors\n\nwere guilty, or aware, of fraud in the making of a deed.                      Id. at\n\n409.     The uncontradicted testimony at issue was provided by the\n\ncreditors themselves, who quite obviously had a personal interest\nin the outcome of the case.               The Court observed that fraud cases\n\nare    uniquely      within    the   province      of   the   jury's     credibility\n\ndeterminations, as \"[p]arties contemplating a fraud frequently\npursue . . . devious courses to conceal their designs.\"                       Id. at\n\n410.    Finally, the Court noted that there was much circumstantial\n\nevidence that \"there [was] a strong probability\" that the creditors\nwere aware of the fraud.             Id. at 413.        As a result, the Court,\n\nwhile noting that \"the jury had no right to arbitrarily disregard\n\nthe    positive       testimony      of     unimpeached       and    uncontradicted\n\nwitnesses,\" held that \"[u]nder the peculiar circumstances of this\ncase, it was not error to submit [the question of fraud] to the\n\njury.\"     Id. at 408, 414.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\f             In this case, there is no such evidence as would support\n\na   jury's   rejection    of   the    experts'     testimony.         The    experts,\nalthough     paid   by   the   defendants     on   an   hourly      basis,    had   no\nfinancial or personal interest in the outcome of the case.                     Nor is\n\nthere a claim of fraud on the part of the expert witnesses.                         The\nonly \"bias\" is in their retention by the defense.                   In    Chesapeake\n\n& O. Ry., the Supreme Court held that the fact that the witness was\nan employee of the defendant was not a sufficient basis for the\njury to reject his testimony.               283 U.S. at 216.                Here, the\nwitnesses were paid outside experts, a much weaker basis on which\n\nto find their testimony lacked credibility. There was no evidence,\n\ncircumstantial or direct, tending to show that they were not\n\ncredible     witnesses.         The    testimony        was    not       improbable,\ninconsistent, or otherwise facially unbelievable.                   In short, there\n\nis nothing in the record to support the jury's rejection of the\n\nexperts' testimony.\n             The general rule that a jury verdict cannot be based\n\nsolely on the jury's rejection of the other side's uncontradicted\n\ntestimony applies with particular force to expert testimony on\nmatters outside of lay competence.             While juries may decide what\n\nweight to give to the testimony of expert witnesses, they are not\n\n\"at    liberty      to    disregard      arbitrarily          the        unequivocal,\n\nuncontradicted and unimpeached            testimony of an expert witness\nwhere . . . the testimony bears on technical questions . . . beyond\n\nthe competence of lay determination.\"               Webster v. Offshore Food\n\nServ., Inc., 434 F.2d 1191, 1193 (5th Cir. 1970) (internal citation\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fomitted); see also Bearman v. Prudential Ins. Co., 186 F.2d 662,\n\n665 (10th Cir. 1951) (same).           There is no doubt the subject matter\nhere required expert testimony.\n                 The idea that the jury could base a verdict simply on\n\nrejection of expert testimony here is also inconsistent with the\nrule that consumer expectations cannot be the basis of liability in\na case involving complex technical matters.                A jury in such a case\nmust rely         on   expert   testimony   and   cannot    substitute    its    own\nexperience.\n                 A consumer expectations theory was not available to the\n\nplaintiff here.12         \"Barker . . . made clear that when the ultimate\n\nissue       of   design   defect    calls   for   a   careful     assessment     of\n\nfeasibility, practicality, risk and benefit, the case should not be\nresolved simply on the basis of ordinary consumer expectations.\"\n\nSoule v. Gen. Motors Corp., 882 P.2d 298, 305 (Cal. 1994) (holding\n\nthat the consumer expectations test was not appropriate for a claim\nthat a car was defective because the wheel assembly detached in\n\naccident).          The   California   Supreme    Court    has   held   that    \"the\n\nconsumer expectations test is reserved for cases in which the\n\neveryday experience of the product's users permit a conclusion that\n\nthe product's designs violated minimum safety assumptions.\" Id. at\n\n308.    The court specifically observed that \"the ordinary consumer\n\n\n       12\n          The district court erroneously instructed the jury on the\nconsumer expectation theory. But Hyundai failed to object after\nthe instruction was given and therefore failed to preserve its\nobjection. See Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc., 289 F.3d 128, 133-34\n(1st Cir. 2002). Accordingly, our reversal of the jury verdict is\nnot based on this ground.\n\n                                        -30-\n\fof an automobile simply has 'no idea' how it should perform in all\n\nforeseeable situations, or how safe it should be made against all\nforeseeable hazards.\"       Id.    In one airbag design defect suit, a\nCalifornia appellate court held that:\n\n            The deployment of an air bag is, quite fortunately, not\n            part of the \"everyday experience\" of the consuming\n            public. Minimum safety standards for air bags are not\n            within the common knowledge of lay jurors. Jurors are in\n            need of expert testimony to evaluate the risks and\n            benefits of the challenged design. . . . [I]n designing\n            air bags there are tradeoffs involving complex technical\n            issues.\nPruitt v. Gen. Motors Corp., 72 Cal. App. 4th 1480, 1483-84 (Cal.\n\nApp. 1999).13\n\n            The Collazo-Santiago court found that \"the plaintiff\nadduced    sufficient   evidence     for    the     jury   to   find    that   the\n\ndefendant's expert was an interested witness.\" 149 F.3d at 28.\n\nThus, the decision rested not on an absolute rule but, rather, on\nan assessment of the weight of the relevant evidence.                   Collazo-\n\nSantiago    presents    a   litany   of     facts    casting    doubt    on    the\n\ndefendant's expert's credibility.           Collazo-Santiago differed from\nthis case in several ways.           The plaintiff in Collazo-Santiago\n\n\n     13\n          Another California appellate court, however, has held\nthat a consumer expectations theory was available in a design\ndefect case challenging the relative placement of the airbag and\nthe windshield. See Bresnahan v. Chrysler Corp., 32 Cal. App. 4th\n1559 (1995).    In general, the question of whether a consumer\nexpectation theory is available depends not on the challenged\nproduct itself, but on the complexity of the alleged defect;\n\"[f]or example, the ordinary consumers of modern automobiles may\nand do expect that such vehicles will be designed so as not to\nexplode while idling at stoplights, experience sudden steering or\nbrake failure as they leave the dealership, or roll over and catch\nfire in two-mile-per-hour collisions.\" Soule, 882 P.2d at 308 n.3.\n\n                                     -31-\n\fmarshaled extraordinary evidence of expert bias.      The expert not\n\nonly was being paid by the defendant, but had previously been\nemployed by the defendant as a design engineer.      At the time of\ntrial, the expert was earning the vast majority of his income by\n\ntestifying for that particular defendant or its affiliates and had,\nin fact, testified for them thirty-six times in the two year period\npreceding the trial.   Id. at 27-28.14\n\n           In contrast to Collazo-Santiago, this is not a case where\n\nthe veracity or the reliability of the expert testimony was in\ndoubt or the expert testimony did not cover a material point. In\n\nfact, the plaintiff emphasized the veracity and reliability of the\n\nexperts.     The plaintiff called Dr. Benedict as her own witness.\n\nIn referring to Dr. Martinez, the plaintiff's attorney specifically\nsaid, \"believe him on just about everything.\"     With regard to Dr.\n\nBenedict, the plaintiff's attorney said that \"he knew what the\n\ntruth was.    He was an honest man.\"     The fact that the defendant\npaid the experts' fees cannot alone establish bias to overcome\n\nplausible and uncontradicted evidence that the design benefits\n\noutweighed any risks. That is particularly so where the non-paying\nparty encourages the jury to accept both experts as credible.    The\n\ndefendant proffered reliable expert testimony that indicated that\n\nthe utility of the design outweighed the risk, and the jury could\n\nnot simply disregard such testimony.\n\n\n\n\n     14\n           We do not suggest that these facts conclusively establish\nbias.\n\n                                -32-\n\f                               IV.

Sears Roebuck de P.R., Inc.,</i> 144 P.R. Dec. 830, 840 n. 9, 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486 n. 9, 1998 WL 198857 (1998); <i>Barker v. Lull Eng'r Co.,</i> 20 Cal.3d 413, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443 (1978). The question here is whether a jury may find for a plaintiff, injured when her airbag properly deployed in an auto accident, when the evidence is that the overall utility of the design exceeds the overall risk, there is no evidence of the existence of an alternative safer design, and the jury verdict is based either on a misunderstanding of the law or solely on the jury's rejection of the testimony of the experts retained by the defendant. We hold that such a jury verdict is not sustainable. It effectively, in these circumstances, either converts the defendant to the status of an insurer or creates liability based on a consumer expectation theory. Since neither of these outcomes is permissible under Puerto Rican law, we reverse and direct entry of judgment for defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in the morning of August 10, 1996, Ines Reyes-Quintana, then fifteen years old, was returning from a party in a 1996 Hyundai Accent. Reyes-Quintana's brother was driving the car and Reyes-Quintana was in the front passenger's seat. The Hyundai was in the left lane of a two-lane road. A Nissan station wagon, traveling at a substantially slower speed, crossed from the right lane into the left lane, in front of the Hyundai. The Hyundai braked, leaving about 163 feet worth of skid marks on the road. The Hyundai then rear-ended the Nissan at a speed differential of about 30 miles per hour. The passenger-side airbag deployed, striking Reyes-Quintana's hand, which she had raised as if to brace herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The force of the airbag striking her arm fractured Reyes-Quintana's arm and wrist in four places. These were the only injuries Reyes-Quintana sustained in the accident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The fractures required three surgeries, including the permanent attachment of two metal plates and sixteen metal screws. Reyes-Quintana has also experienced some permanent loss of strength and scarring in that arm. The Hyundai sustained significant damage, estimated at over $11,300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. TRIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only two experts testified on the airbag's design. Both experts were retained by the defendant, Hyundai. The plaintiff also offered the testimony of a medical expert to establish Reyes-Quintana's injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A. Testimony of Dr. Martinez</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Jose Martinez, formerly of Texas A &amp; M University, testified as an accident reconstruction expert, providing the probable explanation of how the accident took place. He testified that the police reports showed 163 feet of braking marks before impact. Based on the damage sustained by the Hyundai, Dr. Martinez concluded that it was traveling thirty miles per hour faster than the Nissan at the point of impact. Based on this conclusion and the length of the skid marks, Dr. Martinez opined that the Hyundai had to be traveling at least 63 miles per hour before the driver began to brake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Martinez explained the mechanics of accident reconstruction, a short summary of which is necessary in order to understand the issues in this case. Barrier equivalent velocity, referred to as BEV, is the speed at which a vehicle goes into a barrier, measured in miles per hour. BEV is used for setting the deployment level for airbags, and it is the measurement used in the relevant federal regulations. Delta V, a related but not identical concept, is the change in velocity of a vehicle, usually at the center of gravity, also measured in miles per hour. Generally, accident reconstruction experts measure the Delta V of the car environment, rather than that of a specific occupant. In accidents involving impact into a barrier, the BEV is often slightly less than the Delta V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The higher the Delta V is, the more serious the injuries are likely to be. Conversely, the lower the Delta V, the less serious the injuries are likely to be. The majority of accidents occur in the 10 to 15 Delta V range. Generally, accidents with a Delta V under 15 are considered to be of lower severity. Middle severity accidents are in the 15 to 25 Delta V range; above 25 is considered high severity. Dr. Martinez testified that a BEV of 15 \"is where you start to get serious injuries, according to the statistics\" and that is \"where you want that air bag to go off.\" He also testified that even an accident referred to as \"low severity\" is not mild because, if you are unrestrained, such an accident can \"put your head in the windshield\" and cause serious injuries. Although he could not provide the specific percentiles of how many people would get hurt in an accident with a BEV under 14, he stated that \"people do get hurt and will get hurt\" in those types of accidents. Dr. Martinez testified that an accident with a BEV of 12 would cause an unbelted test dummy to go through the windshield. Based on his reconstruction of the plaintiff's accident, Dr. Martinez estimated the BEV of the accident at \"14 to 16, or maybe thirteen and change\" and the Delta V at \"15 to 16, could be 15 to 17.\" The airbag in this Hyundai model is designed to always deploy in accidents with a BEV of 12 or greater, and so the deployment of the airbag was in keeping with its intended design. Dr. Martinez testified that, in any American car with an airbag, the airbag would have deployed in an accident of the type at issue here. Nothing in the cross-examination impeached any of these conclusions. The plaintiff's counsel attempted to make Dr. Martinez concede that Hyundai could have chosen an airbag design that would deploy at a higher BEV; Dr. Martinez responded that he did not know whether it was possible to create a design that would only deploy at a BEV of over 14 and still meet the federal performance standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's counsel also attempted to get Dr. Martinez to concede that he knew of studies indicating that airbag deployment at a BEV of less than 15 causes more injuries than it prevents; Dr. Martinez responded that he had no knowledge of such studies. No such studies were introduced. Dr. Martinez's overall conclusion was that, even at accidents with a BEV of 14 and less, the airbag \"does more good than harm.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Testimony of Dr. Benedict</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. James Benedict, an expert in the response of the human body to acceleration and impact forces, such as in accidents, also testified. Specifically, he is an expert in biomechanical analysis, occupant kinematics, injury causation, and airbag performance. Although the defense retained Dr. Benedict, the plaintiff called him as a witness and presented his testimony. He testified that Reyes-Quintana's arm injuries were consistent with impact with the deploying passenger airbag. He estimated that her forearm was one to three inches from the dashboard at the time of the injury, based on the fact that forearm fractures rarely occur when the arm is three or more inches away from the airbag. He also testified that even if the airbag had not deployed, Reyes-Quintana could have received the same fractures in her forearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dr. Benedict's testimony, the airbag deploys when sensors in the car detect a change in acceleration level; the airbag is essentially \"predictive in nature,\" in that it must predict the severity of the collision based on the initial change in acceleration. The airbag deploys in about one-fourth of the time it takes to blink an eye. Dr. Benedict testified that he knew of no way for an airbag to deploy more slowly and still provide the required protection. As for the Hyundai involved in this particular accident, Dr. Benedict testified that the airbag was designed to deploy in every accident with a BEV of 12 or higher(which he referred to as the \"must fire\" level), but because of variances in vehicle tolerances, could deploy at a BEV of as low as 8.9. He agreed that in any car in America in 1996, the airbag would deploy during a crash with a BEV of 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like Dr. Martinez, Dr. Benedict testified that he would classify an accident occurring at zero to 14 or 15 Delta V as a low severity accident; an accident occurring at 15 to 25 Delta V as a moderate severity accident; an accident occurring at 25 to 35 Delta V as a severe accident; and any accident over 35 Delta V as very severe. He testified that these are \"ranges,\" and the categorization may vary from expert to expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Benedict testified that the effects of a crash with a BEV of 15 could vary. Some occupants will emerge from such an accident with minor or moderate injuries, referred to as \"AIS-I\" or \"AIS-II\" injuries, in reference to the Abbreviated Injury Scale system for categorizing the severity of injuries. Perhaps as many as half of those involved in such crashes would walk away from the accident with no injuries. An unbelted individual without an airbag in the type of crash experienced by Reyes-Quintana, however, could hit and shatter the windshield, sustaining facial bone fractures, lacerations to the face, and perhaps neck injuries. Death could even result. Accidents with a Delta V of 15 account for twenty percent of all AIS-III or greater injuries. AIS-III injuries are severe, serious or critical, including injuries such as contusions to the lung or a penetrating injury to the skull, and may pose a threat to life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Benedict acknowledged that there have been injuries and some deaths caused by deployment of airbags. At the same time, over six thousand lives had been saved by the presence of airbags. He characterized this as a \"trade-off.\" Airbags are meant to protect the primary systems that keep people alive: the head, neck, spine, chest, heart, and lungs. Airbag systems are most effective in preventing these head, neck, and chest injuries, although they may increase the risk of less severe injuries in some crashes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As he had with Dr. Martinez, the plaintiff's counsel attempted to get Dr. Benedict to admit that reports had concluded that, in low severity crashes, occupants are more likely to be injured by the airbag than by the accident itself. Dr. Benedict responded that he knew of one study concerning driver's side airbags, but denied that he knew of any such conclusion. At no point did any expert testify that such a conclusion would be accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's counsel attempted to focus Dr. Benedict's testimony specifically on a belted passenger's risk of injuries. On examination by the plaintiff, Dr. Benedict testified that \"you can have significant injury in Delta Vs of 15, 14, 13,\" even when wearing a seat belt, although he conceded that \"it's less likely wearing a seat belt\" and the \"probability of the head hitting something [when a passenger is wearing a seat belt] is low.\" According to Dr. Benedict, however, federal law requires that airbags be designed to protect unrestrained passengers as well as restrained passengers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quintana-Ruiz offered no evidence to contradict any of the evidence described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C.

The district court granted the motion on the plaintiff's failure to warn claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but denied it on the plaintiff's design defect claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, the plaintiff's attorney argued that the \"only question\" for the jury was \"whether the damages suffered by Ines [Reyes-Quintana] would have been less had the airbag not been in the car or not deployed in the car.\" He argued that the Delta V was around 15 and the BEV was in the 12 to 14 range, classifying the accident as a \"minor collision,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that there should not be airbag deployment \"at these speeds.\" In referring to Dr. Martinez, the plaintiff's attorney specifically said \"believe him on just about everything.\" With regard to Dr. Benedict, the plaintiff's attorney said that \"he knew what the truth was. He was an honest man.\" The judge instructed the jury, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a manufacturer of a product is not the insurer of all the damages its product may cause, you must weigh the evidence according to the following legal theories: Under the doctrine of product liability, a plaintiff may bring an action against a manufacturer who defectively designed a product, or in the alternative, failed to provide instructions or warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the design theory, a plaintiff must establish that, first, the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner; or the product's design is the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury and the defendant failed to establish, in light of the relevant factors, that, on balance, the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such a design....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...

The jury awarded $400,000 to Ines Reyes-Quintana (who had sued through her mother, plaintiff Quintana-Ruiz) and $150,000 in emotional distress damages to Reyes-Quintana's mother, plaintiff Quintana-Ruiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai again moved for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial or remittitur of damages. The trial court denied the motions for judgment as a matter of law, but found the damages to be excessive and ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff accepted a remittitur to $90,000 of the emotional distress damages awarded to Quintana-Ruiz, the mother. The district court did not order remittitur of the $400,000 award to Reyes-Quintana. <i>Quintana Ruiz v. Hyundai Motor Co.,</i> No. 98-1858 (D.P.R. Mar. 12, 2001). In denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude \"that the deployment of the airbag in an accident of this type was unwarranted given the risks posed by the high speed at which the airbag deploys\" or that, given the evidence that airbags are designed to protect the upper body areas, \"the jury may have reasonably found that the risk posed to other parts of the body, like plaintiff's arm, were too high and that the overall design was defective.\" <i>Id.,</i> slip op. at 6. The district court further reasoned that, even if all the experts testified that the utility of the airbag design outweighed the risk, \"there was testimony from which the jury could have found that defendant's experts' testimony was biased and unreliable.\" <i>Id.</i> The judge also found that Hyundai had forfeited any claim of error regarding the consumer expectation test by not specifically objecting to its inclusion in the jury instructions, and that, regardless, the fleeting reference to consumer expectations in the jury instructions was harmless error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hyundai argues that there is insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to support the jury verdict.

Sears Roebuck de P.R., Inc.,</i> 144 P.R. Dec. 830, 840 n. 9, 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486 n. 9, 1998 WL 198857 (1998); <i>see also Collazo-Santiago v.

This rule, which follows California law as established in <i>Barker v. Lull Eng'r Co.,</i> 20 Cal.3d 413, 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443 (1978), is a minority rule. <i>Compare, e.g., Vineyard v.

Inc.,</i> 66 Haw. 237, 659 P.2d 734, 739-40 (1983) (same). The rationale articulated for this burden shifting is that \"most of the evidentiary matters which may be relevant to the determination of the adequacy of a product's design under the `risk-benefit' standard e.g., the feasibility and cost of alternative designs ... involve technical matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the manufacturer.\" <i>Barker,</i> 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d at 455. The goal of the <i>Barker</i> rule, therefore, was to \"lighten the plaintiff's burden\" in proving a design defect, <i>id.</i> 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d at 456, not to radically expand the scope of products considered defective by design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the defendant concedes that the plaintiff has met her burden of establishing that the airbag was the proximate cause of Reyes-Quintana's injuries.

Both parties agree that the airbag operated exactly as it was intended and that the challenged design aspect was a conscious design decision, rather than an unforeseen consequence (for instance, a premature or unexpected deployment) of the airbag's design. <i>Cf. Collazo-Santiago,</i> 149 F.3d at 25-26 (challenged design aspect involved whether airbag could have been better designed to minimize injuries when it did deploy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Collazo-Santiago,</i> another case from Puerto Rico involving a design defect claim based on airbag-related injuries, we noted that \"[a]s identified in <i>Barker,</i> factors to be considered by the jury\" in evaluating whether the defendant has met its burden of establishing that the design benefits outweighed its risks include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the gravity of the danger posed by the challenged design, the likelihood that such a danger would occur, the mechanical feasibility of a safer alternative design, the financial cost of an improved design, and the adverse consequences to the product and to the consumer that would result from an alternative design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 25 (quoting <i>Barker,</i> 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d at 455). The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has also quoted this language approvingly. <i>Rivera Santana,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830 n. 9, 1992 WL 754830 n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1. Risk Utility Balancing</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little guidance from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court on how the risk-utility test should be applied. The case that first adopted the rule, <i>Rivera Santana,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng 754830, 1992 WL 754830, was resolved on another ground &#8212; the manufacturer's failure to warn of the inherently dangerous nature of the product. A subsequent case reiterating the risk-utility rule, <i>Aponte Rivera,</i> 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486, 1998 WL 324486, was also resolved on a failure to warn theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's attorney argued in his closing that the question was \"whether the damages suffered by Ines [Reyes-Quintana] would have been less had the air bag not been in the car or not deployed in the car.\" That, however, is not the correct question in a design defect case. The question posed by the plaintiff's attorney unfairly stacks the deck in the risk-utility equation &#8212; when the question is based on the plaintiff's particular circumstances, the \"risk\" of injury is 100%, as the plaintiff in question has by definition been injured, and therefore the risk will almost always outweigh the utility for that particular plaintiff in that particular instance. Similarly, the trial court's conclusion that, given the evidence that airbags are designed to protect the upper body areas, \"the jury may have reasonably found that the risk posed to other parts of the body, like plaintiff's arm, were too high and that the overall design was defective,\" <i>Quintana Ruiz,</i> slip op. at 6, misstates the test. The issue is not whether the design posed too great a risk to the passenger's arm, or any one specific body part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the question for the jury was whether, generally, the benefits imposed by the airbag's challenged design aspect (here, the fact that the passenger side airbag deploys in accidents with a BEV in the range of 14 to 16) outweigh its risks. In this inquiry, the jury should have considered the risk and utility to unbelted passengers, as well as the risk to belted passengers. The evidence was that unbelted passengers receive a considerable utility from airbags in such accidents, as, absent the airbag, there is a substantial risk of severe facial, head and spinal injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was much evidence presented at trial on the risks posed by, and the utility created by, airbag deployment at a BEV of 14. The uncontradicted evidence was that the benefits outweighed the risks. No expert testified that the risk of harm posed to passengers by airbags in accidents with a BEV of 14 exceeded the benefits of airbags deploying in those types of crashes. In fact, both Dr. Martinez and Dr. Benedict testified that they knew of no studies coming to such a conclusion. Dr. Martinez specifically testified that, at accidents with a BEV of 14 and under, the airbag \"does more good than harm.\" The evidence was that airbags are designed to prevent the most serious types of injuries and therefore to preserve lives, although the cost of preserving these lives may be an increased risk of injuries of a less serious variety in some crashes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's argument that these serious injuries do not occur in the type of accident she had was not supported by the evidence. The evidence was that 20% of all AIS-III injuries occur at a Delta V of 15 or below &#8212; therefore, a significant percentage of serious injuries are the result of these \"moderate\" severity accidents. Reyes-Quintana had the benefit of the protection against these types of injuries afforded by the airbag. She did not suffer any head, face or brain injuries, precisely the types of injuries an airbag protects against in an accident with a Delta V of 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the plaintiff's examination of Dr. Benedict concerned whether the airbag would deploy at a BEV of 8.9, and with the fact that Hyundai does not warn consumers that airbags may cause serious bodily injury. Neither of those topics was material to the risk-utility questions before the jury. It was undisputed that the BEV (and Delta V) were well above 8.9 (and therefore a design choice to make the airbag deploy at a BEV of 8.9 could not be a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries). And, because the matter of labels is so extensively regulated by federal law, there was no viable claim for failure to warn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many products, like airbags, involve a \"trade off\" between the benefits offered to the consumer and the risk created by the product. The risk-utility balancing test is designed to avoid converting the manufacturer into the insurer of every harm that arises out of a product from which the consumer derives utility. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has emphasized that \"[t]he manufacturer ... is not the insurer of every damage his products may cause.\" <i>Aponte Rivera,</i> 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486, 1998 WL 324486; <i>accord Rivera Santana,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830, 1992 WL 754830 (same language) (quoting <i>Mendoza v.

The plaintiff is entitled to compensation only if the challenged design aspect does more harm than good, overall, for the consumer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Alternative Design</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An important part of the risk-utility test is the question of whether there is a mechanically feasible safer alternative design.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Barker,</i> 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d at 455; <i>Rivera Santana,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830 n. 9, 1992 WL 754830.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least three views of how the existence, or non-existence, of a mechanically feasible alternative design fits into the risk-utility balancing test: 1) a showing of an alternative design is the sine qua non of a design defect claim, meaning that a plaintiff cannot prevail even if the risk exceeds the utility unless there is a showing of alternative design, <i>see</i> J. Henderson Jr. &amp; A. Twerski, <i>Achieving Consensus on Defective Product Design,</i> 83 Cornell L.Rev. 867, 883-84 (1998); 2) the plaintiff cannot prevail if there is no showing of a feasible alternative design, <i>unless</i> the risk so far outweighs the utility that no reasonable person would market the product, <i>see id.; Restatement (Third) of Torts: Product Liability,</i> &#167; 2 cmt. b (1998) (\"[P]roduct sellers may be subject to liability even absent a reasonable alternative design when the product design is manifestly unreasonable.\"); and 3) it is not necessary to show the existence of an alternative design if the risk outweighs the utility, but if the actual utility exceeds the actual risk, then the plaintiff may still prevail if there is a showing of a feasible alternate design that would achieve the same utility with a lesser degree of risk,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>see Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts,</i> &#167; 99 at 699 (W. Keeton et al. eds., 5th ed.1984). It is not clear what view the Puerto Rico courts would follow, but none of the three approaches assists the plaintiff. As discussed above, the evidence shows that the actual utility of an airbag deploying at a BEV of 14 outweighs the actual risk posed by such an airbag. Therefore, even under the third view of alternate design (the most plaintiff-friendly view), Quintana-Ruiz cannot prevail unless there is a feasible alternative design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even taking this third view, it is well-established that the inquiry into the \"mechanical feasibility\" of an alternative design must be determined based on the universe of existing technology at the time of manufacture and design (or possibly the time of sale),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> not some future development leading to a potentially feasible possibility. <i>See Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, supra,</i> &#167; 99, at 701 (\"The courts have almost universally held that the feasibility of designing a safer product must be determined as of the time the product was designed.\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Product Liability, supra,</i> &#167; 2 cmt. f (\"[Q]ualified expert testimony on the issue suffices, even though the expert has produced no prototype, if it reasonably supports the conclusion that a reasonable alternative design could have been practically adopted at the time of sale.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California courts as well have accepted the principle that feasibility is determined in light of the technology extant at the relevant time. <i>See Brown v.

In <i>Aguayo v. Crompton &amp; Knowles Corp.,</i> 183 Cal. App.3d 1032, 228 Cal.Rptr. 768 (1986), the plaintiff attempted to introduce evidence that the defendant's successor had instituted a safer alternative design in subsequent versions of the product. The appeals court upheld the district court's ruling excluding the evidence. Noting that while \"[p]laintiff's experts had described how this alternate safety system would operate using technology available at the time of manufacture [of the original machine]\" which \"does have a tendency to show it is feasible,\" the plaintiff's \"offer of proof omitted facts that would show that the knowledge and technology used to manufacture and design the [original] machine was the same used to produce the [proffered] machine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1038-39, 228 Cal.Rptr. 768.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this, the <i>Barker</i> burden-shifting rule potentially puts defendants in an impossible situation with regard to alternative designs &#8212; that of trying to prove a negative (that there is no alternative design that was feasible at the relevant time that would not cause greater risk). <i>Barker</i> itself, and the Puerto Rico cases adopting it, say only that the burden lies with the defendant of proving that the overall utility exceeds the overall risk, not that the burden is on the defendant to prove the impossible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The courts of Puerto Rico will ultimately have to sort through the precise role played by evidence of alternative design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, no expert presented any evidence that there was any alternative design that would have posed less of a risk to passengers while still providing the same level of protection. In fact, the expert testimony was just the opposite. The only alternative design suggested by the plaintiff was an airbag with a higher deployment level (presumably a deployment level at a BEV greater than 16, given that the expert testimony placed the BEV of this accident at between 14 and 16). The expert testimony effectively refuted this as a feasible alternative that would decrease overall risk to passengers. \"[F]easibility [is] not the sole issue, for another relevant consideration [is] whether an alternative design of the car, while averting the particular [harm here], would have created a greater risk of injury in other ... situations.\" <i>Barker,</i> 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d at 456. Expert testimony established that a deployment trigger above a BEV of 12 would leave many individuals unprotected from serious injuries of AIS-III and higher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Dr. Benedict testified that airbags cannot be designed to trigger at one specific BEV level. Rather, because of variations in cars, any one design will result in a range of deployment levels. If a designer wants an airbag to definitely deploy at a BEV of 12 (what Dr. Benedict referred to as a \"must fire\" level), the airbag will sometimes deploy at as low as a BEV of 8.9. The plaintiff's suggestion in closing arguments that Hyundai should have designed a bag that would deploy at a BEV of 16 and above, but never at a BEV of 14 or 15, is inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial on mechanical feasibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, federal regulations governing the performance of airbags must factor into the jury's consideration of whether there is any feasible alternative design. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has mandated that airbags be designed to protect unbelted occupants, as well as belted occupants. 49 C.F.R. &#167; 571.208, S5.1 (2001). This evidence was before the jury. Although, \"states may impose liability under their products liability statutes even if the manufacturer or seller meets the minimum federal standards,\" <i>Rivera-Santana,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830, 1992 WL 754830, an alternative design cannot be considered feasible if it would require the manufacturer to run afoul of federal standards. In fact, a state law claim that attempts to impose requirements that conflict with the federal standards would most likely be preempted by federal law. <i>See Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co.,</i> 529 U.S. 861, 871, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000); <i>Wood v. Gen.

Expert Testimony</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court alternatively upheld the jury verdict on the basis that the defendant bore the burden of proof and that the jury was free to reject the defendant's experts' testimony as biased. The only \"bias\" was that Hyundai paid the experts' consulting fees (including compensation for time spent testifying), and that both experts primarily, although not exclusively, work for the defense side in such cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the burden-shifting rule as stated by Puerto Rico (albeit without consideration of the factors discussed here), a plaintiff need not present any evidence regarding the risk or utility of the product, or even regarding the design of the product. <i>Aponte Rivera,</i> 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486 n. 9, 1998 WL 324486; <i>Rivera Santana v. Superior Packaging, Inc.,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830, 1992 WL 754830. From this, the plaintiff argues that when a plaintiff does not present her own expert testimony and convinces the jury to disregard the defense experts' testimony, a plaintiff can prevail on her design defect claim simply by showing that the product caused her injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thought its alternative ground was compelled by <i>Collazo-Santiago,</i> 149 F.3d 23. <i>See Quintana Ruiz,</i> slip op. at 6 &amp; n. 17.

The plaintiff has argued that <i>Collazo-Santiago</i> established a flat rule that a jury may reject the testimony of an expert witness on a subject requiring expert testimony solely on the basis of the jury's conclusion that the expert is biased in a case where the defendant, as a matter of law, bears the burden of proof on the issue.

Christian Moerlein Brewing Co.,</i> 172 U.S. 401, 19 S.Ct. 233, 43 L.Ed. 492 (1899), is helpful in sketching the contours of this rule. <i>Sonnentheil</i> is usually quoted as holding that \"the mere fact that the witness is interested in the result of the suit is deemed sufficient to require the credibility of his testimony to be submitted to the jury as a question of fact.\" <i>Id.</i> at 408, 19 S.Ct. 233. This rule must be understood in context. The central issue in <i>Sonnentheil</i> was whether creditors were guilty, or aware, of fraud in the making of a deed. <i>Id.</i> at 409, 19 S.Ct. 233. The uncontradicted testimony at issue was provided by the creditors themselves, who quite obviously had a personal interest in the outcome of the case. The Court observed that fraud cases are uniquely within the province of the jury's credibility determinations, as \"[p]arties contemplating a fraud frequently pursue... devious courses to conceal their designs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 410, 19 S.Ct. 233. Finally, the Court noted that there was much circumstantial evidence that \"there [was] a strong probability\" that the creditors were aware of the fraud. <i>Id.</i> at 413, 19 S.Ct. 233. As a result, the Court, while noting that \"the jury had no right to arbitrarily disregard the positive testimony of unimpeached and uncontradicted witnesses,\" held that \"[u]nder the peculiar circumstances of this case, it was not error to submit [the question of fraud] to the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 408, 414, 19 S.Ct. 233.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there is no such evidence as would support a jury's rejection of the experts' testimony. The experts, although paid by the defendants on an hourly basis, had no financial or personal interest in the outcome of the case. Nor is there a claim of fraud on the part of the expert witnesses. The only \"bias\" is in their retention by the defense. In <i>Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry.,</i> the Supreme Court held that the fact that the witness was an employee of the defendant was not a sufficient basis for the jury to reject his testimony. 283 U.S. at 216, 51 S.Ct. 453. Here, the witnesses were paid outside experts, a much weaker basis on which to find their testimony lacked credibility. There was no evidence, circumstantial or direct, tending to show that they were not credible witnesses. The testimony was not improbable, inconsistent, or otherwise facially unbelievable. In short, there is nothing in the record to support the jury's rejection of the experts' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule that a jury verdict cannot be based solely on the jury's rejection of the other side's uncontradicted testimony applies with particular force to expert testimony on matters outside of lay competence. While juries may decide what weight to give to the testimony of expert witnesses, they are not \"at liberty to disregard arbitrarily the unequivocal, uncontradicted and unimpeached testimony of an expert witness where ... the testimony bears on technical questions ... beyond the competence of lay determination.\" <i>Webster v.

Thus, the decision rested not on an absolute rule but, rather, on an assessment of the weight of the relevant evidence. <i>Collazo-Santiago</i> presents a litany of facts casting doubt on the defendant's expert's credibility. <i>Collazo-Santiago</i> differed from this case in several ways. The plaintiff in <i>Collazo-Santiago</i> marshaled extraordinary evidence of expert bias. The expert not only was being paid by the defendant, but had previously been employed by the defendant as a design engineer. At the time of trial, the expert was earning the vast majority of his income by testifying for that particular defendant or its affiliates and had, in fact, testified for them thirty-six times in the two year period preceding the trial. <i>Id.</i> at 27-28.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to <i>Collazo-Santiago,</i> this is not a case where the veracity or the reliability of the expert testimony was in doubt or the expert testimony did not cover a material point. In fact, the plaintiff emphasized the veracity and reliability of the experts. The plaintiff called Dr. Benedict as her own witness. In referring to Dr. Martinez, the plaintiff's attorney specifically said, \"believe him on just about everything.\" With regard to Dr. Benedict, the plaintiff's attorney said that \"he knew what the truth was. He was an honest man.\" The fact that the defendant paid the experts' fees cannot alone establish bias to overcome plausible and uncontradicted evidence that the design benefits outweighed any risks. That is particularly so where the non-paying party encourages the jury to accept both experts as credible. The defendant proffered reliable expert testimony that indicated that the utility of the design outweighed the risk, and the jury could not simply disregard such testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

There are competing policy interests &#8212; on the one hand is the possibility that a manufacturer may continue to sell an outmoded design long after a safer alternative becomes feasible, while on the other hand is the absolutely inevitable lag time between when a product is designed and when it is sold and the fact that technology may develop during that lag time.

The question here is whether a jury may find for a plaintiff, injured when her airbag properly deployed in an auto accident, when the evidence is that the overall utility of the design exceeds the overall risk, there is no evidence of the existence of an alternative safer design, and the jury verdict is based either on a misunderstanding of the law or solely on the jury's rejection of the testimony of the experts retained by the defendant. We hold that such a jury verdict is not sustainable. It effectively, in these circumstances, either converts the defendant to the status of an insurer or creates liability based on a consumer expectation theory. Since neither of these outcomes is permissible under Puerto Rican law, we reverse and direct entry of judgment for defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in the morning of August 10, 1996, Ines Reyes-Quintana, then fifteen years old, was returning from a party in a 1996 Hyundai Accent. Reyes-Quintana's brother was driving the car and Reyes-Quintana was in the front passenger's seat. The Hyundai was in the left lane of a two-lane road. A Nissan station wagon, traveling at a substantially slower speed, crossed from the right lane into the left lane, in front of the Hyundai. The Hyundai braked, leaving about 163 feet worth of skid marks on the road. The Hyundai then rear-ended the Nissan at a speed differential of about 30 miles per hour. The passenger-side airbag deployed, striking Reyes-Quintana's hand, which she had raised as if to brace herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The force of the airbag striking her arm fractured Reyes-Quintana's arm and wrist in four places. These were the only injuries Reyes-Quintana sustained in the accident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The fractures required three surgeries, including the permanent attachment of two metal plates and sixteen metal screws. Reyes-Quintana has also experienced some permanent loss of strength and scarring in that arm. The Hyundai sustained significant damage, estimated at over $11,300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. TRIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only two experts testified on the airbag's design. Both experts were retained by the defendant, Hyundai. The plaintiff also offered the testimony of a medical expert to establish Reyes-Quintana's injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A. Testimony of Dr. Martinez</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Jose Martinez, formerly of Texas A &amp; M University, testified as an accident reconstruction expert, providing the probable explanation of how the accident took place. He testified that the police reports showed 163 feet of braking marks before impact. Based on the damage sustained by the Hyundai, Dr. Martinez concluded that it was traveling thirty miles per hour faster than the Nissan at the point of impact. Based on this conclusion and the length of the skid marks, Dr. Martinez opined that the Hyundai had to be traveling at least 63 miles per hour before the driver began to brake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Martinez explained the mechanics of accident reconstruction, a short summary of which is necessary in order to understand the issues in this case. Barrier equivalent velocity, referred to as BEV, is the speed at which a vehicle goes into a barrier, measured in miles per hour. BEV is used for setting the deployment level for airbags, and it is the measurement used in the relevant federal regulations. Delta V, a related but not identical concept, is the change in velocity of a vehicle, usually at the center of gravity, also measured in miles per hour. Generally, accident reconstruction experts measure the Delta V of the car environment, rather than that of a specific occupant. In accidents involving impact into a barrier, the BEV is often slightly less than the Delta V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The higher the Delta V is, the more serious the injuries are likely to be. Conversely, the lower the Delta V, the less serious the injuries are likely to be. The majority of accidents occur in the 10 to 15 Delta V range. Generally, accidents with a Delta V under 15 are considered to be of lower severity. Middle severity accidents are in the 15 to 25 Delta V range; above 25 is considered high severity. Dr. Martinez testified that a BEV of 15 \"is where you start to get serious injuries, according to the statistics\" and that is \"where you want that air bag to go off.\" He also testified that even an accident referred to as \"low severity\" is not mild because, if you are unrestrained, such an accident can \"put your head in the windshield\" and cause serious injuries. Although he could not provide the specific percentiles of how many people would get hurt in an accident with a BEV under 14, he stated that \"people do get hurt and will get hurt\" in those types of accidents. Dr. Martinez testified that an accident with a BEV of 12 would cause an unbelted test dummy to go through the windshield. Based on his reconstruction of the plaintiff's accident, Dr. Martinez estimated the BEV of the accident at \"14 to 16, or maybe thirteen and change\" and the Delta V at \"15 to 16, could be 15 to 17.\" The airbag in this Hyundai model is designed to always deploy in accidents with a BEV of 12 or greater, and so the deployment of the airbag was in keeping with its intended design. Dr. Martinez testified that, in any American car with an airbag, the airbag would have deployed in an accident of the type at issue here. Nothing in the cross-examination impeached any of these conclusions. The plaintiff's counsel attempted to make Dr. Martinez concede that Hyundai could have chosen an airbag design that would deploy at a higher BEV; Dr. Martinez responded that he did not know whether it was possible to create a design that would only deploy at a BEV of over 14 and still meet the federal performance standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's counsel also attempted to get Dr. Martinez to concede that he knew of studies indicating that airbag deployment at a BEV of less than 15 causes more injuries than it prevents; Dr. Martinez responded that he had no knowledge of such studies. No such studies were introduced. Dr. Martinez's overall conclusion was that, even at accidents with a BEV of 14 and less, the airbag \"does more good than harm.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Testimony of Dr. Benedict</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. James Benedict, an expert in the response of the human body to acceleration and impact forces, such as in accidents, also testified. Specifically, he is an expert in biomechanical analysis, occupant kinematics, injury causation, and airbag performance. Although the defense retained Dr. Benedict, the plaintiff called him as a witness and presented his testimony. He testified that Reyes-Quintana's arm injuries were consistent with impact with the deploying passenger airbag. He estimated that her forearm was one to three inches from the dashboard at the time of the injury, based on the fact that forearm fractures rarely occur when the arm is three or more inches away from the airbag. He also testified that even if the airbag had not deployed, Reyes-Quintana could have received the same fractures in her forearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dr. Benedict's testimony, the airbag deploys when sensors in the car detect a change in acceleration level; the airbag is essentially \"predictive in nature,\" in that it must predict the severity of the collision based on the initial change in acceleration. The airbag deploys in about one-fourth of the time it takes to blink an eye. Dr. Benedict testified that he knew of no way for an airbag to deploy more slowly and still provide the required protection. As for the Hyundai involved in this particular accident, Dr. Benedict testified that the airbag was designed to deploy in every accident with a BEV of 12 or higher(which he referred to as the \"must fire\" level), but because of variances in vehicle tolerances, could deploy at a BEV of as low as 8.9. He agreed that in any car in America in 1996, the airbag would deploy during a crash with a BEV of 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like Dr. Martinez, Dr. Benedict testified that he would classify an accident occurring at zero to 14 or 15 Delta V as a low severity accident; an accident occurring at 15 to 25 Delta V as a moderate severity accident; an accident occurring at 25 to 35 Delta V as a severe accident; and any accident over 35 Delta V as very severe. He testified that these are \"ranges,\" and the categorization may vary from expert to expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Benedict testified that the effects of a crash with a BEV of 15 could vary. Some occupants will emerge from such an accident with minor or moderate injuries, referred to as \"AIS-I\" or \"AIS-II\" injuries, in reference to the Abbreviated Injury Scale system for categorizing the severity of injuries. Perhaps as many as half of those involved in such crashes would walk away from the accident with no injuries. An unbelted individual without an airbag in the type of crash experienced by Reyes-Quintana, however, could hit and shatter the windshield, sustaining facial bone fractures, lacerations to the face, and perhaps neck injuries. Death could even result. Accidents with a Delta V of 15 account for twenty percent of all AIS-III or greater injuries. AIS-III injuries are severe, serious or critical, including injuries such as contusions to the lung or a penetrating injury to the skull, and may pose a threat to life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Benedict acknowledged that there have been injuries and some deaths caused by deployment of airbags. At the same time, over six thousand lives had been saved by the presence of airbags. He characterized this as a \"trade-off.\" Airbags are meant to protect the primary systems that keep people alive: the head, neck, spine, chest, heart, and lungs. Airbag systems are most effective in preventing these head, neck, and chest injuries, although they may increase the risk of less severe injuries in some crashes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As he had with Dr. Martinez, the plaintiff's counsel attempted to get Dr. Benedict to admit that reports had concluded that, in low severity crashes, occupants are more likely to be injured by the airbag than by the accident itself. Dr. Benedict responded that he knew of one study concerning driver's side airbags, but denied that he knew of any such conclusion. At no point did any expert testify that such a conclusion would be accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's counsel attempted to focus Dr. Benedict's testimony specifically on a belted passenger's risk of injuries. On examination by the plaintiff, Dr. Benedict testified that \"you can have significant injury in Delta Vs of 15, 14, 13,\" even when wearing a seat belt, although he conceded that \"it's less likely wearing a seat belt\" and the \"probability of the head hitting something [when a passenger is wearing a seat belt] is low.\" According to Dr. Benedict, however, federal law requires that airbags be designed to protect unrestrained passengers as well as restrained passengers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quintana-Ruiz offered no evidence to contradict any of the evidence described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C. Proceedings After Close of Evidence</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After all the evidence had been introduced, Hyundai moved for judgment as a matter of law. The district court granted the motion on the plaintiff's failure to warn claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but denied it on the plaintiff's design defect claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, the plaintiff's attorney argued that the \"only question\" for the jury was \"whether the damages suffered by Ines [Reyes-Quintana] would have been less had the airbag not been in the car or not deployed in the car.\" He argued that the Delta V was around 15 and the BEV was in the 12 to 14 range, classifying the accident as a \"minor collision,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that there should not be airbag deployment \"at these speeds.\" In referring to Dr. Martinez, the plaintiff's attorney specifically said \"believe him on just about everything.\" With regard to Dr. Benedict, the plaintiff's attorney said that \"he knew what the truth was. He was an honest man.\" The judge instructed the jury, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a manufacturer of a product is not the insurer of all the damages its product may cause, you must weigh the evidence according to the following legal theories: Under the doctrine of product liability, a plaintiff may bring an action against a manufacturer who defectively designed a product, or in the alternative, failed to provide instructions or warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the design theory, a plaintiff must establish that, first, the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner; or the product's design is the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury and the defendant failed to establish, in light of the relevant factors, that, on balance, the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such a design....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... If you find that the benefits surpass the risks, then the defendants are not liable under this theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, if you find that the benefits do not surpass the risks, then you find for the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberations, the jury found for the plaintiff, and also found that the plaintiff bore no share of the comparative fault. The jury awarded $400,000 to Ines Reyes-Quintana (who had sued through her mother, plaintiff Quintana-Ruiz) and $150,000 in emotional distress damages to Reyes-Quintana's mother, plaintiff Quintana-Ruiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai again moved for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial or remittitur of damages. The trial court denied the motions for judgment as a matter of law, but found the damages to be excessive and ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff accepted a remittitur to $90,000 of the emotional distress damages awarded to Quintana-Ruiz, the mother. The district court did not order remittitur of the $400,000 award to Reyes-Quintana. <i>Quintana Ruiz v. Hyundai Motor Co.,</i> No. 98-1858 (D.P.R. Mar. 12, 2001). In denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude \"that the deployment of the airbag in an accident of this type was unwarranted given the risks posed by the high speed at which the airbag deploys\" or that, given the evidence that airbags are designed to protect the upper body areas, \"the jury may have reasonably found that the risk posed to other parts of the body, like plaintiff's arm, were too high and that the overall design was defective.\" <i>Id.,</i> slip op. at 6. The district court further reasoned that, even if all the experts testified that the utility of the airbag design outweighed the risk, \"there was testimony from which the jury could have found that defendant's experts' testimony was biased and unreliable.\" <i>Id.</i> The judge also found that Hyundai had forfeited any claim of error regarding the consumer expectation test by not specifically objecting to its inclusion in the jury instructions, and that, regardless, the fleeting reference to consumer expectations in the jury instructions was harmless error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hyundai argues that there is insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to support the jury verdict. We review the district court's denial of judgment as a matter of law de novo, reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict to determine if the verdict is supported by the evidence. <i>See Rodowicz v.

The case that first adopted the rule, <i>Rivera Santana,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng 754830, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">754830</span></span>, was resolved on another ground &#8212; the manufacturer's failure to warn of the inherently dangerous nature of the product. A subsequent case reiterating the risk-utility rule, <i>Aponte Rivera,</i> 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">324486</span></span>, was also resolved on a failure to warn theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's attorney argued in his closing that the question was \"whether the damages suffered by Ines [Reyes-Quintana] would have been less had the air bag not been in the car or not deployed in the car.\" That, however, is not the correct question in a design defect case. The question posed by the plaintiff's attorney unfairly stacks the deck in the risk-utility equation &#8212; when the question is based on the plaintiff's particular circumstances, the \"risk\" of injury is 100%, as the plaintiff in question has by definition been injured, and therefore the risk will almost always outweigh the utility for that particular plaintiff in that particular instance. Similarly, the trial court's conclusion that, given the evidence that airbags are designed to protect the upper body areas, \"the jury may have reasonably found that the risk posed to other parts of the body, like plaintiff's arm, were too high and that the overall design was defective,\" <i>Quintana Ruiz,</i> slip op. at 6, misstates the test. The issue is not whether the design posed too great a risk to the passenger's arm, or any one specific body part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the question for the jury was whether, generally, the benefits imposed by the airbag's challenged design aspect (here, the fact that the passenger side airbag deploys in accidents with a BEV in the range of 14 to 16) outweigh its risks. In this inquiry, the jury should have considered the risk and utility to unbelted passengers, as well as the risk to belted passengers. The evidence was that unbelted passengers receive a considerable utility from airbags in such accidents, as, absent the airbag, there is a substantial risk of severe facial, head and spinal injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was much evidence presented at trial on the risks posed by, and the utility created by, airbag deployment at a BEV of 14. The uncontradicted evidence was that the benefits outweighed the risks. No expert testified that the risk of harm posed to passengers by airbags in accidents with a BEV of 14 exceeded the benefits of airbags deploying in those types of crashes. In fact, both Dr. Martinez and Dr. Benedict testified that they knew of no studies coming to such a conclusion. Dr. Martinez specifically testified that, at accidents with a BEV of 14 and under, the airbag \"does more good than harm.\" The evidence was that airbags are designed to prevent the most serious types of injuries and therefore to preserve lives, although the cost of preserving these lives may be an increased risk of injuries of a less serious variety in some crashes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's argument that these serious injuries do not occur in the type of accident she had was not supported by the evidence. The evidence was that 20% of all AIS-III injuries occur at a Delta V of 15 or below &#8212; therefore, a significant percentage of serious injuries are the result of these \"moderate\" severity accidents. Reyes-Quintana had the benefit of the protection against these types of injuries afforded by the airbag. She did not suffer any head, face or brain injuries, precisely the types of injuries an airbag protects against in an accident with a Delta V of 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the plaintiff's examination of Dr. Benedict concerned whether the airbag would deploy at a BEV of 8.9, and with the fact that Hyundai does not warn consumers that airbags may cause serious bodily injury. Neither of those topics was material to the risk-utility questions before the jury. It was undisputed that the BEV (and Delta V) were well above 8.9 (and therefore a design choice to make the airbag deploy at a BEV of 8.9 could not be a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries). And, because the matter of labels is so extensively regulated by federal law, there was no viable claim for failure to warn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many products, like airbags, involve a \"trade off\" between the benefits offered to the consumer and the risk created by the product. The risk-utility balancing test is designed to avoid converting the manufacturer into the insurer of every harm that arises out of a product from which the consumer derives utility. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has emphasized that \"[t]he manufacturer ... is not the insurer of every damage his products may cause.\" <i>Aponte Rivera,</i> 1998 P.R.-Eng. 324486, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">324486</span></span>; <i>accord Rivera Santana,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">754830</span></span> (same language) (quoting <i>Mendoza v.

Henderson Jr. &amp; A. Twerski, <i>Achieving Consensus on Defective Product Design,</i> 83 Cornell L.Rev. 867, 883-84 (1998); 2) the plaintiff cannot prevail if there is no showing of a feasible alternative design, <i>unless</i> the risk so far outweighs the utility that no reasonable person would market the product, <i>see id.; Restatement (Third) of Torts: Product Liability,</i> &#167; 2 cmt. b (1998) (\"[P]roduct sellers may be subject to liability even absent a reasonable alternative design when the product design is manifestly unreasonable.\"); and 3) it is not necessary to show the existence of an alternative design if the risk outweighs the utility, but if the actual utility exceeds the actual risk, then the plaintiff may still prevail if there is a showing of a feasible alternate design that would achieve the same utility with a lesser degree of risk,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>see Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts,</i> &#167; 99 at 699 (W. Keeton et al. eds., 5th ed.1984). It is not clear what view the Puerto Rico courts would follow, but none of the three approaches assists the plaintiff. As discussed above, the evidence shows that the actual utility of an airbag deploying at a BEV of 14 outweighs the actual risk posed by such an airbag. Therefore, even under the third view of alternate design (the most plaintiff-friendly view), Quintana-Ruiz cannot prevail unless there is a feasible alternative design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even taking this third view, it is well-established that the inquiry into the \"mechanical feasibility\" of an alternative design must be determined based on the universe of existing technology at the time of manufacture and design (or possibly the time of sale),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> not some future development leading to a potentially feasible possibility. <i>See Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, supra,</i> &#167; 99, at 701 (\"The courts have almost universally held that the feasibility of designing a safer product must be determined as of the time the product was designed.\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Product Liability, supra,</i> &#167; 2 cmt. f (\"[Q]ualified expert testimony on the issue suffices, even though the expert has produced no prototype, if it reasonably supports the conclusion that a reasonable alternative design could have been practically adopted at the time of sale.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California courts as well have accepted the principle that feasibility is determined in light of the technology extant at the relevant time. <i>See Brown v.

Noting that while \"[p]laintiff's experts had described how this alternate safety system would operate using technology available at the time of manufacture [of the original machine]\" which \"does have a tendency to show it is feasible,\" the plaintiff's \"offer of proof omitted facts that would show that the knowledge and technology used to manufacture and design the [original] machine was the same used to produce the [proffered] machine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1038-39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155891\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155891/aguayo-v-crompton-knowles-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In fact, the expert testimony was just the opposite. The only alternative design suggested by the plaintiff was an airbag with a higher deployment level (presumably a deployment level at a BEV greater than 16, given that the expert testimony placed the BEV of this accident at between 14 and 16). The expert testimony effectively refuted this as a feasible alternative that would decrease overall risk to passengers. \"[F]easibility [is] not the sole issue, for another relevant consideration [is] whether an alternative design of the car, while averting the particular [harm here], would have created a greater risk of injury in other ... situations.\" <i>Barker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1166422\"><a href=\"/opinion/1166422/barker-v-lull-engineering-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 573 P.2d at 456. Expert testimony established that a deployment trigger above a BEV of 12 would leave many individuals unprotected from serious injuries of AIS-III and higher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Dr. Benedict testified that airbags cannot be designed to trigger at one specific BEV level. Rather, because of variations in cars, any one design will result in a range of deployment levels. If a designer wants an airbag to definitely deploy at a BEV of 12 (what Dr. Benedict referred to as a \"must fire\" level), the airbag will sometimes deploy at as low as a BEV of 8.9. The plaintiff's suggestion in closing arguments that Hyundai should have designed a bag that would deploy at a BEV of 16 and above, but never at a BEV of 14 or 15, is inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial on mechanical feasibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, federal regulations governing the performance of airbags must factor into the jury's consideration of whether there is any feasible alternative design. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has mandated that airbags be designed to protect unbelted occupants, as well as belted occupants. 49 C.F.R. &#167; 571.208, S5.1 (2001). This evidence was before the jury. Although, \"states may impose liability under their products liability statutes even if the manufacturer or seller meets the minimum federal standards,\" <i>Rivera-Santana,</i> 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">754830</span></span>, an alternative design cannot be considered feasible if it would require the manufacturer to run afoul of federal standards. In fact, a state law claim that attempts to impose requirements that conflict with the federal standards would most likely be preempted by federal law. <i>See Geier v. Am.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></span> (1899), is helpful in sketching the contours of this rule. <i>Sonnentheil</i> is usually quoted as holding that \"the mere fact that the witness is interested in the result of the suit is deemed sufficient to require the credibility of his testimony to be submitted to the jury as a question of fact.\" <i>Id.</i> at 408, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span>. This rule must be understood in context. The central issue in <i>Sonnentheil</i> was whether creditors were guilty, or aware, of fraud in the making of a deed. <i>Id.</i> at 409, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span>. The uncontradicted testimony at issue was provided by the creditors themselves, who quite obviously had a personal interest in the outcome of the case. The Court observed that fraud cases are uniquely within the province of the jury's credibility determinations, as \"[p]arties contemplating a fraud frequently pursue... devious courses to conceal their designs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 410, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span>. Finally, the Court noted that there was much circumstantial evidence that \"there [was] a strong probability\" that the creditors were aware of the fraud. <i>Id.</i> at 413, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span>. As a result, the Court, while noting that \"the jury had no right to arbitrarily disregard the positive testimony of unimpeached and uncontradicted witnesses,\" held that \"[u]nder the peculiar circumstances of this case, it was not error to submit [the question of fraud] to the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 408, 414, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The experts, although paid by the defendants on an hourly basis, had no financial or personal interest in the outcome of the case. Nor is there a claim of fraud on the part of the expert witnesses. The only \"bias\" is in their retention by the defense. In <i>Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry.,</i> the Supreme Court held that the fact that the witness was an employee of the defendant was not a sufficient basis for the jury to reject his testimony. 283 U.S. at 216, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></span>. Here, the witnesses were paid outside experts, a much weaker basis on which to find their testimony lacked credibility. There was no evidence, circumstantial or direct, tending to show that they were not credible witnesses. The testimony was not improbable, inconsistent, or otherwise facially unbelievable.

Thus, the decision rested not on an absolute rule but, rather, on an assessment of the weight of the relevant evidence. <i>Collazo-Santiago</i> presents a litany of facts casting doubt on the defendant's expert's credibility. <i>Collazo-Santiago</i> differed from this case in several ways. The plaintiff in <i>Collazo-Santiago</i> marshaled extraordinary evidence of expert bias. The expert not only was being paid by the defendant, but had previously been employed by the defendant as a design engineer. At the time of trial, the expert was earning the vast majority of his income by testifying for that particular defendant or its affiliates and had, in fact, testified for them thirty-six times in the two year period preceding the trial. <i>Id.</i> at 27-28.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to <i>Collazo-Santiago,</i> this is not a case where the veracity or the reliability of the expert testimony was in doubt or the expert testimony did not cover a material point. In fact, the plaintiff emphasized the veracity and reliability of the experts. The plaintiff called Dr. Benedict as her own witness. In referring to Dr. Martinez, the plaintiff's attorney specifically said, \"believe him on just about everything.\" With regard to Dr. Benedict, the plaintiff's attorney said that \"he knew what the truth was. He was an honest man.\" The fact that the defendant paid the experts' fees cannot alone establish bias to overcome plausible and uncontradicted evidence that the design benefits outweighed any risks. That is particularly so where the non-paying party encourages the jury to accept both experts as credible. The defendant proffered reliable expert testimony that indicated that the utility of the design outweighed the risk, and the jury could not simply disregard such testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

There are competing policy interests &#8212; on the one hand is the possibility that a manufacturer may continue to sell an outmoded design long after a safer alternative becomes feasible, while on the other hand is the absolutely inevitable lag time between when a product is designed and when it is sold and the fact that technology may develop during that lag time.

Even were we to view this case through that lens, these concerns are directed at cases where credibility is at issue, which is not the case here. There was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, to suggest that the witnesses' credibility was in doubt, and the plaintiff's counsel vouched for the credibility of the experts.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The district court erroneously instructed the jury on the consumer expectation theory.

In general, the question of whether a consumer expectation theory is available depends not on the challenged product itself, but on the complexity of the alleged defect; \"[f]or example, the ordinary consumers of modern automobiles may and do expect that such vehicles will be designed so as not to explode while idling at stoplights, experience sudden steering or brake failure as they leave the dealership, or roll over and catch fire in two-mile-per-hour collisions.\" <i>Soule,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1296743\"><a href=\"/opinion/1296743/soule-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.
