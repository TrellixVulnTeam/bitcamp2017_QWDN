The conditional plea reserved Dixon's right to seek\n\nappellate review of the court's disallowance of his suppression\n\nmotion. That motion had been the subject of an evidentiary hearing\n\nbefore the Magistrate Judge whose comprehensive amended recommended\n\ndecision was affirmed by the district court.    Dixon appeals from\n\nhis conviction, focusing on his contention that the court erred in\n\ndenying his suppression motion.\n\n          We have heard argument and reviewed the parties' briefs\n\nand the record on appeal, examining the Magistrate Judge's findings\n\nof fact for clear error and his legal conclusions de novo.
