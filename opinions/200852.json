Wietecha, David I. Pincus, Attorneys, Tax Division,\nDepartment of Justice, Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, and Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                         February 12, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam. Pro se appellant Kathleen Marino appeals from a\n\ndistrict   court    judgment      dismissing      her   action   for   lack   of\n\njurisdiction and denying her motion for reconsideration.                       We\n\naffirm.     In   addition,   we    grant    the   government's    request     for\n\nsanctions, albeit in a lesser amount than requested.1\n\n     I.    Background\n\n     The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") filed a Notice of Federal\n\nTax Lien on Marino's property relative to her income tax liability\n\nfor the 1996 tax year.         On October 29, 2002, a Collection Due\n\nProcess (\"CDP\") hearing was held, at which Marino contested her\n\nunderlying income tax liability.2          She made arguments which the IRS\n\nsettlement officer informed her had been consistently rejected as\n\ngroundless by the courts.         For example, she asserted that she was\n\nnot liable for the income tax, that she did not have to file\n\nreturns, that the Internal Revenue Code was unconstitutional, and\n\nother similar \"tax protester\" arguments.                 The IRS settlement\n\nofficer gave her a copy of Pierson v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 576\n\n(2000), which warns taxpayers about sanctions for frivolously\n\n\n\n     1\n      Internal Revenue Service Appeals Manager Kathleen Brown is\nthe appellee, but the government has filed a brief on her behalf,\nand so we refer to the government in describing the appellate\ncontentions.\n     2\n      She had apparently never received the Notices of Deficiency\nthe IRS had sent her prior to the hearing.        Accordingly, the\npertinent statute gave her the right to challenge \"the existence or\namount of the underlying tax liability[.]\"           26 U.S.C. §\n6330(c)(2)(B).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fopposing the collection of taxes.3\n\n     On November 27, 2002, appellee Brown issued a Notice of\n\nDetermination upholding the lien.         Brown instructed Marino to file\n\nany challenge to the determination in the Tax Court.             Citing the\n\nPierson case, she reminded Marino that seeking review primarily for\n\ndelay and asserting frivolous or groundless positions could result\n\nin sanctions of up to $25,000.       Brown also advised Marino that the\n\nIRS considered her objections to its collection efforts to be\n\ngroundless.\n\n     Marino then filed the instant petition against Brown in the\n\ndistrict    court,    seeking   review    of   the    IRS's   determination.\n\nAlthough the IRS was seeking to collect on an income tax liability,\n\nshe asserted that the case involved \"employment taxes.\"                     The\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, without\n\nopposition by Marino.       In an endorsed order, the district court\n\ngranted the motion, stating: \"ALLOWED, the motion appearing well\n\nfounded    and   no   opposition   having   been     filed.    See   True    v.\n\nCommissioner, 108 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1364 (M.D. Fla. 2000).\"4\n\n\n     3\n      The Pierson case discusses 26 U.S.C. § 6673(a), which\nauthorizes the United States Tax Court (\"Tax Court\") to impose\nsanctions of up to $25,000 if taxpayers have instituted proceedings\nin that court \"primarily for delay\" or have taken \"frivolous or\ngroundless\" positions.\n     4\n      In True, a pro se taxpayer filed an action in federal\ndistrict court, alleging that the IRS had violated his due process\nrights by denying him a CDP hearing relative to a levy on his\nassets. Evaluating the same judicial review statute that is at\nissue here, 26 U.S.C. § 6330(d), the district court concluded that\n\n                                    -3-\n\f     Marino then asked the court to reconsider. She contended that\n\nshe had not received a copy of the government's motion to dismiss\n\nand argued that the district court had jurisdiction over her\n\npetition.     In an endorsed order, the district court denied her\n\nmotion, stating that \"no good cause [had] been shown to reconsider\n\non the merits, even if plaintiff did not previously receive a copy\n\nof the motion to dismiss.\"\n\n     Marino appealed the district court's orders dismissing her\n\npetition and denying reconsideration.\n\n     II.    Discussion\n\n     A.    Jurisdiction\n\n     The    parties    essentially   agree   that   the   Tax   Court    has\n\njurisdiction    over    cases   involving    an   underlying    income   tax\n\nliability.5    However, Marino asserts on appeal, as in the district\n\n\n\nit lacked jurisdiction over the suit because the evidence showed\nthat the underlying tax liability was for income tax based on\nincome derived from True's self-employment. True had asserted that\nhis tax liability was for an \"employment tax,\" urging, therefore,\nthat the district court rather than the Tax Court had jurisdiction\nover his suit. This is the very contention Marino makes, and self-\nemployment income may be at issue in this case as well. The Notice\nof Federal Tax Lien describes the pertinent tax area as \"Small\nBusiness/Self Employed Area # 1.\"\n     5\n      See 26 U.S.C. §6330(d)(1) (allowing appeal from lien\ndetermination \"to the Tax Court . . . or . . . if the Tax Court\ndoes not have jurisdiction of the underlying tax liability, to a\ndistrict court of the United States\"); 26 C.F.R. § 301.6230(f)(2),\nA-F3 [Answer to Question F3] (\"If the Tax Court would have\njurisdiction over the type of tax specified in the CDP Notice (for\nexample, income . . . taxes), then the taxpayer must seek judicial\nreview by the Tax Court.\").\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcourt, that this case involves \"employment taxes,\" so that the\n\ndistrict court has jurisdiction.6     She makes other arguments as\n\nwell.7   For its part, the government contends that the IRS's\n\ndetermination upholding its lien on Marino's property was based on\n\nan underlying income tax liability.\n\n     There is no question that the government's position is the\n\ncorrect one.   The documents attached to Marino's district court\n\npetition -- e.g., the Notice of Federal Tax Lien -- verify that the\n\nlien was based on her income tax liability for the 1996 tax year.\n\nAccordingly, the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction, and Marino\n\nshould have filed her petition for review in that court, as\n\n\n\n     6\n      See 26 C.F.R. § 601.102(b)(2)(i) (identifying \"[e]mployment\ntaxes\" as \"[t]axes not within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Tax\nCourt\").    Marino does not explain the reasoning behind her\ncontention that the case involves \"employment taxes.\" That term\nusually includes such taxes as \"the taxes under the Federal\nInsurance Contributions Act (FICA), . . . the Federal Unemployment\nTax Act (FUTA), and income tax withholding, [26 U.S.C. §§] 3401-\n3406.\" Evans Publishing, Inc. v. Commissioner, 119 T.C. 242, 252\nn.2 (2002).\n     7\n      Marino raises the new claim that the Tax Court lacks the\njudicial power to resolve the issues in this case. In particular,\nshe asserts that the Tax Court is an administrative tribunal in the\nexecutive branch of government, that it is not a court of law, that\nit does not consider issues of law, and that it cannot exercise\n\"Article III judicial power.\"    The government correctly asserts\nthat her claim is meritless, as a Supreme Court case cited in\nMarino's own appellate brief confirms.            See Freytag v.\nCommissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 890-91 (1991) (holding that the Tax\nCourt, although an Article I court, exercises judicial power much\nlike that of the federal district courts); see also Crain v.\nCommissioner, 737 F.2d 1417, 1417-18 (5th Cir. 1984) (sanctioning\ntaxpayer   for   \"spurious\"   claim   that   the  Tax   Court   was\n\"unconstitutionally exercising Article III powers\").\n\n                               -5-\n\fappellee Brown advised her to do.     Under the circumstances, we\n\nreadily affirm the district court's judgment. See Skwira v. United\n\nStates, 344 F.3d 64, 71 (1st Cir. 2003) (in dismissals for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction, the court of appeals reviews the\n\ndistrict court's predicate fact-finding for clear error and uses de\n\nnovo review for its \"ultimate conclusion regarding the existence\n\nvel non of subject matter jurisdiction\").\n\n     B.     Sanctions\n\n     In a separate motion, the government asks this court to impose\n\na $4,000 \"lump sum\" sanction on Marino for her frivolous appeal,\n\nciting Fed. R. App. P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. § 1912.8         It offers\n\nevidence that this sum is less than the average expense ($4,900) it\n\nincurred in attorney salaries and other costs to defend typical\n\nfrivolous tax appeals during the 1998-99 time period.9     It also\n\nrefers us to a recent frivolous tax appeal, Stafford v. United\n\nStates, 208 F.3d 1177, 1179 (10th Cir. 2000), in which the Tenth\n\nCircuit imposed a $4,000 sanction based essentially on the same\n\nevidence.\n\n     Marino opposes the request for sanctions. Among other things,\n\n\n     8\n      Rule 38 allows the imposition of \"just damages\" and single or\ndouble costs for a frivolous appeal, and § 1912 allows the same for\nan appeal which has caused \"delay\" for the prevailing party.\n     9\n      The government has submitted a supporting declaration,\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1745, by government attorney Annette M.\nWietecha. Attorney Wietecha works in the Appellate Section of the\nTax Division of the Department of Justice and has had primary\nresponsibility for defending this case.\n\n                               -6-\n\fshe claims that she did not appeal in bad faith or with intent to\n\nharass, that she is pro se, that she had no notice that her\n\narguments were frivolous, and that her actions did not cause any\n\ndelay.    She does not contend that she cannot pay the amount\n\nrequested, and she has not questioned the government's evidence.\n\n     Marino's objections lack merit.               Sanctions are appropriate\n\nwhenever the appeal, objectively viewed, is completely frivolous,\n\nas it was in this instance.            J. Moore, 16A Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure,   §   3984.1,   at   647-50       (3d   ed.    2003)   (stating    that\n\nsubjective motivation is irrelevant where an appeal is \"utterly\n\nwithout merit\").     Moreover, we have routinely sanctioned pro se\n\ntaxpayers who pursue frivolous appeals.                  E.g., Kelly v. United\n\nStates, 789 F.2d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam).                        While\n\nimposing double costs in past cases, we have warned that filing\n\nfrivolous appeals will expose pro se taxpayers to \"the full range\n\nof sanctions,\" including a flat damages award in lieu of attorney's\n\nfees and costs.     Lefebvre v. Commissioner, 830 F.2d 417, 420, 421\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam).                Other circuits have routinely\n\nimposed   the    latter-type    flat    sanction     in    frivolous   taxpayer\n\nappeals, id. at 420 & n.4 (citing the cases).\n\n     IRS personnel twice warned Marino that she could be sanctioned\n\nin Tax Court proceedings for frivolously opposing the government's\n\ncollection activities.      Their notification satisfies any advance\n\nwarning requirement that this circuit may have.              See Lefebvre, 830\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fF.2d at 421 (imposing appellate sanction on taxpayer who had been\n\nwarned by the Tax Court about the possibility of sanctions in that\n\ncourt).    On this record, Marino appealed, obviously knowing that\n\nshe had no reasonable expectation of success.                   She knew that the\n\nIRS's determination upholding its lien was based on her income tax\n\nliability, and she knew that she had to seek judicial review in the\n\nTax Court.     Instead, she filed her petition for review in the\n\ndistrict    court,    falsely   asserting       that    the   case    involved     an\n\nunderlying employment tax liability.            The district court's rulings\n\nand the case law it cited, which she utterly ignored, put her on\n\nnotice that she lacked any basis for an appeal.                       We can only\n\nconclude that she has pursued this appeal in order to further delay\n\nthe government's collection of income tax from her.\n\n     The    government's      request     for    a     lump     sum   sanction     is\n\nreasonable.    We see no point in requiring the government to submit\n\na detailed statement of its fees and costs, which would prolong the\n\npresent proceedings at further expense to the government and this\n\ncourt.     See Parker v. Commissioner, 117 F.3d 785, 787 (5th Cir.\n\n1997) (per curiam) (describing the advantages of making a lump sum\n\naward under Rule 38).\n\n     The $4,000 sanction requested by the government--which may be\n\nless than     its    actual   cost   of   defending      this    appeal--is      also\n\nreasonable.    However, because this is the first case involving a\n\npro se taxpayer in which we impose a significantly higher sanction\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthan double costs, we set the sanction in this instance at $2,000.\n\nWe warn those who may contemplate filing frivolous appeals in\n\nsimilar   egregiously   meritless    cases   of   this   type   that,   when\n\nwarranted, we may well be expected to impose the figure of at least\n\n$4,000 in future such appeals.\n\n     Affirmed.   A sanction of $2,000 is imposed on the appellant.\n\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 38; 28 U.S.C. § 1912.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

We affirm. In addition, we grant the government's request for sanctions, albeit in a lesser amount than requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") filed a Notice of Federal Tax Lien on Marino's property relative to her income tax liability for the 1996 tax year. On October 29, 2002, a Collection Due Process (\"CDP\") hearing was held, at which Marino contested her underlying income tax liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She made arguments which the IRS settlement officer informed her had been consistently rejected as groundless by the courts. For example, she asserted that she was not liable for the income tax, that she did not have to file returns, that the Internal Revenue Code was unconstitutional, and other similar \"tax protester\" arguments. The IRS settlement officer gave her a copy of <i>Pierson v. Commissioner,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1840062</span></span> (2000), which warns taxpayers about sanctions for frivolously opposing the collection of taxes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 27, 2002, appellee Brown issued a Notice of Determination upholding the lien. Brown instructed Marino to file any challenge to the determination in the Tax Court. Citing the <i>Pierson</i> case, she reminded Marino that seeking review primarily for delay and asserting frivolous or groundless positions could result in sanctions of up to $25,000. Brown also advised Marino that the IRS considered her objections to its collection efforts to be groundless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marino then filed the instant petition against Brown in the district court, seeking review of the IRS's determination. Although the IRS was seeking to collect on an income tax liability, she asserted that the case involved \"employment taxes.\" The government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, without opposition by Marino. In an endorsed order, the district court granted the motion, stating: \"ALLOWED, the motion appearing well founded and no opposition having been filed. <i>See True v. Commissioner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428498\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428498/true-v-cir/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

She contended that she had not received a copy of the government's motion to dismiss and argued that the district court had jurisdiction over her petition. In an endorsed order, the district court denied her motion, stating that \"no good cause [had] been shown to reconsider on the merits, even if plaintiff did not previously receive a copy of the motion to dismiss.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marino appealed the district court's orders dismissing her petition and denying reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Jurisdiction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties essentially agree that the Tax Court has jurisdiction over cases involving an underlying income tax liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> However, Marino asserts on appeal, as in the district court, that this case involves \"employment taxes,\" so that the district court has jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> She makes other arguments as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> For its part, the government contends that the IRS's determination upholding its lien on Marino's property was based on an underlying income tax liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that the government's position is the correct one. The documents attached to Marino's district court petition &#8212; e.g., the Notice of Federal Tax Lien &#8212; verify that the lien was based on her income tax liability for the 1996 tax year. Accordingly, the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction, and Marino should have filed her petition for review in that court, as appellee Brown advised her to do. Under the circumstances, we readily affirm the district court's judgment. <i>See Skwira v.

Among other things, she claims that she did not appeal in bad faith or with intent to harass, that she is pro se, that she had no notice that her arguments were frivolous, and that her actions did not cause any delay.
