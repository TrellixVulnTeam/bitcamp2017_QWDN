Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Joseph F. Krowski, with whom Law Office of Joseph F. Krowski\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Susanne G. Reardon, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           August 14, 2006\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge.            James Michael Kater, who is\n\nserving a life sentence for murder and kidnapping, appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his petition for habeas corpus relief\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.      Our review is subject to the Antiterrorism\n\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No.\n\n104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996).           Kater's habeas petition raises,\n\ninter alia, a due process claim based on the introduction of a\n\nprior bad act for the purpose of establishing identity, an unusual\n\nvoir dire claim, and a claim under the Confrontation Clause related\n\nto     the   introduction    of   testimony       by   previously    hypnotized\n\nwitnesses.      We reject Kater's claims, affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of the petition, and resolve one issue of first impression\n\nfor this court.\n\n             We address Kater's assumption that in a federal habeas\n\nproceeding on de novo review of a state court's judgment under\n\nFortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39 (1st Cir. 2001), we may apply a new\n\nrule    of   law,   which   was   not   clearly    established      by   existing\n\nprecedent at the time the state conviction became final.                     Our\n\ncircuit law has not yet addressed this aftermath issue to Fortini,\n\nwhich    held   that,   post-AEDPA,     preserved      federal   constitutional\n\nclaims on habeas would be reviewed de novo, when such claims were\n\nnot \"adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\"                   28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 2254(d); Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.             While we consider such\n\nclaims \"de novo,\" that does not mean we review those claims as an\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\foriginal matter, as if the claims were raised on direct appeal.\n\nRather, the claims of habeas petitioners, even on de novo review\n\nunder Fortini, continue to be limited by the principles laid out in\n\nTeague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), and its progeny, which\n\ngenerally bar claims that require the application or announcement\n\nof \"new rules\" of law.\n\n                                I.\n\n          This case has an over twenty-year history in the courts\n\nof Massachusetts. We begin with a thumbnail sketch of that history\n\nto set the stage.\n\n          Kater was indicted in 1978 in Massachusetts for the\n\nkidnapping and murder of a fifteen-year-old girl, Mary Lou Arruda.\n\nHe was convicted in 1979, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (SJC) reversed the conviction because certain hypnotically\n\naided testimony had been introduced at trial.       Commonwealth v.\n\nKater (Kater I), 447 N.E.2d 1190 (Mass. 1983).   The SJC ordered the\n\ntrial court on remand to hold a hearing and to admit only such\n\ntestimony as was based on pre-hypnotic memories.    Commonwealth v.\n\nKater (Kater II), 476 N.E.2d 593 (Mass. 1985).       After two more\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\ftrials ended inconclusively,1 Kater was tried for a fourth time.2\n\nKater       was    convicted   after   his     fourth   trial,   in   1996;   this\n\nconviction was upheld by the SJC.               Commonwealth v. Kater (Kater\n\nVII), 734 N.E.2d 1164 (Mass. 2000).               It is the affirmance of his\n\nconviction at his fourth trial which is at issue here.\n\n                  Before the fourth trial began, the state trial court\n\nordered that the testimony of previously hypnotized witnesses be\n\nlimited to facts that had been documented in the record before the\n\nwitnesses had been hypnotized.                 Id. at 1177.      This was more\n\nfavorable to Kater than the SJC's directive that pre-hypnotic\n\ntestimony be separated from hypnotically aided testimony. Id. The\n\ntrial court also ruled, at motion in limine before trial, that the\n\nprosecution could introduce evidence of Kater's state conviction\n\nfor a similar kidnapping, for the purpose of establishing Kater's\n\nidentity.3          Id. at 1172, 1175.   The SJC affirmed this ruling.         Id.\n\nat 1176.\n\n\n        1\n        After a second conviction in 1986, the SJC reversed the\nconviction again based on the introduction of hypnotically aided\ntestimony.   Commonwealth v. Kater (Kater III), 567 N.E.2d 885\n(Mass. 1991). It later affirmed a trial court order suppressing\ncertain evidence that the state had failed to show was based on\npre-hypnotic memory. Commonwealth v. Kater (Kater IV), 592 N.E.2d\n1328 (Mass. 1992). A third trial ended in a mistrial.\n        2\n         Kater failed in his double jeopardy challenge to the\nindictment leading to the fourth trial. See Kater v. Commonwealth\n(Kater V), 653 N.E.2d 576 (Mass. 1995).\n     3\n        The SJC rejected as premature Kater's interlocutory\nchallenge to the admission of this prior bad act evidence. Kater\nv. Commonwealth (Kater VI), 659 N.E.2d 273 (Mass. 1995).\n\n                                         -4-\n\f           At    jury   selection,     on    Kater's    motion    and   with   the\n\nCommonwealth's agreement, the state trial court asked potential\n\njurors individually a second round of questions.               After describing\n\nKater's prior conviction, the judge asked whether knowledge of that\n\nconviction      would   affect   the   jurors'       ability     to   accept   and\n\nunderstand the presumption of innocence and the limitation on the\n\nuse of prior bad act evidence to the issue of identification.                  Id.\n\nSeven of fifteen jurors were struck based on their responses to\n\nthese questions.\n\n           The trial court later decided that voir dire on the prior\n\nbad acts was inappropriate, and excused the previously selected\n\njurors.   Id.    It did so for two reasons.          First, it found that \"if\n\nevidence of other crimes were admitted, it would not be extraneous\n\nwithin the meaning of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234, ยง 28], and voir\n\ndire would not be authorized.\"          Id.       The court referred to state\n\nlaw \"provid[ing] that a trial judge must, for the purpose of\n\ndetermining whether a juror stands indifferent in a case, conduct\n\nan individual voir dire of each prospective juror if it appears\n\nthat a substantial risk exists that an extraneous issue might\n\naffect the outcome of the case.\"            Id.   (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n234, ยง 28). The SJC said that, under Massachusetts law, \"[a]n\n\nextraneous issue is one that goes beyond the record and raises a\n\nserious question of possible prejudice.\" Id. at 1175. Second, the\n\ntrial court found that \"if the evidence [of prior bad acts] were\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fultimately not admitted at trial, the questions would have then\n\ncontaminated the jury.\"   Id. at 1174.     Jury selection then began\n\nanew without any inquiry as to Kater's prior conviction.\n\n          The SJC affirmed the reasoning of the state trial court\n\non the voir dire issue on state law grounds.         Id. at 1174-75\n\n(\"Kater's obstacle is that the issue of his prior similar crime was\n\nnot extraneous. . . . Here, the issue of Kater's prior similar\n\ncrime did not lie beyond the record.    Evidence of the prior similar\n\ncrime was fully relevant and probative on the issue of Kater's\n\nidentity as the perpetrator.\").\n\n                                  II.\n\n          We briefly recount the facts as found by the state court,\n\nwhich are detailed in Kater VII, 734 N.E.2d at 1170-72.       Arruda\n\ndisappeared in September 1978 while riding a bike near her home in\n\nRaynham, Massachusetts.   Her bike was found the same day; nearby\n\nwas a Benson & Hedges cigarette and a car tire track with an\n\nacceleration mark and an abnormal tread wear pattern.     Two months\n\nlater, in November 1978, Arruda's clothed body was found tied to a\n\ntree.   A pathologist testified that Arruda had been tied to the\n\ntree while conscious, but that she lost consciousness and that the\n\nweight of Arruda's head against the restraint around her neck\n\nstrangled her.   Id. at 1170.\n\n          Around the time Arruda disappeared, five individuals saw\n\na green car with a black or silver stripe speeding through the\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fneighborhood where Arruda had been abducted.    Id.   Four of these\n\nwitnesses were hypnotized during the course of the investigation\n\ninto Arruda's disappearance.     Kater I, 447 N.E.2d at 1194.    At\n\ntrial, the five witnesses testified that Kater's car was similar in\n\ncolor, size, and markings to the car they had seen on the day of\n\nArruda's disappearance. Kater VII, 734 N.E.2d at 1171. One person\n\ndescribed the driver of the car as a white male with dark curly\n\nhair and dark-rimmed glasses.   Police developed a composite sketch\n\nof the driver based on eyewitness accounts.    Id. at 1170.\n\n          While Arruda was still missing, Kater was interviewed by\n\nthe police.   The police noted that Kater smoked Benson & Hedges\n\ncigarettes, and that his appearance matched both the composite\n\nsketch and the description of the driver given by one witness.\n\nKater allowed the police to search his car, a bright green Opel\n\nwith a black racing stripe.   The right front tire tread of the car\n\nhad a unusual wear pattern consistent with the tire track found\n\nnear Arruda's bicycle.   In the car the police found two cartons of\n\nBenson & Hedges cigarettes and two pairs of dark-rimmed glasses.\n\nIn the trunk of the car, under some luggage, the police found two\n\nnewspapers, each open to articles about Arruda's disappearance.\n\nKater made a statement to the police as to his whereabouts at the\n\ntime of Arruda's disappearance, but the SJC found Kater's alibi to\n\nhave been inaccurate.    Id. at 1171.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           Kater, in 1969, had pled guilty to a crime which the SJC\n\nstated was \"strikingly similar\" to the one perpetrated against\n\nArruda.    Id. at 1176.         Evidence of this prior conviction was\n\nintroduced at Kater's fourth trial for the purpose of establishing\n\nKater's identity as the perpetrator of the crime against Arruda.\n\nKater had abducted a thirteen-year-old girl, Jacalyn Bussiere, who\n\nwas walking her bicycle on a secluded street.          He forced her into\n\nhis car and drove her to a wooded area.          Kater hit Bussiere over\n\nthe head and tried to force her face into a stream.          After Bussiere\n\nfought back, Kater forced Bussiere into the car again and drove her\n\ndeeper into the woods, where he tied her hands, ankles, torso and\n\nneck against a tree; this was similar to how Arruda's body had been\n\nfound   tied.      Bussiere    lost   consciousness   for   some    time,   but\n\neventually managed to free herself and report the crime to the\n\npolice.   Id.     She identified Kater as her assailant.           Id. at 1172\n\nn.3.\n\n           Kater was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of\n\nArruda, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility\n\nof parole.      Id. at 1170.\n\n                                      III.\n\n           It is a fundamental principle of the law of federal\n\nhabeas corpus in non-death-penalty cases that no habeas claim is\n\nstated as to state court criminal convictions unless the alleged\n\nerrors are violations of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fUnited States.   Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67, 68 (1991); see\n\nalso 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2241(c)(3), 2254(a).          Errors based on violations\n\nof state law are not within the reach of federal habeas petitions\n\nunless there is a federal constitutional claim raised.                Estelle,\n\n502 U.S. at 67-68.\n\n           Indeed,    the   question     of   whether    anything     at   trial\n\nviolated state law in a non-death-penalty case is no part of a\n\nfederal habeas court's review of a state conviction.                Id. at 67.\n\nThis reflects the reality under the Constitution that the states\n\nare free to adopt any number of different rules for criminal\n\nproceedings so long as the application of those rules does not\n\nviolate   federal    constitutional      requirements.        See   id.    at    70\n\n(\"Cases in this Court have long proceeded on the premise that the\n\nDue Process Clause guarantees the fundamental elements of fairness\n\nin a criminal trial. . . . But it has never been thought that such\n\ncases   establish    this   Court   as   a    rule   making   organ    for      the\n\npromulgation of state rules of criminal procedure.\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554,\n\n563-64 (1967))).\n\n           The Commonwealth argues for dismissal of the petition on\n\nthe basis that only state-law claims are asserted.              We agree with\n\nthe Commonwealth that if nothing other than questions of compliance\n\nwith state law were at issue, no habeas petition would lie.                There\n\nare, though, no clean and clear dividing lines for the federal\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fcourts as to when a state court ruling about state law, on\n\nevidentiary or other grounds, may transgress the Constitution. The\n\nhabeas petition here is framed in terms of violations of federal\n\nlaw, and we deal only with the federal questions presented.\n\n            The    Supreme     Court       has     \"defined       the     category    of\n\ninfractions that violate 'fundamental fairness' very narrowly.\"\n\nDowling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (1990). The petitioner\n\nargues that his state trial was so fundamentally unfair as to\n\nviolate   due     process     of    law   under        the    Fifth    and   Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution.                    Kater argues that it was\n\nunconstitutional to admit certain types of evidence and not to\n\nconduct voir dire.       He argues that evidence about his prior crime\n\n(for which he was convicted in 1969), which was admitted under the\n\nexception to the exclusion for prior bad acts evidence for evidence\n\ntending to show identity, was constitutionally barred.                          He also\n\nargues that his trial was fundamentally unfair because the trial\n\njudge refused to ask voir dire questions describing the evidence of\n\nthe prior crime, already determined to be admissible, and asking\n\nwhether   the     potential    jurors      would       remain    unaffected     by   the\n\nevidence.     This failure to ask the voir dire questions, he says,\n\nresulted in a jury biased against him, in violation of the Sixth\n\nand   Fourteenth     Amendments.           Kater       also    argues    that   it   was\n\nunconstitutional to admit testimony from witnesses who were once\n\nhypnotized.        Finally,    he    says,       the    federal       Constitution   was\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\foffended, under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979), when the\n\njury convicted him based on insufficient evidence.\n\n          All   of   these   issues     were   presented   in   federal\n\nconstitutional terms to the SJC.      The SJC ruled on the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence and admission of the prior bad acts in federal\n\nconstitutional terms, see Kater VII, 734 N.E.2d at 1173, 1175-76,\n\nand so we address these claims through the lens of the deferential\n\nstatutory standards under AEDPA.      See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d).    As to\n\nthese claims, Kater must show the SJC's decision \"1) 'was contrary\n\nto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates' or 2) 'was based on an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\n\nproceeding.'\" McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(en banc) (quoting 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)).\n\n          As to the admission of evidence from once-hypnotized\n\nwitnesses and the voir dire issue, the SJC did not address those\n\nissues in federal constitutional terms, so our review is de novo.\n\nDiBenedetto v. Hall, 272 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\n\nFortini, 257 F.3d at 47 (\"AEDPA imposes a requirement of deference\n\nto state court decisions, but we can hardly defer to the state\n\ncourt on an issue that the state court did not address.\").       Before\n\ntackling the merits of Kater's claims, it is important to correct\n\na flawed assumption, present in Kater's argument on the voir dire\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fpoint, as to what \"de novo\" review under Fortini means and to\n\nclarify our standard of review.\n\n            In the end, none of these purported errors -- voir dire,\n\nintroduction of evidence, or sufficiency of evidence -- raises a\n\nplausible   claim   of   denial   of    federal      constitutional     rights,\n\nnotwithstanding the very able advocacy by Kater's counsel.\n\nA.          De Novo Review in Habeas Cases\n\n            In arguing that voir dire on the effect of prior bad act\n\nevidence is constitutionally mandated, Kater points to state court\n\ncases, and argues that these cases \"suggest the way [the] Supreme\n\nCourt would rule.\"       Kater wrongly assumes that \"de novo\" review\n\nafter AEDPA, which applies when the state court did not adjudicate\n\nthe presented federal constitutional issue on the merits, see\n\nFortini, 257 F.3d at 47,4 means that this court can decide the\n\nissue as an original matter, whether or not the result would be the\n\nannouncement   of   a    new   rule    that    has   not   yet   been   clearly\n\nestablished by existing precedent.            Not so.   De novo review under\n\nFortini does not eliminate the need for a habeas court to engage in\n\nthe analysis mandated by Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989).\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       There is, of course, the need for a habeas petitioner to\nhave met \"certain preliminary criteria before we can reach the\nmerits of his claim,\" such as fair presentation of claims to the\nstate court, exhaustion of state remedies, and the lack of\nprocedural default. See McCambridge, 303 F.3d at 34.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f           Teague and its progeny remain good law after AEDPA.\n\nTeague analysis applies in habeas cases filed before AEDPA's\n\neffective date.    See Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 351-52\n\n(2004).    Teague analysis applies even in cases to which the AEDPA\n\nstandard of review, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1), applies.   See Horn v.\n\nBanks, 536 U.S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam) (noting that \"the\n\nAEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct\"); see also Sepulveda v.\n\nUnited States, 330 F.3d 55, 66 (1st Cir. 2003) (requiring Teague\n\nanalysis for claims of federal habeas petitioners under ยง 2255).\n\nKater's assumption -- that a federal court engaged in de novo\n\nreview does not ask whether a particular claim is based on already\n\nclearly established federal law -- would lead to an end-run around\n\nthe Teague doctrine.\n\n           In its canonical form, Teague generally bars habeas\n\nclaims based on retroactive application of \"new rules\" announced\n\nafter a state conviction has become final.5       489 U.S. at 310\n\n(plurality opinion).   This rule has also been interpreted to mean\n\nthat habeas claims requiring the announcement of new rules are also\n\ngenerally barred. See Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 487-88 (1990)\n\n(\"As [petitioner] is before us on collateral review, we must first\n\ndetermine whether the relief sought would create a new rule [under\n\nTeague].    If so, we will neither announce nor apply the new rule\n\n\n\n     5\n      The general rule is subject to exceptions not relevant here.\nSee Sepulveda, 330 F.3d at 59-60 (describing the exceptions).\n\n                                -13-\n\fsought by [petitioner] unless it would fall into one of two narrow\n\nexceptions.\"    (citations omitted)).\n\n          \"To apply the paradigm of nonretroactivity required by\n\nTeague, we must determine when the petitioner's conviction became\n\nfinal and 'whether a state court considering [the petitioner's]\n\nclaim at the time his conviction became final would have felt\n\ncompelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule [he]\n\nseeks was required by the Constitution.'\"     Curtis v. Duval, 124\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997) (emphasis added) (quoting Saffle, 494\n\nU.S. at 488).   In other words, a rule is new under Teague if it is\n\nnot \"compelled by existing precedent.\"     Id.; see also Beard v.\n\nBanks, 542 U.S. 406, 413 (2004) (question under Teague is whether,\n\nas of the time the conviction became final, the rule was \"'dictated\n\nby then-existing precedent'\" (quoting Lambrix v. Singletary, 520\n\nU.S. 518, 527-28 (1997))).\n\n          The Teague analysis, while different than the AEDPA\n\nstandard, is related to AEDPA review in at least one sense.   That\n\nis because, under AEDPA, the inquiry on habeas is whether the\n\nhabeas claim is based on \"clearly established Federal law.\"     28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1); see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412\n\n(2000).   Whatever the differences between the Teague analysis and\n\nthe standard of review in AEDPA, the focus of both is, in essence,\n\non the substantive standards set by clearly established federal\n\nlaw.   Whether habeas review is under the deferential standard\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fprovided in ยง 2254(d)(1) or under the de novo standard of Fortini,\n\nstate habeas petitioners may not seek release on federal law\n\ngrounds which have yet to be clearly established.    Thus, in this\n\ncase, it is irrelevant whether (as the petitioner asserts) the\n\nSupreme Court might someday recognize a constitutional right to\n\nvoir dire on prior bad acts evidence.   The question, under Teague,\n\nis whether such a constitutional right was clearly established by\n\nexisting precedent at the time the state conviction became final.\n\nB.        Claims Related to Kater's Prior Conviction\n\n          We start with what may be the most important issue to\n\nKater -- the arguments based on use of evidence of his prior\n\nconviction. It is commonly said that \"mere\" errors under state law\n\nin the admission of evidence are not cognizable under federal\n\nhabeas review.   See 1 Hertz & Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus\n\nPractice and Procedure ยง 9.1, at 411-12 (4th ed. 2001).   This means\n\nthat the question is not whether the admission of the evidence was\n\nstate-law error, but whether any error rendered the trial so\n\nfundamentally unfair that it violated the Due Process Clause.   See\n\nPetrillo v. O'Neill, 428 F.3d 41, 44 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2005); see\n\nalso Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47 (\"[N]ot every ad hoc mistake in\n\napplying state evidence rules, even in a murder case, should be\n\ncalled a violation of due process; otherwise every significant\n\nstate court error in excluding evidence offered by the defendant\n\nwould be a basis for undoing the conviction.\").\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f              1.     Admission of Prior 1969 Conviction\n\n              Kater argues that the evidence of his prior conviction\n\nwas not in fact relevant to identity under Massachusetts state law,\n\nand that this mistake was so serious as to be federally cognizable.\n\nHe also argues that the evidence, even if thought to be relevant to\n\nidentity, was so prejudicial as to make his trial fundamentally\n\nunfair.\n\n              He also complains, incorrectly, that the state court\n\nshould have been bound by the federal law of the case doctrine and\n\ntherefore should have excluded the prior bad acts evidence because\n\nit had not been admitted in the prior three trials.                 The federal\n\nlaw of the case doctrine does not apply to state courts.                    See\n\nEstelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68; see also Arizona v. California, 460\n\nU.S.   605,    618   (1983)   (\"Law   of     the   case   directs    a   court's\n\ndiscretion, it does not limit the tribunal's power.\").\n\n              It is, though, still possible that admission of the\n\nevidence was fundamentally unfair so as to prejudice Kater.               Kater\n\nmakes this argument, and says that the Commonwealth cannot have it\n\nboth ways.     That is, when Kater invoked the Double Jeopardy Clause\n\nto block his fourth trial, the state courts ruled against the\n\nclaim, finding there was adequate evidence in the record, without\n\nadmission of the prior bad acts, to support the conviction in a\n\ntrial where the evidence was not introduced.              He argues that this\n\nfinding that the prior 1969 conviction was not necessary to his\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fconviction became the law of the case.                      As such, it was surplusage\n\nto admit the prior bad acts, and prejudicial to him to do so.\n\n               On extreme facts, it may be theoretically possible to\n\nfind    that    a     state      court's      evaluative         judgment     --     that   the\n\nprejudicial effect does not substantially outweigh the probative\n\nvalue    --     was       such    an     unreasonable           application     of    clearly\n\nestablished federal constitutional standards as to result in a\n\nfundamentally unfair trial.                   In practice, such a case -- if one\n\nexists -- will be very rare.               The SJC's conclusion that the bad act\n\nevidence of Kater's prior conviction showed identity was quite\n\nreasonable,         and    while        adverse      to    Kater,      was    not    unfairly\n\nprejudicial.         The evidence powerfully went to identity.                        The SJC\n\nrecounted the following similarities between Kater's past crime and\n\nthe Arruda case: both victims were young girls, both were abducted\n\non a rural residential road and placed in a car, both were brought\n\nto a dense wooded area, both were tied to a tree in a similar\n\nmanner, both were bound around the neck in such a way that\n\nstrangulation might result, and both were left in isolated areas of\n\nthe woods.      Kater VII, 734 N.E.2d at 1176 & n.7.                    As the SJC found,\n\nthe two cases were \"strikingly similar,\" with a \"modus operandi\n\n. . . so distinctive as to make the evidence highly probative.\"\n\nId. at 1176.\n\n               We   agree        with   the    SJC,       and    see   no    basis    for   any\n\nconclusion that this evidence of his prior conviction unfairly\n\n\n                                              -17-\n\fprejudiced Kater, much less that the trial was fundamentally\n\nunfair.6\n\n                2.       Voir Dire on Prior Conviction\n\n                Kater's innovative voir dire argument rests on a mistaken\n\nview       of   the   purpose   and    limits     of   a   defendant's   federal\n\nconstitutional right to conduct voir dire for bias.                 Again, states\n\nmay make different choices as to this topic; our concern is Kater's\n\nfederal constitutional right.\n\n                Kater's argument is based on these propositions:\n\n1.     The Fourteenth Amendment requires that jurors be impartial.\n\nMorgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 729 (1992).\n\n2.    The U.S. Supreme Court has not endorsed the distinction made by\n\nthe    state     court    between     requiring   voir     dire   questioning   on\n\nextraneous issues -- if it appears that a substantial risk exists\n\nthat the extraneous issue might affect the outcome of the case --\n\nand not requiring it on non-extraneous issues relevant to and in\n\nthe record of the case.         He argues that if the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nwere to address the issue, it would conclude, as apparently have\n\nthe state courts of California, see People v. Chapman, 18 Cal.\n\n\n\n       6\n      Kater also argues that the admission of the prior conviction\nviolated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Kater argues that he is being\npunished twice for the 1968 crime against Bussiere: once because of\nhis conviction in 1969, and again by the admission of the 1969\nconviction at his trial for Arruda's kidnapping and murder.\nKater's argument raises no question under the Double Jeopardy\nClause.   In no sense is admission of prior bad act evidence\n\"punishment\" within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fRptr. 2d 738 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993) (relying on People v. Ranney, 1\n\nP.2d 423 (Cal. 1931)),7 that there is a Sixth Amendment right to\n\nquestion jurors on possible prejudice or bias due to defendant's\n\nprior felony conviction.     We note that this step of the argument is\n\nbased on the erroneous assumption rejected above, that de novo\n\nreview under Fortini eliminates Teague review.\n\n3.   Kater argues, in any event, that the record here shows that\n\nwhen the questions were asked about his prior bad acts, almost half\n\nof the questioned jurors said they would have problems following\n\nthe court's instructions, and that this entitled Kater to insist\n\nthat questions be asked at voir dire about the effects of evidence\n\nas to his prior conviction.\n\n           We address Kater's argument on this issue with reference\n\nto   clearly   established   law   at   the   time   Kater's   state   court\n\nconviction became final,8 as required by Teague, focusing on the\n\nSupreme Court cases on which Kater builds his argument.\n\n\n\n      7\n       Kater also relies on other state cases requiring voir dire\non a defendant's prior convictions, but all of those cases rely on\ninterpretations of state, not federal, law. See State v. Collin,\n741 A.2d 1074 (Me. 1999); People v. Hosier, 116 N.Y.S. 911 (N.Y.\nApp. Div. 1903); Staggs v. State, 29 P.2d 135 (Okla. Crim. App.\n1934); State v. Ziebert, 579 P.2d 275 (Or. Ct. App. 1978).\n      8\n       \"A state conviction and sentence become final for purposes\nof [the Teague] analysis when the availability of direct appeal to\nthe state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a\npetition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely filed\npetition has been finally denied.\" Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S.\n383, 390 (1994). The SJC handed down its final opinion in August\n2000, and no petition for certiorari was filed.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f              The Supreme Court has explained that federal authority\n\nover voir dire in cases tried in state courts is \"limited to\n\nenforcing the commands of the United States Constitution.\"            Mu'Min\n\nv. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 422 (1991).9        So far, the Supreme Court\n\nhas recognized a defendant's constitutional right to voir dire\n\nquestioning only about whether jurors might be prejudiced against\n\ndefendant because of his race.      See Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S.\n\n524, 526-27 (1973); Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308, 314-15\n\n(1931). Even then, the inquiry in non-death-penalty cases need not\n\nbe made in every state court case in which the races of the victim\n\nand the defendant are different.        Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589,\n\n597-98 (1976); see generally 5 LaFave, et al., Criminal Procedure\n\nยง 22.3(a), at 293 (2d ed. 1999) (\"[T]he Court has as yet declined\n\nto   extend    the   [Ham]   doctrine   to   matters   other   than   racial\n\nprejudice.\").\n\n              Death penalty cases present special concerns about what\n\nvoir dire may be constitutionally required, and there are special\n\nvoir dire rules in such cases.      See Turner v. Murray, 476 U.S. 28,\n\n36-37 (1986) (holding that Due Process Clause entitled death-\n\npenalty-eligible defendant to voir dire questioning on racial bias\n\nwhere defendant was accused of interracial crime); see also Morgan\n\n\n\n      9\n       The Court carefully distinguished between constitutional\nrequirements which states must meet and the exercise of its broader\nsupervisory authority over cases tried in federal courts. Mu'Min,\n500 U.S. at 422, 424.\n\n                                   -20-\n\fv. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 738-39 (1992) (state trial court, under\n\nDue Process Clause, may not refuse to inquire into whether a\n\npotential    juror,    regardless      of    facts   in   the   case,      would\n\nautomatically impose the death sentence); 5 LaFave, et al., supra,\n\nยง 22.3(a), at 295.\n\n            To   date,      the    Court      has    recognized       no    such\n\nconstitutionally compelled right to voir dire in other contexts,\n\nincluding where the claim involved potential voir dire about\n\nextensive and prejudicial pretrial publicity, resulting in further\n\nquestioning jurors about the content of materials they had seen\n\nafter they had declared themselves impartial. See Mu'Min, 500 U.S.\n\nat 431-32.\n\n            There is no claim here of prejudicial bias of potential\n\njurors based on race or, indeed, any other suspect classification.\n\nThere is no claim the jurors prejudged the matter based on adverse\n\npretrial publicity.       Kater was not sentenced to death, but to life\n\nimprisonment,    and     the   voir   dire    requested   did   not     address\n\nsentencing at all.       All of the categories of cases for which the\n\nSupreme Court has recognized a constitutional right to voir dire\n\nhave involved preexisting views, not based on the evidence in the\n\ncase, which prospective jurors may bring into the courtroom with\n\nthem that impair their ability to fairly consider the evidence.\n\n            It is true that some state courts have concluded that, as\n\na matter of state policy, they will permit or even require voir\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fdire on whether a juror who has heard evidence of a defendant's\n\nprior bad acts can still follow the judge's instructions about the\n\nlimited purpose for such testimony.            Massachusetts has chosen not\n\nto follow that path, and requires voir dire questioning only where\n\nthere is a \"substantial risk . . . that an extraneous issue\" --\n\n\"one that goes beyond the record and raises a serious question of\n\npossible prejudice\" -- \"might affect the outcome of the case.\"\n\nKater VII, 734 N.E.2d at 1174-75 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234,\n\nยง 28).\n\n            The question is whether, given the clearly established\n\nfederal     law   at   the   time    Kater's    conviction    became     final,\n\nMassachusetts was compelled by the federal Constitution to require\n\nsuch voir dire on the effect of evidence, yet to be admitted, of\n\ndefendant's prior bad acts.         Massachusetts was not under any such\n\nconstitutional compulsion. Kater had no constitutional entitlement\n\nto question potential jurors on the effect of the prior bad act\n\nevidence.\n\nC.          Testimony From Previously Hypnotized Witnesses\n\n            Kater starts from the firm foundation that the Sixth\n\nAmendment Confrontation Clause guarantees that prosecution trial\n\ntestimony    be   subject    to     testing    by   the   defendant    via   the\n\nopportunity for cross-examination.             Crawford v. Washington, 541\n\nU.S. 36, 61 (2004) (stating that the Confrontation Clause \"commands\n\n. . . that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\ftesting in the crucible of cross-examination\").         Kater argues that\n\nhis   Confrontation   Clause   rights      were   violated   by    permitting\n\ntestimony from witnesses who had been hypnotized.                 See Clay v.\n\nVose, 771 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1985).            He also argues that the\n\nintroduction of this testimony violated due process and rendered\n\nhis trial fundamentally unfair.\n\n           In particular, Kater argues that the hypnosis led the\n\nwitnesses to become \"convinced of the absolute accuracy\" of their\n\ntestimony, supported by pre-hypnotic documentation, that Kater's\n\ncar was similar in color, size, and markings to the car they had\n\nseen on the day of the abduction, making them impermeable to cross-\n\nexamination. We rejected a similar argument by a habeas petitioner\n\nin Clay, a case in which the state court (unlike the state court\n\nhere) had not restricted witness testimony only to previously\n\ndocumented facts.     Id. at 3-5.\n\n           The risks that may be posed by testimony of previously\n\nhypnotized witnesses are simply not present here.            At Kater's last\n\ntrial, the trial judge allowed previously hypnotized witnesses to\n\ntestify only as to facts that were documented before the hypnosis\n\nprocedures were performed.     The SJC held that \"such limitations on\n\nthe witnesses eliminated the risk that their testimony might be\n\naffected by hypnosis.\"     Kater VII, 734 N.E.2d at 1177.           Admission\n\nof this evidence cannot possibly be said to have deprived the\n\npetitioner of a fundamentally fair trial.\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fD.          Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n            The Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense.        In re\n\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970).      The SJC concluded, under the\n\nfederal Jackson standard, that the evidence was sufficient.    Kater\n\nVII, 734 N.E.2d at 1172-73; see Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319 (\"[T]he\n\nrelevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\").    Although the AEDPA standard applies, even if\n\nwe were to review this sufficiency question de novo, we would\n\nagree.\n\nE.          Other Claims\n\n            Kater argues the trial was fundamentally unfair under the\n\nDue Process Clause because of the loss or destruction of evidence.\n\nThe SJC extensively analyzed these claims and rejected them.\n\nWhether viewed de novo or through the AEDPA lens, we conclude the\n\nclaims individually and collectively do not raise a claim of\n\nconstitutional dimension.\n\n            The dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f",

Our review is subject to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). Kater's habeas petition raises, inter alia, a due process claim based on the introduction of a prior bad act for the purpose of establishing identity, an unusual voir dire claim, and a claim under the Confrontation Clause related to the introduction of testimony by previously hypnotized witnesses.

Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39 (1st Cir.2001), we may apply a new rule of law, which was not clearly established by existing precedent at the time the state conviction became final. Our circuit law has not yet addressed this aftermath issue to <i>Fortini,</i> which held that, post-AEDPA, preserved federal constitutional claims on habeas would be reviewed de novo, when such claims were not \"adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d); <i>Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47. While we consider such claims \"de novo,\" that does not mean we review those claims as an original matter, as if the claims were raised on direct appeal. Rather, the claims of habeas petitioners, even on de novo review under <i>Fortini,</i> continue to be limited by the principles laid out in <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), and its progeny, which generally bar claims that require the application or announcement of \"new rules\" of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case has an over twenty-year history in the courts of Massachusetts.

He was convicted in 1979, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) reversed the conviction because certain hypnotically aided testimony had been introduced at trial. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Kater</i> (<i>Kater I</i>), 388 Mass. 519, 447 N.E.2d 1190 (1983). The SJC ordered the trial court on remand to hold a hearing and to admit only such testimony as was based on pre-hypnotic memories. <i>Commonwealth v. Kater</i> (<i>Kater II</i>), 394 Mass. 531, 476 N.E.2d 593 (1985). After two more trials ended inconclusively,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Kater was tried for a fourth time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Kater was convicted after his fourth trial, in 1996; this conviction was upheld by the SJC. <i>Commonwealth v. Kater</i> (<i>Kater VII</i>), 432 Mass. 404, 734 N.E.2d 1164 (2000). It is the affirmance of his conviction at his fourth trial which is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the fourth trial began, the state trial court ordered that the testimony of previously hypnotized witnesses be limited to facts that had been documented in the record before the witnesses had been hypnotized. <i>Id.</i> at 1177. This was more favorable to Kater than the SJC's directive that pre-hypnotic testimony be separated from hypnotically aided testimony. <i>Id.</i> The trial court also ruled, at motion in limine before trial, that the prosecution could introduce evidence of Kater's state conviction for a similar kidnapping, for the purpose of establishing Kater's identity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1172, 1175. The SJC affirmed this ruling. <i>Id.</i> at 1176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At jury selection, on Kater's motion and with the Commonwealth's agreement, the state trial court asked potential jurors individually a second round of questions. After describing Kater's prior conviction, the judge asked whether knowledge of that conviction would affect the jurors' ability to accept and understand the presumption of innocence and the limitation on the use of prior bad act evidence to the issue of identification. <i>Id.</i> Seven of fifteen jurors were struck based on their responses to these questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court later decided that voir dire on the prior bad acts was inappropriate, and excused the previously selected jurors. <i>Id.</i> It did so for two reasons. First, it found that \"if evidence of other crimes were admitted, it would not be extraneous within the meaning of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234, &#167; 28], and voir dire would not be authorized.\" <i>Id.</i> The court referred to state law \"provid[ing] that a trial judge must, for the purpose of determining whether a juror stands indifferent in a case, conduct an individual voir dire of each prospective juror if it appears that a substantial risk exists that an extraneous issue might affect the outcome of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234, &#167; 28). The SJC said that, under Massachusetts law, \"[a]n extraneous issue is one that goes beyond the record and raises a serious question of possible prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1175. Second, the trial court found that \"if the evidence [of prior bad acts] were ultimately not admitted at trial, the questions would have then contaminated the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1174. Jury selection then began anew without any inquiry as to Kater's prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC affirmed the reasoning of the state trial court on the voir dire issue on state law grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 1174-75 (\"Kater's obstacle is that the issue of his prior similar crime was not extraneous. . . . Here, the issue of Kater's prior similar crime did not lie beyond the record.

Arruda disappeared in September 1978 while riding a bike near her home in Raynham, Massachusetts. Her bike was found the same day; nearby was a Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette and a car tire track with an acceleration mark and an abnormal tread wear pattern. Two months later, in November 1978, Arruda's clothed body was found tied to a tree. A pathologist testified that Arruda had been tied to the tree while conscious, but that she lost consciousness and that the weight of Arruda's head against the restraint around her neck strangled her. <i>Id.</i> at 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the time Arruda disappeared, five individuals saw a green car with a black or silver stripe speeding through the neighborhood where Arruda had been abducted. <i>Id.</i> Four of these witnesses were hypnotized during the course of the investigation into Arruda's disappearance. <i>Kater I,</i> 447 N.E.2d at 1194. At trial, the five witnesses testified that Kater's car was similar in color, size, and markings to the car they had seen on the day of Arruda's disappearance. <i>Kater VII,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1171. One person described the driver of the car as a white male with dark curly hair and dark-rimmed glasses. Police developed a composite sketch of the driver based on eyewitness accounts. <i>Id.</i> at 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Arruda was still missing, Kater was interviewed by the police. The police noted that Kater smoked Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes, and that his appearance matched both the composite sketch and the description of the driver given by one witness. Kater allowed the police to search his car, a bright green Opel with a black racing stripe. The right front tire tread of the car had a unusual wear pattern consistent with the tire track found near Arruda's bicycle. In the car the police found two cartons of Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes and two pairs of dark-rimmed glasses. In the trunk of the car, under some luggage, the police found two newspapers, each open to articles about Arruda's disappearance. Kater made a statement to the police as to his whereabouts at the time of Arruda's disappearance, but the SJC found Kater's alibi to have been inaccurate. <i>Id.</i> at 1171.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kater, in 1969, had pled guilty to a crime which the SJC stated was \"strikingly similar\" to the one perpetrated against Arruda. <i>Id.</i> at 1176. Evidence of this prior conviction was introduced at Kater's fourth trial for the purpose of establishing Kater's identity as the perpetrator of the crime against Arruda. Kater had abducted a thirteen-year-old girl, Jacalyn Bussiere, who was walking her bicycle on a secluded street. He forced her into his car and drove her to a wooded area. Kater hit Bussiere over the head and tried to force her face into a stream. After Bussiere fought back, Kater forced Bussiere into the car again and drove her deeper into the woods, where he tied her hands, ankles, torso and neck against a tree; this was similar to how Arruda's body had been found tied. Bussiere lost consciousness for some time, but eventually managed to free herself and report the crime to the police. <i>Id.</i> She identified Kater as her assailant. <i>Id.</i> at 1172 n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kater was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Arruda, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. <i>Id.</i> at 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a fundamental principle of the law of federal habeas corpus in non-death-penalty cases that no habeas claim is stated as to state court criminal convictions unless the alleged errors are violations of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. <i>Estelle v. McGuire,</i> 502 U.S. 62, 67, 68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2241(c)(3), 2254(a). Errors based on violations of state law are not within the reach of federal habeas petitions unless there is a federal constitutional claim raised. <i>Estelle,</i> 502 U.S. at 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the question of whether anything at trial violated state law in a non-death-penalty case is no part of a federal habeas court's review of a state conviction. <i>Id.</i> at 67, 112 S.Ct. 475. This reflects the reality under the Constitution that the states are free to adopt any number of different rules for criminal proceedings so long as the application of those rules does not violate federal constitutional requirements. <i>See id.</i> at 70, 112 S.Ct. 475 (\"Cases in this Court have long proceeded on the premise that the Due Process Clause guarantees the fundamental elements of fairness in a criminal trial. . . . But it has never been thought that such cases establish this Court as a rule making organ for the promulgation of state rules of criminal procedure.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Spencer v. Texas,</i> 385 U.S. 554, 563-64, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argues for dismissal of the petition on the basis that only state-law claims are asserted. We agree with the Commonwealth that if nothing other than questions of compliance with state law were at issue, no habeas petition would lie. There are, though, no clean and clear dividing lines for the federal courts as to when a state court ruling about state law, on evidentiary or other grounds, may transgress the Constitution. The habeas petition here is framed in terms of violations of federal law, and we deal only with the federal questions presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has \"defined the category of infractions that violate `fundamental fairness' very narrowly.\" <i>Dowling v. United States,</i> 493 U.S. 342, 352, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990). The petitioner argues that his state trial was so fundamentally unfair as to violate due process of law under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Kater argues that it was unconstitutional to admit certain types of evidence and not to conduct voir dire. He argues that evidence about his prior crime (for which he was convicted in 1969), which was admitted under the exception to the exclusion for prior bad acts evidence for evidence tending to show identity, was constitutionally barred. He also argues that his trial was fundamentally unfair because the trial judge refused to ask voir dire questions describing the evidence of the prior crime, already determined to be admissible, and asking whether the potential jurors would remain unaffected by the evidence. This failure to ask the voir dire questions, he says, resulted in a jury biased against him, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Kater also argues that it was unconstitutional to admit testimony from witnesses who were once hypnotized. Finally, he says, the federal Constitution was offended, under <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), when the jury convicted him based on insufficient evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these issues were presented in federal constitutional terms to the SJC. The SJC ruled on the sufficiency of the evidence and admission of the prior bad acts in federal constitutional terms, <i>see Kater VII,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1173, 1175-76, and so we address these claims through the lens of the deferential statutory standards under AEDPA. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). As to these claims, Kater must show the SJC's decision \"1) `was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States' or 2) `was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.'\" <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc) (quoting 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the admission of evidence from once-hypnotized witnesses and the voir dire issue, the SJC did not address those issues in federal constitutional terms, so our review is de novo. <i>DiBenedetto v. Hall,</i> 272 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47 (\"AEDPA imposes a requirement of deference to state court decisions, but we can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address.\"). Before tackling the merits of Kater's claims, it is important to correct a flawed assumption, present in Kater's argument on the voir dire point, as to what \"de novo\" review under <i>Fortini</i> means and to clarify our standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, none of these purported errors&#8212;voir dire, introduction of evidence, or sufficiency of evidence&#8212;raises a plausible claim of denial of federal constitutional rights, notwithstanding the very able advocacy by Kater's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>De Novo Review in Habeas Cases</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that voir dire on the effect of prior bad act evidence is constitutionally mandated, Kater points to state court cases, and argues that these cases \"suggest the way [the] Supreme Court would rule.\" Kater wrongly assumes that \"de novo\" review after AEDPA, which applies when the state court did not adjudicate the presented federal constitutional issue on the merits, <i>see Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> means that this court can decide the issue as an original matter, whether or not the result would be the announcement of a new rule that has not yet been clearly established by existing precedent. Not so. De novo review under <i>Fortini</i> does not eliminate the need for a habeas court to engage in the analysis mandated by <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Teague</i> and its progeny remain good law after AEDPA. <i>Teague</i> analysis applies in habeas cases filed before AEDPA's effective date. <i>See Schriro v. Summerlin,</i> 542 U.S. 348, 351-52, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). <i>Teague</i> analysis applies even in cases to which the AEDPA standard of review, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), applies. <i>See Horn v. Banks,</i> 536 U.S. 266, 272, 122 S.Ct. 2147, 153 L.Ed.2d 301 (2002) (per curiam) (noting that \"the AEDPA and <i>Teague</i> inquiries are distinct\"); <i>see also Sepulveda v. United States,</i> 330 F.3d 55, 66 (1st Cir.2003) (requiring <i>Teague</i> analysis for claims of federal habeas petitioners under &#167; 2255). Kater's assumption&#8212;that a federal court engaged in de novo review does not ask whether a particular claim is based on already clearly established federal law&#8212;would lead to an end-run around the <i>Teague</i> doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its canonical form, <i>Teague</i> generally bars habeas claims based on retroactive application of \"new rules\" announced after a state conviction has become final.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> 489 U.S. at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). This rule has also been interpreted to mean that habeas claims requiring the announcement of new rules are also generally barred. <i>See Saffle v. Parks,</i> 494 U.S. 484, 487-88, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990) (\"As [petitioner] is before us on collateral review, we must first determine whether the relief sought would create a new rule [under <i>Teague</i>].

In other words, a rule is new under <i>Teague</i> if it is not \"compelled by existing precedent.\" <i>Id.; see also Beard v. Banks,</i> 542 U.S. 406, 413, 124 S.Ct. 2504, 159 L.Ed.2d 494 (2004) (question under <i>Teague</i> is whether, as of the time the conviction became final, the rule was \"`<i>dictated</i> by then-existing precedent'\" (quoting <i>Lambrix v. Singletary,</i> 520 U.S. 518, 527-28, 117 S.Ct. 1517, 137 L.Ed.2d 771 (1997))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Teague</i> analysis, while different than the AEDPA standard, is related to AEDPA review in at least one sense. That is because, under AEDPA, the inquiry on habeas is whether the habeas claim is based on \"clearly established Federal law.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1); <i>see also Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Whatever the differences between the <i>Teague</i> analysis and the standard of review in AEDPA, the focus of both is, in essence, on the substantive standards set by clearly established federal law. Whether habeas review is under the deferential standard provided in &#167; 2254(d)(1) or under the de novo standard of <i>Fortini,</i> state habeas petitioners may not seek release on federal law grounds which have yet to be clearly established. Thus, in this case, it is irrelevant whether (as the petitioner asserts) the Supreme Court might someday recognize a constitutional right to voir dire on prior bad acts evidence. The question, under <i>Teague,</i> is whether such a constitutional right was clearly established by existing precedent at the time the state conviction became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Claims Related to Kater's Prior Conviction</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with what may be the most important issue to Kater&#8212;the arguments based on use of evidence of his prior conviction. It is commonly said that \"mere\" errors under state law in the admission of evidence are not cognizable under federal habeas review. <i>See</i> 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman, <i>Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 9.1, at 411-12 (4th ed.2001). This means that the question is not whether the admission of the evidence was state-law error, but whether any error rendered the trial so fundamentally unfair that it violated the Due Process Clause. <i>See Petrillo v. O'Neill,</i> 428 F.3d 41, 44 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47 (\"[N]ot every ad hoc mistake in applying state evidence rules, even in a murder case, should be called a violation of due process; otherwise every significant state court error in excluding evidence offered by the defendant would be a basis for undoing the conviction.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Admission of Prior 1969 Conviction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kater argues that the evidence of his prior conviction was not in fact relevant to identity under Massachusetts state law, and that this mistake was so serious as to be federally cognizable. He also argues that the evidence, even if thought to be relevant to identity, was so prejudicial as to make his trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He also complains, incorrectly, that the state court should have been bound by the federal law of the case doctrine and therefore should have excluded the prior bad acts evidence because it had not been admitted in the prior three trials. The federal law of the case doctrine does not apply to state courts. <i>See Estelle,</i> 502 U.S. at 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475; <i>see also Arizona v. California,</i> 460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983) (\"Law of the case directs a court's discretion, it does not limit the tribunal's power.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, though, still possible that admission of the evidence was fundamentally unfair so as to prejudice Kater. Kater makes this argument, and says that the Commonwealth cannot have it both ways. That is, when Kater invoked the Double Jeopardy Clause to block his fourth trial, the state courts ruled against the claim, finding there was adequate evidence in the record, <i>without</i> admission of the prior bad acts, to support the conviction in a trial where the evidence was not introduced. He argues that this finding that the prior 1969 conviction was not necessary to his conviction became the law of the case. As such, it was surplusage to admit the prior bad acts, and prejudicial to him to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On extreme facts, it may be theoretically possible to find that a state court's evaluative judgment&#8212;that the prejudicial effect does not substantially outweigh the probative value&#8212;was such an unreasonable application of clearly established federal constitutional standards as to result in a fundamentally unfair trial. In practice, such a case&#8212;if one exists&#8212;will be very rare. The SJC's conclusion that the bad act evidence of Kater's prior conviction showed identity was quite reasonable, and while adverse to Kater, was not unfairly prejudicial. The evidence powerfully went to identity. The SJC recounted the following similarities between Kater's past crime and the Arruda case: both victims were young girls, both were abducted on a rural residential road and placed in a car, both were brought to a dense wooded area, both were tied to a tree in a similar manner, both were bound around the neck in such a way that strangulation might result, and both were left in isolated areas of the woods. <i>Kater VII,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1176 &amp; n. 7. As the SJC found, the two cases were \"strikingly similar,\" with a \"modus operandi . . . so distinctive as to make the evidence highly probative.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the SJC, and see no basis for any conclusion that this evidence of his prior conviction <i>unfairly</i> prejudiced Kater, much less that the trial was fundamentally unfair.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Voir Dire on Prior Conviction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kater's innovative voir dire argument rests on a mistaken view of the purpose and limits of a defendant's federal <i>constitutional</i> right to conduct voir dire for bias.

Illinois,</i> 504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The U.S. Supreme Court has not endorsed the distinction made by the state court between requiring voir dire questioning on <i>extraneous</i> issues&#8212;if it appears that a substantial risk exists that the extraneous issue might affect the outcome of the case&#8212;and not requiring it on non-extraneous issues relevant to and in the record of the case. He argues that if the U.S. Supreme Court were to address the issue, it would conclude, as apparently have the state courts of California, <i>see People v. Chapman,</i> 15 Cal.App.4th 136, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 738 (1993) (relying on <i>People v. Ranney,</i> 213 Cal. 70, 1 P.2d 423 (1931)),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> that there is a Sixth Amendment right to question jurors on possible prejudice or bias due to defendant's prior felony conviction. We note that this step of the argument is based on the erroneous assumption rejected above, that de novo review under <i>Fortini</i> eliminates <i>Teague</i> review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Kater argues, in any event, that the record here shows that when the questions were asked about his prior bad acts, almost half of the questioned jurors said they would have problems following the court's instructions, and that this entitled Kater to insist that questions be asked at voir dire about the effects of evidence as to his prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address Kater's argument on this issue with reference to clearly established law at the time Kater's state court conviction became final,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> as required by <i>Teague,</i> focusing on the Supreme Court cases on which Kater builds his argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has explained that federal authority over voir dire in cases tried in state courts is \"limited to enforcing the commands of the United States Constitution.\" <i>Mu'Min v. Virginia,</i> 500 U.S. 415, 422, 111 S.Ct. 1899, 114 L.Ed.2d 493 (1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> So far, the Supreme Court has recognized a defendant's constitutional right to voir dire questioning only about whether jurors might be prejudiced against defendant because of his race. <i>See Ham v. South Carolina,</i> 409 U.S. 524, 526-27, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973); <i>Aldridge v. United States,</i> 283 U.S. 308, 314-15, 51 S.Ct. 470, 75 L.Ed. 1054 (1931). Even then, the inquiry in non-death-penalty cases need not be made in every state court case in which the races of the victim and the defendant are different. <i>Ristaino v. Ross,</i> 424 U.S. 589, 597-98, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 47 L.Ed.2d 258 (1976); <i>see generally</i> 5 LaFave, et al., <i>Criminal Procedure</i> &#167; 22.3(a), at 293 (2d ed. 1999) (\"[T]he Court has as yet declined to extend the [<i>Ham</i>] doctrine to matters other than racial prejudice.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Death penalty cases present special concerns about what voir dire may be constitutionally required, and there are special voir dire rules in such cases. <i>See Turner v. Murray,</i> 476 U.S. 28, 36-37, 106 S.Ct. 1683, 90 L.Ed.2d 27 (1986) (holding that Due Process Clause entitled death-penalty-eligible defendant to voir dire questioning on racial bias where defendant was accused of interracial crime); <i>see also Morgan v. Illinois,</i> 504 U.S. 719, 738-39, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992) (state trial court, under Due Process Clause, may not refuse to inquire into whether a potential juror, regardless of facts in the case, would automatically impose the death sentence); 5 LaFave, et al., <i>supra,</i> &#167; 22.3(a), at 295.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To date, the Court has recognized no such constitutionally compelled right to voir dire in other contexts, including where the claim involved potential voir dire about extensive and prejudicial pretrial publicity, resulting in further questioning jurors about the content of materials they had seen after they had declared themselves impartial. <i>See Mu'Min,</i> 500 U.S. at 431-32, 111 S.Ct. 1899.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no claim here of prejudicial bias of potential jurors based on race or, indeed, any other suspect classification. There is no claim the jurors prejudged the matter based on adverse pretrial publicity. Kater was not sentenced to death, but to life imprisonment, and the voir dire requested did not address sentencing at all. All of the categories of cases for which the Supreme Court has recognized a constitutional right to voir dire have involved preexisting views, not based on the evidence in the case, which prospective jurors may bring into the courtroom with them that impair their ability to fairly consider the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that some state courts have concluded that, as a matter of state policy, they will permit or even require voir dire on whether a juror who has heard evidence of a defendant's prior bad acts can still follow the judge's instructions about the limited purpose for such testimony. Massachusetts has chosen not to follow that path, and requires voir dire questioning only where there is a \"substantial risk . . . that an extraneous issue\" &#8212; \"one that goes beyond the record and raises a serious question of possible prejudice\" &#8212; \"might affect the outcome of the case.\" <i>Kater VII,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1174-75 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234, &#167; 28).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether, given the clearly established federal law at the time Kater's conviction became final, Massachusetts was compelled by the federal Constitution to require such voir dire on the effect of evidence, yet to be admitted, of defendant's prior bad acts. Massachusetts was not under any such constitutional compulsion. Kater had no constitutional entitlement to question potential jurors on the effect of the prior bad act evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Testimony From Previously Hypnotized Witnesses</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kater starts from the firm foundation that the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause guarantees that prosecution trial testimony be subject to testing by the defendant via the opportunity for cross-examination. <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (stating that the Confrontation Clause \"commands . . . that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination\"). Kater argues that his Confrontation Clause rights were violated by permitting testimony from witnesses who had been hypnotized. <i>See Clay v. Vose,</i> 771 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1985). He also argues that the introduction of this testimony violated due process and rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In particular, Kater argues that the hypnosis led the witnesses to become \"convinced of the absolute accuracy\" of their testimony, supported by pre-hypnotic documentation, that Kater's car was similar in color, size, and markings to the car they had seen on the day of the abduction, making them impermeable to cross-examination. We rejected a similar argument by a habeas petitioner in <i>Clay,</i> a case in which the state court (unlike the state court here) had not restricted witness testimony only to previously documented facts. <i>Id.</i> at 3-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The risks that may be posed by testimony of previously hypnotized witnesses are simply not present here. At Kater's last trial, the trial judge allowed previously hypnotized witnesses to testify only as to facts that were documented before the hypnosis procedures were performed. The SJC held that \"such limitations on the witnesses eliminated the risk that their testimony might be affected by hypnosis.\" <i>Kater VII,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1177. Admission of this evidence cannot possibly be said to have deprived the petitioner of a fundamentally fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense. <i>In re Winship,</i> 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). The SJC concluded, under the federal <i>Jackson</i> standard, that the evidence was sufficient. <i>Kater VII,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1172-73; <i>see Jackson,</i> 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (\"[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"). Although the AEDPA standard applies, even if we were to review this sufficiency question de novo, we would agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Other Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kater argues the trial was fundamentally unfair under the Due Process Clause because of the loss or destruction of evidence. The SJC extensively analyzed these claims and rejected them. Whether viewed de novo or through the AEDPA lens, we conclude the claims individually and collectively do not raise a claim of constitutional dimension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> After a second conviction in 1986, the SJC reversed the conviction again based on the introduction of hypnotically aided testimony<i>Commonwealth v.

Kater argues that he is being punished twice for the 1968 crime against Bussiere: once because of his conviction in 1969, and again by the admission of the 1969 conviction at his trial for Arruda's kidnapping and murder.

Our review is subject to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). Kater's habeas petition raises, inter alia, a due process claim based on the introduction of a prior bad act for the purpose of establishing identity, an unusual voir dire claim, and a claim under the Confrontation Clause related to the introduction of testimony by previously hypnotized witnesses. We reject Kater's claims, affirm the district court's denial of the petition, and resolve one issue of first impression for this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address Kater's assumption that in a federal habeas proceeding on de novo review of a state court's judgment under <i>Fortini v.

While we consider such claims \"de novo,\" that does not mean we review those claims as an original matter, as if the claims were raised on direct appeal.

He was convicted in 1979, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) reversed the conviction because certain hypnotically aided testimony had been introduced at trial. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Kater</i> (<i>Kater I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2190460\"><a href=\"/opinion/2190460/commonwealth-v-kater/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2190460\"><a href=\"/opinion/2190460/commonwealth-v-kater/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span> (1983). The SJC ordered the trial court on remand to hold a hearing and to admit only such testimony as was based on pre-hypnotic memories. <i>Commonwealth v.

This was more favorable to Kater than the SJC's directive that pre-hypnotic testimony be separated from hypnotically aided testimony. <i>Id.</i> The trial court also ruled, at motion in limine before trial, that the prosecution could introduce evidence of Kater's state conviction for a similar kidnapping, for the purpose of establishing Kater's identity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1172, 1175.

After describing Kater's prior conviction, the judge asked whether knowledge of that conviction would affect the jurors' ability to accept and understand the presumption of innocence and the limitation on the use of prior bad act evidence to the issue of identification. <i>Id.</i> Seven of fifteen jurors were struck based on their responses to these questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court later decided that voir dire on the prior bad acts was inappropriate, and excused the previously selected jurors. <i>Id.</i> It did so for two reasons. First, it found that \"if evidence of other crimes were admitted, it would not be extraneous within the meaning of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234, &#167; 28], and voir dire would not be authorized.\" <i>Id.</i> The court referred to state law \"provid[ing] that a trial judge must, for the purpose of determining whether a juror stands indifferent in a case, conduct an individual voir dire of each prospective juror if it appears that a substantial risk exists that an extraneous issue might affect the outcome of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234, &#167; 28). The SJC said that, under Massachusetts law, \"[a]n extraneous issue is one that goes beyond the record and raises a serious question of possible prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1175. Second, the trial court found that \"if the evidence [of prior bad acts] were ultimately not admitted at trial, the questions would have then contaminated the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1174.

Arruda disappeared in September 1978 while riding a bike near her home in Raynham, Massachusetts. Her bike was found the same day; nearby was a Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette and a car tire track with an acceleration mark and an abnormal tread wear pattern. Two months later, in November 1978, Arruda's clothed body was found tied to a tree. A pathologist testified that Arruda had been tied to the tree while conscious, but that she lost consciousness and that the weight of Arruda's head against the restraint around her neck strangled her. <i>Id.</i> at 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the time Arruda disappeared, five individuals saw a green car with a black or silver stripe speeding through the neighborhood where Arruda had been abducted. <i>Id.</i> Four of these witnesses were hypnotized during the course of the investigation into Arruda's disappearance. <i>Kater I,</i> 447 N.E.2d at 1194. At trial, the five witnesses testified that Kater's car was similar in color, size, and markings to the car they had seen on the day of Arruda's disappearance. <i>Kater VII,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1171.

The police noted that Kater smoked Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes, and that his appearance matched both the composite sketch and the description of the driver given by one witness. Kater allowed the police to search his car, a bright green Opel with a black racing stripe. The right front tire tread of the car had a unusual wear pattern consistent with the tire track found near Arruda's bicycle. In the car the police found two cartons of Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes and two pairs of dark-rimmed glasses. In the trunk of the car, under some luggage, the police found two newspapers, each open to articles about Arruda's disappearance. Kater made a statement to the police as to his whereabouts at the time of Arruda's disappearance, but the SJC found Kater's alibi to have been inaccurate. <i>Id.</i> at 1171.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kater, in 1969, had pled guilty to a crime which the SJC stated was \"strikingly similar\" to the one perpetrated against Arruda. <i>Id.</i> at 1176. Evidence of this prior conviction was introduced at Kater's fourth trial for the purpose of establishing Kater's identity as the perpetrator of the crime against Arruda. Kater had abducted a thirteen-year-old girl, Jacalyn Bussiere, who was walking her bicycle on a secluded street. He forced her into his car and drove her to a wooded area. Kater hit Bussiere over the head and tried to force her face into a stream. After Bussiere fought back, Kater forced Bussiere into the car again and drove her deeper into the woods, where he tied her hands, ankles, torso and neck against a tree; this was similar to how Arruda's body had been found tied. Bussiere lost consciousness for some time, but eventually managed to free herself and report the crime to the police. <i>Id.</i> She identified Kater as her assailant. <i>Id.</i> at 1172 n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kater was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Arruda, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. <i>Id.</i> at 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a fundamental principle of the law of federal habeas corpus in non-death-penalty cases that no habeas claim is stated as to state court criminal convictions unless the alleged errors are violations of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. <i>Estelle v.

The petitioner argues that his state trial was so fundamentally unfair as to violate due process of law under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

He argues that evidence about his prior crime (for which he was convicted in 1969), which was admitted under the exception to the exclusion for prior bad acts evidence for evidence tending to show identity, was constitutionally barred. He also argues that his trial was fundamentally unfair because the trial judge refused to ask voir dire questions describing the evidence of the prior crime, already determined to be admissible, and asking whether the potential jurors would remain unaffected by the evidence. This failure to ask the voir dire questions, he says, resulted in a jury biased against him, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Whatever the differences between the <i>Teague</i> analysis and the standard of review in AEDPA, the focus of both is, in essence, on the substantive standards set by clearly established federal law. Whether habeas review is under the deferential standard provided in &#167; 2254(d)(1) or under the de novo standard of <i>Fortini,</i> state habeas petitioners may not seek release on federal law grounds which have yet to be clearly established. Thus, in this case, it is irrelevant whether (as the petitioner asserts) the Supreme Court might someday recognize a constitutional right to voir dire on prior bad acts evidence.

This means that the question is not whether the admission of the evidence was state-law error, but whether any error rendered the trial so fundamentally unfair that it violated the Due Process Clause. <i>See Petrillo v.

Kater makes this argument, and says that the Commonwealth cannot have it both ways. That is, when Kater invoked the Double Jeopardy Clause to block his fourth trial, the state courts ruled against the claim, finding there was adequate evidence in the record, <i>without</i> admission of the prior bad acts, to support the conviction in a trial where the evidence was not introduced. He argues that this finding that the prior 1969 conviction was not necessary to his conviction became the law of the case. As such, it was surplusage to admit the prior bad acts, and prejudicial to him to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On extreme facts, it may be theoretically possible to find that a state court's evaluative judgment&#8212;that the prejudicial effect does not substantially outweigh the probative value&#8212;was such an unreasonable application of clearly established federal constitutional standards as to result in a fundamentally unfair trial. In practice, such a case&#8212;if one exists&#8212;will be very rare. The SJC's conclusion that the bad act evidence of Kater's prior conviction showed identity was quite reasonable, and while adverse to Kater, was not unfairly prejudicial. The evidence powerfully went to identity. The SJC recounted the following similarities between Kater's past crime and the Arruda case: both victims were young girls, both were abducted on a rural residential road and placed in a car, both were brought to a dense wooded area, both were tied to a tree in a similar manner, both were bound around the neck in such a way that strangulation might result, and both were left in isolated areas of the woods. <i>Kater VII,</i> 734 N.E.2d at 1176 &amp; n. 7.

Kater's argument raises no question under the Double Jeopardy Clause.
