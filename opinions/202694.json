Michael A. Ponsor,   U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     John M. Thompson with whom Linda J. Thompson and Thompson &\nThompson, P.C. were on brief for appellant.\n     Alex J. Grant, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                         April 6, 2007\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.     Lee Henry was indicted on October\n\n23, 2003, on four counts of distribution and possession with intent\n\nto distribute heroin and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841 (2000).     The charges stemmed from controlled drug buys that\n\noccurred on February 6 and 26 and on May 2 and 13, 2003.               The\n\ncontrolled drug buys were made by Carlos Ortiz, who was cooperating\n\nwith the FBI, under the supervision of FBI Special Agent Robert\n\nLewis.\n\n            In early 2004, prior to trial, Henry sought exculpatory\n\nevidence from the government, and the district court ordered the\n\ngovernment    to   produce   four   categories   of   documents   relating\n\nprimarily to the government's contacts with and benefits supplied\n\nto Ortiz.     Further evidence was sought in June 2004 (e.g., drug\n\ntests and debriefing reports) and further evidence was produced.\n\nIn a July 2004 hearing the court ordered the government to give yet\n\nfurther evidence to the defense.\n\n            On December 30, 2004, one business day before trial,\n\nHenry sought to subpoena further documents from Ortiz and Agent\n\nLewis, with both requests asking for very broad categories of\n\ndocuments including material earlier furnished.1            The district\n\n\n     1\n      For example, the Ortiz subpoena sought any record of any\naspect of Ortiz' dealings with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's\nOffice; any record or evidence of Ortiz' drug dealing and use; any\nrecord of the amount of benefits provided to Ortiz; any transcript\nof any of Ortiz' testimony given in any criminal proceeding; a copy\nof any statement given in connection with Ortiz' involvement in the\ninvestigation of Henry; any record of dealing with Section 8\n\n                                    -2-\n\fcourt, citing delay, overbreadth and prior production, quashed the\n\nsubpoena as to Ortiz and granted only limited items demanded of\n\nLewis.   A renewed request during trial was denied.\n\n           Trial began on January 3, 2005, and continued until\n\nJanuary 13, 2005.        The government offered Agent Lewis and a\n\ncooperating local law enforcement agent to testify as to the\n\narrangements for the buys (e.g., dates, searches of Ortiz and his\n\ncar before and after the buys, recording equipment).            There was\n\nalso identification of the drugs recovered from Ortiz after each of\n\nthe transactions.    Ortiz testified as to the buys themselves and\n\nidentified Henry as the seller.\n\n           The   pièce   de   résistance   was   the   recordings   of   the\n\nFebruary transactions from a concealed camera and audiotape device\n\nin Ortiz' car where the February deals occurred.          In the February\n\n26 sale, the seller could be seen and heard and exchanges of money\n\nand drugs witnessed by the jury.         In a tape of a phone call also\n\npresented to the jury, the seller answers to the name \"Lee,\" and\n\nthe buyer refers to \"Lee\" throughout the various recordings.\n\nDespite some discrepancies (e.g., the seller had a mustache and\n\n\n\n\nhousing authorities; all phone records from March 2001 onward; any\nrecord of any accusation of misconduct while Ortiz served as a\nconfidential informant and cooperating witness; and all tax returns\nduring the time Ortiz was working with the FBI.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fHenry appeared clean shaven at trial), the jury could compare the\n\nface on the video with Henry.2\n\n                  The first May buy followed the same pattern but took\n\nplace outside the car, and the main taped evidence was from audio\n\nrecordings.          The jury could, of course, compare voices from the\n\nfirst May audio with the two February audio recordings; and, in\n\naddition, although Henry did not testify at trial, Agent Lewis\n\ntestified that he had heard Henry speak in person in late 2003 and\n\nthat Henry's voice matched the voice on the tape.\n\n                  The second May buy was also outside the car.                    The\n\ngovernment offered an audiotape of a telephone conversation between\n\nOrtiz       and    someone   at   a   cell    phone   number   assigned    to    Henry\n\narranging to meet near a restaurant; but, because of distortions at\n\nthe     noisy       restaurant,       the    corresponding     audiotape    of     the\n\ntransaction itself was hard to make out, although the government\n\nsought to show fragments allegedly consistent with a drug deal.\n\n                  The defense called no witnesses except for Agent Lewis\n\nwho was recalled and subject to brief examination primarily about\n\nOrtiz' admissions of past criminal conduct.                     The defense did,\n\nhowever, bring out Ortiz' very extensive record of past criminal\n\nconduct, the benefits he received from the government, and alleged\n\n\n\n        2\n      The February 6 recording was less complete because Ortiz\npartially covered up the video camera, but the audiotape was played\nto the jury and still frames of the video allowed the jury to see\npart of the defendant's face and the money change hands.\n\n                                             -4-\n\fdeviations from standard guidelines by Lewis or other agents in\n\nhandling or compensating Ortiz.\n\n              In closing the prosecutor relied scarcely at all on Ortiz\n\nbut focused heavily on the videos for the February buys and on the\n\naudio   for     the    first   May   transaction.      For   the   second   May\n\ntransaction, the links were the telephone call arranging the\n\nmeeting   and    the    less   distinct   audio-taped    discussion    at   the\n\ntransaction site.        The defense closing was an energetic kitchen-\n\nsink collection of criticism of Ortiz, Lewis and the prosecution's\n\nsupposed failure to prove what it had promised.\n\n              The jury, after approximately five hours of deliberation,\n\nfound Henry guilty as to the first three transactions and acquitted\n\nas to the fourth (the May 13 sale, which was the one minimally\n\nrecorded).       The district court sentenced Henry to 144 months'\n\nimprisonment.      Henry has now appealed and we have pending both his\n\nappeal from his conviction and a recent motion by Henry filed in\n\nthis court seeking a remand to permit him to file in the district\n\ncourt a Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence.             Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 33.\n\n              On this appeal, Henry wisely does not challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence against him.            The first of his two sets\n\nof arguments is directed to discovery and the main contention is\n\nthat the district court erred in quashing the eve-of-trial subpoena\n\nto Ortiz and limiting the similar subpoena to Lewis.                  A second\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fstrand    of    this   argument     claims     that    alleged    discovery    order\n\nviolations should have led to suppression of evidence.\n\n               In federal criminal trials, defense access to government\n\nevidence that is exculpatory or helpful in impeaching government\n\nwitnesses      is   governed   by    a   set    of    statutory   and   rule-based\n\nrequirements elaborated through much doctrine.                    Among the most\n\nfamiliar are those reflected in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 26.2, Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, and the Brady decision,\n\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\n\n               In addition, but with limitations, the defense may use\n\nsubpoenas before trial to secure admissible evidence but not as a\n\ngeneral discovery device.            Fed. R. Crim. P. 17; Nixon v. United\n\nStates, 418 U.S. 683 (1974); Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States, 341\n\nU.S. 214, 218 (1951).       The court has power to quash a subpoena that\n\nis unreasonable or oppressive, Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(2), and\n\nreview on appeal is for abuse of discretion.                 Nixon, 418 U.S. at\n\n702; United States v. Lieberman, 608 F.2d 889, 904 (1st Cir. 1979).\n\n               Here, the subpoenas were not only extremely broad and\n\nunrealistic, especially as eve-of-trial demands, but the categories\n\nof information overlapped with prior demands for information.\n\nHenry's briefs do not explain just what materials had been produced\n\nby the government in response to the prior requests; but if the\n\nearlier     production     had      been       unjustifiably      deficient,    the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdeficiencies should have been identified--and well before the last\n\nworking day before trial.\n\n           In addition, practically all errors relating to discovery\n\nor the admission or exclusion of evidence require some showing of\n\nprejudice--usually, some variant on a likelihood of a different\n\noutcome if the error had not been made.            See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Castellini, 392 F.3d 35, 52 (1st Cir. 2004) (improperly admitted\n\nevidence must have \"likely affected the outcome of trial\").                 Less\n\nis sometimes needed for constitutional error but, even there, some\n\nprejudice ordinarily is required.3\n\n           Most of the salient material sought both in the earlier\n\ndemands by Henry and in his eve-of-trial subpoenas aimed at two\n\ntargets.    Most     important   was    material    to   impeach   Ortiz,    and\n\nunderstandably so since he alone had dealt with the drug supplier.\n\nBut Ortiz was impeached by overwhelming evidence of his criminal\n\npast and the payments to him from the government.            The prosecution\n\nrelied   centrally    on   the   videos      and   audiotapes.     The   jury,\n\nacquitting on the last transaction, showed that it placed minimal\n\nfaith in Ortiz.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      See, e.g., Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)\n(requiring harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt).   No-prejudice\nreversals are ordinarily reserved for very rare errors so\nfundamental as to be deemed \"structural error\"--a somewhat ill-\ndefined category none of whose examples approach the present case.\nSee Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 8 (1999) (collecting\nexamples).\n\n                                       -7-\n\f            The defense also sought information to show that the FBI\n\nhad mishandled Ortiz, either by sloppy procedures or by failing to\n\ncomply with various Justice Department guidelines for dealing with\n\nconfidential informants or cooperating witnesses.               Some of this\n\ninformation the defense received and used in evidence and in\n\narguing to the jury; but so far as information sought aimed to\n\nimpeach Ortiz, it was redundant; and the alleged violations were,\n\nas we will see, not an independent basis for suppressing evidence.\n\n            Asked by us at oral argument about the apparent lack of\n\nprejudice    and   the   powerful      taped   evidence     supporting       the\n\nconvictions, Henry's counsel said that the defense hoped to show\n\nthat Agent Lewis had been careless and even untruthful as to prior\n\ndealings with Ortiz.       But only two examples were offered and\n\nneither   was   very   significant.4      Lewis   was     not   shown   to    be\n\ngenerally unworthy of belief, and any doubts raised about either\n\ncompetence or veracity could not have seriously undermined the\n\nvideo and audio evidence.\n\n            Henry argues that the limitations on discovery and the\n\nsubpoenas constituted not only an abuse of discretion by the\n\ndistrict court but also a violation of the Sixth Amendment, which\n\nguarantees \"criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present\n\n\n     4\n      First, Lewis was required to do a thorough suitability check\non Ortiz but testified at trial to lacking background information\nabout Ortiz. Second, Lewis testified that Ortiz told him that he\nwas not a substance abuser when they first met, while Ortiz stated\nhe told Agent Lewis that he had been involved in drugs.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fa complete defense.\"           Holmes v. South Carolina, 126 S. Ct. 1727,\n\n1731 (2006) (quoting Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 689-90\n\n(1986)).       Just when a restriction on discovery or admission of\n\nevidence rises to the level of a Sixth Amendment violation need not\n\nbe pursued.5          We have found nothing to indicate that the quashing\n\nwas error nor, if Henry argues that the application of Rule 17\n\nwhile       correct    was   still   unconstitutional,   that   the   requisite\n\nprejudice existed.           See United States v. Hughes, 895 F.2d 1135,\n\n1145 n.15 (6th Cir. 1990).\n\n               Henry makes one other discovery-related argument, namely,\n\nthat the government read an early discovery order too narrowly and\n\nthat the district judge should have sanctioned the government. The\n\nargument is not adequately developed in Henry's opening brief and\n\nso is forfeit, Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).          In any event, the judge supportably found that\n\nthe government's reading was reasonable.\n\n               Henry's other main claim on appeal is that \"the district\n\ncourt erred in admitting the evidence obtained through . . .\n\nOrtiz's commission of federal and state crimes.\"            This interesting\n\nargument starts with a series of propositions: that the Attorney\n\nGeneral has only doubtful power to authorize acts that constitute\n\n\n        5\n      See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995); Pennsylvania\nv. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 56-57 (1987); United States v. Valenzuela-\nBernal, 458 U.S. 858, 872-73 (1982); United States v. Theresius\nFilippi, 918 F.2d 244, 247-48 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v.\nHoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                                         -9-\n\fcrimes even in aid of criminal \"sting\" investigations; that the\n\nauthority    to    delegate    this    authority     to   others    is    even   more\n\nlimited;     and   that   the    FBI     in   this    case   ignored        numerous\n\nrestrictions in Justice Department guidelines. The remedy, Henry's\n\nbrief argues, should be suppression of evidence including the\n\ntapes.\n\n            The government says that neither the lack of authority\n\nnor the guideline violation claims were adequately preserved as\n\nbases for suppression.        This is quite arguably so as to the former;\n\nthe latter may have been preserved.                But, by-passing waiver or\n\nplain error requirements, we reject the exclusion claim on the\n\nmerits.      Even assuming arguendo infirmities as to authority,\n\ndelegation    or    compliance    with     Justice    Department         guidelines,\n\nexclusion of the evidence was not warranted in this case.\n\n            Nothing    here     involves      evidence    made     unreliable      by\n\ngovernment misconduct, so exclusion would serve only a deterrent\n\nvalue--if    misconduct       there    were--at    the    cost     of    letting   an\n\notherwise guilty defendant go free.               The Supreme Court has been\n\nwilling to pay that price in the case of evidence secured by\n\ncertain constitutional violations, although even in such instances\n\nit has adopted a number of qualifications.                   See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (1984); Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S.\n\n465, 493 (1976).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f           The Court has been far less ready to require exclusion\n\nfor violations of any non-constitutional rubrics.        A few supposed\n\nexamples are older cases dealing with provisions designed to\n\nprotect constitutional interests.        E.g., McNabb v. United States,\n\n318 U.S. 332, 347 (1943).     More recently, the Court has said that\n\nthe cases of suppression for statutory violations are \"few,\"\n\nSanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S. Ct. 2669, 2681 (2006); for obvious\n\nreasons this is even more clearly true of regulations.6\n\n           Similarly, this court has said that \"[t]he exclusionary\n\nrule was not fashioned to vindicate a broad, general right to be\n\nfree of agency action not 'authorized' by law.\"        Hensel, 699 F.2d\n\nat   29.   Judge   Posner   has   explained   why:   \"Exclusion   confers\n\nwindfalls on the guilty and therefore, at least as a device for\n\nenforcing nonconstitutional rules, is disfavored.\"        United States\n\nv. Dawson, 425 F.3d 389, 394 (7th Cir. 2005), reh'g granted on\n\nother grounds, 434 F.3d 956, cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 831 (2006).\n\n           There is a good deal of precedent supporting the use of\n\nsting operations in law enforcement, including drug transactions\n\ninvolving undercover agents or cooperating private persons;7 and\n\n\n      6\n      United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741, 754-55 (1979) (IRS\nregulations); Buntrock v. SEC, 347 F.3d 995, 999 (7th Cir. 2003)\n(SEC regulations); United States v. Hensel, 699 F.2d 18, 29 (1st\nCir.), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 958 (1983) (Coast Guard regulations).\n\n      7\n      Hampton v.

Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 425-26 (1973)\n\n                                  -11-\n\fwhile undercover operations can be, and have been, abused, an\n\nexclusionary rule based on the principle that all such operations\n\nare unlawful would be an extraordinary step.\n\n          Justice   Department   guidelines   were   not   compelled   by\n\nstatute, nor intended to create private rights.       United States v.\n\nFlemmi, 225 F.3d 78, 88 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S.\n\n1170 (2001).   Henry may be right in saying that the guidelines are\n\nunderenforced, and this would be cause for concern, but that is\n\nprimarily a matter for the Justice Department or, if Congress\n\nwishes, for its supervision.\n\n          We deny Henry's \"motion for remand to permit filing of\n\nRule 33 motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence.\"\n\nAll of the \"newly discovered evidence\" Henry points to would either\n\nbe used to further impeach Ortiz or Lewis or to argue for the\n\nsuppression of evidence. As we have already explained, impeachment\n\nof Ortiz was thoroughly accomplished and suppression of evidence on\n\naccount of the way Ortiz was supervised is not appropriate.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n(undercover federal agent supplied drug component and purchased\ndrugs from defendant); Lewis v.

Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and LYNCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lee Henry was indicted on October 23, 2003, on four counts of distribution and possession with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 (2000). The charges stemmed from controlled drug buys that occurred on February 6 and 26 and on May 2 and 13, 2003. The controlled drug buys were made by Carlos Ortiz, who was cooperating with the FBI, under the supervision of FBI Special Agent Robert Lewis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2004, prior to trial, Henry sought exculpatory evidence from the government, and the district court ordered the government to produce four categories of documents relating primarily to the government's contacts with and benefits supplied to Ortiz. Further evidence was sought in June 2004 (<i>e.g.,</i> drug tests and debriefing reports) and further evidence was produced. In a July 2004 hearing the court ordered the government to give yet further evidence to the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 2004, one business day before trial, Henry sought to subpoena further documents from Ortiz and Agent Lewis, with both requests asking for very broad categories of documents including material earlier furnished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court, citing delay, overbreadth and prior production, quashed the subpoena as to Ortiz and granted only limited items demanded of Lewis. A renewed request during trial was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began on January 3, 2005, and continued until January 13, 2005. The government offered Agent Lewis and a cooperating local law enforcement agent to testify as to the arrangements for the buys (<i>e.g.,</i> dates, searches of Ortiz and his car before and after the buys, recording equipment). There was also identification of the drugs recovered from Ortiz after each of the transactions. Ortiz testified as to the buys themselves and identified Henry as the seller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance was the recordings of the February transactions from a concealed camera and audiotape device in Ortiz' car where the February deals occurred. In the February 26 sale, the seller could be seen and heard and exchanges of money and drugs witnessed by the jury. In a tape of a phone call also presented to the jury, the seller answers to the name \"Lee,\" and the buyer refers to \"Lee\" throughout the various recordings. Despite some discrepancies (<i>e.g.,</i> the seller had a mustache and Henry appeared clean shaven at trial), the jury could compare the face on the video with Henry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first May buy followed the same pattern but took place outside the car, and the main taped evidence was from audio recordings. The jury could, of course, compare voices from the first May audio with the two February audio recordings; and, in addition, although Henry did not testify at trial, Agent Lewis testified that he had heard Henry speak in person in late 2003 and that Henry's voice matched the voice on the tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second May buy was also outside the car. The government offered an audiotape of a telephone conversation between Ortiz and someone at a cell phone number assigned to Henry arranging to meet near a restaurant; but, because of distortions at the noisy restaurant, the corresponding audiotape of the transaction itself was hard to make out, although the government sought to show fragments allegedly consistent with a drug deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense called no witnesses except for Agent Lewis who was recalled and subject to brief examination primarily about Ortiz' admissions of past criminal conduct. The defense did, however, bring out Ortiz' very extensive record of past criminal conduct, the benefits he received from the government, and alleged deviations from standard guidelines by Lewis or other agents in handling or compensating Ortiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing the prosecutor relied scarcely at all on Ortiz but focused heavily on the videos for the February buys and on the audio for the first May transaction. For the second May transaction, the links were the telephone call arranging the meeting and the less distinct audio-taped discussion at the transaction site. The defense closing was an energetic kitchen-sink collection of criticism of Ortiz, Lewis and the prosecution's supposed failure to prove what it had promised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury, after approximately five hours of deliberation, found Henry guilty as to the first three transactions and acquitted as to the fourth (the May 13 sale, which was the one minimally recorded). The district court sentenced Henry to 144 months' imprisonment. Henry has now appealed and we have pending both his appeal from his conviction and a recent motion by Henry filed in this court seeking a remand to permit him to file in the district court a Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Henry wisely does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him. The first of his two sets of arguments is directed to discovery and the main contention is that the district court erred in quashing the eve-of-trial subpoena to Ortiz and limiting the similar subpoena to Lewis. A second strand of this argument claims that alleged discovery order violations should have led to suppression of evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal criminal trials, defense access to government evidence that is exculpatory or helpful in impeaching government witnesses is governed by a set of statutory and rule-based requirements elaborated through much doctrine. Among the most familiar are those reflected in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500, Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2, Fed.R.Crim.P. 16, and the <i>Brady</i> decision, <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, but with limitations, the defense may use subpoenas before trial to secure admissible evidence but not as a general discovery device. Fed.R.Crim.P. 17; <i>United States v. Nixon,</i> 418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974); <i>Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States,</i> 341 U.S. 214, 218, 71 S.Ct. 675, 95 L.Ed. 879 (1951). The court has power to quash a subpoena that is unreasonable or oppressive, Fed.R.Crim.P. 17(c)(2), and review on appeal is for abuse of discretion. <i>Nixon,</i> 418 U.S. at 702, 94 S.Ct. 3090; <i>United States v. Lieberman,</i> 608 F.2d 889, 904 (1st Cir.1979). Here, the subpoenas were not only extremely broad and unrealistic, especially as eve-of-trial demands, but the categories of information overlapped with prior demands for information. Henry's briefs do not explain just what materials had been produced by the government in response to the prior requests; but if the earlier production had been unjustifiably deficient, the deficiencies should have been identified-and well before the last working day before trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, practically all errors relating to discovery or the admission or exclusion of evidence require some showing of prejudice-usually, some variant on a likelihood of a different outcome if the error had not been made. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d 35, 52 (1st Cir.2004) (improperly admitted evidence must have \"likely affected the outcome of trial\"). Less is sometimes needed for constitutional error but, even there, some prejudice ordinarily is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the salient material sought both in the earlier demands by Henry and in his eve-of-trial subpoenas aimed at two targets. Most important was material to impeach Ortiz, and understandably so since he alone had dealt with the drug supplier. But Ortiz was impeached by overwhelming evidence of his criminal past and the payments to him from the government. The prosecution relied centrally on the videos and audiotapes. The jury, acquitting on the last transaction, showed that it placed minimal faith in Ortiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense also sought information to show that the FBI had mishandled Ortiz, either by sloppy procedures or by failing to comply with various Justice Department guidelines for dealing with confidential informants or cooperating witnesses. Some of this information the defense received and used in evidence and in arguing to the jury; but so far as information sought aimed to impeach Ortiz, it was redundant; and the alleged violations were, as we will see, not an independent basis for suppressing evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asked by us at oral argument about the apparent lack of prejudice and the powerful taped evidence supporting the convictions, Henry's counsel said that the defense hoped to show that Agent Lewis had been careless and even untruthful as to prior dealings with Ortiz. But only two examples were offered and neither was very significant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Lewis was not shown to be generally unworthy of belief, and any doubts raised about either competence or veracity could not have seriously undermined the video and audio evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry argues that the limitations on discovery and the subpoenas constituted not only an abuse of discretion by the district court but also a violation of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees \"criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\" <i>Holmes v. South Carolina,</i> 547 U.S. 319, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 1731, 164 L.Ed.2d 503 (2006) (quoting <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 683, 689-90, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986)). Just when a restriction on discovery or admission of evidence rises to the level of a Sixth Amendment violation need not be pursued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We have found nothing to indicate that the quashing was error nor, if Henry argues that the application of Rule 17 while correct was still unconstitutional, that the requisite prejudice existed. <i>See United States v.</i> <i>Hughes,</i> 895 F.2d 1135, 1145 n. 15 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry makes one other discovery-related argument, namely, that the government read an early discovery order too narrowly and that the district judge should have sanctioned the government. The argument is not adequately developed in Henry's opening brief and so is forfeit, <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir.1998). In any event, the judge supportably found that the government's reading was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry's other main claim on appeal is that \"the district court erred in admitting the evidence obtained through . . . Ortiz's commission of federal and state crimes.\" This interesting argument starts with a series of propositions: that the Attorney General has only doubtful power to authorize acts that constitute crimes even in aid of criminal \"sting\" investigations; that the authority to delegate this authority to others is even more limited; and that the FBI in this case ignored numerous restrictions in Justice Department guidelines. The remedy, Henry's brief argues, should be suppression of evidence including the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that neither the lack of authority nor the guideline violation claims were adequately preserved as bases for suppression. This is quite arguably so as to the former; the latter may have been preserved. But, by-passing waiver or plain error requirements, we reject the exclusion claim on the merits. Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> infirmities as to authority, delegation or compliance with Justice Department guidelines, exclusion of the evidence was not warranted in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing here involves evidence made unreliable by government misconduct, so exclusion would serve only a deterrent value&#8212;if misconduct there were&#8212;at the cost of letting an otherwise guilty defendant go free. The Supreme Court has been willing to pay that price in the case of evidence secured by certain constitutional violations, although even in such instances it has adopted a number of qualifications. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984); <i>Stone v. Powell,</i> 428 U.S. 465, 493, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has been far less ready to require exclusion for violations of any non-constitutional rubrics. A few supposed examples are older cases dealing with provisions designed to protect constitutional interests. <i>E.g., McNabb v. United States,</i> 318 U.S. 332, 347, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943). More recently, the Court has said that the cases of suppression for statutory violations are \"few,\" <i>Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 2681, 165 L.Ed.2d 557 (2006); for obvious reasons this is even more clearly true of regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, this court has said that \"[t]he exclusionary rule was not fashioned to vindicate a broad, general right to be free of agency action not `authorized' by law.\" <i>Hensel,</i> 699 F.2d at 29. Judge Posner has explained why: \"Exclusion confers windfalls on the guilty and therefore, at least as a device for enforcing nonconstitutional rules, is disfavored.\" <i>United States v. Dawson,</i> 425 F.3d 389, 394 (7th Cir.2005), <i>reh'g granted on other grounds,</i> 434 F.3d 956, <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 831, 166 L.Ed.2d 675 (2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a good deal of precedent supporting the use of sting operations in law enforcement, including drug transactions involving undercover agents or cooperating private persons;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and while undercover operations can be, and have been, abused, an exclusionary rule based on the principle that all such operations are unlawful would be an extraordinary step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Department guidelines were not compelled by statute, nor intended to create private rights. <i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> 225 F.3d 78, 88 (1st Cir.2000), <i>cert. denied,</i> 531 U.S. 1170, 121 S.Ct. 1137, 148 L.Ed.2d 1002 (2001). Henry may be right in saying that the guidelines are underenforced, and this would be cause for concern, but that is primarily a matter for the Justice Department or, if Congress wishes, for its supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deny Henry's \"motion for remand to permit filing of Rule 33 motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence.\" All of the \"newly discovered evidence\" Henry points to would either be used to further impeach Ortiz or Lewis or to argue for the suppression of evidence. As we have already explained, impeachment of Ortiz was thoroughly accomplished and suppression of evidence on account of the way Ortiz was supervised is not appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For example, the Ortiz subpoena sought any record of any aspect of Ortiz' dealings with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office; any record or evidence of Ortiz' drug dealing and use; any record of the amount of benefits provided to Ortiz; any transcript of any of Ortiz' testimony given in any criminal proceeding; a copy of any statement given in connection with Ortiz' involvement in the investigation of Henry; any record of dealing with Section 8 housing authorities; all phone records from March 2001 onward; any record of any accusation of misconduct while Ortiz served as a confidential informant and cooperating witness; and all tax returns during the time Ortiz was working with the FBI</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The February 6 recording was less complete because Ortiz partially covered up the video camera, but the audiotape was played to the jury and still frames of the video allowed the jury to see part of the defendant's face and the money change hands</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> <i>See, e.g., Chapman v.

The charges stemmed from controlled drug buys that occurred on February 6 and 26 and on May 2 and 13, 2003.

A renewed request during trial was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began on January 3, 2005, and continued until January 13, 2005. The government offered Agent Lewis and a cooperating local law enforcement agent to testify as to the arrangements for the buys (<i>e.g.,</i> dates, searches of Ortiz and his car before and after the buys, recording equipment). There was also identification of the drugs recovered from Ortiz after each of the transactions. Ortiz testified as to the buys themselves and identified Henry as the seller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance was the recordings of the February transactions from a concealed camera and audiotape device in Ortiz' car where the February deals occurred. In the February 26 sale, the seller could be seen and heard and exchanges of money and drugs witnessed by the jury. In a tape of a phone call also presented to the jury, the seller answers to the name \"Lee,\" and the buyer refers to \"Lee\" throughout the various recordings. Despite some discrepancies (<i>e.g.,</i> the seller had a mustache and Henry appeared clean shaven at trial), the jury could compare the face on the video with Henry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first May buy followed the same pattern but took place outside the car, and the main taped evidence was from audio recordings. The jury could, of course, compare voices from the first May audio with the two February audio recordings; and, in addition, although Henry did not testify at trial, Agent Lewis testified that he had heard Henry speak in person in late 2003 and that Henry's voice matched the voice on the tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second May buy was also outside the car. The government offered an audiotape of a telephone conversation between Ortiz and someone at a cell phone number assigned to Henry arranging to meet near a restaurant; but, because of distortions at the noisy restaurant, the corresponding audiotape of the transaction itself was hard to make out, although the government sought to show fragments allegedly consistent with a drug deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense called no witnesses except for Agent Lewis who was recalled and subject to brief examination primarily about Ortiz' admissions of past criminal conduct. The defense did, however, bring out Ortiz' very extensive record of past criminal conduct, the benefits he received from the government, and alleged deviations from standard guidelines by Lewis or other agents in handling or compensating Ortiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing the prosecutor relied scarcely at all on Ortiz but focused heavily on the videos for the February buys and on the audio for the first May transaction. For the second May transaction, the links were the telephone call arranging the meeting and the less distinct audio-taped discussion at the transaction site. The defense closing was an energetic kitchen-sink collection of criticism of Ortiz, Lewis and the prosecution's supposed failure to prove what it had promised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury, after approximately five hours of deliberation, found Henry guilty as to the first three transactions and acquitted as to the fourth (the May 13 sale, which was the one minimally recorded). The district court sentenced Henry to 144 months' imprisonment. Henry has now appealed and we have pending both his appeal from his conviction and a recent motion by Henry filed in this court seeking a remand to permit him to file in the district court a Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Henry wisely does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him. The first of his two sets of arguments is directed to discovery and the main contention is that the district court erred in quashing the eve-of-trial subpoena to Ortiz and limiting the similar subpoena to Lewis. A second strand of this argument claims that alleged discovery order violations should have led to suppression of evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal criminal trials, defense access to government evidence that is exculpatory or helpful in impeaching government witnesses is governed by a set of statutory and rule-based requirements elaborated through much doctrine. Among the most familiar are those reflected in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500, Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2, Fed.R.Crim.P. 16, and the <i>Brady</i> decision, <i>Brady v.

Here, the subpoenas were not only extremely broad and unrealistic, especially as eve-of-trial demands, but the categories of information overlapped with prior demands for information. Henry's briefs do not explain just what materials had been produced by the government in response to the prior requests; but if the earlier production had been unjustifiably deficient, the deficiencies should have been identified-and well before the last working day before trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, practically all errors relating to discovery or the admission or exclusion of evidence require some showing of prejudice-usually, some variant on a likelihood of a different outcome if the error had not been made. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Castellini,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201449\"><a href=\"/opinion/201449/united-states-v-castellini/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2004) (improperly admitted evidence must have \"likely affected the outcome of trial\"). Less is sometimes needed for constitutional error but, even there, some prejudice ordinarily is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the salient material sought both in the earlier demands by Henry and in his eve-of-trial subpoenas aimed at two targets. Most important was material to impeach Ortiz, and understandably so since he alone had dealt with the drug supplier. But Ortiz was impeached by overwhelming evidence of his criminal past and the payments to him from the government. The prosecution relied centrally on the videos and audiotapes. The jury, acquitting on the last transaction, showed that it placed minimal faith in Ortiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense also sought information to show that the FBI had mishandled Ortiz, either by sloppy procedures or by failing to comply with various Justice Department guidelines for dealing with confidential informants or cooperating witnesses. Some of this information the defense received and used in evidence and in arguing to the jury; but so far as information sought aimed to impeach Ortiz, it was redundant; and the alleged violations were, as we will see, not an independent basis for suppressing evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asked by us at oral argument about the apparent lack of prejudice and the powerful taped evidence supporting the convictions, Henry's counsel said that the defense hoped to show that Agent Lewis had been careless and even untruthful as to prior dealings with Ortiz. But only two examples were offered and neither was very significant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Lewis was not shown to be generally unworthy of belief, and any doubts raised about either competence or veracity could not have seriously undermined the video and audio evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry argues that the limitations on discovery and the subpoenas constituted not only an abuse of discretion by the district court but also a violation of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees \"criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\" <i>Holmes v.

Just when a restriction on discovery or admission of evidence rises to the level of a Sixth Amendment violation need not be pursued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We have found nothing to indicate that the quashing was error nor, if Henry argues that the application of Rule 17 while correct was still unconstitutional, that the requisite prejudice existed. <i>See United States v.</i> <i>Hughes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536219\"><a href=\"/opinion/536219/united-states-v-charles-hughes-88-1658-luckett-larry-88-1659-sanford/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>, 1145 n. 15 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry makes one other discovery-related argument, namely, that the government read an early discovery order too narrowly and that the district judge should have sanctioned the government. The argument is not adequately developed in Henry's opening brief and so is forfeit, <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1998). In any event, the judge supportably found that the government's reading was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry's other main claim on appeal is that \"the district court erred in admitting the evidence obtained through . . . Ortiz's commission of federal and state crimes.\" This interesting argument starts with a series of propositions: that the Attorney General has only doubtful power to authorize acts that constitute crimes even in aid of criminal \"sting\" investigations; that the authority to delegate this authority to others is even more limited; and that the FBI in this case ignored numerous restrictions in Justice Department guidelines. The remedy, Henry's brief argues, should be suppression of evidence including the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that neither the lack of authority nor the guideline violation claims were adequately preserved as bases for suppression. This is quite arguably so as to the former; the latter may have been preserved. But, by-passing waiver or plain error requirements, we reject the exclusion claim on the merits. Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> infirmities as to authority, delegation or compliance with Justice Department guidelines, exclusion of the evidence was not warranted in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing here involves evidence made unreliable by government misconduct, so exclusion would serve only a deterrent value&#8212;if misconduct there were&#8212;at the cost of letting an otherwise guilty defendant go free. The Supreme Court has been willing to pay that price in the case of evidence secured by certain constitutional violations, although even in such instances it has adopted a number of qualifications. <i>See, e.g., United States v.
