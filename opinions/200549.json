Plaintiffs Global NAPs, Inc.,\n\nFrank       T.    Gangi,     William    J.   Rooney,    Jr.    and   Janet    Lima\n\n(collectively, \"Global NAPs\" or \"GNAPS\") brought this diversity\n\naction      against    defendant       Federal    Insurance   Company   (\"Federal\n\nInsurance\"), seeking reimbursement of litigation expenses incurred\n\nin the course of           defending a lawsuit brought by Verizon.1          At the\n\ntime Verizon filed its complaint, Global NAPs was covered by a\n\ncombination insurance policy issued by Federal Insurance that\n\nobliged the insurance company \"to defend any insured against a suit\n\nseeking damages for . . . personal injury.\" The policy pertinently\n\ndefined personal injury as \"injury . . . arising out of one or more\n\nof the following offenses, committed in the course of your business\n\n. . . (B) malicious prosecution.\"                  Global NAPs argues that the\n\nVerizon complaint adumbrated2 a claim for malicious prosecution,\n\nsee Continental Cas. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 461 N.E.2d 209, 212\n\n(Mass. 1984), triggering Federal Insurance's duty to defend the\n\nlawsuit.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Over the relevant time period, the plaintiffs in                         the\nunderlying action were alternatively known as Bell Atlantic,                   New\nYork/New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, and Verizon.                 For\nsimplicity, we refer to the plaintiffs as \"Verizon\" throughout                 the\ndiscussion.\n        2\n      We have previously defined \"adumbrate\" in the liability\ninsurance context to mean \"to give a sketchy representation of;\noutline broadly, omitting details . . . or 'to suggest, indicate,\nor disclose partially and with a purposeful avoidance of precision'\n. . . \" Open Software Found. v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.,\n307 F.3d 11, 15n.4 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                          -2-\n\f            The district court granted the defendant's motion for\n\nsummary    judgment,     concluding   in    a    thorough     and   well-reasoned\n\ndecision    that   the    Verizon   action      could   not    be   construed   to\n\nadumbrate a claim for malicious prosecution.             For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we agree that Federal Insurance was not obligated to defend\n\nthe Verizon action under the terms of the policy.               Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the decision of the district court.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Global NAPs and Verizon are telecommunications carriers\n\noffering local telephone service to customers in New York and New\n\nEngland.    Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"Telecom\n\nAct\"), 47 U.S.C. §§ 201-231 (2002), local exchange carriers must\n\npermit competing carriers to interconnect with their telephone\n\nnetworks, thereby allowing customers of different local carriers to\n\nconnect to each other. Generally, only the carrier of the customer\n\nwho originates a phone call bills the customer, even though the\n\ncarrier of the party on the receiving end also incurs costs to\n\nconnect the call.        Thus, if a Verizon customer calls a Global NAPs\n\ncustomer, Verizon would initially bill its customer for the phone\n\ncall, and then compensate Global NAPs for handing off the call to\n\nits own customer.        The Telecom Act obliges local exchange carriers\n\nto establish \"reciprocal compensation arrangements\" that govern the\n\noriginating   carrier's      obligation     to    reimburse     the   terminating\n\ncarrier.    The rates that a terminating carrier may charge are set\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fby   the   public   utility   commission      (\"PUC\")    or   public   service\n\ncommission (\"PSC\") for each state, and are generally based on\n\nminutes of use (\"MOUs\") generated by traffic sent to that carrier's\n\nnetwork.\n\n             On September 7, 1999, Global NAPs filed an administrative\n\ncomplaint before the New York PSC encompassing two distinct claims.\n\nFirst,     Global   NAPs   alleged    that   Verizon    unlawfully     withheld\n\nreciprocal compensation for MOUs invoiced in August 1999.                  The\n\nsecond claim sought a declaration from the PSC that Global NAPs was\n\nentitled to the same rate of reciprocal compensation from Verizon\n\nfor calls terminating with its Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\")\n\ncustomers as for all other telephone traffic.             In February 2000,\n\nGlobal NAPs withdrew its claim for payment of the August 1999\n\ninvoice from the PSC complaint.         One month later, the PSC issued a\n\ndeclaratory ruling upholding Global NAPs' position on the second\n\nclaim.\n\n             On May 8, 2000, Verizon brought the lawsuit underlying\n\nthis matter in the United States District Court for the Eastern\n\nDistrict of New York.       The complaint alleged that Global NAPs had\n\nfraudulently billed Verizon for \"tens of millions of dollars in\n\nreciprocal compensation charges for telephone calls that were never\n\nmade, or that if made, were of substantially shorter duration than\n\nclaimed on GNAPs' bills.\"            In total, Verizon articulated nine\n\ncauses of action in its complaint, including violations of RICO,\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe Telecom Act, and the Massachusetts Deceptive Trade Practices\n\nAct, as well as breach of contract and unjust enrichment.        Of\n\nparticular significance to this case, Verizon alleged that Global\n\nNAPs' prosecution of its administrative complaint before the New\n\nYork PSC was a \"predicate act\" supporting RICO liability:\n\n           Defendants' prosecution and maintenance of the\n           New York PSC proceeding relating to the number\n           of MOUs involved was itself a fraud, designed\n           to confuse Bell Atlantic and conceal the\n           nature of Defendants' racketeering activity.\n           Gangi and Rooney in particular submitted\n           papers, and directed GNAPs' counsel to submit\n           papers and take positions, that Defendants\n           knew were false and misleading.\n\n           Conspicuously absent from Verizon's lengthy complaint was\n\nany cause of action for malicious prosecution arising from Global\n\nNAPs' prosecution of the PSC action. Indeed, as the district court\n\nobserved in its decision, the term \"malicious prosecution\" does not\n\nappear anywhere in Verizon's complaint.    Nonetheless, Global NAPs\n\nasserts that various references to the PSC proceedings in Verizon's\n\ncomplaint adumbrated a claim for malicious prosecution, triggering\n\nFederal Insurance's duty to defend the Verizon action.      For the\n\nreasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n                                II.\n\nA. Duty to Defend\n\n           Both parties agree that Massachusetts law governs this\n\ndispute.   The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (SJC) has\n\nstated that\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f           the question of the initial duty of a\n           liability   insurer   to  defend   third-party\n           actions against the insured is decided by\n           matching the third-party complaint with the\n           policy provisions: if the allegations of the\n           complaint are \"reasonably susceptible\" of an\n           interpretation that they state or adumbrate a\n           claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer\n           must undertake the defense . . . . Otherwise\n           stated, the process is one of envisaging what\n           kinds of losses may be proved as lying within\n           the range of allegations of the complaint, and\n           then seeing whether any such loss fits the\n           expectation of protective insurance reasonably\n           generated by the terms of the policy.\n\nContinental Cas., 461 N.E.2d at 212 (quoting Sterilite Corp. v.\n\nContinental Cas. Co., 458 N.E.2d 338, 340-41 (Mass. App. Ct. 1983)\n\n(internal citations and footnote omitted)).\n\n           The SJC has stressed the broad scope of this duty.           See\n\nRubenstein v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, 708 N.E.2d 639, 643 n.4\n\n(Mass. 1999) (\"An insurer must tread cautiously regarding its duty\n\nto defend an insured against third-party actions in view of the\n\nexpansive interpretation given to that duty.\");            Boston Symphony\n\nOrchestra, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 545 N.E.2d 1156, 1158\n\n(Mass. 1989) (\"It is axiomatic that an insurance company's duty to\n\ndefend is broader than its duty to indemnify.\").          Accordingly, the\n\nabsence of any explicit claim for malicious prosecution in the\n\nVerizon complaint is not dispositive.              We must look beyond the\n\nspecified causes of action to determine whether the underlying\n\nallegations are \"'reasonably susceptible' of an interpretation that\n\nthey   state   or   adumbrate   a   claim\"   for    malicious   prosecution.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fLiberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. SCA Services, Inc., 588 N.E.2d 1346, 1347\n\n(Mass. 1992).\n\nB.   Malicious Prosecution\n\n             1.   The elements of malicious prosecution\n\n             To determine whether the allegations contained in the\n\nVerizon    complaint   state   or   adumbrate   a   claim   for   malicious\n\nprosecution, we must first identify the elements of the offense.\n\nThe district court concluded correctly that the elements of a claim\n\nfor malicious prosecution are governed by New York law because both\n\nthe PSC proceeding and the Verizon complaint were filed in New\n\nYork.     See Ethicon, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 737 F. Supp.\n\n1320, 1332-33 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (holding that the state where the\n\nunderlying action is filed should furnish the malicious prosecution\n\nstandard).    Under New York law\n\n            the elements essential to the maintenance of\n            an action to recover damages for malicious\n            prosecution are: (1) the commencement of a\n            judicial proceeding against the plaintiff, (2)\n            at the insistence of the defendant, (3)\n            without probable cause, (4) with malice, (5)\n            which action was terminated in favor of the\n            plaintiff, and (6) to the plaintiff's injury.3\n\nFelske v. Bernstein, 570 N.Y.S.2d 331, 332-33 (App. Div. 1991)\n\n(citing Berman v. Silver, Forrester & Schisano,549 N.Y.S.2d 125,\n\n\n\n     3\n      As we discuss subsequently, the sixth element of a malicious\nprosecution claim -- that the plaintiff has suffered an injury --\nhas been construed by the New York Court of Appeals to require a\nshowing of \"special damages.\" See Engel v. CBS, Inc., 711 N.E.2d\n626, 629-31 (N.Y. 1999).\n\n                                    -7-\n\f126 (App. Div. 1989)).            Global NAPs resists this doctrinaire\n\nconception of malicious prosecution, insisting that this phrase\n\nshould be understood according to its ordinary meaning and not\n\ntreated as a legal term of art: \"In construing liability insurance\n\npolicies, the Supreme Judicial Court . . . ordinarily looks to\n\ncommon usage, eschewing reliance upon nice legal distinctions that\n\nwould not be apparent to the lay policyholder.\"                       Global NAPs\n\nfurther argues that employing a lay understanding of malicious\n\nprosecution \"should lead the Court to find a defense obligation\n\nbecause   a    reasonable    lay     insured    would        expect    'malicious\n\nprosecution'    coverage     to    apply   to   allegations        that   it   had\n\nprosecuted a baseless claim to advance a fraudulent scheme.\"\n\n          An \"ordinary meaning\" approach to construing malicious\n\nprosecution    claims      has    been     rejected     in     a   majority     of\n\njurisdictions:\n\n          Though the meaning of 'malicious prosecution,'\n          as used in a commercial general liability\n          insurance policy, appears to be an issue of\n          first impression under Texas law, many other\n          courts throughout the country have addressed\n          this issue.   Most have held that \"malicious\n          prosecution\" in an insurance policy means the\n          technical legal definition of \"malicious\n          prosecution\"      under     the    applicable\n          jurisdiction's tort law.\n\nPennsylvania Pulp & Paper Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 100\n\nS.W.3d 566, 574 (Tex. App. 2003) (citing cases).                   In William J.\n\nTempleman Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 735 N.E.2d 669 (Ill. App.\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fCt. 2000), the court confronted the same argument raised here by\n\nGlobal NAPs:\n\n          The plaintiffs . . . argue that the term\n          \"malicious prosecution\" in the insurance\n          policies is ambiguous, and that such ambiguity\n          should be construed in their favor.         In\n          support   the   defendant  argues   that   the\n          ambiguity is demonstrated by the differing\n          interpretations of the parties in this case\n          [and] the lack of a definition of \"malicious\n          prosecution\" in the policy . . . . We find the\n          meaning of the term \"malicious prosecution\" in\n          this case is clear and unambiguous. The term\n          has long denoted a separate and independent\n          tort catalogued and discussed by Blackstone in\n          the eighteenth century.       See 3 William\n          Blackstone, Commentaries (Thomas M. Cooley\n          ed., Callagahan & Co. 1899) (1765). The clear\n          import of that term denotes coverage for an\n          insured who is sued for the established tort\n          of malicious prosecution.\n\nId. at 678-79.\n\n          The long common law history of \"malicious prosecution\"\n\nundermines     the   ordinary   meaning     construction   advocated   by\n\nappellants.      \"It is hardly unreasonable for a drafter of an\n\ninsurance instrument policy, or any other instrument, to expect\n\nthat a legal term used in the policy will be accorded the meaning\n\nthat the courts have given it.\"          Open Software Found. v. United\n\nStates Fid. & Guar. Co., No. Civ. A. 98-11177-GA, 2001 WL 1298878\n\nat *7 (D. Mass. Aug. 16, 2001); see Western Alliance Ins. Co. v.\n\nGill, 686 N.E.2d 997, 999 (Mass. 1997) (attributing legal rather\n\nthan ordinary meaning to exclusion provision in liability policy);\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fAtlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. McFadden, 595 N.E.2d 762, 764 (Mass.\n\n1992) (same).\n\n            We    therefore     conclude     that   New    York's      six-element\n\nstandard for malicious prosecution claims governs this insurance\n\ndispute.     We must now determine whether the allegations in the\n\nVerizon    complaint    state    or   adumbrate     a     claim    for   malicious\n\nprosecution.\n\n            2.    The Allegations in the Verizon Complaint\n\n            Federal Insurance argues that two required elements of a\n\nmalicious    prosecution      claim   are    not    alleged       in   the   Verizon\n\nComplaint:       1) a special injury, and 2) a termination of the PSC\n\nproceeding in Verizon's favor. We turn first to the special injury\n\nrequirement, mindful of the narrow scope of our review.                  As Global\n\nNAPs correctly points out, our charge is not to determine whether\n\nan allegation of special damages is apparent on the face of the\n\nVerizon complaint, or to analyze the merits of any such claim.\n\nContinental Cas., 461 N.E.2d at 212; Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 588\n\nN.E.2d at 1347.      To survive summary judgment, Global NAPs need not\n\ndemonstrate or even allege that Verizon could have proven the\n\nexistence of special damages resulting from the PSC proceeding.\n\nUnder well-settled Massachusetts law, our objective is simply to\n\nascertain whether the allegations in the Verizon complaint are\n\nreasonably susceptible to an interpretation that they adumbrate, or\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fsketch, an allegation of special damages.    Continental Cas., 461\n\nN.E.2d at 212.\n\n          In Engel, 711 N.E.2d at 626, the New York Court of\n\nAppeals addressed the required element of special damages for\n\nmalicious prosecution claims:\n\n          [I]t seems clear that New York law has deemed\n          special injury to be a necessary consequence\n          of a malicious prosecution . . . . [W]hat is\n          'special' about special injury is that the\n          defendant must abide some concrete harm that\n          is considerably more cumbersome than the\n          physical, psychological or financial demands\n          of defending a lawsuit.\n\nId. at 629-31.   The Engel court further elaborated that \"[a]ctual\n\nimposition of a provisional remedy need not occur, and a highly\n\nsubstantial and identifiable interference with person, property or\n\nbusiness will suffice.\"   Id. at 631.   Global NAPs' position that\n\nVerizon adequately alleged special injury is rooted primarily in\n\nParagraph 131 of the Verizon complaint, which reads as follows:\n\n          On or about September 3, 1999, Rooney prepared\n          a complaint for filing with the New York PSC\n          in which GNAPs demanded payment for reciprocal\n          compensation pursuant to the invoices it had\n          sent to Bell Atlantic . . . . In that\n          complaint, Rooney claims that GNAPs is\n          entitled to the full amount of the unpaid\n          invoices,    even   though   he    knew   that\n          approximately one half of the amount sought\n          arose from the Defendants' criminal fraud\n          involving phantom MOUs, and not from any\n          actual use by or non-fraudulent charge to Bell\n          Atlantic. Rooney wrote and sent the complaint\n          - and thereby commenced the proceeding - with\n          the intention of concealing the fraud from\n          Bell Atlantic, so that GNAPs could continue to\n          collect reciprocal compensation while the MOU\n\n                                -11-\n\f          dispute dragged on, and with the intention of\n          persuading the PSC to become an unwitting\n          accomplice to Defendants' Phantom MOUs Scheme.\n\n(emphasis added).   The appellants' theory is that Verizon alleged\n\nin the underlying complaint that Global NAPs' prosecution of its\n\nbaseless invoice claim before the New York PSC precluded Verizon\n\nfrom uncovering the fraud.   As a result, Verizon suffered damages\n\nin the amount of their payments for \"phantom MOUs\" from September\n\n1999 (when the PSC complaint was filed) to February 2000 (when\n\nGlobal NAPs withdrew the invoice claim from the PSC complaint).\n\n          Global NAPs can defeat Federal Insurance's motion for\n\nsummary judgment on this theory only if the Verizon complaint can\n\nbe read to make the following two assertions:   1) Verizon was in a\n\nposition to uncover the \"phantom MOUs scheme\" by September 1999,\n\nbut 2) Verizon was prevented from doing so by Global NAPs' decision\n\nto file the PSC Complaint.   Yet the Verizon complaint contains no\n\nsuch assertions (either explicit or implicit). Indeed, critical\n\nportions of the complaint actually refute any contention that the\n\nPSC proceedings delayed Verizon's discovery of Global NAPs' billing\n\nirregularities.   The complaint specifies that by late 1998 (nearly\n\na full year before Global NAPs commenced the PSC complaint) Verizon\n\nwas using a software package called \"AcceSS7\" that enabled local\n\nexchange carriers to monitor the number of MOUs generated by\n\ntraffic sent to the networks of competing local carriers like\n\nGlobal NAPs.   According to the complaint:\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f          The AcceSS7 software provided an accurate\n          measurement of the MOUs for which GNAPs was\n          legitimately entitled to receive reciprocal\n          compensation for the periods during which it\n          was used to measure GNAPs' MOUs. The results\n          obtained by use of the AcceSS7 software also\n          provided an accurate basis upon which to\n          estimate the true number of MOUs for which\n          GNAPs was entitled to reciprocal compensation\n          for all other periods.\n\nThe Complaint further suggests that Verizon had implemented the\n\nsoftware and begun exposing the alleged fraud as early as April\n\n1999, nearly six months before Global NAPs initiated the PSC\n\naction:\n\n          Bell Atlantic first measured GNAPs MOUs in\n          April 1999, in the heavily trafficked [area\n          of] Boston, Massachusetts.        That check\n          revealed a staggering disparity between the\n          number of MOUs GNAPs invoiced to Bell Atlantic\n          . . . during that month, and the actual number\n          of MOUs for calls handed off to the GNAP's\n          network. In response, Bell Atlantic focused\n          more of its monitoring efforts onto GNAPs,\n          extending its scrutiny to other . . . states.\n          Over the following months, these examinations\n          demonstrated a consistent pattern of massive\n          overstatement of MOUs by GNAPs.\n\n          In short, the complaint cannot be read to allege that the\n\nPSC action stymied Verizon in its efforts to uncover the fraudulent\n\nMOUs scheme, which was actually revealed months earlier with the\n\naid of AcceSS7.   Indeed, it was Verizon's use of AcceSS7 to monitor\n\nMOUs in the New York area that initially led the company to\n\nwithhold reciprocal compensation invoiced in August 1999, which in\n\nturn prompted Global NAPs to file the invoice claim with the PSC.\n\n                                -13-\n\fAccording to Verizon's complaint, the revelation that Global NAPs'\n\nMOUs could be independently verified using AcceSS7 led Global NAPs\n\nto scale back its fraudulent billing:\n\n          [i]n the months immediately following Bell\n          Atlantic's disclosure, the MOUs for which\n          GNAPs   was   billing   Bell   Atlantic   began\n          increasing at a markedly slower rate of\n          growth.   This flattening of its growth rate\n          occurred at a time when the industry in\n          general   continued   its    rapid   expansion.\n          Concerned about Bell Atlantic's scrutiny,\n          Defendants   began    generating    a   smaller\n          percentage of phantom MOUs in each invoice.\n\nWhile it appears that Verizon periodically attempted to obtain\n\ndocumentation from Global NAPs for its invoices, there is no\n\nsuggestion in the complaint or elsewhere in the record that the\n\ninformation Verizon obtained through AcceSS7 painted an incomplete\n\npicture of the fraud in the coverage areas where the software was\n\nimplemented.   The allegations in the complaint do reflect that\n\nVerizon had uncovered Global NAPs' fraudulent billing practices,\n\nand that Global NAPs was reacting to their discovery in the months\n\npreceding the filing of the PSC action. Consequently, Global NAPs'\n\nportrayal of the PSC action as a successful obfuscatory tactic is\n\nwithout basis in the complaint.\n\n          For reasons that are unclear, it appears that Verizon\n\ncontinued to rely on certain Global NAPs invoices after April 1999,\n\npresumably in coverage areas where it had not yet implemented the\n\nAcceSS7 monitoring software.   What is beyond dispute, however, is\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fthat the timing of Verizon's acceptance and rejection of various\n\nGlobal   NAPs   invoices   does   not   correspond   to   the   filing   and\n\nwithdrawal of the PSC claim.      Not only had Verizon begun to uncover\n\nthe fraud before the filing of the PSC complaint, but the complaint\n\nalleges that the fraud did not end with the February withdrawal of\n\nthe PSC claim.    As of May 8, 2000 (three months after the invoice\n\nclaim was withdrawn), Global NAPs was allegedly \"continu[ing] to\n\ntransmit fraudulently overstated invoices for phantom MOUs for\n\nRhode Island to Bell Atlantic each month.\"            These allegations\n\nfurther undermine Global NAPs' theory that Verizon's awareness of\n\nthe fraudulent MOU scheme was somehow tied to the PSC proceedings.\n\nIn the end, nothing in the complaint explains or even hints at a\n\ncausal connection between the PSC action and any delayed discovery\n\nby Verizon of the phantom MOU scheme.       The complaint unambiguously\n\nindicates that Verizon had begun uncovering the fraud many months\n\nbefore the PSC action, and that as of April 1999 they were using\n\nsoftware that provided reliable measures of the MOUs transferred\n\nfrom their network to Global NAPs.\n\n           Massachusetts law directs us to broadly construe and\n\nextrapolate from the language of the complaint to determine whether\n\nthe plaintiff in the underlying action has adumbrated a claim\n\ncovered by the insurance policy.          But we cannot credit a theory\n\nof coverage that flatly contradicts facts and assertions made\n\nexplicit in the complaint.        One would have to selectively ignore\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fthe portions of the complaint excerpted above to construe the\n\ncomplaint as alleging that Global NAPs' prosecution of the PSC\n\naction imposed \"a highly substantial and identifiable interference\n\nwith business,\" Engel, 711 N.E.2d at 631, by obscuring Global NAPs'\n\nfraudulent practices.     This we cannot do.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            Because we conclude that the Verizon complaint does not\n\nallege the required element of special injury, we need not address\n\nthe question of whether the PSC proceeding was terminated in\n\nVerizon's favor.   The Verizon complaint did not state or adumbrate\n\na claim for malicious prosecution as that offense is defined by New\n\nYork law.    The decision below is affirmed.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f",

Gangi, William J. Rooney, Jr. and Janet Lima (collectively, \"Global NAPs\" or \"GNAPS\") brought this diversity action against defendant Federal Insurance Company (\"Federal Insurance\"), seeking reimbursement of litigation expenses incurred in the course of defending a lawsuit brought by Verizon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> At the time Verizon filed its complaint, Global NAPs was covered by a combination insurance policy issued by Federal Insurance that obliged the insurance company \"to defend any insured against a suit seeking damages for... personal injury.\" The policy pertinently defined personal injury as \"injury... arising out of one or more of the following offenses, committed in the course of your business ... (B) malicious prosecution.\" Global NAPs argues that the Verizon complaint adumbrated<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> a claim for malicious prosecution, <i>see Continental Cas. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co.,</i> 391 Mass. 143, 461 N.E.2d 209, 212 (1984), triggering Federal Insurance's duty to defend the lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, concluding in a thorough and well-reasoned decision that the Verizon action could not be construed to adumbrate a claim for malicious prosecution. For the reasons that follow, we agree that Federal Insurance was not obligated to defend the Verizon action under the terms of the policy. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs and Verizon are telecommunications carriers offering local telephone service to customers in New York and New England. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"Telecom Act\"), 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 201-231 (2002), local exchange carriers must permit competing carriers to interconnect with their telephone networks, thereby allowing customers of different local carriers to connect to each other. Generally, only the carrier of the customer who originates a phone call bills the customer, even though the carrier of the party on the receiving end also incurs costs to connect the call. Thus, if a Verizon customer calls a Global NAPs customer, Verizon would initially bill its customer for the phone call, and then compensate Global NAPs for handing off the call to its own customer. The Telecom Act obliges local exchange carriers to establish \"reciprocal compensation arrangements\" that govern the originating carrier's obligation to reimburse the terminating carrier. The rates that a terminating carrier may charge are set by the public utility commission (\"PUC\") or public service commission (\"PSC\") for each state, and are generally based on minutes of use (\"MOUs\") generated by traffic sent to that carrier's network.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 1999, Global NAPs filed an administrative complaint before the New York PSC encompassing two distinct claims. First, Global NAPs alleged that Verizon unlawfully withheld reciprocal compensation for MOUs invoiced in August 1999. The second claim sought a declaration from the PSC that Global NAPs was entitled to the same rate of reciprocal compensation from Verizon for calls terminating with its Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\") customers as for all other telephone traffic. In February 2000, Global NAPs withdrew its claim for payment of the August 1999 invoice from the PSC complaint. One month later, the PSC issued a declaratory ruling upholding Global NAPs' position on the second claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 8, 2000, Verizon brought the lawsuit underlying this matter in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint alleged that Global NAPs had fraudulently billed Verizon for \"tens of millions of dollars in reciprocal compensation charges for telephone calls that were never made, or that if made, were of substantially shorter duration than claimed on GNAPs' bills.\" In total, Verizon articulated nine causes of action in its complaint, including violations of RICO, the Telecom Act, and the Massachusetts Deceptive Trade Practices Act, as well as breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Of particular significance to this case, Verizon alleged that Global NAPs' prosecution of its administrative complaint before the New York PSC was a \"predicate act\" supporting RICO liability:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' prosecution and maintenance of the New York PSC proceeding relating to the number of MOUs involved was itself a fraud, designed to confuse Bell Atlantic and conceal the nature of Defendants' racketeering activity. Gangi and Rooney in particular submitted papers, and directed GNAPs' counsel to submit papers and take positions, that Defendants knew were false and misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conspicuously absent from Verizon's lengthy complaint was any cause of action for malicious prosecution arising from Global NAPs' prosecution of the PSC action. Indeed, as the district court observed in its decision, the term \"malicious prosecution\" does not appear anywhere in Verizon's complaint. Nonetheless, Global NAPs asserts that various references to the PSC proceedings in Verizon's complaint adumbrated a claim for malicious prosecution, triggering Federal Insurance's duty to defend the Verizon action. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Duty to Defend</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties agree that Massachusetts law governs this dispute. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (SJC) has stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend third-party actions against the insured is decided by matching the third-party complaint with the policy provisions: if the allegations of the complaint are \"reasonably susceptible\" of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.... Otherwise stated, the process is one of envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Continental Cas.,</i> 461 N.E.2d at 212 (quoting <i>Sterilite Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co.,</i> 17 Mass.App.Ct. 316, 458 N.E.2d 338, 340-41 (1983) (internal citations and footnote omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC has stressed the broad scope of this duty. <i>See Rubenstein v. Royal Ins. Co. of America,</i> 429 Mass. 355, 708 N.E.2d 639, 643 n. 4 (1999) (\"An insurer must tread cautiously regarding its duty to defend an insured against third-party actions in view of the expansive interpretation given to that duty.\"); <i>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> 406 Mass. 7, 545 N.E.2d 1156, 1158 (1989) (\"It is axiomatic that an insurance company's duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.\"). Accordingly, the absence of any explicit claim for malicious prosecution in the Verizon complaint is not dispositive. We must look beyond the specified causes of action to determine whether the underlying allegations are \"`reasonably susceptible' of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim\" for malicious prosecution. <i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. SCA Services, Inc.,</i> 412 Mass. 330, 588 N.E.2d 1346, 1347 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Malicious Prosecution</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The elements of malicious prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether the allegations contained in the Verizon complaint state or adumbrate a claim for malicious prosecution, we must first identify the elements of the offense. The district court concluded correctly that the elements of a claim for malicious prosecution are governed by New York law because both the PSC proceeding and the Verizon complaint were filed in New York. <i>See Ethicon, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> 737 F.Supp. 1320, 1332-33 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (holding that the state where the underlying action is filed should furnish the malicious prosecution standard).

Global NAPs resists this doctrinaire conception of malicious prosecution, insisting that this phrase should be understood according to its ordinary meaning and not treated as a legal term of art: \"In construing liability insurance policies, the Supreme Judicial Court ... ordinarily looks to common usage, eschewing reliance upon nice legal distinctions that would not be apparent to the lay policyholder.\" Global NAPs further argues that employing a lay understanding of malicious prosecution \"should lead the Court to find a defense obligation because a reasonable lay insured would expect `malicious prosecution' coverage to apply to allegations that it had prosecuted a baseless claim to advance a fraudulent scheme.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An \"ordinary meaning\" approach to construing malicious prosecution claims has been rejected in a majority of jurisdictions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the meaning of `malicious prosecution,' as used in a commercial general liability insurance policy, appears to be an issue of first impression under Texas law, many other courts throughout the country have addressed this issue. Most have held that \"malicious prosecution\" in an insurance policy means the technical legal definition of \"malicious prosecution\" under the applicable jurisdiction's tort law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pennsylvania Pulp &amp; Paper Co. v.

In support the defendant argues that the ambiguity is demonstrated by the differing interpretations of the parties in this case [and] the lack of a definition of \"malicious prosecution\" in the policy.... We find the meaning of the term \"malicious prosecution\" in this case is clear and unambiguous. The term has long denoted a separate and independent tort catalogued and discussed by Blackstone in the eighteenth century. <i>See</i> 3 William Blackstone, <i>Commentaries</i> (Thomas M. Cooley ed., Callagahan &amp; Co. 1899) (1765). The clear import of that term denotes coverage for an insured who is sued for the established tort of malicious prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 678-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The long common law history of \"malicious prosecution\" undermines the ordinary meaning construction advocated by appellants. \"It is hardly unreasonable for a drafter of an insurance instrument policy, or any other instrument, to expect that a legal term used in the policy will be accorded the meaning that the courts have given it.\" <i>Open Software Found. v.

We must now determine whether the allegations in the Verizon complaint state or adumbrate a claim for malicious prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Allegations in the Verizon Complaint</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Insurance argues that two required elements of a malicious prosecution claim are not alleged in the Verizon Complaint: 1) a special injury, and 2) a termination of the PSC proceeding in Verizon's favor. We turn first to the special injury requirement, mindful of the narrow scope of our review. As Global NAPs correctly points out, our charge is not to determine whether an allegation of special damages is apparent on the face of the Verizon complaint, or to analyze the merits of any such claim. <i>Continental Cas.,</i> 461 N.E.2d at 212; <i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 588 N.E.2d at 1347. To survive summary judgment, Global NAPs need not demonstrate or even allege that Verizon could have proven the existence of special damages resulting from the PSC proceeding. Under well-settled Massachusetts law, our objective is simply to ascertain whether the allegations in the Verizon complaint are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that they adumbrate, or sketch, an allegation of special damages. <i>Continental Cas.,</i> 461 N.E.2d at 212.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Engel,</i> 689 N.Y.S.2d 411, 711 N.E.2d at 626, the New York Court of Appeals addressed the required element of special damages for malicious prosecution claims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t seems clear that New York law has deemed special injury to be a necessary consequence of a malicious prosecution.... [W]hat is `special' about special injury is that the defendant must abide some concrete harm that is considerably more cumbersome than the physical, psychological or financial demands of defending a lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 629-31. The <i>Engel</i> court further elaborated that \"[a]ctual imposition of a provisional remedy need not occur, and a highly substantial and identifiable interference with person, property or business will suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 631. Global NAPs' position that Verizon adequately alleged special injury is rooted primarily in Paragraph 131 of the Verizon complaint, which reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about September 3, 1999, Rooney prepared a complaint for filing with the New York PSC in which GNAPs demanded payment for reciprocal compensation pursuant to the invoices it had sent to Bell Atlantic.... In that complaint, Rooney claims that GNAPs is entitled to the full amount of the unpaid invoices, even though he knew that approximately one half of the amount sought arose from the Defendants' criminal fraud involving phantom MOUs, and not from any actual use by or non-fraudulent charge to Bell Atlantic. <i>Rooney wrote and sent the complaint &#8212; and thereby commenced the proceeding &#8212; with the intention of concealing the fraud from Bell Atlantic, so that GNAPs could continue to collect reciprocal compensation while the MOU dispute dragged on,</i> and with the intention of persuading the PSC to become an unwitting accomplice to Defendants' Phantom MOUs Scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). The appellants' theory is that Verizon alleged in the underlying complaint that Global NAPs' prosecution of its baseless invoice claim before the New York PSC precluded Verizon from uncovering the fraud. As a result, Verizon suffered damages in the amount of their payments for \"phantom MOUs\" from September 1999 (when the PSC complaint was filed) to February 2000 (when Global NAPs withdrew the invoice claim from the PSC complaint).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs can defeat Federal Insurance's motion for summary judgment on this theory only if the Verizon complaint can be read to make the following two assertions: 1) Verizon was in a position to uncover the \"phantom MOUs scheme\" by September 1999, but 2) Verizon was prevented from doing so by Global NAPs' decision to file the PSC Complaint. Yet the Verizon complaint contains no such assertions (either explicit or implicit). Indeed, critical portions of the complaint actually refute any contention that the PSC proceedings delayed Verizon's discovery of Global NAPs' billing irregularities. The complaint specifies that by late 1998 (nearly a full year before Global NAPs commenced the PSC complaint) Verizon was using a software package called \"AcceSS7\" that enabled local exchange carriers to monitor the number of MOUs generated by traffic sent to the networks of competing local carriers like Global NAPs. According to the complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AcceSS7 software provided an accurate measurement of the MOUs for which GNAPs was legitimately entitled to receive reciprocal compensation for the periods during which it was used to measure GNAPs' MOUs. The results obtained by use of the AcceSS7 software also provided an accurate basis upon which to estimate the true number of MOUs for which GNAPs was entitled to reciprocal compensation for all other periods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint further suggests that Verizon had implemented the software and begun exposing the alleged fraud as early as April 1999, nearly six months before Global NAPs initiated the PSC action:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell Atlantic first measured GNAPs MOUs in April 1999, in the heavily trafficked [area of] Boston, Massachusetts. That check revealed a staggering disparity between the number of MOUs GNAPs invoiced to Bell Atlantic ... during that month, and the actual number of MOUs for calls handed off to the GNAP's network. In response, Bell Atlantic focused more of its monitoring efforts onto GNAPs, extending its scrutiny to other ... states. Over the following months, these examinations demonstrated a consistent pattern of massive overstatement of MOUs by GNAPs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the complaint cannot be read to allege that the PSC action stymied Verizon in its efforts to uncover the fraudulent MOUs scheme, which was actually revealed months earlier with the aid of AcceSS7. Indeed, it was Verizon's use of AcceSS7 to monitor MOUs in the New York area that initially led the company to withhold reciprocal compensation invoiced in August 1999, which in turn prompted Global NAPs to file the invoice claim with the PSC. According to Verizon's complaint, the revelation that Global NAPs' MOUs could be independently verified using AcceSS7 led Global NAPs to scale back its fraudulent billing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]n the months immediately following Bell Atlantic's disclosure, the MOUs for which GNAPs was billing Bell Atlantic began increasing at a markedly slower rate of growth. This flattening of its growth rate occurred at a time when the industry in general continued its rapid expansion. Concerned about Bell Atlantic's scrutiny, Defendants began generating a smaller percentage of phantom MOUs in each invoice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it appears that Verizon periodically attempted to obtain documentation from Global NAPs for its invoices, there is no suggestion in the complaint or elsewhere in the record that the information Verizon obtained through AcceSS7 painted an incomplete picture of the fraud in the coverage areas where the software was implemented. The allegations in the complaint do reflect that Verizon had uncovered Global NAPs' fraudulent billing practices, and that Global NAPs was reacting to their discovery in the months preceding the filing of the PSC action. Consequently, Global NAPs' portrayal of the PSC action as a successful obfuscatory tactic is without basis in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that are unclear, it appears that Verizon continued to rely on certain Global NAPs invoices after April 1999, presumably in coverage areas where it had not yet implemented the AcceSS7 monitoring software. What is beyond dispute, however, is that the timing of Verizon's acceptance and rejection of various Global NAPs invoices does not correspond to the filing and withdrawal of the PSC claim. Not only had Verizon begun to uncover the fraud before the filing of the PSC complaint, but the complaint alleges that the fraud did not end with the February withdrawal of the PSC claim. As of May 8, 2000 (three months after the invoice claim was withdrawn), Global NAPs was allegedly \"continu[ing] to transmit fraudulently overstated invoices for phantom MOUs for Rhode Island to Bell Atlantic each month.\" These allegations further undermine Global NAPs' theory that Verizon's awareness of the fraudulent MOU scheme was somehow tied to the PSC proceedings. In the end, nothing in the complaint explains or even hints at a causal connection between the PSC action and any delayed discovery by Verizon of the phantom MOU scheme. The complaint unambiguously indicates that Verizon had begun uncovering the fraud many months before the PSC action, and that as of April 1999 they were using software that provided reliable measures of the MOUs transferred from their network to Global NAPs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law directs us to broadly construe and extrapolate from the language of the complaint to determine whether the plaintiff in the underlying action has adumbrated a claim covered by the insurance policy.

Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs and Verizon are telecommunications carriers offering local telephone service to customers in New York and New England. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"Telecom Act\"), 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 201-231 (2002), local exchange carriers must permit competing carriers to interconnect with their telephone networks, thereby allowing customers of different local carriers to connect to each other. Generally, only the carrier of the customer who originates a phone call bills the customer, even though the carrier of the party on the receiving end also incurs costs to connect the call. Thus, if a Verizon customer calls a Global NAPs customer, Verizon would initially bill its customer for the phone call, and then compensate Global NAPs for handing off the call to its own customer. The Telecom Act obliges local exchange carriers to establish \"reciprocal compensation arrangements\" that govern the originating carrier's obligation to reimburse the terminating carrier. The rates that a terminating carrier may charge are set by the public utility commission (\"PUC\") or public service commission (\"PSC\") for each state, and are generally based on minutes of use (\"MOUs\") generated by traffic sent to that carrier's network.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 1999, Global NAPs filed an administrative complaint before the New York PSC encompassing two distinct claims. First, Global NAPs alleged that Verizon unlawfully withheld reciprocal compensation for MOUs invoiced in August 1999. The second claim sought a declaration from the PSC that Global NAPs was entitled to the same rate of reciprocal compensation from Verizon for calls terminating with its Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\") customers as for all other telephone traffic. In February 2000, Global NAPs withdrew its claim for payment of the August 1999 invoice from the PSC complaint. One month later, the PSC issued a declaratory ruling upholding Global NAPs' position on the second claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 8, 2000, Verizon brought the lawsuit underlying this matter in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint alleged that Global NAPs had fraudulently billed Verizon for \"tens of millions of dollars in reciprocal compensation charges for telephone calls that were never made, or that if made, were of substantially shorter duration than claimed on GNAPs' bills.\" In total, Verizon articulated nine causes of action in its complaint, including violations of RICO, the Telecom Act, and the Massachusetts Deceptive Trade Practices Act, as well as breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Of particular significance to this case, Verizon alleged that Global NAPs' prosecution of its administrative complaint before the New York PSC was a \"predicate act\" supporting RICO liability:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' prosecution and maintenance of the New York PSC proceeding relating to the number of MOUs involved was itself a fraud, designed to confuse Bell Atlantic and conceal the nature of Defendants' racketeering activity. Gangi and Rooney in particular submitted papers, and directed GNAPs' counsel to submit papers and take positions, that Defendants knew were false and misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conspicuously absent from Verizon's lengthy complaint was any cause of action for malicious prosecution arising from Global NAPs' prosecution of the PSC action. Indeed, as the district court observed in its decision, the term \"malicious prosecution\" does not appear anywhere in Verizon's complaint. Nonetheless, Global NAPs asserts that various references to the PSC proceedings in Verizon's complaint adumbrated a claim for malicious prosecution, triggering Federal Insurance's duty to defend the Verizon action. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

The Allegations in the Verizon Complaint</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Insurance argues that two required elements of a malicious prosecution claim are not alleged in the Verizon Complaint: 1) a special injury, and 2) a termination of the PSC proceeding in Verizon's favor. We turn first to the special injury requirement, mindful of the narrow scope of our review. As Global NAPs correctly points out, our charge is not to determine whether an allegation of special damages is apparent on the face of the Verizon complaint, or to analyze the merits of any such claim. <i>Continental Cas.,</i> 461 N.E.2d at 212; <i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 588 N.E.2d at 1347. To survive summary judgment, Global NAPs need not demonstrate or even allege that Verizon could have proven the existence of special damages resulting from the PSC proceeding. Under well-settled Massachusetts law, our objective is simply to ascertain whether the allegations in the Verizon complaint are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that they adumbrate, or sketch, an allegation of special damages. <i>Continental Cas.,</i> 461 N.E.2d at 212.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Engel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2210424\"><a href=\"/opinion/2210424/engel-v-cbs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 711 N.E.2d at 626, the New York Court of Appeals addressed the required element of special damages for malicious prosecution claims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t seems clear that New York law has deemed special injury to be a necessary consequence of a malicious prosecution.... [W]hat is `special' about special injury is that the defendant must abide some concrete harm that is considerably more cumbersome than the physical, psychological or financial demands of defending a lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 629-31. The <i>Engel</i> court further elaborated that \"[a]ctual imposition of a provisional remedy need not occur, and a highly substantial and identifiable interference with person, property or business will suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 631. Global NAPs' position that Verizon adequately alleged special injury is rooted primarily in Paragraph 131 of the Verizon complaint, which reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about September 3, 1999, Rooney prepared a complaint for filing with the New York PSC in which GNAPs demanded payment for reciprocal compensation pursuant to the invoices it had sent to Bell Atlantic.... In that complaint, Rooney claims that GNAPs is entitled to the full amount of the unpaid invoices, even though he knew that approximately one half of the amount sought arose from the Defendants' criminal fraud involving phantom MOUs, and not from any actual use by or non-fraudulent charge to Bell Atlantic. <i>Rooney wrote and sent the complaint &#8212; and thereby commenced the proceeding &#8212; with the intention of concealing the fraud from Bell Atlantic, so that GNAPs could continue to collect reciprocal compensation while the MOU dispute dragged on,</i> and with the intention of persuading the PSC to become an unwitting accomplice to Defendants' Phantom MOUs Scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). The appellants' theory is that Verizon alleged in the underlying complaint that Global NAPs' prosecution of its baseless invoice claim before the New York PSC precluded Verizon from uncovering the fraud. As a result, Verizon suffered damages in the amount of their payments for \"phantom MOUs\" from September 1999 (when the PSC complaint was filed) to February 2000 (when Global NAPs withdrew the invoice claim from the PSC complaint).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs can defeat Federal Insurance's motion for summary judgment on this theory only if the Verizon complaint can be read to make the following two assertions: 1) Verizon was in a position to uncover the \"phantom MOUs scheme\" by September 1999, but 2) Verizon was prevented from doing so by Global NAPs' decision to file the PSC Complaint. Yet the Verizon complaint contains no such assertions (either explicit or implicit). Indeed, critical portions of the complaint actually refute any contention that the PSC proceedings delayed Verizon's discovery of Global NAPs' billing irregularities. The complaint specifies that by late 1998 (nearly a full year before Global NAPs commenced the PSC complaint) Verizon was using a software package called \"AcceSS7\" that enabled local exchange carriers to monitor the number of MOUs generated by traffic sent to the networks of competing local carriers like Global NAPs. According to the complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AcceSS7 software provided an accurate measurement of the MOUs for which GNAPs was legitimately entitled to receive reciprocal compensation for the periods during which it was used to measure GNAPs' MOUs. The results obtained by use of the AcceSS7 software also provided an accurate basis upon which to estimate the true number of MOUs for which GNAPs was entitled to reciprocal compensation for all other periods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint further suggests that Verizon had implemented the software and begun exposing the alleged fraud as early as April 1999, nearly six months before Global NAPs initiated the PSC action:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell Atlantic first measured GNAPs MOUs in April 1999, in the heavily trafficked [area of] Boston, Massachusetts. That check revealed a staggering disparity between the number of MOUs GNAPs invoiced to Bell Atlantic ... during that month, and the actual number of MOUs for calls handed off to the GNAP's network. In response, Bell Atlantic focused more of its monitoring efforts onto GNAPs, extending its scrutiny to other ... states. Over the following months, these examinations demonstrated a consistent pattern of massive overstatement of MOUs by GNAPs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the complaint cannot be read to allege that the PSC action stymied Verizon in its efforts to uncover the fraudulent MOUs scheme, which was actually revealed months earlier with the aid of AcceSS7. Indeed, it was Verizon's use of AcceSS7 to monitor MOUs in the New York area that initially led the company to withhold reciprocal compensation invoiced in August 1999, which in turn prompted Global NAPs to file the invoice claim with the PSC. According to Verizon's complaint, the revelation that Global NAPs' MOUs could be independently verified using AcceSS7 led Global NAPs to scale back its fraudulent billing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]n the months immediately following Bell Atlantic's disclosure, the MOUs for which GNAPs was billing Bell Atlantic began increasing at a markedly slower rate of growth. This flattening of its growth rate occurred at a time when the industry in general continued its rapid expansion. Concerned about Bell Atlantic's scrutiny, Defendants began generating a smaller percentage of phantom MOUs in each invoice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it appears that Verizon periodically attempted to obtain documentation from Global NAPs for its invoices, there is no suggestion in the complaint or elsewhere in the record that the information Verizon obtained through AcceSS7 painted an incomplete picture of the fraud in the coverage areas where the software was implemented. The allegations in the complaint do reflect that Verizon had uncovered Global NAPs' fraudulent billing practices, and that Global NAPs was reacting to their discovery in the months preceding the filing of the PSC action. Consequently, Global NAPs' portrayal of the PSC action as a successful obfuscatory tactic is without basis in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that are unclear, it appears that Verizon continued to rely on certain Global NAPs invoices after April 1999, presumably in coverage areas where it had not yet implemented the AcceSS7 monitoring software. What is beyond dispute, however, is that the timing of Verizon's acceptance and rejection of various Global NAPs invoices does not correspond to the filing and withdrawal of the PSC claim. Not only had Verizon begun to uncover the fraud before the filing of the PSC complaint, but the complaint alleges that the fraud did not end with the February withdrawal of the PSC claim. As of May 8, 2000 (three months after the invoice claim was withdrawn), Global NAPs was allegedly \"continu[ing] to transmit fraudulently overstated invoices for phantom MOUs for Rhode Island to Bell Atlantic each month.\" These allegations further undermine Global NAPs' theory that Verizon's awareness of the fraudulent MOU scheme was somehow tied to the PSC proceedings. In the end, nothing in the complaint explains or even hints at a causal connection between the PSC action and any delayed discovery by Verizon of the phantom MOU scheme. The complaint unambiguously indicates that Verizon had begun uncovering the fraud many months before the PSC action, and that as of April 1999 they were using software that provided reliable measures of the MOUs transferred from their network to Global NAPs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law directs us to broadly construe and extrapolate from the language of the complaint to determine whether the plaintiff in the underlying action has adumbrated a claim covered by the insurance policy. But we cannot credit a theory of coverage that flatly contradicts facts and assertions made explicit in the complaint. One would have to selectively ignore the portions of the complaint excerpted above to construe the complaint as alleging that Global NAPs' prosecution of the PSC action imposed \"a highly substantial and identifiable interference with business,\" <i>Engel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2210424\"><a href=\"/opinion/2210424/engel-v-cbs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 711 N.E.2d at 631, by obscuring Global NAPs' fraudulent practices.
