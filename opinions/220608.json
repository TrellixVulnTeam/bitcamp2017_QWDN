Prudencio Méndez-Aponte, the\n\nformer Assistant Secretary of State for Protocol Affairs at the\n\nPuerto   Rico     State   Department,   sued    Fernando    Bonilla,   in   his\n\npersonal and official capacity as the Secretary of State of the\n\nPuerto Rico State Department, alleging that Bonilla fired him due\n\nto his political affiliation.              Méndez-Aponte's claim did not\n\nsurvive Bonilla's motion for summary judgment.             The district court\n\nsanctioned      Méndez-Aponte's     attorneys     $1000    each   because    it\n\nconcluded that the pleadings and responses that they submitted\n\nviolated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).            Méndez-Aponte and\n\nhis attorneys now appeal alleging that the district court erred in\n\ngranting Bonilla's summary judgment motion and imposing sanctions.\n\nWe affirm the district court's decision.\n\n                               I.   Background\n\n            Méndez-Aponte was the Assistant Secretary of State for\n\nProtocol Affairs at the Puerto Rico State Department from June 1,\n\n2001 until March 3, 2006.       Méndez-Aponte alleges that, in 2005, in\n\nthe course of his official duties and during \"official meetings\n\nwhere the economic situation of the government of Puerto Rico and\n\nof the [Puerto Rico] State Department . . . were discussed,\" he\n\nsuggested    to   Marisara   Pont-Marchese,      the   interim    Puerto    Rico\n\nSecretary of State, that investing in Iraqi dinars would be a good\n\nlong-term investment for Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          Méndez-Aponte      alleges    that     on   August    21,   2005,    a\n\njournalist from El Nuevo Día, a Puerto Rican newspaper, called him\n\nto inquire about rumors that employees at the Puerto Rico State\n\nDepartment were selling Iraqi dinars during office hours.              Méndez-\n\nAponte contacted Bonilla to inform him about the journalist's\n\ninquiry and they set up a meeting to discuss the matter the next\n\nday.   The next day, before this discussion could take place,\n\nMéndez-Aponte found out from the press that Bonilla had fired him\n\nand had also asked the Director of the Government Ethics Office to\n\ninvestigate the rumors that dinars were sold at the Puerto Rico\n\nState Department.    According to Méndez-Aponte, that same day, the\n\nSubsecretary   of    State   asked     Méndez-Aponte     to    meet   with    an\n\ninvestigator   who    was    conducting     an    inquiry      regarding      the\n\nallegations.   On August 24, 2005, Méndez-Aponte received a written\n\nnotification, dated August 22, 2005, informing him that he had been\n\nremoved from his position due to illegal conduct.               Specifically,\n\nthe letter stated that Méndez-Aponte was suspended because he\n\n\"engaged in . . . conduct that is clearly detrimental to the moral\n\nand good name of the Department.\"1\n\n\n\n\n1\n   In his motion for summary judgment, Bonilla alleged that he\nfired Méndez-Aponte because he no longer trusted him due to the\nallegations that he may have been involved in the sale of Iraqi\ndinars.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           On June 27, 2006, Méndez-Aponte, his wife, and their\n\nconjugal partnership filed a complaint against, inter alios,2 the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, Fernando Bonilla, in his official and\n\npersonal   capacities,     Bonilla's     wife,   and    their   conjugal\n\npartnership, in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico.    The plaintiffs filed their complaint pursuant to\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986,\n\nand 1988, alleging violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the United States Constitution. They asked the court\n\nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their Puerto Rico law\n\nclaims.\n\n           On April 27, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their amended\n\ncomplaint including Bonilla, in his personal and official capacity\n\nas Secretary of State of the Puerto Rico State Department, as the\n\nonly defendant.    Bonilla filed an answer to the amended complaint\n\non October 15, 2007.     On August 12, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a\n\nnotice of partial voluntary dismissal of their claims alleging\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process violations.       On August 26, 2008,\n\nthe   district   court   entered   partial   judgment   dismissing   with\n\n\n2\n   The original complaint also included the following defendants:\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the Puerto Rico State Department;\nWinda Torres, Lilly Castro, Sara González-Surí, Yanis Blanco,\nOrlando Rodríguez, José Negrón, José C. Díaz-Ortiz, Rafael Subero,\nZaira Caraballo, and Isabel Colberg, each in her or his official\nand personal capacities, together with each of his or her spouses\nand their conjugal partnerships; John Doe, Jane Roe, Corporation X,\nY, Z; and Insurance Company S, T, V. These defendants were not\nincluded in the plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fprejudice plaintiffs' claims alleging violations of Méndez-Aponte's\n\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n           On April 4, 2009, the defendant filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment requesting that the district court dismiss the\n\nplaintiffs' section 1983 political discrimination claim because\n\nplaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case of political\n\ndiscrimination or, in the alternative, because Bonilla was entitled\n\nto qualified immunity. The plaintiffs filed a timely opposition to\n\nthe motion for summary judgment and a statement of contested\n\nmaterial facts on April 23, 2009.         On September 16, 2009, the\n\ndistrict court entered an order granting Bonilla's motion for\n\nsummary   judgment   and   dismissing   Méndez-Aponte's   section   1983\n\npolitical discrimination claims with prejudice and dismissing the\n\nsupplemental state law claims without prejudice.            See Méndez-\n\nAponte v. Puerto Rico, 656 F. Supp. 2d 277 (D.P.R. 2009).            The\n\ndistrict court found that the plaintiffs failed to properly dispute\n\nthe defendant's statement of uncontested material facts because\n\ntheir denials and qualifications of the defendant's fact statements\n\nwere \"mostly irrelevant to the matter at hand and consist of mere\n\n'speculation,   generalities,    conclusory   assertions,    improbable\n\ninferences and, for lack of a better phrase, a lot of \"hot air.\"'\"\n\nId. at 281 (quoting Domínguez v. Eli Lilly and Co., 958 F. Supp.\n\n721, 728 (D.P.R. 1997)).       The court therefore took its factual\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffindings mainly from Bonilla's statement of uncontested material\n\nfacts.3   Id.\n\n            The district court concluded that Méndez-Aponte could be\n\nterminated without cause because he held a trust position for which\n\nparty affiliation was an appropriate qualification for continued\n\nemployment.       Id. at 288-89.    The court therefore dismissed Méndez-\n\nAponte's political discrimination claim.               Id. at 289.   Pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), the court also imposed a\n\nsanction of $1,000 each on attorneys Nicolás Nogueras-Cartagena and\n\nPatricia Ramírez Gelpí.         Id. at 291.        The court found that the\n\nattorneys    failed     to   properly    dispute       Bonilla's   statement   of\n\nuncontroverted facts, that their memorandum of law failed to\n\nspecify     the    documents   in    the      record    that   supported   their\n\ncontentions and left blank the number of the exhibit to which they\n\nwere referring the court, and that their \"long and generally\n\nincomprehensible opposition [was] frivolous and totally devoid of\n\nany semblance of colorable merit.\"             Id. at 290-91.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    On appeal, Méndez-Aponte challenges the district court's\ndecision to glean the facts from Bonilla's statement of uncontested\nmaterial facts.    As discussed infra at 18, we agree with the\ndistrict court that Méndez-Aponte's allegations lacked proper\nevidentiary support. We conclude that, pursuant to the District of\nPuerto Rico's Local Rule 56(e), the district court properly deemed\nBonilla's facts admitted.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f                            II.   Discussion\n\n           A.    Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n           Our review of the district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment is de novo.     Del Toro Pacheco v. Pereira, 633 F.3d 57, 62\n\n(1st Cir. 2011).    We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nnon-moving party.     Lopera v. Town of Coventry, 640 F.3d 388, 395\n\n(1st Cir. 2011); Del Toro Pacheco, 633 F.3d at 62.         \"We ignore any\n\n'conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported\n\nspeculation.'\"     Del Toro Pacheco, 633 F.3d at 62 (quoting Sutliffe\n\nv. Epping Sch. Dist., 584 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir. 2009)).             \"The\n\ncourt shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there\n\nis no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).4\n\n\"We may affirm summary judgment on any ground manifest in the\n\nrecord.\"    Klaucke v. Daly, 595 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           The   First   Amendment    protects   public   employees   from\n\nadverse action due to their political affiliation, unless political\n\naffiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position.            See\n\nBranti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 518 (1980); Ocasio-Hernández v.\n\nFortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2011).              A plaintiff\n\n\n4\n   We cite the amended version of Rule 56, effective December 1,\n2010, because doing so is just and practicable where the standard\nfor granting summary judgment remains unchanged. See Ophthalmic\nSurgeons, Ltd. v. Paychex, Inc., 632 F.3d 31, 35 n.4 (1st Cir.\n2011).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fseeking to establish a political discrimination claim under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 must establish four elements: \"(1) that the plaintiff\n\nand defendant have opposing political affiliations, (2) that the\n\ndefendant is aware of the plaintiff's affiliation, (3) that an\n\nadverse   employment     action   occurred,     and   (4)     that    political\n\naffiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse\n\nemployment action.\" Ocasio-Hernández, 640 F.3d at 13 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).         Here, Bonilla argues that political\n\naffiliation is a proper requirement for Méndez-Aponte's position\n\nand that, therefore, Bonilla could properly fire Méndez-Aponte for\n\nhis political affiliation.\n\n              The question of whether political affiliation is an\n\nappropriate basis for dismissal is a legal one for the court.\n\nUphoff Figueroa v. Alejandro, 597 F.3d 423, 429 (1st Cir. 2010);\n\nHadfield v. McDonough, 407 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2005).                    This\n\ncircuit has typically conducted a two-part analysis to make this\n\ndetermination.     See Hadfield, 407 F.3d at 16; Duriex-Gauthier v.\n\nLópez-Nieves, 274 F.3d 4, 9 (1st Cir. 2001).           We ask (1) \"whether\n\nthe governmental unit decides 'issues where there is room for\n\npolitical disagreement on goals or their implementation,'\" Ruiz-\n\nCasillas v. Camacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127, 132 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting Jiménez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 241-42\n\n(1st   Cir.    1986)   (en   banc)),    and   (2)   whether    \"the    specific\n\nresponsibilities of the position resemble those of a policymaker or\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fother officeholder whose functions are such that party affiliation\n\nis an appropriate criterion for holding the post,\" Hadfield, 407\n\nF.3d at 16.      We have upheld political dismissals of mid- or upper-\n\nlevel employees where the employee \"merely represented the agency's\n\npolicy positions to other entities or to the public or where\n\nimportant personnel functions were part of the portfolio.\"                   Flynn\n\nv. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              Turning to the first inquiry, we agree with the district\n\ncourt that the Puerto Rico State Department handles matters where\n\nthere    is    room   for    political    disagreement   on    goals   or    their\n\nimplementation. See Méndez-Aponte, 656 F. Supp. 2d at 286 (holding\n\nthat the first prong of the inquiry was satisfied).                The Governor\n\nof Puerto Rico, who is \"elected by direct vote in each general\n\nelection,\" P.R. Const. art. IV, § 1, appoints the Secretary of\n\nState,     id.   §    5.     The   Secretary    of   State    is   charged    with\n\n\"promulgat[ing] all proclamations and orders of the Governor and\n\nall laws enacted by the Legislative Assembly.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n3, § 51.      Further, the Puerto Rico State Department is in charge of\n\narranging the visits of \"personages from foreign countries who can\n\ncome and observe Puerto Rican life and who . . . can in some way\n\nmake known outside of Puerto Rico the facts concerning [Puerto\n\nRico].\" Id. § 62.          This is certainly a politically sensitive task.\n\nGiven that the Puerto Rico State Department and the Governor of\n\nPuerto Rico have a close working relationship, the State Department\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\frepresents Puerto Rico to governments of other countries, and the\n\npolicy goals of the State Department may change with different\n\nadministrations, we hold that the State Department is an agency\n\nthat \"involve[s] decision making on issues where there is room for\n\npolitical disagreement on goals or their implementation.\"     Olmeda\n\nv. Ortiz-Quiñonez, 434 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n          We now look to the specific responsibilities of the\n\nposition to determine whether party affiliation is an appropriate\n\nrequirement.    Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127, 132\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).     In applying the second prong of the analysis,\n\nthis court has looked at a variety of factors which include\n\n          the relative compensation level for the\n          position, the technical expertise (if any)\n          required to do the job, the extent to which\n          the position involves supervision and control\n          over others, the degree to which the position\n          confers authority to speak in the name of\n          higher-ups who themselves are policymakers,\n          the influence of the position over programs\n          and policy initiatives, and the public\n          perception of what the position entails.\n\nGalloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Jiménez-\n\nFuentes, 807 F.2d at 242).     We also consider \"the relationship of\n\nthe position to elected officials, party leaders, and partisan\n\npolitics.\"     Id. at 30.   We focus only on \"the inherent duties of\n\nthe position under review and do not consider the actual tasks\n\nperformed by a present or past officeholder.\"      Roldán-Plumey v.\n\nCerezo-Suárez, 115 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 1997); accord Jiménez-\n\n                                  -11-\n\fFuentes, 807 F.2d at 242.      The official job description is a\n\npresumptively reliable basis for determining the actual functions\n\nof the position.   Uphoff-Figueroa, 597 F.3d at 430; Roldán-Plumey,\n\n115 F.3d at 62.\n\n          Because we have an official job description available, we\n\nbegin with this document.5   See Galloza, 389 F.3d at 30 (\"[I]f a\n\nformal job description exists, it is important for an inquiring\n\ncourt to look to the specifics of that document.\").         The job\n\ndescription for the position of Assistant Secretary of State for\n\nProtocol Affairs lists the following relevant duties:\n\n          2. [Advise]6 the Secretary of State on the\n          formulation of public policy that will rule\n          his work area, or to [sic] the management of\n          staff    of    the    Department     and    the\n          representatives    of   public   and    private\n          organizations as to the mission and goals of\n          the   different    activities   and    services\n          provided.\n          . . . .\n          4. Prepare rules and analyze administrative\n          and    fiscal    procedures    to     formulate\n\n\n5\n    According to the human resources records, Méndez-Aponte's\nemployee status is listed as one of \"confidence.\" Under Puerto\nRico law, government positions are classified as career or\ntrust/confidence. Uphoff-Figueroa, 597 F.3d at 430 n.7; Morales-\nSantiago v. Hernández-Pérez, 488 F.3d 465, 469 (1st Cir. 2007).\nAlthough we have previously found such classifications relevant,\nthey are not dispositive of whether political affiliation is an\nappropriate requirement for a position.    López-Quiñones v. P.R.\nNat'l Guard, 526 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 2008).\n6\n  The certified translation of the job description translates the\nSpanish word \"asesorar\" as \"assess.\" According to many Spanish-\nEnglish dictionaries, however, \"asesorar\" means \"to advise,\ncounsel.\" See, e.g., Cassell's Spanish Dictionary 94 (1968). We\nhave modified the translation accordingly.\n\n                                -12-\n\f          recommendations   about   [matters]7   under   his\n          jurisdiction.\n\n          5.

Many of these\n\nduties are not purely ministerial and are open-ended. See Galloza,\n\n389 F.3d at 31 (noting that open-ended job description duties\n\ngenerally allow the employee to exercise discretion \"and, thus,\n\ntend to indicate that a position is policymaking in nature\").          For\n\nexample,   the   position    can   involve   formulating   recommendations\n\nregarding matters under the jurisdiction of the Secretary for\n\nProtocol Affairs, and counseling the Secretary of State and the\n\nGovernor of Puerto Rico regarding \"international, local, military\n\nand civil protocol affairs.\"         These duties indicate a level of\n\ndiscretion that indicates that the position involves policymaking.\n\n           Méndez-Aponte's position also involves \"supervision and\n\ncontrol over others.\"       Galloza, 389 F.3d at 29.   It is uncontested\n\nthat the position of Secretary for Protocol Affairs involves\n\nsupervising employees; four employees report directly to the person\n\nin this position. López-Quiñones v. P.R.

In addition,\n\nthe   Secretary    for   Protocol   Affairs   reports   directly   to   the\n\nSecretary of State and the Sub-Secretary of State and we have\n\npreviously considered that \"report[ing] to those in the upper\n\nechelons of [an] agency\" is indicative of a policymaking position.\n\nSee Hadfield, 407 F.3d at 17.\n\n            The position may also involve acting as a liaison to\n\nother government agencies, \"represent[ing]. . . the Secretary of\n\nState or the Governor and the Under-Secretary\" in official acts,\n\nrepresenting the Secretary of State \"in [meetings], public hearings\n\nand conferences, among other activities,\" and supervising and\n\nexecuting    the   visits   of   important    dignitaries   from   foreign\n\ngovernments.   These functions involve representing the Puerto Rico\n\nGovernor's or the Secretary of State's views to other agencies, the\n\npublic, and other governments.       We consider these functions to be\n\nexemplary of the position's spokesperson-like capacities, which we\n\nhave previously considered to be indicative of a policymaking\n\nposition.    Uphoff Figueroa, 597 F.3d at 429 (\"[I]t is enough that\n\nthe official [is] involved in policy, even if only as an adviser,\n\nimplementer, or spokesperson.\"      (emphasis and second alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Flynn, 140 F.3d at 46) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f           Looking   at     the   inherent   duties    of   the   position   of\n\nAssistant Secretary of State for Protocol Affairs, we hold that\n\npolitical affiliation is an appropriate qualification for the\n\nposition and that, therefore, it is one that is not federally\n\nprotected against political discrimination.             The district court\n\nproperly granted Bonilla's motion for summary judgment on the\n\nground that Méndez-Aponte held a trust position that was not\n\nprotected under the First Amendment.\n\n           B.   Sanctions\n\n           We   review    the     district   court's   decision    to   impose\n\nsanctions for abuse of discretion.            Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx\n\nCorp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990) (\"[A]n appellate court should apply\n\nan abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a\n\ndistrict   court's   Rule    11    determination.\");    Meléndez-García      v.\n\nSánchez, 629 F.3d 25, 33 (1st Cir. 2010); Young v. City of\n\nProvidence ex rel. Napolitano, 404 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2005).               A\n\ndistrict court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an\n\nerroneous view of the law or on clearly erroneous factual findings.\n\nSee F.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de P.R., 563\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           We give deference to a district court's decision to\n\nimpose sanctions because it is in the best position to \"evaluate\n\nthe circumstances surrounding an alleged violation and render an\n\ninformed judgment.\"       McLane, Graf, Raulerson & Middleton, P.A. v.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fRechberger, 280 F.3d 26, 44 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Cruz v.\n\nSavage, 896 F.2d 626, 632 (1st Cir. 1990)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).      \"Rule 11(b) is not a strict liability provision\n\nand a showing of at least 'culpable careless[ness]' is required\n\nbefore a violation of the Rule can be found.\" Citibank Global\n\nMarkets, Inc. v.

R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3)-(4).\n\n           The district court listed the following as its reasons\n\nfor imposing sanctions on the two attorneys: (i) the document was\n\n\"incomprehensible\";     (ii)    the   document   included   an    irrelevant\n\nhistory   of   the   Puerto    Rico   State   Department;   and   (iii)   the\n\nopposition was sloppy and careless as evidenced by, for example,\n\nomissions in the citations to the record.           Méndez-Aponte, 656 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 290-91.    After reviewing the filings and the record, we\n\nconclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in imposing\n\n                                      -17-\n\fsanctions.    We agree with the district court that the plaintiffs'\n\nopposition to summary judgment and the statement of contested\n\nmaterial     facts   consist,   in   large       part,   of    speculation    and\n\nconclusory allegations for which the only evidentiary support is\n\nMéndez-Aponte's sworn affidavit, which itself contains conclusory\n\nallegations.     See id. at 281.       Neither filing has any promise of\n\nlikely   evidentiary      support.     We    provide     one   example   of   the\n\nconclusory    allegations    included       in   the   opposition   to   summary\n\njudgment:\n\n            Plaintiff's conduct [-- speaking in favor of\n            the   purchase    of   Iraqi   dinars   --]   was\n            constitutionally protected. And it was under\n            the pretext of this conduct that he was\n            condemned     and      discriminated     against.\n            Plaintiff did not hold a policy making\n            position, and his political affiliation was\n            not a requirement for the office held. . . .\n            [P]ursuant to the difference in political\n            affiliation     [between     Méndez-Aponte    and\n            Bonilla,]    he    was    suspended   from    his\n            employment.\n\nAfter engaging in the same wild-goose chase that the district court\n\nhad to endure to find evidentiary support for Méndez-Aponte's\n\nfactual allegations, we hold that the district court did not abuse\n\nits   discretion     in   concluding    that      Méndez-Aponte's     attorneys\n\nviolated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).                   We therefore\n\naffirm its imposition of sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f                           III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the aforementioned reasons we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in appellee's favor and its\n\nimposition of sanctions.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

Méndez-Aponte's claim did not\n\nsurvive Bonilla's motion for summary judgment.             The district court\n\nsanctioned      Méndez-Aponte's     attorneys     $1000    each   because    it\n\nconcluded that the pleadings and responses that they submitted\n\nviolated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).            Méndez-Aponte and\n\nhis attorneys now appeal alleging that the district court erred in\n\ngranting Bonilla's summary judgment motion and imposing sanctions.\n\nWe affirm the district court's decision.\n\n                               I.   Background\n\n            Méndez-Aponte was the Assistant Secretary of State for\n\nProtocol Affairs at the Puerto Rico State Department from June 1,\n\n2001 until March 3, 2006.       Méndez-Aponte alleges that, in 2005, in\n\nthe course of his official duties and during \"official meetings\n\nwhere the economic situation of the government of Puerto Rico and\n\nof the [Puerto Rico] State Department . . . were discussed,\" he\n\nsuggested    to   Marisara   Pont-Marchese,      the   interim    Puerto    Rico\n\nSecretary of State, that investing in Iraqi dinars would be a good\n\nlong-term investment for Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          Méndez-Aponte      alleges    that     on   August    21,   2005,    a\n\njournalist from El Nuevo Día, a Puerto Rican newspaper, called him\n\nto inquire about rumors that employees at the Puerto Rico State\n\nDepartment were selling Iraqi dinars during office hours.              Méndez-\n\nAponte contacted Bonilla to inform him about the journalist's\n\ninquiry and they set up a meeting to discuss the matter the next\n\nday.   The next day, before this discussion could take place,\n\nMéndez-Aponte found out from the press that Bonilla had fired him\n\nand had also asked the Director of the Government Ethics Office to\n\ninvestigate the rumors that dinars were sold at the Puerto Rico\n\nState Department.    According to Méndez-Aponte, that same day, the\n\nSubsecretary   of    State   asked     Méndez-Aponte     to    meet   with    an\n\ninvestigator   who    was    conducting     an    inquiry      regarding      the\n\nallegations.   On August 24, 2005, Méndez-Aponte received a written\n\nnotification, dated August 22, 2005, informing him that he had been\n\nremoved from his position due to illegal conduct.               Specifically,\n\nthe letter stated that Méndez-Aponte was suspended because he\n\n\"engaged in . . . conduct that is clearly detrimental to the moral\n\nand good name of the Department.\"1\n\n\n\n\n1\n   In his motion for summary judgment, Bonilla alleged that he\nfired Méndez-Aponte because he no longer trusted him due to the\nallegations that he may have been involved in the sale of Iraqi\ndinars.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           On June 27, 2006, Méndez-Aponte, his wife, and their\n\nconjugal partnership filed a complaint against, inter alios,2 the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, Fernando Bonilla, in his official and\n\npersonal   capacities,     Bonilla's     wife,   and    their   conjugal\n\npartnership, in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico.    The plaintiffs filed their complaint pursuant to\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986,\n\nand 1988, alleging violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the United States Constitution. They asked the court\n\nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their Puerto Rico law\n\nclaims.\n\n           On April 27, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their amended\n\ncomplaint including Bonilla, in his personal and official capacity\n\nas Secretary of State of the Puerto Rico State Department, as the\n\nonly defendant.    Bonilla filed an answer to the amended complaint\n\non October 15, 2007.     On August 12, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a\n\nnotice of partial voluntary dismissal of their claims alleging\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process violations.       On August 26, 2008,\n\nthe   district   court   entered   partial   judgment   dismissing   with\n\n\n2\n   The original complaint also included the following defendants:\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the Puerto Rico State Department;\nWinda Torres, Lilly Castro, Sara González-Surí, Yanis Blanco,\nOrlando Rodríguez, José Negrón, José C. Díaz-Ortiz, Rafael Subero,\nZaira Caraballo, and Isabel Colberg, each in her or his official\nand personal capacities, together with each of his or her spouses\nand their conjugal partnerships; John Doe, Jane Roe, Corporation X,\nY, Z; and Insurance Company S, T, V. These defendants were not\nincluded in the plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fprejudice plaintiffs' claims alleging violations of Méndez-Aponte's\n\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n           On April 4, 2009, the defendant filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment requesting that the district court dismiss the\n\nplaintiffs' section 1983 political discrimination claim because\n\nplaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case of political\n\ndiscrimination or, in the alternative, because Bonilla was entitled\n\nto qualified immunity. The plaintiffs filed a timely opposition to\n\nthe motion for summary judgment and a statement of contested\n\nmaterial facts on April 23, 2009.         On September 16, 2009, the\n\ndistrict court entered an order granting Bonilla's motion for\n\nsummary   judgment   and   dismissing   Méndez-Aponte's   section   1983\n\npolitical discrimination claims with prejudice and dismissing the\n\nsupplemental state law claims without prejudice.

The\n\ndistrict court found that the plaintiffs failed to properly dispute\n\nthe defendant's statement of uncontested material facts because\n\ntheir denials and qualifications of the defendant's fact statements\n\nwere \"mostly irrelevant to the matter at hand and consist of mere\n\n'speculation,   generalities,    conclusory   assertions,    improbable\n\ninferences and, for lack of a better phrase, a lot of \"hot air.\"'\"\n\nId. at 281 (quoting Domínguez v.

Id. at 288-89.    The court therefore dismissed Méndez-\n\nAponte's political discrimination claim.               Id. at 289.   Pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), the court also imposed a\n\nsanction of $1,000 each on attorneys Nicolás Nogueras-Cartagena and\n\nPatricia Ramírez Gelpí.         Id. at 291.        The court found that the\n\nattorneys    failed     to   properly    dispute       Bonilla's   statement   of\n\nuncontroverted facts, that their memorandum of law failed to\n\nspecify     the    documents   in    the      record    that   supported   their\n\ncontentions and left blank the number of the exhibit to which they\n\nwere referring the court, and that their \"long and generally\n\nincomprehensible opposition [was] frivolous and totally devoid of\n\nany semblance of colorable merit.\"             Id. at 290-91.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    On appeal, Méndez-Aponte challenges the district court's\ndecision to glean the facts from Bonilla's statement of uncontested\nmaterial facts.    As discussed infra at 18, we agree with the\ndistrict court that Méndez-Aponte's allegations lacked proper\nevidentiary support. We conclude that, pursuant to the District of\nPuerto Rico's Local Rule 56(e), the district court properly deemed\nBonilla's facts admitted.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f                            II.

R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3)-(4).\n\n           The district court listed the following as its reasons\n\nfor imposing sanctions on the two attorneys: (i) the document was\n\n\"incomprehensible\";     (ii)    the   document   included   an    irrelevant\n\nhistory   of   the   Puerto    Rico   State   Department;   and   (iii)   the\n\nopposition was sloppy and careless as evidenced by, for example,\n\nomissions in the citations to the record.           Méndez-Aponte, 656 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 290-91.    After reviewing the filings and the record, we\n\nconclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in imposing\n\n                                      -17-\n\fsanctions.    We agree with the district court that the plaintiffs'\n\nopposition to summary judgment and the statement of contested\n\nmaterial     facts   consist,   in   large       part,   of    speculation    and\n\nconclusory allegations for which the only evidentiary support is\n\nMéndez-Aponte's sworn affidavit, which itself contains conclusory\n\nallegations.     See id. at 281.       Neither filing has any promise of\n\nlikely   evidentiary      support.     We    provide     one   example   of   the\n\nconclusory    allegations    included       in   the   opposition   to   summary\n\njudgment:\n\n            Plaintiff's conduct [-- speaking in favor of\n            the   purchase    of   Iraqi   dinars   --]   was\n            constitutionally protected. And it was under\n            the pretext of this conduct that he was\n            condemned     and      discriminated     against.\n            Plaintiff did not hold a policy making\n            position, and his political affiliation was\n            not a requirement for the office held. . . .\n            [P]ursuant to the difference in political\n            affiliation     [between     Méndez-Aponte    and\n            Bonilla,]    he    was    suspended   from    his\n            employment.\n\nAfter engaging in the same wild-goose chase that the district court\n\nhad to endure to find evidentiary support for Méndez-Aponte's\n\nfactual allegations, we hold that the district court did not abuse\n\nits   discretion     in   concluding    that      Méndez-Aponte's     attorneys\n\nviolated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).                   We therefore\n\naffirm its imposition of sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f                           III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the aforementioned reasons we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in appellee's favor and its\n\nimposition of sanctions.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f</pre>",
