Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney,\nRosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                          April 17, 2008\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge.      Appellant Cardona-Díaz\n\n(Cardona)    challenges   the   87-month   sentence   he   received   after\n\npleading guilty to conspiring to distribute a controlled substance.\n\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a).          We dismiss\n\nCardona’s appeal, because it is barred as a result of the waiver of\n\nappeal to which he consented in his plea agreement.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            From approximately the year 2000 until he was indicted in\n\nMay of 2005, Cardona was part of a group that sold cocaine, cocaine\n\nbase (crack), and marijuana around Barrio Corazón in Guayama,\n\nPuerto Rico.    Cardona was a seller for one of the ringleaders.         In\n\nOctober 2003, Cardona and other co-conspirators sold 36 grams of\n\ncrack to a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) confidential\n\ninformant.\n\n            Cardona subsequently was indicted by a District of Puerto\n\nRico Grand Jury and charged with violating 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1)\n\nand 846, and 18 U.S.C. § 2.      Count One alleged that from about 2000\n\nto the date of the indictment, Cardona conspired to possess with\n\nintent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and fifty\n\ngrams or more of crack.         Count Three charged that, on or about\n\nOctober 16, 2003, Cardona and a co-defendant intentionally and\n\nunlawfully distributed five grams or more of crack.\n\n            On March 7, 2006, Cardona pled guilty to both of those\n\ncounts.   The terms of Cardona’s plea agreement provided for a base\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\foffense level of thirty, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guideline §\n\n2D1.1(5), “for possession and conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute between three point five (3.5) and five (5) kilograms of\n\ncocaine and between thirty-five (35) and fifty (50) grams of\n\ncocaine base.” [Plea Agreement, DE 147, p. 5] Cardona agreed to\n\nboth of these drug amounts in the plea agreement and at his change-\n\nof-plea hearing.       The agreement also stipulated a three-level\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility, establishing a total\n\noffense   level   of   27    and    a    sentencing    range    of   70-87   months\n\nimprisonment.     The parties did not stipulate to Cardona’s criminal\n\nhistory   category,    but    the       Presentence    Report   assigned     him   a\n\ncriminal history category of I.             The parties also agreed that no\n\nfurther adjustments or departures were applicable, and that the\n\ngovernment would recommend that the court sentence Cardona to 87\n\nmonths imprisonment.\n\n           Though the plea agreement stated only that the government\n\nwould recommend a sentence of 87 months imprisonment, during the\n\nsentencing hearing, the district court was under the mistaken\n\nimpression that Cardona and the government had negotiated for and\n\nagreed to a sentence of 87 months. However, neither party objected\n\nto the district court’s characterization of the 87-month sentence\n\nas that “agreed upon” by the parties.                 Ultimately, the district\n\ncourt adopted the parties’ stipulations and sentenced Cardona to 87\n\nmonths imprisonment.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f                                   II.\n\n            The issue before us is whether Cardona’s appeal is barred\n\nby the waiver contained in his plea agreement.           The government\n\nurges us to enforce that waiver, as, “under ordinary circumstances,\n\na knowing, voluntary waiver of the right to appeal from a sentence,\n\ncontained in a plea agreement, ought to be enforced.”               United\n\nStates v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir. 2001) (footnote\n\nomitted).    In determining whether to enforce the waiver, we make\n\nthree inquiries.     First, we confirm whether “the written plea\n\nagreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement\n\nelucidating the waiver and delineating its scope.”            Id. at 24.\n\nSecond, we determine whether the district court questioned the\n\ndefendant   specifically   about   his   understanding   of   the   waiver\n\nprovision and its ramifications.     Id.    Third, we consider whether\n\nenforcing the waiver would work a miscarriage of justice.              Id.\n\nat 25-26.\n\n            Cardona concedes that the first two parts of the Teeter\n\ntest are met.    The plea agreement clearly states that, as long as\n\nthe court sentenced Cardona according to the terms and conditions\n\nof the plea agreement, Cardona would “waive[] and surrender[] his\n\nright to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.” [Plea\n\nAgreement at 8] Moreover, at Cardona’s change-of-plea hearing, the\n\ncourt directed Cardona to the language of the waiver in the plea\n\nagreement and asked him if he understood the waiver, to which he\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fresponded “yes.” [Change of Plea transcript at 9]             The court also\n\nreminded Cardona of the waiver of appeal at sentencing.            Cardona’s\n\nwaiver of his right to appeal was therefore both knowing and\n\nvoluntary, and will only be set aside if enforcing the waiver would\n\nwork a miscarriage of justice.       See id.\n\n           We have consistently warned that “the miscarriage of\n\njustice reservation ‘will be applied sparingly and without undue\n\ngenerosity.’”     United States v. De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d 5, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26).                  Among the\n\nfactors we consider in determining whether enforcement would lead\n\nto a miscarriage of justice are “the clarity of the alleged error,\n\nits   character   and   gravity,   its    impact   on   the   defendant,   any\n\npossible prejudice to the government, and the extent to which the\n\ndefendant acquiesced in the result.” United States v. Gil-Quezada,\n\n445 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26).\n\nWe now consider whether honoring the waiver to deny his appeal\n\nwould work a miscarriage of justice.\n\n           Cardona’s only colorable claim is that the sentencing\n\ncourt’s erroneous belief that Cardona had agreed to a sentence of\n\n87 months requires that we remand for resentencing.1                  At the\n\n\n1\n       In his brief, Cardona argues that the district court\nimproperly applied the Sentencing Guidelines in a mandatory\nfashion, failed to consider adequately the sentencing factors\ncontained in 18 U.S.C. § 3553, created unwarranted sentencing\ndisparities in relying on the crack-cocaine guideline range, and\nviolated the parsimony principle by imposing a sentence greater\nthan necessary to satisfy section 3553 goals.     However, these\n\n                                    -5-\n\foutset, we emphasize that neither Cardona nor the government raised\n\nthis issue in the initial briefing, and did so only after a\n\nsupplemental briefing order was issued. Nor did the parties object\n\nat the sentencing hearing; in fact, both the government and Cardona\n\napparently went along with the district court’s assertion that\n\nCardona had agreed to an 87-month sentence, despite the fact that\n\nCardona’s plea agreement stated only that the government would\n\nrecommend an 87-month sentence.\n\n            The court’s misunderstanding of the agreement reached\n\nbetween   Cardona   and    the   government   is   troubling.    The   court\n\nemphasized that a major factor in its decision to impose an 87-\n\nmonth sentence was “that the parties bargained for 87 months,” and\n\nstated that “the court see[s] no reason why the court should at\n\nthis time    depart from what the parties agreed.               This was a\n\nnegotiation. . . .        So, therefore, I am going to follow what the\n\nparties originally bargained.” [Sent. Tr. 27-29]\n\n            The government made no effort to correct the district\n\ncourt's misunderstanding.        In fact, the government arguably misled\n\nthe court when it stated that the 87-month sentence was \"what was\n\nbargained for and agreed to by the parties.\" [Sent. Tr. 24] We are\n\n\n\ngarden-variety challenges to Cardona’s sentence are too trivial to\nwarrant discussion in light of Cardona’s waiver of appeal.\nAlthough we do not foreclose the possibility that the errors\nCardona alleges could in other circumstances rise to the level of\na miscarriage of justice, our review of the record in this case\nsatisfies us that there was no such miscarriage here.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fequally dismayed that Cardona's own counsel was silent in the face\n\nof the misunderstanding.\n\n          However, it has not been demonstrated to our satisfaction\n\nthat this error would work a miscarriage of justice if we were not\n\nto remand.     Cardona’s waiver of his right to appeal in his plea\n\nagreement,     his   failure    to   object    to   the   district    court’s\n\nmisunderstanding of the plea agreement at the hearing (and apparent\n\nacquiescence in that misunderstanding), and his failure to raise\n\nthe issue on appeal until directed by us, establish a very high\n\nhurdle for him to show the kind of error that would permit us to\n\nentertain his argument and consider reversal.             He cannot overcome\n\nthat hurdle in this appeal.\n\n          As    indicated      earlier,    Teeter   outlined    the   various\n\ninquiries that we consider in determining whether enforcement of a\n\nplea agreement would lead to a miscarriage of justice. Though some\n\nof the Teeter factors weigh in Cardona’s favor, others suggest that\n\nwe should enforce the waiver and dismiss his appeal.            First, that\n\nCardona “acquiesced in the result” suggests that we should enforce\n\nthe waiver.     See Gil-Quezada, 445 F.3d at 37.          Additionally, the\n\nerror may have influenced the high-end guidelines sentence Cardona\n\nreceived, but we cannot be certain that the court would not have\n\nimposed a similar sentence anyway.            Although the district court\n\nrelied in part on its mistaken understanding that both sides agreed\n\nto an 87-month sentence, it appears to have imposed the high\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fsentence based on the drug quantities of both crack and cocaine to\n\nwhich Cardona stipulated, and based on uncharged conduct including\n\npossession    of   marijuana     and   possession   of   a   large   amount   of\n\nammunition.    Finally, although the district court would have been\n\nfree to reject the government’s recommendation (just as it was free\n\nto reject an “agreed upon” sentence), we have recognized that when\n\nparties   agree    that    the   government   will   recommend       a   certain\n\nsentence, they do so with the understanding that it is likely the\n\ndistrict court will accept the recommendation.               See United States\n\nv. Velez Carrero, 77 F.3d 11, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1996).                 Thus, the\n\nlimited “character and gravity” of the alleged error, as well as\n\nits questionable “impact on the defendant,” suggest that we should\n\nenforce the waiver.       See Gil-Quezada, 445 F.3d at 37.        We therefore\n\nconclude there is no miscarriage of justice; we enforce the appeal\n\nwaiver agreed to by the parties.\n\n                                       III.\n\n           Because Cardona agreed to a valid waiver of his right to\n\nappeal his sentence, and because none of the errors he alleged\n\nworked a miscarriage of justice, we will enforce the waiver and\n\ndismiss his appeal.\n\nDISMISSED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f",

Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, WALLACE,<sup>[*]</sup> Senior Circuit Judge, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Appellant Cardona-Díaz (Cardona) challenges the 87-month sentence he received after pleading guilty to conspiring to distribute a controlled substance. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a). We dismiss Cardona's appeal, because it is barred as a result of the waiver of appeal to which he consented in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>From approximately the year 2000 until he was indicted in May of 2005, Cardona was part of a group that sold cocaine, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> cocaine base (crack), and marijuana around Barrio Corazón in Guayama, Puerto Rico. Cardona was a seller for one of the ringleaders. In October 2003, Cardona and other co-conspirators sold 36 grams of crack to a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) confidential informant.</p>\n<p>Cardona subsequently was indicted by a District of Puerto Rico Grand Jury and charged with violating 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846, and 18 U.S.C. § 2. Count One alleged that from about 2000 to the date of the indictment, Cardona conspired to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and fifty grams or more of crack. Count Three charged that, on or about October 16, 2003, Cardona and a co-defendant intentionally and unlawfully distributed five grams or more of crack.</p>\n<p>On March 7, 2006, Cardona pled guilty to both of those counts. The terms of Cardona's plea agreement provided for a base offense level of thirty, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guideline § 2D1.1(5), \"for possession and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute between three point five (3.5) and five (5) kilograms of cocaine and between thirty-five (35) and fifty (50) grams of cocaine base.\" [Plea Agreement, DE 147, p. 5] Cardona agreed to both of these drug amounts in the plea agreement and at his change-of-plea hearing. The agreement also stipulated a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, establishing a total offense level of 27 and a sentencing range of 70-87 months imprisonment. The parties did not stipulate to Cardona's criminal history category, but the Presentence Report assigned him a criminal history category of I. The parties also agreed that no further adjustments or departures were applicable, and that the government would recommend that the court sentence Cardona to 87 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Though the plea agreement stated only that the government would <i>recommend</i> a sentence of 87 months imprisonment, during the sentencing hearing, the district court was under the mistaken impression that Cardona and the government had <i>negotiated for and agreed to</i> a sentence of 87 months. However, neither party objected to the district court's characterization of the 87-month sentence as that \"agreed upon\" by the parties. Ultimately, the district court adopted the parties' stipulations and sentenced Cardona to 87 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The issue before us is whether Cardona's appeal is barred by the waiver contained in his plea agreement. The government urges us to enforce that waiver, as, \"under ordinary circumstances, a knowing, voluntary waiver of the right to appeal from a sentence, contained in a plea agreement, ought to be enforced.\" <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 2001) (footnote omitted). In determining whether to enforce the waiver, we make three inquiries. First, we confirm whether \"the written plea agreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24. Second, we determine whether the district court questioned the defendant specifically about his understanding of the waiver provision and its ramifications. <i>Id.</i> Third, we consider whether enforcing the waiver would work a miscarriage of justice. <i>Id.</i> at 25-26.</p>\n<p>Cardona concedes that the first two parts of the <i>Teeter</i> test are met. The plea agreement clearly states that, as long as the court sentenced Cardona according to the terms and conditions of the plea agreement, Cardona would \"waive[ ] and surrender[ ] his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\" [Plea Agreement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> at 8] Moreover, at Cardona's change-of-plea hearing, the court directed Cardona to the language of the waiver in the plea agreement and asked him if he understood the waiver, to which he responded \"yes.\" [Change of Plea transcript at 9] The court also reminded Cardona of the waiver of appeal at sentencing. Cardona's waiver of his right to appeal was therefore both knowing and voluntary, and will only be set aside if enforcing the waiver would work a miscarriage of justice. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>We have consistently warned that \"the miscarriage of justice reservation `will be applied sparingly and without undue generosity.'\" <i>United States v. De-La-Cruz Castro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200058\"><a href=\"/opinion/200058/united-states-v-de-la-cruz-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26). Among the factors we consider in determining whether enforcement would lead to a miscarriage of justice are \"the clarity of the alleged error, its character and gravity, its impact on the defendant, any possible prejudice to the government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\" <i>United States v. Gil-Quezada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794028\"><a href=\"/opinion/794028/united-states-v-francisco-antonio-gil-quezada/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26). We now consider whether honoring the waiver to deny his appeal would work a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p>Cardona's only colorable claim is that the sentencing court's erroneous belief that Cardona had agreed to a sentence of 87 months requires that we remand for resentencing.<sup>[1]</sup> At the outset, we emphasize that neither Cardona nor the government raised this issue in the initial briefing, and did so only after a supplemental briefing order was issued. Nor did the parties object at the sentencing hearing; in fact, both the government and Cardona apparently went along with the district court's assertion that Cardona had agreed to an 87-month sentence, despite the fact that Cardona's plea agreement stated only that the government would <i>recommend</i> an 87-month sentence.</p>\n<p>The court's misunderstanding of the agreement reached between Cardona and the government is troubling. The court emphasized that a major factor in its decision to impose an 87-month sentence was \"that the parties bargained for 87 months,\" and stated that \"the court see[s] no reason why the court should at this time depart from what the parties agreed. This was a negotiation.... So, therefore, I am going to follow what the parties originally bargained.\" [Sent. Tr. 27-29]</p>\n<p>The government made no effort to correct the district court's misunderstanding. In fact, the government arguably misled the court when it stated that the 87-month sentence was \"what was bargained for and agreed to by the parties.\" [Sent. Tr. 24] We are equally dismayed that Cardona's own counsel was silent in the face of the misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>However, it has not been demonstrated to our satisfaction that this error would work a miscarriage of justice if we were not to remand. Cardona's waiver of his right to appeal in his plea agreement, his failure to object to the district court's misunderstanding of the plea agreement at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> the hearing (and apparent acquiescence in that misunderstanding), and his failure to raise the issue on appeal until directed by us, establish a very high hurdle for him to show the kind of error that would permit us to entertain his argument and consider reversal. He cannot overcome that hurdle in this appeal.</p>\n<p>As indicated earlier, <i>Teeter</i> outlined the various inquiries that we consider in determining whether enforcement of a plea agreement would lead to a miscarriage of justice. Though some of the <i>Teeter</i> factors weigh in Cardona's favor, others suggest that we should enforce the waiver and dismiss his appeal. First, that Cardona \"acquiesced in the result\" suggests that we should enforce the waiver. <i>See </i><i>Gil-Quezada,</i> 445 F.3d at 37. Additionally, the error may have influenced the high-end guidelines sentence Cardona received, but we cannot be certain that the court would not have imposed a similar sentence anyway. Although the district court relied in part on its mistaken understanding that both sides agreed to an 87-month sentence, it appears to have imposed the high sentence based on the drug quantities of both crack and cocaine to which Cardona stipulated, and based on uncharged conduct including possession of marijuana and possession of a large amount of ammunition. Finally, although the district court would have been free to reject the government's recommendation (just as it was free to reject an \"agreed upon\" sentence), we have recognized that when parties agree that the government will recommend a certain sentence, they do so with the understanding that it is likely the district court will accept the recommendation. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Velez Carrero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196601\"><a href=\"/opinion/196601/united-states-v-velez-carrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 11-12 (1st Cir.1996). Thus, the limited \"character and gravity\" of the alleged error, as well as its questionable \"impact on the defendant,\" suggest that we should enforce the waiver. <i>See </i><i>Gil-Quezada,</i> 445 F.3d at 37. We therefore conclude there is no miscarriage of justice; we enforce the appeal waiver agreed to by the parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because Cardona agreed to a valid waiver of his right to appeal his sentence, and because none of the errors he alleged worked a miscarriage of justice, we will enforce the waiver and dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p>DISMISSED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  In his brief, Cardona argues that the district court improperly applied the Sentencing Guidelines in a mandatory fashion, failed to consider adequately the sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. § 3553, created unwarranted sentencing disparities in relying on the crack-cocaine guideline range, and violated the parsimony principle by imposing a sentence greater than necessary to satisfy section 3553 goals. However, these garden-variety challenges to Cardona's sentence are too trivial to warrant discussion in light of Cardona's waiver of appeal. Although we do not foreclose the possibility that the errors Cardona alleges could in other circumstances rise to the level of a miscarriage of justice, our review of the record in this case satisfies us that there was no such miscarriage here.</p>\n\n</div>",
