F. Dennis Saylor, IV, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Boudin, Chief Circuit Judge,\n           Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Michael L.

Plaintiffs-appellants\n\nBrandon S. Blair and Richard N. Tousignant (\"plaintiffs\") appeal\n\nthe district court's dismissal of two separate actions in favor of\n\ndefendants     City   of   Worcester,    Massachusetts   (\"City\"),   former\n\nWorcester Chief of Police James Gallagher, and Worcester Police\n\nOfficers Daniel Dowd, Thomas Dowd, Thomas C. Duffy, Falcone1,\n\nEdward McGinn, James Moore, Jose Ortiz, Jonathan Thomas, and Peter\n\nTowler (collectively, \"defendants\").2         The plaintiffs, in separate\n\ncomplaints that were later consolidated, alleged that they were\n\nattacked and beaten by Worcester police officers, for which they\n\nsought recovery against the defendants under myriad legal theories.\n\nIn an initial action, the district court granted the defendants'\n\nmotions to dismiss, without prejudice, for failure to perfect\n\nservice of process.        After the plaintiffs refiled their claims in\n\na second action, the district court granted the defendant officers'\n\nmotions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, holding that the\n\nmatter was time-barred.        We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\n\nremand for further proceedings.\n\n                               I.   BACKGROUND\n\n\n     1\n         The first name of Officer Falcone is unclear.\n     2\n      We note that the City of Worcester, Chief Gallagher, and\nOfficer Thomas were not named in the second action. Moreover, the\nplaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Falcone from the second action on\nAugust 29, 2006.    Finally, the plaintiffs have abandoned their\nclaims with respect to Chief Gallagher and the City. Where these\ndistinctions matter, we refer to the remaining defendants as the\n\"defendant officers.\"\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          The record facts of this case, at least those relevant to\n\nthe instant appeal, are not in material dispute.    On December 22,\n\n2001, the plaintiffs were involved in an altercation with several\n\nof the defendant officers.   As a result of this incident, criminal\n\ncharges were brought against the plaintiffs.    At the conclusion of\n\na jury trial, both plaintiffs were acquitted.   Shortly thereafter,\n\non August 16, 2002, the plaintiffs, represented by W. Theodore\n\nHarris, filed separate complaints3 in federal district court,\n\nalleging various claims based on their purported mistreatment at\n\nthe hands of the defendants.   On September 5, 2002, Donald Rider,\n\nan attorney for the City, notified Chief Gallagher and Officers\n\nDaniel Dowd, Thomas Dowd, Duffy, Patricia Falcone,4 McGinn, Moore,\n\nOrtiz, Thomas, and Towler that two civil rights lawsuits were\n\npending against them in federal district court; indicated that he\n\nwould handle the lawsuits; and requested that they inform him if\n\nserved with process.   The record does not reveal how Rider learned\n\nof the lawsuits, although the plaintiffs introduced as evidence a\n\ncopy of a newspaper article, dated August 29, 2002, describing the\n\n\n\n     3\n      Blair and Tousignant filed separate but nearly-identical\ncomplaints and amended complaints in the initial action. Although\nthe district court and the parties exclusively referred to each set\nof complaints in the singular, we use the proper forms to ensure\nclarity, as the cases were not consolidated until a later juncture.\n     4\n      Rider sent this email to a recipient identified as \"Patricia\nFalcone,\" not the \"Thomas Falcone\" named in the plaintiffs' second\naction.    It is undisputed, however, that \"Falcone,\" whether\nPatricia or Thomas, was never served.\n\n                                -3-\n\faction,   which   might   have   been   the   source   of   his   knowledge.\n\nSubsequently, on November 25, 2002, Deputy Sheriff Ronald E.\n\nRichard attempted service upon Officers Daniel Dowd, Thomas Dowd,\n\nDuffy, McGinn, Moore, Ortiz, and Towler by leaving copies of the\n\nsummonses and the original complaints with an individual named\n\nKatherine McNamara, a \"Principal Clerk\" at the police department.\n\nThese returns of service were filed with the district court on\n\nDecember 2, 2002.    No returns of service were filed for the City,\n\nChief Gallagher, Officer Thomas, or Officer Falcone.\n\n           On January 8, 2004, 402 days after the plaintiffs' last\n\naction in the case, the district court mailed to Harris a Notice\n\nindicating that because the case had been inactive more than one\n\nyear, it would be dismissed in thirty days pursuant to Local Rule\n\n41.1 unless the plaintiffs took appropriate action.               Blair and\n\nTousignant learned of the Notice, which was entered on the docket,\n\nand chose to retain different counsel.            On February 6, 2004,\n\nattorney Stephen CampoBasso filed an appearance on behalf of the\n\nplaintiffs and submitted motions requesting that the cases not be\n\ndismissed, which were granted.           Harris withdrew as counsel of\n\nrecord on March 22, 2004, and he was subsequently suspended from\n\nthe practice of law for a period of eighteen months for reasons\n\nthat are not apparent on the face of the record.\n\n           On April 30, 2004, CampoBasso filed amended complaints on\n\nthe plaintiffs' behalf.      On June 8, 2004, CampoBasso obtained a\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fsummons for Chief Gallagher, which was then served, via a purported\n\nagent       named   Jennifer   Tauper,    and     a    return     of   service   was\n\nsubsequently filed with the court on July 8, 2004.                      The record\n\ndiscloses that, on August 4, 2004, CampoBasso sent a letter to\n\nAttorney Rider, to which copies of a summons and an amended\n\ncomplaint were apparently appended, in the apparent expectation\n\nthat Rider would assist in \"service of the Summons\" and then return\n\nit to him.          No copy of the attachment is in the record.                   On\n\nNovember      16,   2004,   CampoBasso     sent       follow-up    correspondence,\n\napparently due to his concern regarding Rider's silence.                          On\n\nDecember 14, 2004, CampoBasso directed yet another letter to Rider,\n\nrequesting his \"assistance in getting the Summonses5 filed with the\n\nCourt.\"        He mentioned that his clients were growing \"uneasy\"\n\nregarding the lack of activity in the case.                  Unfortunately, the\n\nrecord does not explicate which defendant or defendants CampoBasso\n\nsought to serve in this manner.           Regardless, CampoBasso's efforts,\n\nwhich might have been an attempt to obtain waiver of personal\n\nservice under Rule 4(d), were apparently fruitless--and, in any\n\nevent, the plaintiffs do not rely on this set of correspondence in\n\nany of their claims of error.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n      CampoBasso's correspondence does not clearly indicate whether\nhis query referred to only one or multiple summonses. CampoBasso\nseems to have used the singular and plural form of \"summons\"\ninterchangeably.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f           CampoBasso took no further record action in the case and\n\ncommitted suicide in February 2005.         On April 14, 2005, Jo Ann\n\nCitron and Michael Altman appeared on behalf of the plaintiffs as\n\nthe third set of counsel of record.           Proceeding expeditiously\n\nthereafter, on April 26, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a motion for\n\ndefault   judgment   against   the    defendants.   In   response,   the\n\ndefendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims, arguing that\n\nthe plaintiffs had failed to effect personal service of process\n\nupon them.    The defendants attached an affidavit from McNamara\n\nstating that she was not authorized to accept service for the\n\ndefendant officers.     Likewise, Officer Thomas Dowd submitted an\n\naffidavit indicating that he had not appointed McNamara as his\n\nagent for receiving service of process.\n\n           In response, the plaintiffs offered evidence purporting\n\nto show that McNamara had actual and apparent authority to accept\n\nprocess on behalf of the defendant officers, requested leave to\n\nconduct additional discovery to prove this agency relationship, and\n\nargued that even if no agency relationship existed, the district\n\ncourt should extend the time to serve the defendants.      On March 13,\n\n2006, the district court issued an opinion denying the plaintiffs\n\nrelief and granting the defendants' motions to dismiss, without\n\nprejudice. The plaintiffs filed a timely Notice of Appeal on April\n\n6, 2006, but subsequently requested and received a stay during the\n\npendency of the action described below.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           On June 26, 2006, the plaintiffs initiated a new action\n\nin federal district court, based on the same underlying conduct,\n\nseeking similar relief as before, asserting that the Massachusetts\n\nrenewal statute revived their otherwise time-barred claims.                  The\n\ndistrict court, based on its construction of the renewal statute,\n\nrejected   the   plaintiffs'    contentions     and    dismissed      the   case.\n\nAgain, the plaintiffs appealed; the two appeals have since been\n\nconsolidated.\n\n                               II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Effect of the Amended Complaints\n\n           The defendants argue that the filing of the April 30,\n\n2004, amended complaints makes irrelevant any service of process,\n\nwhether effective or not, that was performed in this case in\n\nrelation to the original complaints.          On the defendants' theory,\n\nthe amended complaint--by being filed , and whether or not properly\n\nserved--superseded the original complaint, and made it no longer\n\navailable as a basis for pursuing this case.           Under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 5(a)(2), an amended complaint stating a new claim\n\nmust be served on defendants, such as those here, who have failed\n\nto   appear.     The   defendants    argue   that     because   the    original\n\ncomplaint was superseded and the amended complaint was never\n\nserved, dismissal of the suit for insufficient service of process\n\nwas proper.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            There are two flaws with the defendants' theory.         First,\n\nit   is   doubtful   that   the   unserved    amended   complaint   in   fact\n\nsuperseded the original complaint.           See Anunciation v. W. Capital\n\nFin. Servs. Corp., 97 F.3d 1458 (table), 1996 WL 534049, at *2 (9th\n\nCir. Sept. 19, 1996) (unpublished); Int'l Controls Corp. v. Vesco,\n\n556 F.2d 665, 669 (2d Cir. 1977).          Second, the amended complaint\n\ndid not in fact contain a new claim for relief, and therefore did\n\nnot require service under Rule 5(a)(2). The defendants are correct\n\nthat the original complaint contained a Statement indicating that\n\neither Count Nine or Count Ten--which, precisely, is ambiguous--was\n\nsubject to a presentment requirement, and that an amended complaint\n\nwould be filed in the future to actually urge the claim following\n\nsatisfaction of the presentment requirement.\n\n            Dismissal on this basis would exalt form over substance\n\nbecause the original and amended complaints are substantively\n\nidentical.    Rule 5(a)(2) ensures that a party, having been served,\n\nis able make an informed decision not to answer a complaint without\n\nfearing additional exposure to liability for claims raised only in\n\nsubsequent complaints that are never served.             Here, we have no\n\ndoubt that the original complaints provided the defendants with\n\nfair notice that the plaintiffs sought recovery on both Count Nine\n\nand Count Ten.   See Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d 50, 55\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).     It is not as if satisfaction of the presentment\n\nrequirement were somehow in doubt--the Statement revealed that\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fnotice of the claim had already been provided, and the silence of\n\nthe government agency is sufficient compliance with the statute.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, § 4.\n\n           Moreover,    the   factual   predicate   for   the   plaintiffs'\n\nclaims did not change at all.       See Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullan, 485 F.3d\n\n150, 154 (1st Cir. 2007) (explaining that fair notice is provided\n\nwhere a complaint explains \"who did what to whom, when, where, and\n\nwhy\" (citations omitted)); Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter, 339 F.3d\n\n9,   14   (1st   Cir.   2003)   (indicating    that   a    complaint   may\n\n\"sufficiently raise[] a claim even if it points to no legal theory\n\nor . . . the wrong legal theory\" (citation omitted)); DeNovellis v.\n\nShalala, 124 F.3d 298, 310 n.6 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that a\n\ncomplaint \"need not clearly articulate the precise legal theories\"\n\nto provide fair notice).      Thus, because the amended complaints did\n\nnot urge any new, substantive claims against any of the defendants,\n\nadditional service of process was not required.6          See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 5(a)(2); accord Gilles v. United States, 906 F.2d 1386, 1389\n\n(10th Cir. 1990) (explaining that dismissal based on improper\n\nservice of an amended complaint is inappropriate so long as the\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Massachusetts\ndoes not require plaintiffs to plead presentment. Vasys v. Metro.\nDist. Comm'n, 438 N.E.2d 836, 840 (Mass. 1982).\n\n                                   -9-\n\famended complaint \"relates back\" under Rule 15(c)7 to a prior,\n\nproperly served complaint).\n\nB.   Denial of Discovery and an Evidentiary Hearing\n\n           The district court dismissed the plaintiffs' original\n\naction for insufficient service of process under Rule 12(b)(5) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.    The plaintiffs do not argue\n\nthat the existing record substantiates that they provided adequate\n\nservice of process to any of the defendants.     Rather, they contend\n\nthat the district court erred by denying their request for limited\n\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining\n\nwhether McNamara was authorized to accept service of process for\n\nthe defendant officers.    In relevant part, Rule 4(e)(2) of the\n\nFederal Rules permits a plaintiff to effect service by \"delivering\n\na copy of [the summons and complaint] to an agent authorized by\n\nappointment or by law to receive service of process.\"    Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 4(e)(2)(C). This action was brought in a federal district court\n\nlocated   in   Massachusetts,   and    service   was   attempted   in\n\nMassachusetts; therefore, the plaintiffs were also permitted to\n\nserve the defendants in accordance with Massachusetts state law.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1). Massachusetts likewise allows a plaintiff\n\nto effect service \"[u]pon an individual by . . . delivering a copy\n\n\n\n      7\n      Under Rule 15(c)(1)(B), an amended complaint relates back to\na prior complaint where \"the amendment asserts a claim or defense\nthat arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out-\nor attempted to be set out--in the original pleading.\"\n\n                                -10-\n\fof the summons and of the complaint to an agent authorized by\n\nappointment or by statute to receive service of process.\" Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 4(d)(1).      The district court declined the plaintiffs'\n\nrequests for discovery and an evidentiary hearing based on its\n\ndetermination that they were merely \"grasp[ing] at straws\" without\n\nany \"realistic prospect\" of success.   Blair v. City of Worcester,\n\nNos. 02-40152-FDS, 02-40153-FDS, 2006 WL 1581582, at *6 (D. Mass.\n\nMar. 13, 2006).\n\n           A district court generally retains \"broad discretion in\n\ndetermining whether to grant jurisdictional8 discovery.\"     United\n\nStates v. Swiss Am. Bank, Ltd., 274 F.3d 610, 626 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(citation omitted).    Accordingly, \"[t]he standard for reversing a\n\ndistrict court's decision to disallow jurisdictional discovery is\n\nhigh.\"   Id.   To obtain relief, the aggrieved party must show that\n\n\"the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted\n\nin substantial prejudice.\"   Id. (citation omitted).9\n\n\n     8\n      Several cases to which we cite technically pertain to\ndismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction or Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction.\nNonetheless, these cases lend insight to our present inquiry. We\nnote that the parties and district court have cited such cases\ninterchangeably, as well.\n     9\n      As a preliminary matter, the plaintiffs argue that\napplication of the ordinary abuse of discretion standard is\ninappropriate in this case. They reason that an erroneous legal\nassumption underlying the district court's analysis of the returns\nof service executed by Deputy Richard tainted its subsequent review\nof all of the issues pertaining to this appeal.          Thus, the\nplaintiffs contend that de novo review is appropriate, given the\npurported legal error. Because we reverse even under the abuse of\n\n                                -11-\n\f            In contrast, the threshold showing that a plaintiff must\n\npresent    to   the   district   court    to   merit   limited   discovery   is\n\nrelatively low.       See Surpitski v. Hughes-Keenan Corp., 362 F.2d\n\n254, 255-256 (1st Cir. 1966) (per curiam) (explaining that a party\n\nshould be allowed to conduct jurisdictional discovery when its\n\nposition is not frivolous); see generally Swiss Am. Bank, 274 F.3d\n\nat 637 (\"As a general matter, discovery . . . should be freely\n\npermitted . . . .\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n\nEdmond v. U.S. Postal Serv. Gen. Counsel, 949 F.2d 415, 425 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1991))).     Moreover, factual disputes regarding agency should\n\ntypically be resolved only after a live hearing, see Rivera-Lopez\n\nv. Municipality of Dorado, 979 F.2d 885, 887 (1st Cir. 1992), in\n\norder     to    explore     issues       of    \"credibility      and   resolve\n\n. . . unanswered questions implicated by the parties' briefing.\"\n\nPadilla-Mangual v. Pavia Hosp., 516 F.3d 29, 34, (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nIndeed, we may find an abuse of discretion even where the lower\n\ncourt's decision is \"by no means wholly unsupported by the record.\"\n\nId.     Thus, where a plaintiff can demonstrate the existence of a\n\nplausible factual disagreement or ambiguity, our jurisprudence\n\nfavors permitting the litigants the opportunity to flesh out the\n\nrecord.    See id.\n\n            Here, the returns of service executed by Deputy Richard\n\nstate, in relevant part:\n\n\ndiscretion standard, we need not resolve this question.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f           I hereby certify and return that on 11/25/2002\n           at 11:59 AM I served a true and attested copy\n           of the Summons, Complaint and Jury Demand in\n           this action in the following manner: To wit,\n           by delivering in hand to KATHERIN [sic]\n           MCNAMARA, agent, person in charge at the time\n           of service for [the defendant officer] at\n           WORCESTER POLICE DEPARTMENT, 9-11 LINCOLN SQ,\n           WORCESTER, MA.\n\nAs the defendants point out, the language of the returns seems\n\ndesigned to indicate both service of an agent under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n4(e)(2) and Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1), and service of a \"person in\n\ncharge of [a] business\" under Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(2), which\n\nprovides   one   method   for   the   service   of   corporations   and\n\nunincorporated associations.     Quite obviously, Mass. R. Civ. P.\n\n4(d)(2) is completely inapplicable to service of the defendant\n\nofficers in their individual capacities.\n\n           A return of service generally serves as prima facie\n\nevidence that service was validly performed. See, e.g., O'Brien v.\n\nR.J. O'Brien & Assocs., Inc., 998 F.2d 1394, 1398 (7th Cir. 1993);\n\nCurley v. Radow, No. 00-10956-GAO, 2007 WL 2060015, at *4-5 (D.\n\nMass. July 16, 2007); Johnson v. Witkowski, 573 N.E.2d 513, 524\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1991). Whether or not this return of service\n\nqualifies as such evidence, the defendants have adduced sufficient\n\nrebuttal evidence to refute any presumption of valid service.       In\n\nan affidavit, McNamara stated that:\n\n           I have not been authorized or appointed by\n           Peter Towler, Thomas Dowd, Daniel Dowd, Thomas\n           C. Duffy, Edward McGinn, James Moore[,] or\n           Jose Ortiz to accept service of process on\n\n                                 -13-\n\f           their behalf for lawsuits in which they are\n           being sued, whether in their individual\n           capacity or their official capacity, and I was\n           not so authorized or appointed by them in\n           November 2002.\n\nThus, McNamara specifically denied being appointed an agent by any\n\nof the defendant officers for whom returns of service were filed.\n\nAdditionally, Officer Thomas Dowd provided an affidavit denying\n\nthat he had \"authorized any individual or entity to accept service\n\nof process on my behalf.\"\n\n           Under Massachusetts law, an affidavit is sufficient to\n\nrefute the prima facie presumption created by a return of service.\n\nSee Konan v. Carroll, 638 N.E. 2d 936, 938 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994)\n\n(citing Farley v. Sprague, 372 N.E.2d 1298, 1301-02 (Mass. 1978));\n\nsee also Maniscaclo v. Kenworthy, No. 03-P-626, 815 N.E.2d 656\n\n(table), 2004 WL 2185422, at *3 (Mass. App. Ct. Sept. 28, 2004)\n\n(per curiam) (\"Where, as here, [the] affidavit is uncontradicted\n\nother than by the deputy's return, the affidavit controls.\").\n\nSimilarly, federal courts have held that an affidavit denying\n\nagency,   standing   alone,   may    be    sufficient   to   overcome   the\n\npresumption of proper service created by the return of service.\n\nSee Hornick v. S. & M. Trucking Co., 208 F. Supp. 950, 952 (M.D.\n\nPa. 1962); Metropolitan Theatre Co. v. Warner Bros. Pictures, 16\n\nF.R.D. 391, 392-93 (S.D.N.Y. 1954); Puett Elec. Starting Gate Corp.\n\nv. Thistle Down Co., 2 F.R.D. 550, 551 (N.D. Ohio 1942); see also\n\nElibee v. Leonard, 226 F. App'x 351, 356 (5th Cir. 2007) (per\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fcuriam) (unpublished) (holding averments of defendants sufficient\n\nto refute agency relationship); Gottlieb v. Sandia Am. Corp., 452\n\nF.2d 510, 514 n.5 (3rd Cir. 1971) (stating that \"although a\n\nmarshal's return is not conclusive on the question of service on an\n\nagent, it will stand in the absence of proof to the contrary\").\n\n           Hence,       the     defendants        effectively       rebutted     any\n\npresumption that might have arisen from the returns of service\n\nexecuted by Deputy Richard.            At that point, the ultimate burden of\n\nproving proper service returned to the plaintiffs.                      See Rivera-\n\nLopez,   979    F.2d    at    887   (indicating     \"that,       once   challenged,\n\nplaintiffs     have    the    burden    of    proving   proper    service\").     We\n\nemphasize, however, that the real issue at hand is not whether the\n\nplaintiffs     proved       service--but       merely   whether     they    adduced\n\nsufficient evidence to warrant limited discovery and an evidentiary\n\nhearing.   See id.\n\n           The plaintiffs have mustered evidence--specifically, the\n\nSecond Affidavit of Theresa Labriola (one of their attorneys), a\n\ndocument known as Worcester Police Policy and Procedure No. 351\n\n(\"Policy No. 351\"), and returns of service for Officers Daniel\n\nDowd, Thomas Dowd, Duffy, McGinn, Moore, Ortiz, and Towler in a\n\ndifferent case--to refute McNamara's and Officer Thomas Dowd's\n\naffidavits.     We examine each of these items in turn.\n\n           First,      we    address    the    Labriola   affidavit.        In   the\n\naffidavit, Labriola indicates that Deputy Richard informed her that\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fhe had served Worcester police officers \"hundreds\" of times in the\n\npast by leaving copies of the complaint and summons at the office\n\nof the chief of police, as he did here.                   At some point, he was\n\nsupposedly \"informed that the Chief's Office would no longer accept\n\nany summonses or complaints for the Worcester City Police Officers\"\n\n(emphasis added).        The affidavit further states that Labriola\n\ncorroborated this information with another Deputy Sheriff, Rusty\n\nValery.    Neither Deputy Richard nor Deputy Valery provided an\n\naffidavit substantiating these remarks.              While not based on first-\n\nhand   knowledge,     Labriola's      representations           are   sufficient    to\n\nmilitate   in    favor   of     discovery     and    an    evidentiary       hearing.\n\nAlthough Deputy Richard apparently refused to supply an affidavit,\n\nhe would presumably answer to a court-authorized subpoena.\n\n           Moreover,      the      Labriola   affidavit         alleges     that   the\n\nplaintiffs      attempted     to    obtain    \"cop[ies]         of    all   documents\n\nconcerning      all   summonses      received       by    the    Worcester     Police\n\nDepartment from June 2002 through December 2002,\" to ascertain\n\nwhether the defendant officers routinely acquiesced to service of\n\nprocess via the method attempted in this case.                         According to\n\nLabriola, the Worcester Police Department never responded to this\n\nrequest; moreover, she stated that Rider, the City's attorney,\n\nagreed to help her obtain the information, but that he never\n\nfollowed through.        Limited discovery and an evidentiary hearing\n\nwould permit the plaintiffs to uncover whether there is additional\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fevidence of service effected in the manner attempted in this case.\n\nIf the defendant officers have accepted service in this fashion on\n\na number of occasions, then a strong argument exists that McNamara\n\npossessed implied, actual authority to accept service of process on\n\ntheir behalf.   See In re Focus Media Inc., 387 F.3d 1077, 1082 (9th\n\nCir. 2004) (holding that, while a purported agent must possess\n\nactual authority to accept service of process, such authority may\n\nbe implied rather than express); accord United States v. Ziegler\n\nBolt & Parts Co., 111 F.3d 878, 881 (Fed. Cir. 1997); United States\n\nv. Balanovski, 236 F.2d 298, 303 (2d Cir. 1956); see generally Inn\n\nFoods, Inc. v. Equitable Co-op. Bank, 45 F.3d 594, 597 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (explaining basic, common law principles of agency and\n\nimplied authority in different context).\n\n          Second, the plaintiffs point to Policy No. 351, which\n\nthey suggest establishes apparent authority for McNamara to accept\n\nservice of process on behalf of the defendant officers.          We\n\ndisagree; the policy lends negligible support to the plaintiffs'\n\nassertion of agency.     The policy states that \"[a]ll summonses\n\nreceived by the Worcester Police Department shall be recorded in\n\nthe office of the Chief of Police.      The summons and travel fee\n\nshall be forwarded to the officer named in the summons.\"     As the\n\ndistrict court recognized, however, the policy is labeled \"Revenue\n\nManagement\" and concerns the acceptance of summonses and fees for\n\npolice officers to appear as witnesses.     Indeed, Policy No. 351\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fstates   that    its   purpose   \"is    to    provide   guidelines     for   the\n\nacceptance and receipt of monies received by any police personnel,\"\n\nso as to prevent conflicts of interests.                The language of the\n\npolicy simply does not comport with the interpretation that the\n\nplaintiffs ascribe to it.        Even if it did, nothing in the policy\n\nindicates that any of the defendant officers actually appointed--or\n\nwere required to appoint--McNamara, or any other individual, as an\n\nagent for service of process.          See Maiz v. Virani, 311 F.3d 334,\n\n340 (5th Cir. 2002) (requiring actual authority) (citing United\n\nStates v. $184,505.01, 72 F.3d 1160, 1164 n.10 (3rd Cir. 1995));\n\nsee also Ziegler Bolt & Parts Co., 111 F.3d at 881 (mandating\n\nexpress or implied actual authority, but noting that some courts\n\nhave found implied actual authority based on \"'the doctrine of\n\napparent authority or agency by estoppel'\" (quoting 1 Robert C.\n\nCasad, Jurisdiction in Civil Action § 301.[2][b], at 3-12 to 3-13\n\n(1991))).       At   most,   Policy   No.    351   serves   as   circumstantial\n\nevidence that McNamara may have accepted summonses on the defendant\n\nofficers' behalf in a different context.\n\n            Third, the plaintiffs point to a related case, Boucher v.\n\nCity of Worcester, No. 04-12673-REK (D. Mass. Aug. 22, 2006), in\n\nwhich certain of the defendant officers appear to have been served\n\nin a similar manner without any objection.              Thus, the plaintiffs\n\nhave shown that the defendant officers have, on at least one\n\noccasion, acquiesced to a similar attempt at service.               In Rivera-\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fLopez, a factually similar case, we reversed a lower court's\n\ndetermination that a defendant was estopped from denying an agency\n\nrelationship with a secretary because \"[t]he acceptance of service\n\n[by a secretary] in prior cases unconnected with plaintiff might\n\nhave been specially authorized, or defendant . . . might have\n\nchosen to waive formalities.\"        979 F.2d at 887.      Nevertheless, we\n\nremanded for further proceedings to determine the actual authority\n\nof the secretary to accept service of process for the defendant.\n\nId.   We explained that, \"[i]n view of [the issue's] importance,\n\nthere should be a hearing on live testimony, not on conflicting\n\naffidavits.\"      Id.     The record before us is silent as to why the\n\ndefendant officers did not challenge service in Boucher.                 The\n\nplaintiffs' posited explanation--that they did not because McNamara\n\nwas an agent of the defendant officers--is plausible.            It is also\n\ncredible   that     the     defendants,    for   reasons   of   their   own,\n\naffirmatively decided to waive service in that case, or even that\n\ntheir attorneys simply neglected to raise a valid defense.              See\n\nRivera-Lopez, 979 F.2d at 887.        An evidentiary hearing, with live\n\ntestimony, would help to resolve this unanswered question.\n\n           In summary, the circumstantial evidence adduced by the\n\nplaintiffs gives rise to a permissible inference that the defendant\n\nofficers, in the past, authorized McNamara--or, perhaps, the clerks\n\nin the Office of the Chief of Police--to act as their agent for\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fservice of process.        The self-serving10 affidavits submitted by the\n\ndefendants    are    not    so   powerful      as    to    resolve    the   matter\n\ndefinitively, at least where the plaintiffs have introduced some\n\ncontravening evidence and have had no opportunity to conduct\n\nrelated discovery and elicit testimony from McNamara and the\n\ndefendant officers.        Thus, the district court was mistaken in its\n\nassessment that the plaintiffs' request for limited discovery and\n\nan evidentiary hearing was nothing more than a \"grasp at straws.\"\n\nMoreover,    the     plaintiffs     have       quite      clearly    demonstrated\n\nsubstantial prejudice, given the district court's reasons for\n\ndismissing the original action.\n\n            Accordingly, we hold that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion   by     dismissing    the    action     without   first    permitting\n\nlimited discovery and holding an evidentiary hearing, given the\n\npersistent factual uncertainty concerning agency.11                  See id.; see\n\n\n\n     10\n      Although McNamara is not a defendant, she is nevertheless\naffiliated with them.\n     11\n      Because we remand for limited discovery and an evidentiary\nhearing, we decline to address the plaintiffs' additional\nchallenges.   We note, however, that evidence adduced following\nremand might alter the calculus for application of the\nMassachusetts renewal statute by elucidating the nature of Deputy\nRichard's erroneous service or the reasonableness of the\nplaintiffs' reliance upon it, should the district court again\ndismiss the original action based on a finding that McNamara was\nnot authorized to serve as an agent for the defendant officers.\nFor example, if the defendant officers accepted service of process\nin this manner in many cases, but only due to multiple acts of\nwaiver, the plaintiffs might be deemed justified in mistakenly-but-\nreasonably relying upon such an attempt at service.\n\n                                        -20-\n\falso Surpitski, 362 F.2d at 256 (\"When the fish is identified, and\n\nthe question is whether it is in the pond, we know no reason to\n\ndeny a plaintiff the customary license [to conduct discovery].\").\n\nHowever, the record is devoid of evidence describing any attempt at\n\nservice of either Thomas or Falcone, and the plaintiffs have not\n\noffered    any    explanation      to   mitigate     this    apparent    failure.\n\nAdditionally, the plaintiffs have abandoned their claims against\n\nthe City and Chief Gallagher.           Consequently, these defendants were\n\nproperly dismissed from the case.           If after discovery the district\n\ncourt allows the first action to proceed, it may dismiss the second\n\naction as duplicative; if the district court dismisses the first\n\naction based on insufficient service of process, then it should\n\nproceed to reconsider whether the renewal statute saves the second\n\naction.\n\n                                III.    CONCLUSION\n\n            For    the     foregoing    reasons,    we   reverse   the   district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the original and the second action with\n\nrespect to Officers Daniel Dowd, Thomas Dowd, Duffy, McGinn, Moore,\n\nOrtiz,    and    Towler.      We   remand   for    limited   discovery    and   an\n\nevidentiary hearing.         We affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nthe City of Worcester, Chief Gallagher, and Officers Falcone and\n\nThomas from the original action.\n\n            Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings.         Costs are awarded in favor of appellants.\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\f",

Plaintiffs-appellants\n\nBrandon S. Blair and Richard N. Tousignant (\"plaintiffs\") appeal\n\nthe district court's dismissal of two separate actions in favor of\n\ndefendants     City   of   Worcester,    Massachusetts   (\"City\"),   former\n\nWorcester Chief of Police James Gallagher, and Worcester Police\n\nOfficers Daniel Dowd, Thomas Dowd, Thomas C. Duffy, Falcone1,\n\nEdward McGinn, James Moore, Jose Ortiz, Jonathan Thomas, and Peter\n\nTowler (collectively, \"defendants\").2         The plaintiffs, in separate\n\ncomplaints that were later consolidated, alleged that they were\n\nattacked and beaten by Worcester police officers, for which they\n\nsought recovery against the defendants under myriad legal theories.\n\nIn an initial action, the district court granted the defendants'\n\nmotions to dismiss, without prejudice, for failure to perfect\n\nservice of process.        After the plaintiffs refiled their claims in\n\na second action, the district court granted the defendant officers'\n\nmotions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, holding that the\n\nmatter was time-barred.        We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\n\nremand for further proceedings.\n\n                               I.   BACKGROUND\n\n\n     1\n         The first name of Officer Falcone is unclear.\n     2\n      We note that the City of Worcester, Chief Gallagher, and\nOfficer Thomas were not named in the second action. Moreover, the\nplaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Falcone from the second action on\nAugust 29, 2006.    Finally, the plaintiffs have abandoned their\nclaims with respect to Chief Gallagher and the City. Where these\ndistinctions matter, we refer to the remaining defendants as the\n\"defendant officers.\"\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          The record facts of this case, at least those relevant to\n\nthe instant appeal, are not in material dispute.    On December 22,\n\n2001, the plaintiffs were involved in an altercation with several\n\nof the defendant officers.   As a result of this incident, criminal\n\ncharges were brought against the plaintiffs.    At the conclusion of\n\na jury trial, both plaintiffs were acquitted.   Shortly thereafter,\n\non August 16, 2002, the plaintiffs, represented by W. Theodore\n\nHarris, filed separate complaints3 in federal district court,\n\nalleging various claims based on their purported mistreatment at\n\nthe hands of the defendants.   On September 5, 2002, Donald Rider,\n\nan attorney for the City, notified Chief Gallagher and Officers\n\nDaniel Dowd, Thomas Dowd, Duffy, Patricia Falcone,4 McGinn, Moore,\n\nOrtiz, Thomas, and Towler that two civil rights lawsuits were\n\npending against them in federal district court; indicated that he\n\nwould handle the lawsuits; and requested that they inform him if\n\nserved with process.   The record does not reveal how Rider learned\n\nof the lawsuits, although the plaintiffs introduced as evidence a\n\ncopy of a newspaper article, dated August 29, 2002, describing the\n\n\n\n     3\n      Blair and Tousignant filed separate but nearly-identical\ncomplaints and amended complaints in the initial action. Although\nthe district court and the parties exclusively referred to each set\nof complaints in the singular, we use the proper forms to ensure\nclarity, as the cases were not consolidated until a later juncture.\n     4\n      Rider sent this email to a recipient identified as \"Patricia\nFalcone,\" not the \"Thomas Falcone\" named in the plaintiffs' second\naction.    It is undisputed, however, that \"Falcone,\" whether\nPatricia or Thomas, was never served.\n\n                                -3-\n\faction,   which   might   have   been   the   source   of   his   knowledge.\n\nSubsequently, on November 25, 2002, Deputy Sheriff Ronald E.\n\nRichard attempted service upon Officers Daniel Dowd, Thomas Dowd,\n\nDuffy, McGinn, Moore, Ortiz, and Towler by leaving copies of the\n\nsummonses and the original complaints with an individual named\n\nKatherine McNamara, a \"Principal Clerk\" at the police department.\n\nThese returns of service were filed with the district court on\n\nDecember 2, 2002.    No returns of service were filed for the City,\n\nChief Gallagher, Officer Thomas, or Officer Falcone.\n\n           On January 8, 2004, 402 days after the plaintiffs' last\n\naction in the case, the district court mailed to Harris a Notice\n\nindicating that because the case had been inactive more than one\n\nyear, it would be dismissed in thirty days pursuant to Local Rule\n\n41.1 unless the plaintiffs took appropriate action.               Blair and\n\nTousignant learned of the Notice, which was entered on the docket,\n\nand chose to retain different counsel.            On February 6, 2004,\n\nattorney Stephen CampoBasso filed an appearance on behalf of the\n\nplaintiffs and submitted motions requesting that the cases not be\n\ndismissed, which were granted.           Harris withdrew as counsel of\n\nrecord on March 22, 2004, and he was subsequently suspended from\n\nthe practice of law for a period of eighteen months for reasons\n\nthat are not apparent on the face of the record.\n\n           On April 30, 2004, CampoBasso filed amended complaints on\n\nthe plaintiffs' behalf.      On June 8, 2004, CampoBasso obtained a\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fsummons for Chief Gallagher, which was then served, via a purported\n\nagent       named   Jennifer   Tauper,    and     a    return     of   service   was\n\nsubsequently filed with the court on July 8, 2004.                      The record\n\ndiscloses that, on August 4, 2004, CampoBasso sent a letter to\n\nAttorney Rider, to which copies of a summons and an amended\n\ncomplaint were apparently appended, in the apparent expectation\n\nthat Rider would assist in \"service of the Summons\" and then return\n\nit to him.          No copy of the attachment is in the record.                   On\n\nNovember      16,   2004,   CampoBasso     sent       follow-up    correspondence,\n\napparently due to his concern regarding Rider's silence.                          On\n\nDecember 14, 2004, CampoBasso directed yet another letter to Rider,\n\nrequesting his \"assistance in getting the Summonses5 filed with the\n\nCourt.\"        He mentioned that his clients were growing \"uneasy\"\n\nregarding the lack of activity in the case.                  Unfortunately, the\n\nrecord does not explicate which defendant or defendants CampoBasso\n\nsought to serve in this manner.           Regardless, CampoBasso's efforts,\n\nwhich might have been an attempt to obtain waiver of personal\n\nservice under Rule 4(d), were apparently fruitless--and, in any\n\nevent, the plaintiffs do not rely on this set of correspondence in\n\nany of their claims of error.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n      CampoBasso's correspondence does not clearly indicate whether\nhis query referred to only one or multiple summonses. CampoBasso\nseems to have used the singular and plural form of \"summons\"\ninterchangeably.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f           CampoBasso took no further record action in the case and\n\ncommitted suicide in February 2005.         On April 14, 2005, Jo Ann\n\nCitron and Michael Altman appeared on behalf of the plaintiffs as\n\nthe third set of counsel of record.           Proceeding expeditiously\n\nthereafter, on April 26, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a motion for\n\ndefault   judgment   against   the    defendants.   In   response,   the\n\ndefendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims, arguing that\n\nthe plaintiffs had failed to effect personal service of process\n\nupon them.    The defendants attached an affidavit from McNamara\n\nstating that she was not authorized to accept service for the\n\ndefendant officers.     Likewise, Officer Thomas Dowd submitted an\n\naffidavit indicating that he had not appointed McNamara as his\n\nagent for receiving service of process.\n\n           In response, the plaintiffs offered evidence purporting\n\nto show that McNamara had actual and apparent authority to accept\n\nprocess on behalf of the defendant officers, requested leave to\n\nconduct additional discovery to prove this agency relationship, and\n\nargued that even if no agency relationship existed, the district\n\ncourt should extend the time to serve the defendants.      On March 13,\n\n2006, the district court issued an opinion denying the plaintiffs\n\nrelief and granting the defendants' motions to dismiss, without\n\nprejudice. The plaintiffs filed a timely Notice of Appeal on April\n\n6, 2006, but subsequently requested and received a stay during the\n\npendency of the action described below.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           On June 26, 2006, the plaintiffs initiated a new action\n\nin federal district court, based on the same underlying conduct,\n\nseeking similar relief as before, asserting that the Massachusetts\n\nrenewal statute revived their otherwise time-barred claims.                  The\n\ndistrict court, based on its construction of the renewal statute,\n\nrejected   the   plaintiffs'    contentions     and    dismissed      the   case.\n\nAgain, the plaintiffs appealed; the two appeals have since been\n\nconsolidated.\n\n                               II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Effect of the Amended Complaints\n\n           The defendants argue that the filing of the April 30,\n\n2004, amended complaints makes irrelevant any service of process,\n\nwhether effective or not, that was performed in this case in\n\nrelation to the original complaints.          On the defendants' theory,\n\nthe amended complaint--by being filed , and whether or not properly\n\nserved--superseded the original complaint, and made it no longer\n\navailable as a basis for pursuing this case.           Under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 5(a)(2), an amended complaint stating a new claim\n\nmust be served on defendants, such as those here, who have failed\n\nto   appear.     The   defendants    argue   that     because   the    original\n\ncomplaint was superseded and the amended complaint was never\n\nserved, dismissal of the suit for insufficient service of process\n\nwas proper.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            There are two flaws with the defendants' theory.         First,\n\nit   is   doubtful   that   the   unserved    amended   complaint   in   fact\n\nsuperseded the original complaint.           See Anunciation v. W. Capital\n\nFin.

Second, the amended complaint\n\ndid not in fact contain a new claim for relief, and therefore did\n\nnot require service under Rule 5(a)(2). The defendants are correct\n\nthat the original complaint contained a Statement indicating that\n\neither Count Nine or Count Ten--which, precisely, is ambiguous--was\n\nsubject to a presentment requirement, and that an amended complaint\n\nwould be filed in the future to actually urge the claim following\n\nsatisfaction of the presentment requirement.\n\n            Dismissal on this basis would exalt form over substance\n\nbecause the original and amended complaints are substantively\n\nidentical.    Rule 5(a)(2) ensures that a party, having been served,\n\nis able make an informed decision not to answer a complaint without\n\nfearing additional exposure to liability for claims raised only in\n\nsubsequent complaints that are never served.             Here, we have no\n\ndoubt that the original complaints provided the defendants with\n\nfair notice that the plaintiffs sought recovery on both Count Nine\n\nand Count Ten.   See Aponte-Torres v.

Denial of Discovery and an Evidentiary Hearing\n\n           The district court dismissed the plaintiffs' original\n\naction for insufficient service of process under Rule 12(b)(5) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.    The plaintiffs do not argue\n\nthat the existing record substantiates that they provided adequate\n\nservice of process to any of the defendants.     Rather, they contend\n\nthat the district court erred by denying their request for limited\n\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining\n\nwhether McNamara was authorized to accept service of process for\n\nthe defendant officers.    In relevant part, Rule 4(e)(2) of the\n\nFederal Rules permits a plaintiff to effect service by \"delivering\n\na copy of [the summons and complaint] to an agent authorized by\n\nappointment or by law to receive service of process.\"    Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 4(e)(2)(C). This action was brought in a federal district court\n\nlocated   in   Massachusetts,   and    service   was   attempted   in\n\nMassachusetts; therefore, the plaintiffs were also permitted to\n\nserve the defendants in accordance with Massachusetts state law.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1). Massachusetts likewise allows a plaintiff\n\nto effect service \"[u]pon an individual by . . . delivering a copy\n\n\n\n      7\n      Under Rule 15(c)(1)(B), an amended complaint relates back to\na prior complaint where \"the amendment asserts a claim or defense\nthat arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out-\nor attempted to be set out--in the original pleading.\"\n\n                                -10-\n\fof the summons and of the complaint to an agent authorized by\n\nappointment or by statute to receive service of process.\" Mass.

We examine each of these items in turn.\n\n           First,      we    address    the    Labriola   affidavit.        In   the\n\naffidavit, Labriola indicates that Deputy Richard informed her that\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fhe had served Worcester police officers \"hundreds\" of times in the\n\npast by leaving copies of the complaint and summons at the office\n\nof the chief of police, as he did here.                   At some point, he was\n\nsupposedly \"informed that the Chief's Office would no longer accept\n\nany summonses or complaints for the Worcester City Police Officers\"\n\n(emphasis added).        The affidavit further states that Labriola\n\ncorroborated this information with another Deputy Sheriff, Rusty\n\nValery.    Neither Deputy Richard nor Deputy Valery provided an\n\naffidavit substantiating these remarks.              While not based on first-\n\nhand   knowledge,     Labriola's      representations           are   sufficient    to\n\nmilitate   in    favor   of     discovery     and    an    evidentiary       hearing.\n\nAlthough Deputy Richard apparently refused to supply an affidavit,\n\nhe would presumably answer to a court-authorized subpoena.\n\n           Moreover,      the      Labriola   affidavit         alleges     that   the\n\nplaintiffs      attempted     to    obtain    \"cop[ies]         of    all   documents\n\nconcerning      all   summonses      received       by    the    Worcester     Police\n\nDepartment from June 2002 through December 2002,\" to ascertain\n\nwhether the defendant officers routinely acquiesced to service of\n\nprocess via the method attempted in this case.                         According to\n\nLabriola, the Worcester Police Department never responded to this\n\nrequest; moreover, she stated that Rider, the City's attorney,\n\nagreed to help her obtain the information, but that he never\n\nfollowed through.        Limited discovery and an evidentiary hearing\n\nwould permit the plaintiffs to uncover whether there is additional\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fevidence of service effected in the manner attempted in this case.\n\nIf the defendant officers have accepted service in this fashion on\n\na number of occasions, then a strong argument exists that McNamara\n\npossessed implied, actual authority to accept service of process on\n\ntheir behalf.

We\n\ndisagree; the policy lends negligible support to the plaintiffs'\n\nassertion of agency.     The policy states that \"[a]ll summonses\n\nreceived by the Worcester Police Department shall be recorded in\n\nthe office of the Chief of Police.      The summons and travel fee\n\nshall be forwarded to the officer named in the summons.\"     As the\n\ndistrict court recognized, however, the policy is labeled \"Revenue\n\nManagement\" and concerns the acceptance of summonses and fees for\n\npolice officers to appear as witnesses.     Indeed, Policy No. 351\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fstates   that    its   purpose   \"is    to    provide   guidelines     for   the\n\nacceptance and receipt of monies received by any police personnel,\"\n\nso as to prevent conflicts of interests.                The language of the\n\npolicy simply does not comport with the interpretation that the\n\nplaintiffs ascribe to it.        Even if it did, nothing in the policy\n\nindicates that any of the defendant officers actually appointed--or\n\nwere required to appoint--McNamara, or any other individual, as an\n\nagent for service of process.          See Maiz v. Virani, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"28959\"><a href=\"/opinion/28959/maiz-v-virani/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n340 (5th Cir. 2002) (requiring actual authority) (citing United\n\nStates v. $184,505.01, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710233\"><a href=\"/opinion/710233/united-states-v-18450501-in-us-currency-reginald-d-mcglory/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1164 n.10 (3rd Cir. 1995));\n\nsee also Ziegler Bolt & Parts Co., 111 F.3d at 881 (mandating\n\nexpress or implied actual authority, but noting that some courts\n\nhave found implied actual authority based on \"'the doctrine of\n\napparent authority or agency by estoppel'\" (quoting 1 Robert C.\n\nCasad, Jurisdiction in Civil Action § 301.[2][b], at 3-12 to 3-13\n\n(1991))).       At   most,   Policy   No.    351   serves   as   circumstantial\n\nevidence that McNamara may have accepted summonses on the defendant\n\nofficers' behalf in a different context.\n\n            Third, the plaintiffs point to a related case, Boucher v.\n\nCity of Worcester, No. 04-12673-REK (D. Mass. Aug. 22, 2006), in\n\nwhich certain of the defendant officers appear to have been served\n\nin a similar manner without any objection.              Thus, the plaintiffs\n\nhave shown that the defendant officers have, on at least one\n\noccasion, acquiesced to a similar attempt at service.               In Rivera-\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fLopez, a factually similar case, we reversed a lower court's\n\ndetermination that a defendant was estopped from denying an agency\n\nrelationship with a secretary because \"[t]he acceptance of service\n\n[by a secretary] in prior cases unconnected with plaintiff might\n\nhave been specially authorized, or defendant . . . might have\n\nchosen to waive formalities.\"        979 F.2d at 887.      Nevertheless, we\n\nremanded for further proceedings to determine the actual authority\n\nof the secretary to accept service of process for the defendant.\n\nId.   We explained that, \"[i]n view of [the issue's] importance,\n\nthere should be a hearing on live testimony, not on conflicting\n\naffidavits.\"      Id.     The record before us is silent as to why the\n\ndefendant officers did not challenge service in Boucher.                 The\n\nplaintiffs' posited explanation--that they did not because McNamara\n\nwas an agent of the defendant officers--is plausible.            It is also\n\ncredible   that     the     defendants,    for   reasons   of   their   own,\n\naffirmatively decided to waive service in that case, or even that\n\ntheir attorneys simply neglected to raise a valid defense.              See\n\nRivera-Lopez, 979 F.2d at 887.        An evidentiary hearing, with live\n\ntestimony, would help to resolve this unanswered question.\n\n           In summary, the circumstantial evidence adduced by the\n\nplaintiffs gives rise to a permissible inference that the defendant\n\nofficers, in the past, authorized McNamara--or, perhaps, the clerks\n\nin the Office of the Chief of Police--to act as their agent for\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fservice of process.        The self-serving10 affidavits submitted by the\n\ndefendants    are    not    so   powerful      as    to    resolve    the   matter\n\ndefinitively, at least where the plaintiffs have introduced some\n\ncontravening evidence and have had no opportunity to conduct\n\nrelated discovery and elicit testimony from McNamara and the\n\ndefendant officers.        Thus, the district court was mistaken in its\n\nassessment that the plaintiffs' request for limited discovery and\n\nan evidentiary hearing was nothing more than a \"grasp at straws.\"\n\nMoreover,    the     plaintiffs     have       quite      clearly    demonstrated\n\nsubstantial prejudice, given the district court's reasons for\n\ndismissing the original action.\n\n            Accordingly, we hold that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion   by     dismissing    the    action     without   first    permitting\n\nlimited discovery and holding an evidentiary hearing, given the\n\npersistent factual uncertainty concerning agency.11                  See id.; see\n\n\n\n     10\n      Although McNamara is not a defendant, she is nevertheless\naffiliated with them.\n     11\n      Because we remand for limited discovery and an evidentiary\nhearing, we decline to address the plaintiffs' additional\nchallenges.   We note, however, that evidence adduced following\nremand might alter the calculus for application of the\nMassachusetts renewal statute by elucidating the nature of Deputy\nRichard's erroneous service or the reasonableness of the\nplaintiffs' reliance upon it, should the district court again\ndismiss the original action based on a finding that McNamara was\nnot authorized to serve as an agent for the defendant officers.\nFor example, if the defendant officers accepted service of process\nin this manner in many cases, but only due to multiple acts of\nwaiver, the plaintiffs might be deemed justified in mistakenly-but-\nreasonably relying upon such an attempt at service.\n\n                                        -20-\n\falso Surpitski, 362 F.2d at 256 (\"When the fish is identified, and\n\nthe question is whether it is in the pond, we know no reason to\n\ndeny a plaintiff the customary license [to conduct discovery].\").\n\nHowever, the record is devoid of evidence describing any attempt at\n\nservice of either Thomas or Falcone, and the plaintiffs have not\n\noffered    any    explanation      to   mitigate     this    apparent    failure.\n\nAdditionally, the plaintiffs have abandoned their claims against\n\nthe City and Chief Gallagher.           Consequently, these defendants were\n\nproperly dismissed from the case.           If after discovery the district\n\ncourt allows the first action to proceed, it may dismiss the second\n\naction as duplicative; if the district court dismisses the first\n\naction based on insufficient service of process, then it should\n\nproceed to reconsider whether the renewal statute saves the second\n\naction.\n\n                                III.    CONCLUSION\n\n            For    the     foregoing    reasons,    we   reverse   the   district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the original and the second action with\n\nrespect to Officers Daniel Dowd, Thomas Dowd, Duffy, McGinn, Moore,\n\nOrtiz,    and    Towler.      We   remand   for    limited   discovery    and   an\n\nevidentiary hearing.         We affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nthe City of Worcester, Chief Gallagher, and Officers Falcone and\n\nThomas from the original action.\n\n            Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings.         Costs are awarded in favor of appellants.\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\f</pre>",
