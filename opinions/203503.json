Fnu Odmar, a native and\n\ncitizen    of   Indonesia,     petitions     for   review   of   the   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals’ (“BIA”) dismissal of his appeal from the\n\ndenial of asylum and withholding of removal by an Immigration Judge\n\n(“IJ”).1   Odmar contends that the BIA erred in determining (1) that\n\nthere was no material change in circumstances establishing an\n\nexception to the requirement that asylum applications be filed\n\nwithin one year of arrival in the United States, and (2) that he\n\nwas not entitled to withholding of removal.                  Because we lack\n\njurisdiction     to   review   the   BIA’s    determination      regarding     the\n\ntimeliness of Odmar’s asylum application and substantial evidence\n\nsupports the denial of withholding, we dismiss Odmar’s petition for\n\nreview in part and deny it in part.\n\n                                I.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Odmar entered the United States on April 4, 1999, as a\n\ncrew member authorized to remain for no more than twenty-nine days.\n\nOn April 14, 2003, Odmar was served with a Notice to Appear\n\ncharging him as removable pursuant to Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).                Odmar\n\nfiled a defensive asylum application on July 28, 2005, based on his\n\n\n\n     1\n      Odmar has waived any challenge to the denial of relief under\nthe Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) by not raising it in his\nopening brief. See Levin v. Dalva Bros., Inc., 459 F.3d 68, 76 n.4\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                       2\n\fChristianity.\n\n            In       his    testimony   before   the   IJ    and    in   his   asylum\n\napplication, Odmar described various incidents of harm in support\n\nof his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT\n\nrelief.     The IJ found Odmar credible.                  Odmar described being\n\nfearful    after      witnessing    the   1984    clash     between      Muslims   and\n\nChristians in the Tanjung Priok area of Jakarta.                    In June 1996, a\n\nMuslim group leader interrupted a home prayer service in which\n\nOdmar participated and demanded that the attendees stop their\n\nprayers.    In December 1998, Odmar witnessed a Muslim group attack\n\na   man    on    a    bus    identified    as    Christian     on     his   national\n\nidentification card, which indicates religion.                     Odmar described\n\nthat members of Muslim organizations solicited him, but not his\n\nMuslim neighbors, for donations, and that he felt pressured to\n\ncontribute.          Odmar also testified that his mother and sister\n\ncontinue to reside in Indonesia and practice Christianity without\n\nproblems.\n\n            At the conclusion of the March 2, 2006, hearing, the IJ\n\ndenied all relief except voluntary departure.                  The IJ determined\n\nthat Odmar did not file an asylum application within one year of\n\narriving in the United States, and that he did not qualify for an\n\nexception based on materially changed circumstances in Indonesia.\n\nThe IJ denied withholding of removal finding that Odmar did not\n\nshow that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted\n\n\n                                          3\n\fon account of his Christianity if he returned to Indonesia.          The IJ\n\nfound that Odmar’s experiences did not rise to the requisite level\n\nof past persecution.    The IJ also noted that Odmar testified that\n\nhis mother, sister, and brother-in-law, who were also Christian,\n\nworshiped without any interference from Muslims or the government.\n\n          Odmar timely appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA.            The\n\nBIA issued a decision on August 3, 2007, affirming the denial of\n\nall relief and the grant of voluntary departure.            The BIA found\n\nthat Odmar was ineligible for asylum based on his failure to file\n\nwithin the statutory one-year deadline, and his inability to\n\nestablish “any changed circumstances in Indonesia affecting his\n\neligibility or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in\n\nfiling an application.”        The BIA observed that although Odmar\n\nclaimed that conditions in Indonesia had been deteriorating since\n\nhis 1999 departure, he did not apply for asylum until six years\n\nlater in 2005, and he did not identify “any new ‘changes’ that\n\noccurred in his native country within a reasonable time of his\n\nfiling that related to his claim for relief, and excused his delay\n\nin filing.”\n\n          The   BIA    found   that       Odmar’s   experiences   were   not\n\nsufficiently severe to establish past persecution.          The BIA denied\n\nwithholding, determining that there was no objective basis in the\n\nrecord to conclude that it was more likely than not that Odmar\n\nwould be persecuted if he returned to Indonesia.             The BIA also\n\n\n                                      4\n\fagreed with the IJ’s determination that Odmar was not entitled to\n\nCAT relief.\n\n            Odmar filed a timely petition for review.\n\n                              II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Timeliness of Odmar’s Asylum Application\n\n            We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Odmar's\n\nasylum application based on the BIA’s determinations that Odmar did\n\nnot file his application within the one year deadline and failed to\n\ndemonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing his\n\nlate filing.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); Hayek v. Gonzales, 445\n\nF.3d 501, 506-507 (1st Cir. 2006).        Under the REAL ID Act, this\n\ncourt does retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or\n\nquestions     of     law   raised    in   a    petition   for   review.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).     The BIA’s findings regarding timeliness\n\nand changed or extraordinary circumstances, however, are usually\n\nfactual determinations outside the court’s jurisdiction.           See\n\nHayek,   445 F.3d at 506-507.\n\n            Odmar contends that we retain jurisdiction because he\n\nraises a question of law.     He argues that the IJ used the incorrect\n\nlegal standard by concluding that \"an increase in the intensity in\n\nthe circumstances in a particular country does not constitute a\n\nmaterial change as contemplated by the regulations,\" and that the\n\nBIA \"affirmed and simply cited the statute and regulation.\"\n\n            This argument is unavailing. Though the BIA affirmed the\n\n\n                                     5\n\fIJ, the BIA supplied its own reasoning and did not simply adopt the\n\nreasoning of the IJ.        Based on the record evidence, the BIA\n\nconcluded that Odmar had not identified \"any new ‘changes' that\n\noccurred in his native country within a reasonable time of his\n\nfiling that related to his claim for relief, and excused his delay\n\nin filing.\"   Contrary to Odmar's argument, this determination did\n\nnot involve the application of an erroneous legal standard; rather,\n\nit is a factual determination that Odmar did not demonstrate that\n\ncircumstances in Indonesia had changed such that his untimely\n\napplication   should   be   excused.   Determinations   of   changed\n\ncircumstances are generally factual determinations, Hayek,      445\n\nF.3d at 506-507, and Odmar has not presented a convincing argument\n\nthat the agency's determination here was not of a factual nature.\n\nThis court therefore lacks jurisdiction to review Odmar's claim\n\nthat the BIA erred in finding that his untimely application was not\n\nexcused.\n\nB.   Withholding of Removal\n\n            We review the BIA's findings of fact for substantial\n\nevidence.   See Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThe BIA's findings are upheld if they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole,\" and are reversed only if \"the record evidence would compel\n\na reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\"      Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n\n                                  6\n\f               To qualify for withholding of removal, Odmar must either\n\n(1)    show       that   he    suffered   past    persecution      on    account        of    a\n\nprotected ground, creating a rebuttable presumption of future\n\npersecution; or (2) demonstrate a clear probability of persecution,\n\nwhich requires a showing that it is \"more likely than not\" that his\n\nlife or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.      See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 430-31 (1987);\n\nDa Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          1. Past Persecution\n\n               Sufficient evidence supports the BIA's determination that\n\nOdmar’s experiences do not rise to the level of past persecution.\n\nHis home prayer service was disrupted, he was solicited for money,\n\nand he witnessed physical confrontations. Odmar never suffered any\n\nphysical       harm,     was     never    confined,      and    was     never    directly\n\nthreatened.          Occasional mistreatment or a generalized fear of\n\nmistreatment do not, on their own, constitute persecution.                               See\n\nSombah v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 49, 50-52 (1st Cir. 2008) (Christian\n\nIndonesian did not establish past persecution where applicant\n\nhosted      monthly      prayer    meetings      and   the     attendees’       cars    were\n\nvandalized, her church was burned down, her husband was threatened\n\non    a    bus,    and   Muslim    neighbors      killed     her   dog);    Susanto          v.\n\nGonzales, 439 F.3d 57, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2006) (Chinese Christian\n\nIndonesian         did   not    establish    past      persecution      where     she    was\n\n\n                                             7\n\fmugged, her home was vandalized during the 1998 riots, her church\n\nwas bombed, and a Muslim crowd threatened and threw stones at her).\n\n              Odmar's contention that the IJ failed to take into\n\naccount the totality of the circumstances and violated due process\n\nby ignoring evidence of country conditions between 2002 and 2005 is\n\nmeritless. In his decision, the IJ specifically refers to evidence\n\nof    country    conditions   from   this   time   period,   including   news\n\narticles, State Department reports, and other reports submitted in\n\nExhibit 6, and materials postdating September 2005.             See Sombah,\n\n529    F.3d     at   51-52.   The    parties   also   addressed   the    2005\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report during the hearing before\n\nthe IJ.\n\n       2. Future Persecution\n\n              Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s finding that\n\nOdmar did not establish that it was more likely than not that his\n\nlife or freedom would be threatened on account of his Christianity\n\nbased on country conditions and Odmar’s testimony that his family\n\nremains unharmed in Indonesia.        See Sipayung v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d\n\n18, 20 (1st Cir. 2007) (no objectively reasonable fear of future\n\npersecution where family remained in Indonesia unharmed and able to\n\nsafely practice their religion, and country reports indicated\n\nimproved conditions for Christians); Ferdinandus v. Gonzales, 504\n\nF.3d 61, 63 (1st Cir. 2007) (safety of petitioner's children, who\n\nstill live and attend church in Indonesia, undercuts her argument\n\n\n                                       8\n\fthat she will suffer future persecution).\n\n          Odmar also argues that direct government involvement\n\ntriggers “heightened scrutiny” of his claims. We need not consider\n\nthis argument because Odmar failed to present it to the BIA.   See\n\nSombah, 529 F.3d at 52 (rejecting same argument).\n\n\n\n          We dismiss the petition for review in part for lack of\n\njurisdiction and deny it in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f",

Timeliness of Odmar’s Asylum Application\n\n            We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Odmar's\n\nasylum application based on the BIA’s determinations that Odmar did\n\nnot file his application within the one year deadline and failed to\n\ndemonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing his\n\nlate filing.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); Hayek v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202159\"><a href=\"/opinion/202159/hayek-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506-507 (1st Cir. 2006).        Under the REAL ID Act, this\n\ncourt does retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or\n\nquestions     of     law   raised    in   a    petition   for   review.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).     The BIA’s findings regarding timeliness\n\nand changed or extraordinary circumstances, however, are usually\n\nfactual determinations outside the court’s jurisdiction.           See\n\nHayek,   445 F.3d at 506-507.\n\n            Odmar contends that we retain jurisdiction because he\n\nraises a question of law.     He argues that the IJ used the incorrect\n\nlegal standard by concluding that \"an increase in the intensity in\n\nthe circumstances in a particular country does not constitute a\n\nmaterial change as contemplated by the regulations,\" and that the\n\nBIA \"affirmed and simply cited the statute and regulation.\"\n\n            This argument is unavailing. Though the BIA affirmed the\n\n\n                                     5\n\fIJ, the BIA supplied its own reasoning and did not simply adopt the\n\nreasoning of the IJ.        Based on the record evidence, the BIA\n\nconcluded that Odmar had not identified \"any new ‘changes' that\n\noccurred in his native country within a reasonable time of his\n\nfiling that related to his claim for relief, and excused his delay\n\nin filing.\"   Contrary to Odmar's argument, this determination did\n\nnot involve the application of an erroneous legal standard; rather,\n\nit is a factual determination that Odmar did not demonstrate that\n\ncircumstances in Indonesia had changed such that his untimely\n\napplication   should   be   excused.   Determinations   of   changed\n\ncircumstances are generally factual determinations, Hayek,      445\n\nF.3d at 506-507, and Odmar has not presented a convincing argument\n\nthat the agency's determination here was not of a factual nature.\n\nThis court therefore lacks jurisdiction to review Odmar's claim\n\nthat the BIA erred in finding that his untimely application was not\n\nexcused.\n\nB.   Withholding of Removal\n\n            We review the BIA's findings of fact for substantial\n\nevidence.   See Romilus v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201241\"><a href=\"/opinion/201241/romilus-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThe BIA's findings are upheld if they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole,\" and are reversed only if \"the record evidence would compel\n\na reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\"      Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n\n                                  6\n\f               To qualify for withholding of removal, Odmar must either\n\n(1)    show       that   he    suffered   past    persecution      on    account        of    a\n\nprotected ground, creating a rebuttable presumption of future\n\npersecution; or (2) demonstrate a clear probability of persecution,\n\nwhich requires a showing that it is \"more likely than not\" that his\n\nlife or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.      See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430-31 (1987);\n\nDa Silva v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201398\"><a href=\"/opinion/201398/da-silva-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          1. Past Persecution\n\n               Sufficient evidence supports the BIA's determination that\n\nOdmar’s experiences do not rise to the level of past persecution.\n\nHis home prayer service was disrupted, he was solicited for money,\n\nand he witnessed physical confrontations. Odmar never suffered any\n\nphysical       harm,     was     never    confined,      and    was     never    directly\n\nthreatened.          Occasional mistreatment or a generalized fear of\n\nmistreatment do not, on their own, constitute persecution.                               See\n\nSombah v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203336\"><a href=\"/opinion/203336/sombah-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50-52 (1st Cir. 2008) (Christian\n\nIndonesian did not establish past persecution where applicant\n\nhosted      monthly      prayer    meetings      and   the     attendees’       cars    were\n\nvandalized, her church was burned down, her husband was threatened\n\non    a    bus,    and   Muslim    neighbors      killed     her   dog);    Susanto          v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202090\"><a href=\"/opinion/202090/susanto-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2006) (Chinese Christian\n\nIndonesian         did   not    establish    past      persecution      where     she    was\n\n\n                                             7\n\fmugged, her home was vandalized during the 1998 riots, her church\n\nwas bombed, and a Muslim crowd threatened and threw stones at her).\n\n              Odmar's contention that the IJ failed to take into\n\naccount the totality of the circumstances and violated due process\n\nby ignoring evidence of country conditions between 2002 and 2005 is\n\nmeritless. In his decision, the IJ specifically refers to evidence\n\nof    country    conditions   from   this   time   period,   including   news\n\narticles, State Department reports, and other reports submitted in\n\nExhibit 6, and materials postdating September 2005.             See Sombah,\n\n529    F.3d     at   51-52.   The    parties   also   addressed   the    2005\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report during the hearing before\n\nthe IJ.\n\n       2. Future Persecution\n\n              Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s finding that\n\nOdmar did not establish that it was more likely than not that his\n\nlife or freedom would be threatened on account of his Christianity\n\nbased on country conditions and Odmar’s testimony that his family\n\nremains unharmed in Indonesia.        See Sipayung v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202816\"><a href=\"/opinion/202816/sipayung-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir. 2007) (no objectively reasonable fear of future\n\npersecution where family remained in Indonesia unharmed and able to\n\nsafely practice their religion, and country reports indicated\n\nimproved conditions for Christians); Ferdinandus v.

We need not consider\n\nthis argument because Odmar failed to present it to the BIA.   See\n\nSombah, 529 F.3d at 52 (rejecting same argument).\n\n\n\n          We dismiss the petition for review in part for lack of\n\njurisdiction and deny it in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f</pre>",
