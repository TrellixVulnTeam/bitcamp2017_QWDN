This is a habeas corpus case\n\ninvolving     a    state    prisoner   and    raising    Confrontation   Clause\n\nquestions.        The district court denied habeas relief; we find the\n\nquestion closer, but affirm the denial of relief because the state\n\ncourt decision affirming petitioner's murder conviction cannot be\n\nsaid to be an unreasonable application of clearly established\n\nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\n\n                                       I.\n\n              On July 1, 1983, a thirteen-year-old babysitter, Erica\n\nForestiere, was stabbed to death between 12:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.\nwhile her two young charges slept upstairs.              In 1984, a state court\njury convicted Theodore J. Trigones of the crime, finding him\nguilty   of    first       degree   murder.     He    was   sentenced   to   life\n\nimprisonment without parole.\n              Trigones's defense at trial was that the father of the\nchildren, Leo Trzcinski Jr., intending to kill his estranged wife,\n\nhad   mistakenly      killed    Forestiere,     the     babysitter.     Trigones\ntestified that, on the night of the murder, he went to the\nTrzcinski residence, where he encountered Trzcinski sitting near\nthe already dead babysitter.\n\n              Later that night, Trigones spoke with his stepfather,\n\nRoland Weed.         At a pretrial hearing on Trigones's motion to\n\nsuppress, Weed testified that Trigones, in the early morning hours\n\nfollowing the murder, had said \"I've done something terrible\" or \"I\n\ndid something terrible.\" At that same hearing, Weed also testified\n\nthat he understood Trigones to say \"I killed someone,\" and that\n\n                                        -2-\n\fTrigones said something like \"[t]here's a lot of hate in me\" and\n\n\"if it wasn't her it would have been somebody else.\"\n\n             The    only    purpose    of       this   pretrial    hearing     was   to\ndetermine whether Trigones's statements to Weed were voluntary and\n\nproducts of a rational intellect, given Trigones's contemporaneous\n\ndrug and alcohol ingestion.1          The trial court found the statements\nvoluntary and admissible.\n\n             Trigones was denied the opportunity to confront Weed at\n\ntrial.    An edited version of the transcript of Weed's suppression\n\nhearing testimony was read to the jury, over Trigones's objection,\n\nwhen Weed exercised his Fifth Amendment rights by refusing to\n\ntestify at trial.           Trigones sought interlocutory relief on the\n\nquestion of the admissibility of the Weed testimony and lost.\n             At trial, Trigones testified and pointed the finger at\n\nTrzcinski.     Trigones also attempted to counter Weed's statement.\n\nHe testified that what he had said to Weed was not that he,\nTrigones, had killed someone, but that it was Trzcinski who had\n\nkilled someone, although, in the conversation with Weed, Trigones\n\ndid not name Trzcinski as the killer.                  Trigones testified that he\n\nhad   told   Weed    that    there    is    a    lot   of   hate   in   him,   meaning\n\n      1\n          Although the federal constitutional prohibition against\ncoerced statements does not cover private citizens' conduct,\nColorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 166 (1986), \"[u]nder\nMassachusetts law, statements extracted by private citizens, even\nabsent governmental involvement, are subject to suppression under\nthe involuntariness standard,\" P.J. Liacos et al., Handbook of\nMassachusetts Evidence ยง 9.3, at 591 (7th ed. 1999) (citing\nCommonwealth v. Mahnke, 368 Mass. 662, 335 N.E.2d 660, 672 (1975)).\nWe understand Trigones's suppression hearing argument to have\nfocused more on whether his inculpatory statements were products of\na rational intellect.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fTrzcinski, and that, if it wasn't her (the babysitter), he, again\n\nmeaning Trzcinski, would have killed someone else.     Trzcinski also\n\ntestified and provided a version of the facts which, if credited,\nexculpated him.     The jury had the opportunity to hear from both\n\nTrigones and Trzcinski and to evaluate which witness to believe and\n\nwho was the killer.\n          Weed's testimony, read into evidence at trial, was an\n\nimportant element of the Commonwealth's case.      Trigones's alleged\n\nconfession, as recounted by Weed, was a significant part of the\n\nevidence tending to show that Trigones, rather than Trzcinski,\n\ncommitted the murder.    Indeed, as the federal district court that\n\nheard this habeas petition noted, \"Weed's testimony recounting\n\n[Trigones's] alleged confession was likely some of the most damning\nevidence.\"     Trigones v. Hall, 115 F. Supp. 2d 158, 171 (D. Mass.\n\n2000). The differences between Trigones's version of his statement\n\nto Weed and Weed's version of Trigones's statement make all the\ndifference, according to Trigones, because Trigones's version is an\n\nadmission only to being an accessory after the fact, whereas Weed's\nversion is an admission that Trigones committed the murder himself.\n\n             The jury convicted Trigones, and the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt of Massachusetts (\"SJC\") affirmed the jury's verdict on\n\nappeal, Commonwealth v. Trigones, 397 Mass. 633, 492 N.E.2d 1146\n\n(1986).   The SJC rejected Trigones's argument that, under the\n\nConfrontation Clause, the court should not have admitted Weed's\n\nstatement.    Id. at 1150.   It concluded that, under Ohio v. Roberts,\n\n448 U.S. 56 (1980), the testimony was admissible because Weed was\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\funavailable2   to   testify    at   trial   and   his   suppression   hearing\n\ntestimony bore adequate indicia of reliability.               Trigones, 492\n\nN.E.2d at 1149-50.\n          In 1991 Trigones filed a new trial motion based on\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.            The trial court initially\n\ndenied the motion without a hearing.          A single justice of the SJC\nthen denied Trigones's motion for leave to appeal the denial, but\n\nremanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing because the\n\njustice could not make the requisite ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel determination on the record as it existed at the time.            The\n\ntrial court held an evidentiary hearing at which Trigones's trial\n\ncounsel testified.      After this hearing, the trial court again\n\ndenied the motion and a single justice of the SJC then denied\nTrigones's motion for leave to appeal.              Trigones next filed an\n\nunsuccessful action in the SJC for a declaration that it was\n\nunconstitutional to deny him the right to appeal from the denial of\nthe new trial motion.         Trigones v. Attorney Gen., 420 Mass. 859,\n\n652 N.E.2d 893 (1995).\n\n          In   1997,   some     thirteen    years   after   his   conviction,\n\nTrigones sought federal habeas corpus relief.            He argues that the\n\nadmission into evidence of the transcript of Weed's testimony\n\ndenied him his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\n\nAmendment to cross-examine Weed at trial.               The district court\n\n     2\n          The parties do not dispute Weed's status as an\nunavailable declarant; Weed successfully asserted, on Fifth\nAmendment grounds, that he could not be compelled to testify,\nCommonwealth v. Weed, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 463, 459 N.E.2d 144, 148\n(1984).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fdenied the writ, holding 1) that it was bound by what it considered\n\nthe SJC's not-clearly-erroneous factual conclusion that Trigones\n\nabandoned his bias line of questioning at the suppression hearing\nand 2) that Trigones had failed to raise before the state courts\n\nhis argument that his counsel had lacked a similar motive to cross-\n\nexamine at the suppression hearing.   Trigones, 115 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n172-73.\n\n          Although Trigones's argument is far from frivolous, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial.    In light of the particular\n\ncircumstances of this case, we cannot say that the SJC's conclusion\n\nwas unreasonable.\n\n                               II.\n\n          Trigones makes a two-part argument3: (1) that admission\nat trial of the Weed transcript violated his Sixth Amendment right\n\nto confront Weed; and (2) that the SJC's decision that there was no\nSixth Amendment violation was either \"contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"   28 U.S.C.\nยง 2254(d)(1) (2000).\n          There is no credible argument that this case fits within\n\nthe \"contrary to\" framework of analysis.   See Williams v. Taylor,\n\n529 U.S. 362, 405-06 (2000); Hurtado v. Tucker, 245 F.3d 7, 15 (1st\n\n\n\n     3\n          Trigones   requested    an   expanded    certificate   of\nappealability to permit him to pursue claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel and claims that the state procedures for\npost-conviction petitions violate due process and equal protection.\nThis court denied the request.\n\n                               -6-\n\fCir.), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 282 (2001).     This is simply because\n\nTrigones has not shown that the SJC's decision \"arrives at a\n\nconclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a\nquestion of law.\"       Williams, 529 U.S. at 405; see also Bell v.\n\nCone, 122 S. Ct. 1843, 1850 (2002).      Nor has he shown that the SJC\n\n\"confront[ed] facts that are materially indistinguishable from a\nrelevant Supreme Court precedent and arrive[d] at a[n opposite]\n\nresult.\"    Williams, 529 U.S. at 405; see also Bell, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n1850.    Because the SJC adjudicated the constitutional claim on its\n\nmerits,    we   apply    the   deferential,   statutory   \"unreasonable\n\napplication\" test, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1),4 and do not review the\n\nSJC's constitutional conclusion de novo.        Cf. Fortini v. Murphy,\n\n257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating that \"we can hardly defer\nto the state court on an issue that the state court did not\n\naddress\"), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 1609 (2002). Even an incorrect\n\nstate court decision is not necessarily an \"unreasonable\" one for\nhabeas purposes.        Williams, 529 U.S. at 410 (stating that \"an\n\nunreasonable application of federal law is different from an\n\nincorrect application of federal law\"); see also Bell, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 1850.\n\n\n     4\n          Though the Commonwealth attempts to characterize portions\nof the SJC's determination as determinations of fact entitled to a\npresumption of correctness rebuttable only by clear and convincing\nevidence, ยง 2254(d)(2)'s heightened standard \"applies only to\ndeterminations of 'basic, primary, or historical facts.'\" Ouber v.\nGuarino, No. 01-2390, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 11885, at *22 (1st Cir.\nJune 17, 2002) (quoting Sanna v. DiPaolo, 265 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n2001)). \"Inferences, characterizations of the facts, and mixed\nfact/law conclusions are more appropriately analyzed under\"\nยง 2254(d)(1). Id.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f             The \"unreasonable application\" issue is measured against\n\nthe Sixth Amendment's requirements for the admission of prior\n\npreliminary        judicial   hearing    testimony      of    a   witness    who   is\nunavailable at trial.         The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause\n\nstates that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall\n\nenjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against\nhim.\"    U.S. Const. amend. VI.         It applies to the states through the\n\nFourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.                Pointer v. Texas, 380\n\nU.S. 400, 403 (1965).\n\n             The Confrontation Clause does not prohibit the admission\n\nof all hearsay evidence.           Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 813-14\n\n(1990); Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237 (1895).                 Although \"a\n\nliteral interpretation of the Confrontation Clause could bar the\nuse     of   any    out-of-court      statements       when   the   declarant      is\n\nunavailable,        [the   Supreme]     Court    has   rejected     that    view   as\n\n'unintended and too extreme.'\"             Bourjaily v. United States, 483\n\nU.S. 171, 182 (1987) (quoting Roberts, 448 U.S. at 63).                     \"[T]here\n\nhas     traditionally      been    an    exception      to    the   confrontation\n\nrequirement where a witness is unavailable and has given testimony\n\nat previous judicial proceedings against the same defendant which\n\nwas subject to cross-examination by that defendant.\"                       Barber v.\n\nPage, 390 U.S. 719, 722 (1968).                 That is because \"the right of\n\ncross-examination          initially      afforded       provides     substantial\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcompliance with the purposes behind the confrontation requirement.\"\n\nId.5\n\n                Where hearsay evidence is offered, and that evidence\nconsists        of    testimony       by    an     unavailable        declarant,     the\n\nConfrontation         Clause     requires     that       the   proponent     (here   the\n\nCommonwealth)         show     that   the    transcribed        testimony     from   the\npreliminary          judicial     hearing        bears     adequate     \"indicia     of\n\nreliability,\" sufficient to offset the lack of cross-examination.\n\nRoberts, 448 U.S. at 65-66 (quoting Dutton v. Evans, 400 U.S. 74,\n\n89     (1970)    (plurality));        see   also   Wright,      497   U.S.   at   815-25\n\n(applying the Roberts framework); 2 McCormick on Evidence ยง 252, at\n\n123-24 (J.W. Strong ed., 5th ed. 1999) (outlining the Confrontation\n\nClause's standard for admission of prior testimony).                           Adequate\nindicia are shown if the proffered testimony \"falls within a firmly\n\nrooted . . . exception\" to the hearsay prohibition or if the\n\nproponent of the evidence makes a showing of \"particularized\n\n\n        5\n          The issue of use of prior hearing testimony at trial of\na newly unavailable witness is not one-sided.      In the reported\ncaselaw under Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(1), it is frequently the\nprosecution which objects to the use of the testimony on the basis\nthat it lacked an opportunity or similar motive to cross-examine.\nE.g., United States v. Bartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 670-72 (1st Cir.\n1997) (holding suppression hearing statements inadmissible where\ngovernment's motive to cross-examine on the issue of voluntariness,\nat a suppression hearing in a case against the declarant, differed\nfrom the government's motive at a different trial, at which the\ndeclarant's testimony inculpated the defendant); United States v.\nOmar, 104 F.3d 519, 523-24 (1st Cir. 1997) (excluding from trial\nprior grand jury testimony of witness who died in the interim,\nwhere government lacked similar motive to cross-examine); United\nStates v. Wingate, 520 F.2d 309, 316 (2d Cir. 1975) (affirming the\nexclusion of evidence given at a suppression hearing on\nvoluntariness by a witness unavailable at trial, because of\ndifference in government's motive to cross-examine).\n\n                                            -9-\n\fguarantees of trustworthiness.\"    Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66.   If the\n\ntestimony is within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, then it has\n\nadequate indicia of reliability, without more.    White v. Illinois,\n502 U.S. 346, 355 n.8 (1992); Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66.\n\n          The federal and state hearsay rules, although they do not\n\ncontrol the constitutional inquiry, are instructive because they\noutline the contours of the firmly rooted hearsay exception at\n\nissue in this case.      We have previously concluded that Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 804(b)(1) codifies a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay\n\nprohibition, and so evidence admissible under Rule 804(b)(1) is,\n\n\"by definition, not vulnerable to a challenge based upon the\n\nConfrontation Clause.\"     United States v. McKeeve, 131 F.3d 1, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n          The Federal Rules provide that former testimony is not\n\nexcluded by the hearsay prohibition if the declarant is unavailable\n\nas a witness and \"the party against whom the testimony is now\noffered . . . had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the\n\ntestimony.\"   Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(1); see generally 2 McCormick on\n\nEvidence, supra, ยง 304, at 296-97 (stating that \"the issues in the\n\nfirst proceeding, and hence the purpose for which the testimony was\n\noffered, must have been such as to produce an adequate motive for\n\ntesting on cross-examination the credibility of the testimony\").\n\nThe Massachusetts rule is similar.     See Commonwealth v. Meech, 380\n\nMass. 490, 403 N.E.2d 1174, 1177-78 (1980); Trigones, 492 N.E.2d at\n\n1149-50; P.J. Liacos et al., Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence ยง\n\n8.7.1, at 489 (7th ed. 1999) (stating that \"[p]rior testimony . . .\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fis admissible if it was given under oath in a proceeding where the\n\nissues were substantially the same as in the current proceeding and\n\nthe party against whom it is offered had an opportunity and a\n\nsimilar motive to cross-examine the witness\").\n\n            Even   if   the   motives    to   develop   the   testimony    are\n\ndissimilar, that does not end the Confrontation Clause inquiry.\n\nAlthough a showing of sufficiently dissimilar motives removes the\n\ntestimony from the \"firmly rooted . . . exception\" analysis by\n\nplacing the testimony outside of Rule 804(b)(1) or any other firmly\n\nrooted hearsay exception, the testimony may still be analyzed for\n\"particularized     guarantees    of    trustworthiness\"      and,   if   such\n\nguarantees are found, admitted into evidence. Roberts, 448 U.S. at\n\n66; see also Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 530, 543 (1986) (stating\n\nthat hearsay evidence that does not fall within a firmly rooted\n\nexception   may    nonetheless   be     admitted    without   violating    the\nConfrontation Clause upon a showing that it has particularized\nguarantees of trustworthiness).         If the testimony is not within a\n\nfirmly   rooted     exception,     then       the   proponent    must     show\nparticularized     guarantees     of    trustworthiness       rendering    the\ncontested hearsay statement at least as reliable as a statement\n\nadmissible under a firmly rooted exception.             Wright, 497 U.S. at\n\n821 (citing Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66).6\n\n\n     6\n          A failure to meet Rule 804(b)(1)'s requirements does not\nnecessarily imply a failure to meet the Confrontation Clause's\nrequirements.

Green, 399 U.S. 149, 156 (1970)\n(stating that \"merely because evidence is admitted in violation of\na long-established hearsay rule does not lead to the automatic\nconclusion that confrontation rights have been denied\").\n\n                                   -11-\n\f              The SJC correctly articulated the federal constitutional\n\nstandards; the only issue, then, on federal habeas review is\n\nwhether the SJC unreasonably applied those standards.\n\n                                            III.\n\n              Trigones, in his habeas appeal, argues that the admission\n\nof the Weed transcript violated his Sixth Amendment rights because\n\nhe was unable to cross-examine Weed on two issues: (1) pro-\n\nCommonwealth bias and (2) Weed's ability to recollect accurately\n\nthe statements Weed recounted.                We address bias below, and find\n\nthat Trigones has failed to exhaust his argument pertaining to\nWeed's ability to recollect (except to the extent that he is\n\nalleging an inaccuracy in Weed's recollection due to bias, as\ndistinguished from inaccuracies resulting from other imperfections\nin   Weed's    ability       to   have     perceived       and   recalled    Trigones's\n\nstatement,     such     as    lack    of    memory    or    inability   to     hear   the\nstatements     at     the    time    they    were    allegedly     made).       The   SJC\nconcluded      that    Trigones's          \"sole    argument\"     was   that    \"Weed's\n\ntestimony lacked reliability because he was not fully cross-\nexamined on the possibility that he may have lied in order to\nprotect his wife and himself from prosecution as accessories to the\n\ncrime.\"     Trigones, 492 N.E.2d at 1150.                   After closely examining\nTrigones's arguments presented to the SJC, we agree that Trigones\ndid not make his \"inability to recollect\" argument before the SJC\n\n\n\n\n                                            -12-\n\fand hence, for reasons of lack of exhaustion, he may not raise it\n\nnow.       Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).7\n\n              Trigones argued before the SJC that the admission of the\nWeed transcript violated his Sixth Amendment rights because he was\n\nunable to cross-examine Weed on the bias issue.        He claimed that\n\nhis suppression motion sought to exclude Weed's testimony --\nrecounting Trigones's statements after the murder -- because Weed's\n\ntestimony also showed that Trigones was intoxicated on drugs and\n\nalcohol and could not have made a voluntary statement.           Bias,\n\nTrigones argued to the SJC, was not an issue at the suppression\n\nhearing, but would have been an issue at trial if Weed had\n\n\n       7\n          We note there was already substantial evidence in the\nsuppression hearing record, from Weed himself, that although he\ntestified as reliably as he could, his memory of that evening was\nimperfect.   For example, with respect to events earlier that\nevening, Weed admitted that his memory was weak: \"I don't remember,\nit's been too long,\" he said in response to one question; \"I don't\nremember\" or \"I really don't remember,\" he replied to about ten\nother questions.    He also said he was \"not really sure\" about\nanother statement he attributed to Trigones, and he had to guess at\nsome distances. Even with respect to the incriminatory statements,\nWeed offered two versions and then said he could not recall\nspecifics of other statements because he was in shock and that he\n\"was somewhere else at the time.\" He recalled that he was \"very\nangry\" and \"very emotional\" during that conversation. All of these\nstatements were ample support for Trigones to argue his point to\nthe jury, that a tired and upset Weed had misperceived what\nTrigones said to him. The point to be made -- that Weed's memory\nwas faulty -- could be argued to the jury from the basic facts.\nIndeed, in his closing argument, Trigones argued that the small\ndifference between his own version of his statement on the night of\nthe murder and Weed's version of that statement, as recorded at the\nsuppression hearing, could be explained by the process of Weed's\nlistening to, interpretation of, and \"regurgitation\" of Trigones's\nwords. We do not decide that, had Trigones properly presented his\nargument, all of this would have justified the state court\nrejecting his claim.    Rather, we present these facts from the\nrecord as context to show that the exhaustion requirement has not\nworked a substantial injustice.\n\n                                   -13-\n\ftestified. The asserted bias was in favor of the Commonwealth, and\n\nbrought about by the interests of Weed and his wife in avoiding\n\nbeing charged \"as accessories after the fact to murder.\" Trigones,\n492 N.E.2d at 1148.\n\n            The SJC addressed three issues: (1) \"the extent of the\n\nasserted    restriction        of   cross-examination,\"     (2)    the   \"Sixth\nAmendment principles governing the admission of Weed's recorded\n\ntestimony,\" and (3) \"whether . . . the constitutional standard was\n\nsatisfied.\"     Id.       It    concluded    there   was   no   constitutional\n\nviolation, id. at 1150, finding that Trigones had an opportunity to\n\ncross-examine Weed on bias, although, \"[p]erhaps for tactical\n\nreasons, defense counsel . . . acquiesced in the judge's suggestion\n\nof irrelevance and abandoned that line of questioning,\" id. at\n1149.   The SJC noted that there had been some limited examination\n\non bias at the suppression hearing.          Id. at 1148-49.      As to motive,\n\nthe SJC concluded that Trigones \"should have had the same motive to\ncross-examine Weed at the pretrial hearing on the relevant issue of\n\nbias . . . as he would have had if Weed had testified in person at\ntrial.\"    Id. at 1150.\n\n           These conclusions, if correct (or, for habeas purposes,\n\nat least reasonable), were sufficient under clearly established\n\nSupreme Court law for the SJC to reject Trigones's Confrontation\n\nClause argument.      The SJC, however, proceeded to address whether\n\nWeed's testimony should nonetheless be excluded because Trigones\n\ndid not adequately pursue his opportunity to cross-examine Weed on\n\nbias, and concluded that cross-examination on this point would not\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fhave made a difference.     Id.   We hold that the SJC's conclusions on\n\nopportunity and similar motive were not unreasonable and therefore\n\nconclude that Weed's testimony fell within a firmly rooted hearsay\nexception. Because it would not have been unreasonable for the SJC\n\nto stop the analysis there, given that the Supreme Court has not\n\nresolved   whether   an   unexercised     opportunity   is   sufficient   to\nsatisfy the Confrontation Clause's requirements, Roberts, 448 U.S.\n\nat 61-62, 70-71, we conclude without the need to address the SJC's\n\nholding that cross-examination on bias at trial would not have made\n\na difference.\n\nA. Opportunity to Cross-Examine Weed on Bias\n\n           The question whether Trigones had an opportunity to\n\npursue his bias line of questioning at the suppression hearing is\na very close one.    Even if, faced with the issue on direct appeal,\n\nwe would have resolved the issue differently, we cannot say that\n\nthe SJC's conclusion as to opportunity was unreasonable.\n           The question whether Trigones's counsel, regardless of\n\nhis motive, had a sufficient opportunity to cross-examine Weed at\n\nthe suppression hearing turns on one's interpretation of the\n\nfollowing exchange, which occurred at the suppression hearing,\n\nbetween counsel (Mr. Delinsky) and Weed, immediately followed by an\n\nexchange between counsel and the trial judge:\n\n           Q:             Were you told at that time that Mrs. Weed\n                          could not be prosecuted . . . for helping\n                          somebody after a crime was committed because\n                          she was a blood relative and a mother? Were\n                          you told that by the Police?\n\n           A:             No, I wasn't.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f              Q:              Were you told that by the District Attorney?\n\n              THE COURT:      Now wait, Mr. Delinsky, please.        Let's\n                              assume that all of this happened that you're\n                              asking him. What relevance does it have to\n                              this hearing?\n\n              DELINSKY:       I'll go on.\n              Q:              Now, --\n\n              THE COURT:      No, I mean tell me. What relevance                  does it\n                              have?   The only thing that I've                    got to\n                              decide in this is was his statement                 that of\n                              a rational intellect and I'm going                   to let\n                              the jury listen.\n\n              DELINSKY:       I agree.\n\n              THE COURT:      And what he told his wife and what his wife\n                              did or what he did has got absolutely\n                              nothing to do with this hearing. Now when\n                              we get in front of the jury as to what\n                              caused him to make this statement, that's a\n                              different story. I'm not going to stop you\n                              there.\n\n              DELINSKY:       Okay, thank you.\n              One view of this colloquy, not unreasonable, is that\n\ncounsel    had      an   opportunity       to    engage    in    the    bias     line   of\n\nquestioning, but chose not to pursue it.                     When the trial judge\n\nfirst     asked     counsel      \"[w]hat       relevance     does      [this     line   of\nquestioning] have to this hearing?\" counsel's only response was\n\n\"I'll go on,\" apparently meaning that he would proceed to a\n\ndifferent topic.         The judge, refusing to permit counsel to abandon\n\nhis line of questioning so easily, asked counsel a second time,\n\n\"[w]hat relevance does [this line of questioning] have?\" The judge\n\nexplained     his    own    reason      for     thinking   that     the     bias-related\n\nquestion was not relevant, stating \"[t]he only thing that I've got\n\nto   decide    in    this   is    was    his     statement      that   of    a   rational\n\n                                          -16-\n\fintellect.\"     At this point, counsel did not rebut the judge's\n\nsuggestion of lack of relevance, but instead stated \"I agree.\"\n\n            As the SJC concluded, Trigones, 492 N.E.2d at 1149,\nWeed's purported pro-Commonwealth bias was of course relevant at\n\nthe suppression hearing, even though the suppression hearing was\n\nlimited to the rational intellect question.   Pro-Commonwealth bias\nwould tend to diminish the credibility of any of Weed's statements\n\nfavoring the Commonwealth, and to enhance the force of any of\n\nWeed's statements favoring Trigones.   Upon prompting by the trial\n\njudge to describe the relevance of the bias line of questioning to\n\nthe suppression hearing, counsel could have pointed this out.\n\nInstead, counsel acquiesced.\n\n            We might have decided the opportunity issue differently\nwere it raised on direct appeal, given that counsel might plausibly\n\nbe understood to have acquiesced not in the face of an invitation\n\nto explain the relevance of his inquiry, but rather in light of the\ntrial judge's final conclusion that the line of questioning was not\n\nrelevant.     This alternative characterization of the colloquy is\n\nstrengthened by the trial judge's reassuring statement to counsel\n\nthat \"when we get in front of the jury as to what caused him to\n\nmake this statement, that's a different story.    I'm not going to\n\nstop you there.\"\n\n            But the SJC's conclusion that defense counsel, perhaps\n\nfor tactical reasons, acquiesced and abandoned the bias line of\n\nquestioning despite the trial judge's invitation to explain its\n\nrelevance is not \"unreasonable\" as that term has been interpreted\n\n\n                                -17-\n\funder ยง 2254.      Similarly, the conclusion that an opportunity,\n\nthough hardly used, is sufficient to qualify as an \"opportunity\" to\n\ncross-examine for purposes of the Confrontation Clause is not\nunreasonable.     See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 61-62, 70-71, 73 n.12;\n\nSiegfriedt v. Fair, 982 F.2d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing\n\nDelaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 20 (1985) (per curiam), and\nRoberts,   448   U.S.   at   73   n.12);   Fed.   R.   Evid.   804   advisory\n\ncommittee's note (stating \"no unfairness is apparent in requiring\n\n[a party] to accept his own prior . . . decision not to cross-\n\nexamine\").\n\nB. Similarity of Motive to Cross-Examine Weed on Bias\n\n           In this case, the similarity of motive question is a\n\ncomplicated one.        Our analysis differs substantially from the\nSJC's, but we again conclude that the SJC's position was not\n\nunreasonable.8\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          The Commonwealth defends the SJC's \"similarity of motive\"\nconclusion as being a factual finding to which we must give\ndeference. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(2). It may be that a court's\ndetermination as to similarity of motive is treated as a factual\ndetermination. See United States v. Salerno, 505 U.S. 317, 326\n(1992) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (stating that Rule 804(b)(1)'s\n\"similar-motive inquiry . . . is inherently a factual inquiry\");\nBattle v. Mem'l Hosp. at Gulfport, 228 F.3d 544, 552 (5th Cir.\n2000) (same in a civil case). If so, it is a factual determination\nmade after comparing the \"similarity of the underlying issues\" and\nthe context of the prior questioning. Salerno, 505 U.S. at 326.\nWe reiterate, however, that \"[i]nferences, characterizations of the\nfacts, and mixed fact/law conclusions are more appropriately\nanalyzed under\" ยง 2254(d)(1). Ouber, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 11885,\nat *22. We need not determine, on these facts, whether the SJC's\nsimilarity of motive conclusion was one of law or one of fact\nbecause, either way, it was not unreasonable.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f          At first cut, there appears to be a substantial argument\n\nthat Trigones's   motive   to   cross-examine   Weed   on   bias   at   the\n\nsuppression hearing was significantly different from the motive he\nwould have had at trial. Weed's suppression hearing testimony that\n\nTrigones was incoherent and irrational tended to favor Trigones,\n\nwho was then trying to prove that his confession was not the\nproduct of a rational intellect and, for that reason, should be\n\nsuppressed.   At the suppression hearing, the truth of Weed's\n\nrendition of Trigones's statement was not at issue. The only issue\n\nwas whether Trigones's alcohol and drug intoxication rendered\n\nwhatever statements he made involuntary.    The limited scope of the\n\nsuppression hearing is evident from the text of Trigones's original\n\nmotion to suppress, the trial judge's statements at the suppression\nhearing, and the trial judge's ruling on the motion to suppress,\n\nall of which were limited to the issue of voluntariness.\n\n          At trial, in contrast, the truth of Weed's testimony\nabout the content of the inculpatory statements was certainly at\n\nissue and, when credited, that testimony hurt Trigones.        It formed\n\nan important part of the evidence tending to implicate Trigones,\n\nrather than Trzcinski, in the murder.      At trial, one could argue\n\nthat Trigones had an incentive to attack Weed's credibility and\n\nthereby undermine his harmful testimony, whereas at the suppression\n\nhearing Trigones had an incentive to defend Weed's credibility and\n\nthereby bolster his helpful testimony.     Such differences can make\n\nfor dissimilar motives.    Cf. United States v. Bartelho, 129 F.3d\n\n663, 672 (1st Cir. 1997) (concluding that similar motive to cross-\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fexamine did not exist when, \"[a]lthough [the witness's] credibility\n\nwas    generally   at   issue   in   each   proceeding,   .   .   .   the   more\n\nparticular points [counsel] sought to make were quite different\").\n             But the SJC's contrary position, that Trigones \"should\n\nhave had the same motive to cross-examine Weed at the pretrial\n\nhearing on the relevant issue of bias in favor of the Commonwealth\nas he would have had if Weed had testified in person at trial,\"\n\nTrigones, 492 N.E.2d at 1150, is not unreasonable.                At both the\n\nsuppression hearing and at trial Trigones had an incentive to paint\n\nWeed    as   biased     in   favor   of     the   Commonwealth.        Such    a\n\ncharacterization would tend to diminish the credibility of any of\n\nWeed's statements favoring the Commonwealth. It would also tend to\n\nenhance the force of any of Weed's statements favoring Trigones\nbecause any such statements, made despite pressure to testify\n\nunfavorably to Trigones, could be characterized as all the more\n\nbelievable in light of Weed's incentive to testify contrary to\nTrigones's interests.        At the suppression hearing, showing Weed's\n\npro-Commonwealth bias could only have helped Trigones, by showing\n\nthat Weed was willing to describe Trigones as unable to make\n\nrational statements -- testimony helping Trigones -- despite his\n\nincentive to provide testimony favoring the Commonwealth, and\n\nperhaps by casting doubt on whether Trigones even made the exact\n\nstatements that Weed recounted.\n\n             For these reasons, it is not unreasonable to conclude\n\nthat Trigones had a motive at the suppression hearing to cross-\n\nexamine Weed on the issue of pro-Commonwealth bias similar to the\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fmotive he would have had at trial.         True, the stakes at trial would\n\nhave been higher, but the stakes are almost always higher then (or\n\nat least different), and it is clear that in many cases the motive\nat a preliminary hearing is sufficiently similar to the motive at\n\ntrial to bring the evidence within the Confrontation Clause's\n\nrequirements, e.g., Roberts, 448 U.S. at 72-73; California v.\n\nGreen, 399 U.S. 149, 165 (1970).             See generally 5 Weinstein's\n\nFederal Evidence ยง 804.04[5] (J.M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2002)\n\n(stating that \"similar motive does not mean identical motive\"). In\n\naddition, the stakes were also high at the suppression hearing,\n\nwhere, if Trigones had successfully asserted his involuntariness\n\nargument, the inculpatory statements could have been kept out\n\naltogether. Trigones could only have been helped by showing Weed's\nbias against him.\n\n           The more simplistic characterization -- that Trigones had\n\na motive to paint Weed as truthful at the suppression hearing, but\nas a liar at trial -- is not necessarily the best characterization\n\nbecause   it   fails   adequately    to    account   for   the   nuances   of\n\nTrigones's bias argument.    Trigones's argument was never that Weed\n\nwas a liar.    Rather, his argument was that the import of Weed's\n\ntestimony turned on the small details, those small details were\n\nmatters of recollection, and Weed's recollection could easily have\n\nbeen tilted against him as a result of Weed's desire to please the\n\nCommonwealth and thereby avoid prosecution of himself or his wife\n\nas an accessory after the fact to murder.         Trigones had a motive to\n\ncross-examine Weed on this subtle pro-Commonwealth bias at the\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fsuppression hearing and would have had a similar motive to cross-\n\nexamine on this point at trial.                    It was not unreasonable to\n\nconclude that he had a motive to cross-examine on this subject\nmatter at the suppression hearing similar to the motive he would\n\nhave had at trial.\n\n           In      light   of    this   conclusion,     we    hold   that   the   SJC\nreasonably concluded that Weed's testimony was admissible under the\n\nfirmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule for prior recorded\n\ntestimony.         This finding alone suffices to reject Trigones's\n\nConfrontation Clause challenge and we need not address the SJC's\n\nresolution of whether Trigones's pursuit of the bias point would\n\nhave made a difference.\n\nIV.\n\n             The    Supreme     Court's    Confrontation      Clause   cases      have\n\nsought to accommodate competing interests. Those interests include\nboth   allowing      the   prosecution        to   present    material,     reliable\nevidence and preserving the accuracy of the judicial process\n\nthrough the defendant's exercise of his rights to confront and\ncross-examine adverse witnesses.              The SJC's conclusion that there\nwas no Confrontation Clause violation is within the range of\n\nreasonable    judgments         which   may   be   reached.     The    state   court\ndecision is not an unreasonable application of clearly established\nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\n\n             We affirm the district court order denying the writ of\n\nhabeas corpus.\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\f",

This is a habeas corpus case\n\ninvolving     a    state    prisoner   and    raising    Confrontation   Clause\n\nquestions.        The district court denied habeas relief; we find the\n\nquestion closer, but affirm the denial of relief because the state\n\ncourt decision affirming petitioner's murder conviction cannot be\n\nsaid to be an unreasonable application of clearly established\n\nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\n\n                                       I.\n\n              On July 1, 1983, a thirteen-year-old babysitter, Erica\n\nForestiere, was stabbed to death between 12:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.\nwhile her two young charges slept upstairs.              In 1984, a state court\njury convicted Theodore J. Trigones of the crime, finding him\nguilty   of    first       degree   murder.     He    was   sentenced   to   life\n\nimprisonment without parole.\n              Trigones's defense at trial was that the father of the\nchildren, Leo Trzcinski Jr., intending to kill his estranged wife,\n\nhad   mistakenly      killed    Forestiere,     the     babysitter.     Trigones\ntestified that, on the night of the murder, he went to the\nTrzcinski residence, where he encountered Trzcinski sitting near\nthe already dead babysitter.\n\n              Later that night, Trigones spoke with his stepfather,\n\nRoland Weed.         At a pretrial hearing on Trigones's motion to\n\nsuppress, Weed testified that Trigones, in the early morning hours\n\nfollowing the murder, had said \"I've done something terrible\" or \"I\n\ndid something terrible.\" At that same hearing, Weed also testified\n\nthat he understood Trigones to say \"I killed someone,\" and that\n\n                                        -2-\n\fTrigones said something like \"[t]here's a lot of hate in me\" and\n\n\"if it wasn't her it would have been somebody else.\"\n\n             The    only    purpose    of       this   pretrial    hearing     was   to\ndetermine whether Trigones's statements to Weed were voluntary and\n\nproducts of a rational intellect, given Trigones's contemporaneous\n\ndrug and alcohol ingestion.1          The trial court found the statements\nvoluntary and admissible.\n\n             Trigones was denied the opportunity to confront Weed at\n\ntrial.    An edited version of the transcript of Weed's suppression\n\nhearing testimony was read to the jury, over Trigones's objection,\n\nwhen Weed exercised his Fifth Amendment rights by refusing to\n\ntestify at trial.           Trigones sought interlocutory relief on the\n\nquestion of the admissibility of the Weed testimony and lost.\n             At trial, Trigones testified and pointed the finger at\n\nTrzcinski.     Trigones also attempted to counter Weed's statement.\n\nHe testified that what he had said to Weed was not that he,\nTrigones, had killed someone, but that it was Trzcinski who had\n\nkilled someone, although, in the conversation with Weed, Trigones\n\ndid not name Trzcinski as the killer.                  Trigones testified that he\n\nhad   told   Weed    that    there    is    a    lot   of   hate   in   him,   meaning\n\n      1\n          Although the federal constitutional prohibition against\ncoerced statements does not cover private citizens' conduct,\nColorado v.

Trzcinski also\n\ntestified and provided a version of the facts which, if credited,\nexculpated him.     The jury had the opportunity to hear from both\n\nTrigones and Trzcinski and to evaluate which witness to believe and\n\nwho was the killer.\n          Weed's testimony, read into evidence at trial, was an\n\nimportant element of the Commonwealth's case.      Trigones's alleged\n\nconfession, as recounted by Weed, was a significant part of the\n\nevidence tending to show that Trigones, rather than Trzcinski,\n\ncommitted the murder.

The trial court initially\n\ndenied the motion without a hearing.          A single justice of the SJC\nthen denied Trigones's motion for leave to appeal the denial, but\n\nremanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing because the\n\njustice could not make the requisite ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel determination on the record as it existed at the time.

We address bias below, and find\n\nthat Trigones has failed to exhaust his argument pertaining to\nWeed's ability to recollect (except to the extent that he is\n\nalleging an inaccuracy in Weed's recollection due to bias, as\ndistinguished from inaccuracies resulting from other imperfections\nin   Weed's    ability       to   have     perceived       and   recalled    Trigones's\n\nstatement,     such     as    lack    of    memory    or    inability   to     hear   the\nstatements     at     the    time    they    were    allegedly     made).

He claimed that\n\nhis suppression motion sought to exclude Weed's testimony --\nrecounting Trigones's statements after the murder -- because Weed's\n\ntestimony also showed that Trigones was intoxicated on drugs and\n\nalcohol and could not have made a voluntary statement.           Bias,\n\nTrigones argued to the SJC, was not an issue at the suppression\n\nhearing, but would have been an issue at trial if Weed had\n\n\n       7\n          We note there was already substantial evidence in the\nsuppression hearing record, from Weed himself, that although he\ntestified as reliably as he could, his memory of that evening was\nimperfect.   For example, with respect to events earlier that\nevening, Weed admitted that his memory was weak: \"I don't remember,\nit's been too long,\" he said in response to one question; \"I don't\nremember\" or \"I really don't remember,\" he replied to about ten\nother questions.    He also said he was \"not really sure\" about\nanother statement he attributed to Trigones, and he had to guess at\nsome distances. Even with respect to the incriminatory statements,\nWeed offered two versions and then said he could not recall\nspecifics of other statements because he was in shock and that he\n\"was somewhere else at the time.\" He recalled that he was \"very\nangry\" and \"very emotional\" during that conversation. All of these\nstatements were ample support for Trigones to argue his point to\nthe jury, that a tired and upset Weed had misperceived what\nTrigones said to him. The point to be made -- that Weed's memory\nwas faulty -- could be argued to the jury from the basic facts.\nIndeed, in his closing argument, Trigones argued that the small\ndifference between his own version of his statement on the night of\nthe murder and Weed's version of that statement, as recorded at the\nsuppression hearing, could be explained by the process of Weed's\nlistening to, interpretation of, and \"regurgitation\" of Trigones's\nwords. We do not decide that, had Trigones properly presented his\nargument, all of this would have justified the state court\nrejecting his claim.    Rather, we present these facts from the\nrecord as context to show that the exhaustion requirement has not\nworked a substantial injustice.\n\n                                   -13-\n\ftestified. The asserted bias was in favor of the Commonwealth, and\n\nbrought about by the interests of Weed and his wife in avoiding\n\nbeing charged \"as accessories after the fact to murder.\" Trigones,\n492 N.E.2d at 1148.\n\n            The SJC addressed three issues: (1) \"the extent of the\n\nasserted    restriction        of   cross-examination,\"     (2)    the   \"Sixth\nAmendment principles governing the admission of Weed's recorded\n\ntestimony,\" and (3) \"whether . . . the constitutional standard was\n\nsatisfied.\"     Id.       It    concluded    there   was   no   constitutional\n\nviolation, id. at 1150, finding that Trigones had an opportunity to\n\ncross-examine Weed on bias, although, \"[p]erhaps for tactical\n\nreasons, defense counsel . . . acquiesced in the judge's suggestion\n\nof irrelevance and abandoned that line of questioning,\" id. at\n1149.   The SJC noted that there had been some limited examination\n\non bias at the suppression hearing.          Id. at 1148-49.      As to motive,\n\nthe SJC concluded that Trigones \"should have had the same motive to\ncross-examine Weed at the pretrial hearing on the relevant issue of\n\nbias . . . as he would have had if Weed had testified in person at\ntrial.\"    Id. at 1150.\n\n           These conclusions, if correct (or, for habeas purposes,\n\nat least reasonable), were sufficient under clearly established\n\nSupreme Court law for the SJC to reject Trigones's Confrontation\n\nClause argument.      The SJC, however, proceeded to address whether\n\nWeed's testimony should nonetheless be excluded because Trigones\n\ndid not adequately pursue his opportunity to cross-examine Weed on\n\nbias, and concluded that cross-examination on this point would not\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fhave made a difference.     Id.   We hold that the SJC's conclusions on\n\nopportunity and similar motive were not unreasonable and therefore\n\nconclude that Weed's testimony fell within a firmly rooted hearsay\nexception. Because it would not have been unreasonable for the SJC\n\nto stop the analysis there, given that the Supreme Court has not\n\nresolved   whether   an   unexercised     opportunity   is   sufficient   to\nsatisfy the Confrontation Clause's requirements, Roberts, 448 U.S.\n\nat 61-62, 70-71, we conclude without the need to address the SJC's\n\nholding that cross-examination on bias at trial would not have made\n\na difference.\n\nA. Opportunity to Cross-Examine Weed on Bias\n\n           The question whether Trigones had an opportunity to\n\npursue his bias line of questioning at the suppression hearing is\na very close one.    Even if, faced with the issue on direct appeal,\n\nwe would have resolved the issue differently, we cannot say that\n\nthe SJC's conclusion as to opportunity was unreasonable.\n           The question whether Trigones's counsel, regardless of\n\nhis motive, had a sufficient opportunity to cross-examine Weed at\n\nthe suppression hearing turns on one's interpretation of the\n\nfollowing exchange, which occurred at the suppression hearing,\n\nbetween counsel (Mr. Delinsky) and Weed, immediately followed by an\n\nexchange between counsel and the trial judge:\n\n           Q:             Were you told at that time that Mrs. Weed\n                          could not be prosecuted . . . for helping\n                          somebody after a crime was committed because\n                          she was a blood relative and a mother? Were\n                          you told that by the Police?\n\n           A:             No, I wasn't.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f              Q:              Were you told that by the District Attorney?\n\n              THE COURT:      Now wait, Mr. Delinsky, please.        Let's\n                              assume that all of this happened that you're\n                              asking him. What relevance does it have to\n                              this hearing?\n\n              DELINSKY:       I'll go on.\n              Q:              Now, --\n\n              THE COURT:      No, I mean tell me. What relevance                  does it\n                              have?   The only thing that I've                    got to\n                              decide in this is was his statement                 that of\n                              a rational intellect and I'm going                   to let\n                              the jury listen.\n\n              DELINSKY:       I agree.\n\n              THE COURT:      And what he told his wife and what his wife\n                              did or what he did has got absolutely\n                              nothing to do with this hearing. Now when\n                              we get in front of the jury as to what\n                              caused him to make this statement, that's a\n                              different story. I'm not going to stop you\n                              there.\n\n              DELINSKY:       Okay, thank you.\n              One view of this colloquy, not unreasonable, is that\n\ncounsel    had      an   opportunity       to    engage    in    the    bias     line   of\n\nquestioning, but chose not to pursue it.                     When the trial judge\n\nfirst     asked     counsel      \"[w]hat       relevance     does      [this     line   of\nquestioning] have to this hearing?\" counsel's only response was\n\n\"I'll go on,\" apparently meaning that he would proceed to a\n\ndifferent topic.         The judge, refusing to permit counsel to abandon\n\nhis line of questioning so easily, asked counsel a second time,\n\n\"[w]hat relevance does [this line of questioning] have?\" The judge\n\nexplained     his    own    reason      for     thinking   that     the     bias-related\n\nquestion was not relevant, stating \"[t]he only thing that I've got\n\nto   decide    in    this   is    was    his     statement      that   of    a   rational\n\n                                          -16-\n\fintellect.\"     At this point, counsel did not rebut the judge's\n\nsuggestion of lack of relevance, but instead stated \"I agree.\"\n\n            As the SJC concluded, Trigones, 492 N.E.2d at 1149,\nWeed's purported pro-Commonwealth bias was of course relevant at\n\nthe suppression hearing, even though the suppression hearing was\n\nlimited to the rational intellect question.   Pro-Commonwealth bias\nwould tend to diminish the credibility of any of Weed's statements\n\nfavoring the Commonwealth, and to enhance the force of any of\n\nWeed's statements favoring Trigones.   Upon prompting by the trial\n\njudge to describe the relevance of the bias line of questioning to\n\nthe suppression hearing, counsel could have pointed this out.\n\nInstead, counsel acquiesced.\n\n            We might have decided the opportunity issue differently\nwere it raised on direct appeal, given that counsel might plausibly\n\nbe understood to have acquiesced not in the face of an invitation\n\nto explain the relevance of his inquiry, but rather in light of the\ntrial judge's final conclusion that the line of questioning was not\n\nrelevant.     This alternative characterization of the colloquy is\n\nstrengthened by the trial judge's reassuring statement to counsel\n\nthat \"when we get in front of the jury as to what caused him to\n\nmake this statement, that's a different story.    I'm not going to\n\nstop you there.\"\n\n            But the SJC's conclusion that defense counsel, perhaps\n\nfor tactical reasons, acquiesced and abandoned the bias line of\n\nquestioning despite the trial judge's invitation to explain its\n\nrelevance is not \"unreasonable\" as that term has been interpreted\n\n\n                                -17-\n\funder ยง 2254.      Similarly, the conclusion that an opportunity,\n\nthough hardly used, is sufficient to qualify as an \"opportunity\" to\n\ncross-examine for purposes of the Confrontation Clause is not\nunreasonable.

We need not determine, on these facts, whether the SJC's\nsimilarity of motive conclusion was one of law or one of fact\nbecause, either way, it was not unreasonable.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f          At first cut, there appears to be a substantial argument\n\nthat Trigones's   motive   to   cross-examine   Weed   on   bias   at   the\n\nsuppression hearing was significantly different from the motive he\nwould have had at trial. Weed's suppression hearing testimony that\n\nTrigones was incoherent and irrational tended to favor Trigones,\n\nwho was then trying to prove that his confession was not the\nproduct of a rational intellect and, for that reason, should be\n\nsuppressed.   At the suppression hearing, the truth of Weed's\n\nrendition of Trigones's statement was not at issue. The only issue\n\nwas whether Trigones's alcohol and drug intoxication rendered\n\nwhatever statements he made involuntary.    The limited scope of the\n\nsuppression hearing is evident from the text of Trigones's original\n\nmotion to suppress, the trial judge's statements at the suppression\nhearing, and the trial judge's ruling on the motion to suppress,\n\nall of which were limited to the issue of voluntariness.\n\n          At trial, in contrast, the truth of Weed's testimony\nabout the content of the inculpatory statements was certainly at\n\nissue and, when credited, that testimony hurt Trigones.        It formed\n\nan important part of the evidence tending to implicate Trigones,\n\nrather than Trzcinski, in the murder.      At trial, one could argue\n\nthat Trigones had an incentive to attack Weed's credibility and\n\nthereby undermine his harmful testimony, whereas at the suppression\n\nhearing Trigones had an incentive to defend Weed's credibility and\n\nthereby bolster his helpful testimony.     Such differences can make\n\nfor dissimilar motives.    Cf. United States v. Bartelho, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197664\"><a href=\"/opinion/197664/united-states-v-bartelho/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672 (1st Cir. 1997) (concluding that similar motive to cross-\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fexamine did not exist when, \"[a]lthough [the witness's] credibility\n\nwas    generally   at   issue   in   each   proceeding,   .   .   .   the   more\n\nparticular points [counsel] sought to make were quite different\").\n             But the SJC's contrary position, that Trigones \"should\n\nhave had the same motive to cross-examine Weed at the pretrial\n\nhearing on the relevant issue of bias in favor of the Commonwealth\nas he would have had if Weed had testified in person at trial,\"\n\nTrigones, 492 N.E.2d at 1150, is not unreasonable.                At both the\n\nsuppression hearing and at trial Trigones had an incentive to paint\n\nWeed    as   biased     in   favor   of     the   Commonwealth.        Such    a\n\ncharacterization would tend to diminish the credibility of any of\n\nWeed's statements favoring the Commonwealth. It would also tend to\n\nenhance the force of any of Weed's statements favoring Trigones\nbecause any such statements, made despite pressure to testify\n\nunfavorably to Trigones, could be characterized as all the more\n\nbelievable in light of Weed's incentive to testify contrary to\nTrigones's interests.        At the suppression hearing, showing Weed's\n\npro-Commonwealth bias could only have helped Trigones, by showing\n\nthat Weed was willing to describe Trigones as unable to make\n\nrational statements -- testimony helping Trigones -- despite his\n\nincentive to provide testimony favoring the Commonwealth, and\n\nperhaps by casting doubt on whether Trigones even made the exact\n\nstatements that Weed recounted.\n\n             For these reasons, it is not unreasonable to conclude\n\nthat Trigones had a motive at the suppression hearing to cross-\n\nexamine Weed on the issue of pro-Commonwealth bias similar to the\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fmotive he would have had at trial.         True, the stakes at trial would\n\nhave been higher, but the stakes are almost always higher then (or\n\nat least different), and it is clear that in many cases the motive\nat a preliminary hearing is sufficiently similar to the motive at\n\ntrial to bring the evidence within the Confrontation Clause's\n\nrequirements, e.g., Roberts, 448 U.S. at 72-73; California v.\n\nGreen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108189\"><a href=\"/opinion/108189/california-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165 (1970).             See generally 5 Weinstein's\n\nFederal Evidence ยง 804.04[5] (J.M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2002)\n\n(stating that \"similar motive does not mean identical motive\"). In\n\naddition, the stakes were also high at the suppression hearing,\n\nwhere, if Trigones had successfully asserted his involuntariness\n\nargument, the inculpatory statements could have been kept out\n\naltogether. Trigones could only have been helped by showing Weed's\nbias against him.\n\n           The more simplistic characterization -- that Trigones had\n\na motive to paint Weed as truthful at the suppression hearing, but\nas a liar at trial -- is not necessarily the best characterization\n\nbecause   it   fails   adequately    to    account   for   the   nuances   of\n\nTrigones's bias argument.    Trigones's argument was never that Weed\n\nwas a liar.    Rather, his argument was that the import of Weed's\n\ntestimony turned on the small details, those small details were\n\nmatters of recollection, and Weed's recollection could easily have\n\nbeen tilted against him as a result of Weed's desire to please the\n\nCommonwealth and thereby avoid prosecution of himself or his wife\n\nas an accessory after the fact to murder.         Trigones had a motive to\n\ncross-examine Weed on this subtle pro-Commonwealth bias at the\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fsuppression hearing and would have had a similar motive to cross-\n\nexamine on this point at trial.                    It was not unreasonable to\n\nconclude that he had a motive to cross-examine on this subject\nmatter at the suppression hearing similar to the motive he would\n\nhave had at trial.\n\n           In      light   of    this   conclusion,     we    hold   that   the   SJC\nreasonably concluded that Weed's testimony was admissible under the\n\nfirmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule for prior recorded\n\ntestimony.         This finding alone suffices to reject Trigones's\n\nConfrontation Clause challenge and we need not address the SJC's\n\nresolution of whether Trigones's pursuit of the bias point would\n\nhave made a difference.\n\nIV.\n\n             The    Supreme     Court's    Confrontation      Clause   cases      have\n\nsought to accommodate competing interests. Those interests include\nboth   allowing      the   prosecution        to   present    material,     reliable\nevidence and preserving the accuracy of the judicial process\n\nthrough the defendant's exercise of his rights to confront and\ncross-examine adverse witnesses.              The SJC's conclusion that there\nwas no Confrontation Clause violation is within the range of\n\nreasonable    judgments         which   may   be   reached.     The    state   court\ndecision is not an unreasonable application of clearly established\nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\n\n             We affirm the district court order denying the writ of\n\nhabeas corpus.\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\f</pre>",
