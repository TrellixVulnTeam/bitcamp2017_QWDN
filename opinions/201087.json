Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                              June 28, 2004\n\f            Per Curiam.    We consolidated the instant appeal for\n\nargument with, inter alia, the appeal in United States v. Salinas,\n\nNo. 03-2376.    The consolidated appeals were argued on May 5, 2004.\n\nWe decided Salinas and issued the opinion therein earlier today.\n\nSee United States v. Salinas, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            There is a threshold issue in this case, not presented in\n\nSalinas.    Arteaga made a pretrial motion to dismiss for improper\n\nvenue, but the district court denied it \"without prejudice,\" and\n\nthe case went to trial.    Arteaga did not thereafter renew her venue\n\nchallenge and the jury convicted her of passport fraud.\n\n            This   chronology    presents   a   theoretical   question   of\n\nwaiver.     We say \"theoretical\" because the government explicitly\n\nwaives any such objection, urging us instead \"to address the venue\n\nissue on the merits.\"           Appellee's Br. at 9.      Doing so, the\n\ngovernment adds, \"is in the best interests of justice and judicial\n\neconomy.\"    Id. at 10.\n\n            We accept the parties' joint exhortation.           Here, the\n\nfacts essential to a venue determination are known in advance and\n\nare undisputed, so we see no harm in treating Arteaga's challenge\n\nto venue as properly raised by a pretrial motion.        See Fed. R. Crim\n\nP. 12(b)(2) (explaining that a \"party may raise by pretrial motion\n\nany defense, objection, or request that the court can determine\n\nwithout a trial of the general issue\"); see also United States v.\n\nCarey, 152 F. Supp. 2d 415, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (concluding that\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwhen the government has provided the court with a full proffer of\n\nfacts it    intends to introduce to establish venue, the court may\n\ndecide whether venue is proper prior to trial pursuant to a motion\n\nmade under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12); Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(d) (requiring\n\ncourt to decide \"every pretrial motion before trial unless it finds\n\ngood cause to defer a ruling\"); see generally 1A Charles Alan\n\nWright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure ยง 191 (3d ed. 1999).       Under the circumstances, we regard\n\nthe issue of venue as adequately preserved.\n\n            Once this threshold point is resolved, we need go no\n\nfurther.    Our Salinas opinion is fully dispositive of the merits\n\nquestion raised in Arteaga's appeal. Consequently, for the reasons\n\nset forth    in   Salinas,   we   reverse   the   district    court's   venue\n\ndetermination,     vacate    Arteaga's    conviction,   and    remand    with\n\ninstructions to dismiss the indictment without prejudice for lack\n\nof venue.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f",
