After carefully considering the briefs\n\nand record on appeal, we affirm substantially for the reasons\n\nstated by the district court.\n\n            The appellant’s main argument on appeal is that the\n\ngovernment failed to show that it conducted a reasonable search\n\nin response to his February 28, 2000 request.                   5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(a).
