Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bryan K. Clauson on brief for appellant Felix Ramone Martínez.\n     Adi Goldstein, Assistant United States Attorney, Kenneth P.\nMadden, Assistant United States Attorney, Craig N. Moore, United\nStates Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            February 25, 2004\n\f             Per Curiam.   Felix R. Martínez pled guilty to conspiring\n\nto distribute and possess with intent to distribute the drug\n\n\"ecstasy,\" and with distributing ecstasy on several occasions.       He\n\nappeals from his sentence on the ground that the sentencing court\n\nerred in failing to grant him a two-level decrease in his base\n\noffense level under the \"safety valve\" provisions of the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(6) and\n\n5C1.2(a).1     Specifically, Martínez contests the district court's\n\ndetermination that he had not satisfied the fifth requirement under\n\n§   5C1.2(a),    by   \"truthfully   provid[ing]   the   government   all\n\ninformation and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense\n\nor offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a\n\ncommon scheme or plan.\"Id. § 5C1.2(a)(5).\n\n     Martínez' initial argument is that the sentencing court erred\n\nin allowing the government to object to the two-level \"safety\n\nvalve\" reduction conditionally proposed in the pre-sentence report\n\n(\"PSR\").     Martínez contends that the government's position that he\n\nhad not satisfied the fifth requirement under § 5C1.2(a) amounted\n\nto an untimely objection to the PSR, beyond the fourteen-day period\n\nestablished under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(f)(1).\n\n     The government's opposition to a two-level reduction under §\n\n\n\n     1\n       § 2D1.1(b)(6) provides that a two-level reduction in the\nbase offense level for a drug offense shall be awarded if the\ndefendant meets the \"safety valve\" criteria set forth in §\n5C1.2(a)(1)-(5).\n\n                                    -2-\n\f5C1.2 did not constitute an objection to the PSR.                  The PSR had\n\nrecommended     the    adjustment   only    if   Martínez    complied    with   §\n\n5C1.2(5).       Thus,     the    government's      recommendation     that    the\n\nadjustment not be granted because Martínez had failed to comply\n\nwith § 5C1.2(5) was entirely consistent with the PSR.                 Therefore,\n\nthe recommendation did not run afoul of the 14-day period for\n\nfiling objections to the PSR under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(f)(1).                 The\n\nsentencing court was concerned about the \"safety valve\" interview\n\noccurring such a short time before the scheduled sentencing hearing\n\non   August    22,    2002.     However,    that   concern   was    allayed     by\n\npostponing the sentencing until September 3, 2002.                 There was no\n\nerror in the sentencing court's consideration of the government's\n\nopposition to the \"safety valve\" adjustment.\n\n      The second and third arguments advanced by Martínez are that\n\nthe sentencing court \"failed to make an independent determination\n\nbased   upon   reliable       information   as   to   whether   the    defendant\n\nqualified for the safety valve reduction,\" in violation of his due\n\nprocess rights, and erred in determining that he had not complied\n\nwith § 5C1.2(5).        \"The defendant bears the burden of showing that\n\nhe has made full disclosure (and, thus, that he is entitled to the\n\nbenefit of the safety valve).         This burden includes the obligation\n\nof proving to the court that he has provided truthful and complete\n\ninformation.\"        United States v. Marquez, 280 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n2002). We \"review for clear error the . . . factual determinations\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\funderlying the question whether a defendant is entitled to such\n\nrelief.\" United States v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     Martínez faults the sentencing court for determining that he\n\nhad not qualified for the \"safety valve\" reduction without either\n\nquestioning the probation officer about Martínez' apparent non-\n\ncompliance with § 5C1.2(5) or hearing testimony from the DEA agent\n\nwho conducted the \"safety valve\" interview.            However, Martínez\n\nneither raised these objections at the sentencing nor requested an\n\nevidentiary hearing,    thus waiving any claim that it was error for\n\nthe district court not to hold an evidentiary hearing.             See United\n\nStates v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 203 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n     Martínez now contends that the sentencing court should not\n\nhave arrived at a conclusion regarding his truthfulness until after\n\nMartínez' allocution at sentencing.           Be that as it may, \"the\n\ndeadline for making truthful and complete disclosure is the moment\n\nthat the sentencing hearing starts.\"        United States v. Matos, 328\n\nF.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2003).        Although Martínez protests that the\n\nguilty-plea   hearing   and   the    PSR   included   full   and    truthful\n\nadmissions by Martínez, we have held that § 5C1.2(5) requires\n\ndisclosure to a prosecutor and that statements to a probation\n\nofficer are not sufficient. See United States v. Jiménez Martínez,\n\n83 F.3d 488, 495 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n     The sentencing court made its \"safety valve\" determination\n\nfollowing extensive argumentation from defense counsel; it did not\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fmerely rely upon the government's recommendation.                        The court\n\n\"identified specific instances in which the proffer fell short\" and\n\nit   \"explained   why   [it]   did    not   credit     the    veracity     of   the\n\nappellant's   statement[s].\"         Marquez,    280      F.3d      at   24.    The\n\nsentencing court considered the statements Martínez made during his\n\nsafety valve interview in the context of the information presented\n\nat the change-of-plea hearing, as well as in the PSR, then found\n\nthat Martínez had been untruthful in these two respects.\n\n      First, the court noted that Martínez had admitted, during the\n\nchange-of-plea    proceeding,    to    knowingly     participating         in   the\n\ncharged conspiracy to distribute ecstasy and to the specific\n\ncharged   offenses,     including    the    August   7,      2001    transaction.\n\nHowever, at the \"safety valve\" interview, he had denied any knowing\n\nparticipation in the August 7 transaction, maintaining that \"he had\n\nno idea this involved drugs or a drug deal.\"            The sentencing court\n\nsupportably found that the denial was \"incredible,\" given that\n\nMartínez had already admitted to knowing participation in the\n\nAugust 7, 2001 transaction, and that prior to August 2001, he had\n\nbeen arrested for dealing ecstasy with Anglon.                That finding was\n\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\n      Second, the sentencing court found that Martínez had been\n\nuntruthful in stating: \"I don't keep samples on me, I don't sell\n\ndrugs,\" in response to the government's question at the \"safety\n\nvalve\" interview about providing Agent Cruz with the .27 gram\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fsample of heroin.         The court construed that response as a denial\n\nthat the sample delivery ever took place.                  Although the response\n\ncould have been construed differently, the court's choice between\n\nplausible competing interpretations of the prevailing circumstances\n\ndid not constitute clear error.               See Scharon, 187 F.3d at 22.           The\n\ndistrict court simply found Martínez' denial to be incredible,\n\nbased upon the record evidence, as supported by the information in\n\nthe PSR regarding the relevant conduct on December 8 and 10, 2001\n\n(to which no objection had been made by Martínez).\n\n     The      record     reveals      that    the   sentencing        court   made    an\n\nindependent determination, based upon the evidence before it and\n\nafter hearing defense counsel's arguments, that Martínez had not\n\n\"truthfully provided\" the government with all information and\n\nevidence      he   had   regarding      the    charged    offenses      and   relevant\n\nconduct.      The court did not clearly err in finding that Martínez\n\nfailed   to    satisfy     the     fifth     \"safety    valve\"    requirement.       See\n\nMarquez,    280    F.3d   at     24   (upholding       denial    of   \"safety   valve\"\n\nreduction      based      upon     district      court's        determination    that\n\n\"appellant's portrayal of himself as someone who was paid very\n\nlittle and who knew next to nothing about the details of the\n\ntransactions in which he participated beggars credulity\"); United\n\nStates v. White, 119 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 1997) (upholding denial\n\nof \"safety valve\" reduction based upon district court's finding\n\nthat \"White's 'safety valve' interviews untruthfully minimized her\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\frole in the conspiracy and disclaimed direct knowledge about the\n\nconspiracy\" to which she had pled guilty).               \"[A] safety valve\n\ndebriefing   is   a   situation   that    cries   out   for   straight   talk;\n\nequivocations, half-truths, and veiled allusions will not do.\"\n\nMatos, 328 F.3d at 39.\n\n    The sentence is affirmed.        See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

The\n\ndistrict court simply found Martínez' denial to be incredible,\n\nbased upon the record evidence, as supported by the information in\n\nthe PSR regarding the relevant conduct on December 8 and 10, 2001\n\n(to which no objection had been made by Martínez).\n\n     The      record     reveals      that    the   sentencing        court   made    an\n\nindependent determination, based upon the evidence before it and\n\nafter hearing defense counsel's arguments, that Martínez had not\n\n\"truthfully provided\" the government with all information and\n\nevidence      he   had   regarding      the    charged    offenses      and   relevant\n\nconduct.      The court did not clearly err in finding that Martínez\n\nfailed   to    satisfy     the     fifth     \"safety    valve\"    requirement.       See\n\nMarquez,    280    F.3d   at     24   (upholding       denial    of   \"safety   valve\"\n\nreduction      based      upon     district      court's        determination    that\n\n\"appellant's portrayal of himself as someone who was paid very\n\nlittle and who knew next to nothing about the details of the\n\ntransactions in which he participated beggars credulity\"); United\n\nStates v.
