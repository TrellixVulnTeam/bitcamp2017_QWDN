Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Stahl and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     James M. Fox for appellant.\n     Donald Feith, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom John\nP. Kacavas, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 15, 2011\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     A jury convicted Serge Bayard of\n\nuse of an unauthorized access device, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1029(a)(2)\n\n(2006), and aggravated identity theft, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1028A (2006).\n\nOn appeal he presses a litany of challenges, some counseled and\n\nothers pro se, for the purpose of obtaining a new trial.         We affirm\n\nhis conviction.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            A friendship blossomed between Bayard and Dorothy Shovan,\n\nan elderly widow more than thirty years his senior, shortly after\n\nthe death of her husband.        A few years later, Bayard moved into\n\nShovan's home; in exchange for room and board, Bayard helped her\n\naround the house.       Bayard's responsibilities increased over time.\n\nBy 2004, he was Shovan's driver, repairman, grocery shopper and, as\n\nher   health   waned,    full-time   caretaker.    Some   of   these   tasks\n\nrequired monetary outlays and, although the precise nature of their\n\nfinancial arrangement is unclear, it appears that Bayard used her\n\ncredit cards.      One of those credit cards -- a Bank of America Visa\n\ncard (the \"BofA Card\") -- is at the center of this case.\n\n            On July 25, 2008, after several months of hospitalization\n\nand severe dementia, Shovan died.          At some point in August 2008,\n\nBank of America -- unaware of Shovan's demise -- re-issued the BofA\n\nCard, which was scheduled to expire around that time.          Bayard, who\n\nwas still living in Shovan's home, intercepted the re-issued BofA\n\nCard and used it to make several purchases at a Wal-Mart store\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\ftotaling about $185.         That same day, he used the account number on\n\nthe BofA Card to book a three-month trip to a resort in New\n\nZealand.        In   e-mail    correspondence,          Bayard    told    a    resort\n\nrepresentative that he wanted to pre-pay using a credit card that\n\nbelonged to his \"cousin,\" who Bayard identified in a subsequent e-\n\nmail as Shovan.        The representative agreed and charged Shovan's\n\naccount nearly $3,000.              Two weeks later, Bayard left for New\n\nZealand.      An attorney for Shovan's estate later discovered the\n\ncurious account activity, cancelled the BofA Card, and notified\n\nauthorities.\n\n              In early 2009, shortly after he returned from abroad,\n\nBayard was arrested in connection with charges that do not pertain\n\nto this appeal.       On April 10, 2009, while Bayard was detained and\n\nawaiting trial in state court, the government filed a criminal\n\ncomplaint against him in federal court.                 A two-count indictment,\n\nhanded   up    on    April    29,    2009,    charged    him     with    use   of   an\n\nunauthorized access device, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1029(a)(2),1 and aggravated\n\nidentity theft, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1028A.2            On August 5, 2009, Bayard was\n\n\n     1\n      Section 1029(a)(2) provides that \"[w]hoever . . . knowingly\nand with intent to defraud traffics in or uses one or more\nunauthorized access devices during any one-year period, and by such\nconduct obtains anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more during\nthat period . . . shall, if the offense affects interstate or\nforeign commerce, be punished . . . .\"\n     2\n      Section 1028A(a)(1) provides that \"[w]hoever, during and in\nrelation to [a violation of section 1029(a)(2), among others],\nknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority,\na means of identification of another person shall, in addition to\n\n                                        -3-\n\freleased from state custody.          The next day he was arraigned in\n\nfederal court, pled not guilty, and waived his right to counsel.\n\n              A   two-day   jury    trial   began      in   October.     Bayard\n\nrepresented himself for most of it, but midway through the second\n\nday his stand-by counsel stepped in at Bayard's request. The focal\n\npoint of trial was Bayard's authorization vel non to use the BofA\n\nCard after Shovan's death.         The government elicited testimony that\n\nShovan was the only authorized user on the account; Bayard had no\n\npower of attorney over Shovan's financial affairs; and even if she\n\nhad   informally     authorized    Bayard   to   use    the   BofA   Card,   that\n\nauthorization was only for her benefit and expired upon her death.\n\nBayard testified that Shovan specifically authorized him to use the\n\nBofA Card as well as her other credit cards, not only for her\n\nbenefit but also for his.          He further testified that Shovan had\n\nbequeathed $20,000 to him, and that the transactions at issue were,\n\nin his view, advances on money owed.                   After an afternoon of\n\ndeliberation, the jury convicted Bayard on both counts in the\n\nindictment.       The court sentenced him to three years in prison.3\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\nthe punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment of 2 years.\"\n      3\n          Bayard does not appeal his sentence.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fII.   DISCUSSION\n\n              We address each of Bayard's seven arguments in turn,\n\nadding background as necessary.\n\n      A.      The J.P. Morgan Chase Card\n\n              Before trial, the government moved in limine to admit\n\nevidence in its case-in-chief concerning a J.P. Morgan Chase credit\n\ncard (the \"Chase Card\").       Bayard applied for the Chase Card in\n\nShovan's name on June 23, 2008, when she was incapacitated, and --\n\nas with the BofA Card -- used it after her death.    According to the\n\ngovernment, that evidence was probative of Bayard's intent and\n\nabsence of mistake concerning his use of the BofA Card.              The\n\ndistrict court denied the government's motion on the grounds that\n\nBayard's conduct in connection with the Chase Card was propensity\n\nevidence, see Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), and that its probative value\n\nwas substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 403.4      The court, however, left open the possibility that\n\nsuch evidence might be admissible later on for some other purpose.\n\n              During trial, Bayard took the stand and testified that\n\nShovan specifically authorized him to use her credit cards.          On\n\ncross-examination, the government began to question Bayard about\n\nthe Chase Card.      That prompted Bayard's stand-by counsel, who by\n\nthis time had stepped in, to request a sidebar conference.      There\n\nhe objected on Rule 404(b) grounds. The government responded that,\n\n\n      4\n          The government does not challenge this ruling on appeal.\n\n                                   -5-\n\falthough the court previously had denied its motion in limine on\n\nthat basis, a limited line of questioning on cross-examination was\n\npermissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), because it\n\nsought only to impeach Bayard's credibility. The court agreed with\n\nthe government, adding that in this context the value of the\n\ngovernment's proposed inquiry outweighed any possible prejudice\n\nthat might result.       Bayard declined a limiting instruction and the\n\nsidebar concluded.          The government then continued with cross-\n\nexamination.\n\n            On    appeal,    Bayard   repeats    his    objection        that    any\n\ntestimony about the Chase Card violated Rule 404(b).                His refrain\n\nis misguided.       By its very terms, Rule 404(b) prohibits the\n\nadmission of a prior bad act \"to prove the character of a person in\n\norder to show conformity therewith.\"           See, e.g., United States v.\n\nLandry, 631 F.3d 597, 601 (1st Cir. 2011) (\"[Rule 404(b)] prohibits\n\nthe admission of prior bad acts to establish an individual's\n\ncharacter or propensity to commit a crime.\").                      But here the\n\ngovernment sought to cross-examine Bayard for the limited purpose\n\nof attacking his character for truthfulness.             That is a different\n\npurpose that invokes a different rule.                Compare Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b), with Fed. R. Evid. 608(b).          See generally United States v.\n\nSimonelli, 237 F.3d 19, 22-24 (1st Cir. 2001) (discussing interplay\n\nbetween   Rules    404   and   608;   explaining      that   the    latter      \"'is\n\ncentrally   concerned       with   character    for    veracity,     a    mode   of\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\faccrediting or discrediting the witness that is based on the same\n\n'propensity'        reasoning   of   Rule      404   but    is    subject     to      quite\n\ndifferent rules.'\" (quoting United States v. Cudlitz, 72 F.3d 992,\n\n996 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal brackets omitted))).\n\n              Whether Bayard's actions in connection with the Chase\n\nCard were fair game under Rule 608(b) is a separate question.                           The\n\ngovernment says that such questions are left to the discretion of\n\nthe trial court -- a proposition that may be correct but not\n\nnecessarily     dispositive      here.         Bayard      says    nothing       at   all.\n\nAlthough      the    applicability    of    Rule      608(b)      to   this      line    of\n\nquestioning is less than clear, Bayard's failure to brief the issue\n\nwaives it.      United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n              That leaves us with Rule 403's balancing test, which\n\nBayard does make some attempt to address in his brief.                        Rule 403\n\nstates that relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its probative\n\nvalue    is    substantially     outweighed          by    the    danger    of     unfair\n\nprejudice, confusion of issues, or misleading the jury.\"                         We have\n\ncharacterized Rule 403 judgments as \"battlefield determinations\"\n\nsubject to \"great deference.\"              United States v. Shinderman, 515\n\nF.3d 5, 17 (1st Cir. 2008).          \"Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold\n\nappellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment\n\nconcerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\feffect.\" Id. (quoting Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331,\n\n1340 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n           We discern no abuse of discretion here.            Bayard does not\n\nadequately explain why his conduct surrounding the Chase Card was\n\nnot probative of his credibility, so we assume without deciding\n\nthat it was.   He does argue that the risk of unfair prejudice was\n\nhigh, but we disagree.         Our review of the government's cross-\n\nexamination reveals that it was far from inflammatory. It was also\n\nquite short and limited in scope to what the government had\n\nproposed at the sidebar.           And, as noted, Bayard declined the\n\ndistrict   court's    offer   to   give    a    limiting   instruction.   See\n\nShinderman, 515 F.3d at 17 (\"Furthermore, the court offered to give\n\na limiting instruction; that the defendant eschewed this course\n\ndoes not minimize the value of the court's offer.\").              Given these\n\ncircumstances,   we    are    reluctant    to    second-guess   the   district\n\ncourt's judgment in allowing cross-examination to proceed.\n\n     B.    The CitiBank MasterCard\n\n           During its case-in-chief, the government called Jeffrey\n\nRamos, a custodian of records for Bank of America.                Among other\n\nthings, Ramos authenticated account statements provided by Bank of\n\nAmerica that reflected charges to the BofA Card.                Two of those\n\ncharges, in addition to those described earlier, were balance\n\ntransfers from a CitiBank MasterCard (the \"CitiBank Card\"), which\n\nwas yet another of Shovan's credit cards that Bayard apparently\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fused after her death.   On direct examination, the government asked\n\nRamos a series of questions concerning those transfers.        Based on\n\ncertain questions Bayard posed on cross, the government sought on\n\nre-direct    to   clarify   Ramos's    testimony   by   referencing     a\n\ncorresponding set of account statements provided by CitiBank.\n\n            Bayard objected on the basis that he never received\n\ncopies of the CitiBank records.        The government explained that\n\nBayard had received copies and that they had been marked as an\n\nexhibit, although the exhibit was not yet in evidence.        The trial\n\njudge voiced his concern over questioning Ramos about an exhibit\n\nthat was not in evidence and that he could not authenticate.          The\n\ngovernment ultimately proposed to introduce the CitiBank records by\n\nmeans of a certification, and then conduct its examination of\n\nRamos.   The court then admitted the CitiBank records over Bayard's\n\nrelevancy objection.\n\n            On appeal, Bayard argues that the prosecutor's questions\n\non re-direct concerning the CitiBank Card amounted to prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct. According to Bayard, the prosecutor \"testified through\n\nhis questions that there was another card which was allegedly\n\nobtained through improper means.\"      Bayard did not object on that\n\nground at trial, so our review is for plain error.        United States\n\nv. Sรกnchez-Berrรญos, 424 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            We see no error, plain or otherwise.        Bayard does not\n\nidentify in his brief the specific questions that he challenges,\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fbut our independent review of the trial transcript satisfies us\n\nthat   his    hypothesis      is    unfounded.       None     of    the   prosecutor's\n\nquestions on re-direct gives us pause, let alone rises to the level\n\nwhere, in rare cases, we have ordered a new trial.                          See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Hardy, 37 F.3d 753, 757 (1st Cir. 1994) (vacating\n\nconviction      where   the    prosecutor        drew   an    analogy     between    the\n\ndefendant's running and hiding from police on the night of the\n\ncrime, and running and hiding again at trial by invoking Fifth\n\nAmendment right not to testify); United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d\n\n570, 573 (1st Cir. 1994) (vacating conviction where the prosecutor\n\nsuggested that government witnesses cannot lie and urged jury to\n\n\"[t]ake      responsibility        for   your    community\"        by   convicting   the\n\ndefendant); United States v. Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d 525, 527 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (vacating convictions where the prosecutor urged the\n\njury to consider case as a battle in war against drugs, and the\n\ndefendants as enemy soldiers corrupting \"our society\").\n\n              Separately,      Bayard      hints     in      his    brief    that    the\n\nprosecutor's questions provided an improper \"shortcut\" for the\n\nadmission of the CitiBank records. If that cryptic remark is meant\n\nto challenge the admission of the Citibank records, presumably on\n\nRule 404(b) grounds, the argument is woefully underdeveloped, and\n\nthus waived.     Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.           Even if it were not waived,\n\nBayard's failure to object on that ground below would subject the\n\nargument to plain error review, and under that standard it would\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fcertainly fail.          See Sรกnchez-Berrรญos, 424 F.3d at 73 (\"[U]nder\n\nplain error review, we have leeway to correct only the most\n\negregious of unpreserved errors.\").\n\n       C.        The Jury Instructions\n\n                 During the charge conference, there was considerable\n\ndebate as to the identity of the access device in this case.                 The\n\ngovernment, pointing to the broad statutory definition of \"access\n\ndevice,\" said that it was the plastic BofA Card itself (either the\n\nexpired or re-issued version), the account number embossed on the\n\nplastic, and the Bank of America account to which the card was\n\nlinked.         See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1029(e)(1).5   Bayard's counsel took a much\n\nnarrower view. He argued that the government must show that Bayard\n\nused an \"unauthorized access device,\" id. ยง 1029(a)(2) (emphasis\n\nsupplied), which is an access device that was \"lost, stolen,\n\nexpired, revoked, cancelled, or obtained with intent to defraud,\"\n\nid.    ยง 1029(e)(3).        According to him, evidence adduced at trial\n\nestablished that Shovan authorized Bayard to use the (by then\n\nexpired) BofA Card, along with its number and associated account,\n\nboth       of   which   remained   unchanged   since   the   time   Bayard   was\n\n\n       5\n      Defining \"access device\" as \"any card, plate, code, account\nnumber, electronic serial number, mobile identification number,\npersonal identification number, or other telecommunications\nservice, equipment, or instrument identifier, or other means of\naccount access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with\nanother access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any\nother thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of\nfunds (other than a transfer originated solely by paper\ninstrument).\"\n\n                                       -11-\n\fauthorized to use them.    Thus, he posited that the only access\n\ndevice that the government could argue was \"unauthorized\" was the\n\nre-issued plastic BofA Card, on the theory that it was \"stolen\" or\n\nfraudulently \"obtained\" when Bayard intercepted it in August 2008.6\n\n          The court agreed with Bayard that, under the rather\n\nunique circumstances of this case, only the re-issued plastic BofA\n\nCard -- and not its account or account number -- was arguably\n\n\"unauthorized.\"   Based on that understanding, the court delivered\n\nthe following instruction over the government's objection:\n\n          The term \"access device\" means any card, plate,\n     code, account number, or other means of account access\n     that can be used alone or in conjunction with another\n     access device to obtain money, goods, services or any\n     other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a\n     transfer of funds other than a transfer originated solely\n     by paper instrument. In this case, the access device\n     alleged to be unauthorized is the credit card issued in\n     August of 2008 ending in account number [supplied].\n\n          The term \"unauthorized access device\" includes any\n     credit card that was either stolen or obtained with the\n     intent to defraud. In this case the government claims\n     that the defendant stole and/or obtained with the intent\n     to defraud the Bank of America Visa card, last four\n\n\n     6\n      This was important because the bulk of Bayard's transactions,\nincluding his New Zealand booking and CitiBank balance transfers,\nwere executed online or over the phone using only the account or\naccount number. Under Bayard's hypothesis, those transactions did\nnot violate the statute because he did not physically \"swipe\" the\nplastic BofA Card. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1029(a)(2) (prohibiting \"use\"\nof an \"unauthorized access device\"). Although he did swipe the\ncard at Wal-Mart, the amount of his purchases there fell below the\nstatutory threshold. See id. (imposing liability on purchases of\n\"value aggregating $1,000 or more\" during any one-year period).\n     We do not address these contentions head-on, however, because\nBayard has not appealed the denial of his motion for judgment of\nacquittal.\n\n                               -12-\n\f     digits [supplied], that had been issued to Dorothy\n     Shovan. Accordingly, the government must prove beyond a\n     reasonable doubt either that the defendant stole that\n     credit card or that he obtained it with the intent to\n     defraud.7\n\n          Having gotten what he requested, Bayard now assails the\n\ncourt's instruction as confusing.      In particular, he argues that\n\nlisting \"account number\" as among the possible access devices\n\n\"created a serious risk that the jury would be confused as to\n\nwhether an account number satisfied the statute.\"     Because Bayard\n\nfailed to object to the instruction as delivered, we review for\n\nplain error, Ji v. Bose Corp., 626 F.3d 116, 125 (1st Cir. 2010),\n\nand quickly dispatch his plaint.       We see no likelihood of juror\n\nconfusion, given the court's clear and repeated statements that the\n\naccess device here was the re-issued plastic BofA Card. The phrase\n\n\"account number\" appears only in a list of what access devices\n\ncould be in general.   The court was free to include that list,\n\nwhich closely tracked the statute, for context.    Cf. United States\n\nv. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480, 484 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n     D.   Remaining Arguments\n\n          We briefly address Bayard's four remaining claims raised\n\nin his supplemental pro se brief, and reject the lot.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      We wish to add that we take no position on the court's\nstatutory interpretation that led to this instruction.      Our\nprecedent is unsettled and the answer is far from obvious. See,\ne.g., United States v. DiPietro, 936 F.2d 6, 7 & n.3 (1st Cir.\n1991). We therefore save the question for another day.\n\n                                -13-\n\f                 Bayard    argues      that    the   district    court   should   have\n\ndismissed the case on speedy trial grounds, because 116 days\n\nelapsed between the return date of the indictment and when he moved\n\nfor dismissal.           But the critical date, for purposes of the Speedy\n\nTrial Act, was August 7, 2009, the day after he was arraigned in\n\nfederal court.8           See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(c)(1) (2006) (\"[T]rial . . .\n\nshall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making\n\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the\n\ndefendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in\n\nwhich       such      charge   in     pending,    whichever     date   last    occurs.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)); see also United States v. Muรฑoz-Amado, 182\n\nF.3d       57,   60    (1st    Cir.    1999)     (rejecting   argument    in    similar\n\ncircumstances).            The period between that date and the start of\n\nBayard's trial in October 2009 was well under seventy days.\n\n                 Next, he asserts that the court denied his requests to\n\nsubpoena four individuals, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(b).              Not true.     The transcript from the ex\n\nparte hearing in which Bayard sought subpoenas reveals that he\n\nwithdrew his requests for three of those four individuals.9                         The\n\njudge took under advisement Bayard's request for the remaining\n\n\n       8\n      Bayard specifically disavows any claim under the Sixth\nAmendment's Speedy Trial Clause. See generally Barker v. Wingo,\n407 U.S. 514 (1972).\n       9\n      The government does not point this out in its brief.  It\nexplains in a footnote that it was not present at the ex parte\nhearing and that a transcript was \"not made available.\"\n\n                                              -14-\n\findividual -- Tania Booth, the New Zealand resort representative --\n\nalthough it appears that the court never ruled on that particular\n\nrequest.   But at no point thereafter did Bayard ask the trial judge\n\nfor an up-or-down ruling, so the issue has been waived. DesRosiers\n\nv. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1991).                   In any event,\n\nbecause Bayard's e-mail correspondence with Booth was admitted into\n\nthe record, her testimony likely would have been cumulative.\n\n           Third,   Bayard     critiques    the   timing   of    the   district\n\ncourt's ruling that precluded the government from using a prior\n\nconviction.    According to Bayard, by waiting until the last day of\n\ntrial to issue its ruling the court \"interfered\" with his \"tactical\n\ndecisions,\" including his decision to proceed pro se. If the court\n\nhad ruled earlier, Bayard contends, he would have retained counsel\n\nfor the entire trial.    We think not.      Bayard never indicated below,\n\nin extensive discussions on the matter, that his decision to\n\nproceed pro se hinged on an evidentiary ruling.                 Moreover, the\n\nrecord reveals that Bayard asked his stand-by counsel to step in\n\nbefore   the   court   ruled    on   the    admissibility       of   his   prior\n\nconviction, fatally undermining his claim.\n\n           Lastly, Bayard argues that the cumulative effect of the\n\ndistrict court's errors necessitates a new trial.                    See United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Melendez, 594 F.3d 28, 37 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f(discussing the so-called cumulative error doctrine).   But without\n\nany errors, there is nothing to accumulate.10\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      Bayard's counsel asserted at oral argument that the\ngovernment did not satisfy its burden of showing intent to defraud.\nThe argument comes too late, United States v. Poulin, 631 F.3d 17,\n19 n.2 (1st Cir. 2011) (arguments raised at oral argument but not\nin a party's initial brief are considered waived), and anyway\nBayard did not appeal the denial of his motion for judgment of\nacquittal, see supra note 6.\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

We affirm\n\nhis conviction.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            A friendship blossomed between Bayard and Dorothy Shovan,\n\nan elderly widow more than thirty years his senior, shortly after\n\nthe death of her husband.        A few years later, Bayard moved into\n\nShovan's home; in exchange for room and board, Bayard helped her\n\naround the house.       Bayard's responsibilities increased over time.\n\nBy 2004, he was Shovan's driver, repairman, grocery shopper and, as\n\nher   health   waned,    full-time   caretaker.    Some   of   these   tasks\n\nrequired monetary outlays and, although the precise nature of their\n\nfinancial arrangement is unclear, it appears that Bayard used her\n\ncredit cards.      One of those credit cards -- a Bank of America Visa\n\ncard (the \"BofA Card\") -- is at the center of this case.\n\n            On July 25, 2008, after several months of hospitalization\n\nand severe dementia, Shovan died.          At some point in August 2008,\n\nBank of America -- unaware of Shovan's demise -- re-issued the BofA\n\nCard, which was scheduled to expire around that time.          Bayard, who\n\nwas still living in Shovan's home, intercepted the re-issued BofA\n\nCard and used it to make several purchases at a Wal-Mart store\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\ftotaling about $185.         That same day, he used the account number on\n\nthe BofA Card to book a three-month trip to a resort in New\n\nZealand.        In   e-mail    correspondence,          Bayard    told    a    resort\n\nrepresentative that he wanted to pre-pay using a credit card that\n\nbelonged to his \"cousin,\" who Bayard identified in a subsequent e-\n\nmail as Shovan.        The representative agreed and charged Shovan's\n\naccount nearly $3,000.              Two weeks later, Bayard left for New\n\nZealand.      An attorney for Shovan's estate later discovered the\n\ncurious account activity, cancelled the BofA Card, and notified\n\nauthorities.\n\n              In early 2009, shortly after he returned from abroad,\n\nBayard was arrested in connection with charges that do not pertain\n\nto this appeal.       On April 10, 2009, while Bayard was detained and\n\nawaiting trial in state court, the government filed a criminal\n\ncomplaint against him in federal court.                 A two-count indictment,\n\nhanded   up    on    April    29,    2009,    charged    him     with    use   of   an\n\nunauthorized access device, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1029(a)(2),1 and aggravated\n\nidentity theft, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1028A.2            On August 5, 2009, Bayard was\n\n\n     1\n      Section 1029(a)(2) provides that \"[w]hoever . . . knowingly\nand with intent to defraud traffics in or uses one or more\nunauthorized access devices during any one-year period, and by such\nconduct obtains anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more during\nthat period . . . shall, if the offense affects interstate or\nforeign commerce, be punished . . . .\"\n     2\n      Section 1028A(a)(1) provides that \"[w]hoever, during and in\nrelation to [a violation of section 1029(a)(2), among others],\nknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority,\na means of identification of another person shall, in addition to\n\n                                        -3-\n\freleased from state custody.          The next day he was arraigned in\n\nfederal court, pled not guilty, and waived his right to counsel.\n\n              A   two-day   jury    trial   began      in   October.     Bayard\n\nrepresented himself for most of it, but midway through the second\n\nday his stand-by counsel stepped in at Bayard's request. The focal\n\npoint of trial was Bayard's authorization vel non to use the BofA\n\nCard after Shovan's death.         The government elicited testimony that\n\nShovan was the only authorized user on the account; Bayard had no\n\npower of attorney over Shovan's financial affairs; and even if she\n\nhad   informally     authorized    Bayard   to   use    the   BofA   Card,   that\n\nauthorization was only for her benefit and expired upon her death.\n\nBayard testified that Shovan specifically authorized him to use the\n\nBofA Card as well as her other credit cards, not only for her\n\nbenefit but also for his.          He further testified that Shovan had\n\nbequeathed $20,000 to him, and that the transactions at issue were,\n\nin his view, advances on money owed.                   After an afternoon of\n\ndeliberation, the jury convicted Bayard on both counts in the\n\nindictment.       The court sentenced him to three years in prison.3\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\nthe punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment of 2 years.\"\n      3\n          Bayard does not appeal his sentence.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fII.   DISCUSSION\n\n              We address each of Bayard's seven arguments in turn,\n\nadding background as necessary.\n\n      A.      The J.P. Morgan Chase Card\n\n              Before trial, the government moved in limine to admit\n\nevidence in its case-in-chief concerning a J.P. Morgan Chase credit\n\ncard (the \"Chase Card\").       Bayard applied for the Chase Card in\n\nShovan's name on June 23, 2008, when she was incapacitated, and --\n\nas with the BofA Card -- used it after her death.    According to the\n\ngovernment, that evidence was probative of Bayard's intent and\n\nabsence of mistake concerning his use of the BofA Card.              The\n\ndistrict court denied the government's motion on the grounds that\n\nBayard's conduct in connection with the Chase Card was propensity\n\nevidence, see Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), and that its probative value\n\nwas substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 403.4      The court, however, left open the possibility that\n\nsuch evidence might be admissible later on for some other purpose.\n\n              During trial, Bayard took the stand and testified that\n\nShovan specifically authorized him to use her credit cards.          On\n\ncross-examination, the government began to question Bayard about\n\nthe Chase Card.      That prompted Bayard's stand-by counsel, who by\n\nthis time had stepped in, to request a sidebar conference.      There\n\nhe objected on Rule 404(b) grounds. The government responded that,\n\n\n      4\n          The government does not challenge this ruling on appeal.\n\n                                   -5-\n\falthough the court previously had denied its motion in limine on\n\nthat basis, a limited line of questioning on cross-examination was\n\npermissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), because it\n\nsought only to impeach Bayard's credibility. The court agreed with\n\nthe government, adding that in this context the value of the\n\ngovernment's proposed inquiry outweighed any possible prejudice\n\nthat might result.       Bayard declined a limiting instruction and the\n\nsidebar concluded.          The government then continued with cross-\n\nexamination.\n\n            On    appeal,    Bayard   repeats    his    objection        that    any\n\ntestimony about the Chase Card violated Rule 404(b).                His refrain\n\nis misguided.       By its very terms, Rule 404(b) prohibits the\n\nadmission of a prior bad act \"to prove the character of a person in\n\norder to show conformity therewith.\"           See, e.g., United States v.\n\nLandry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183881\"><a href=\"/opinion/183881/united-states-v-landry/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 601 (1st Cir. 2011) (\"[Rule 404(b)] prohibits\n\nthe admission of prior bad acts to establish an individual's\n\ncharacter or propensity to commit a crime.\").                      But here the\n\ngovernment sought to cross-examine Bayard for the limited purpose\n\nof attacking his character for truthfulness.             That is a different\n\npurpose that invokes a different rule.                Compare Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b), with Fed. R. Evid. 608(b).

The\n\ngovernment says that such questions are left to the discretion of\n\nthe trial court -- a proposition that may be correct but not\n\nnecessarily     dispositive      here.         Bayard      says    nothing       at   all.\n\nAlthough      the    applicability    of    Rule      608(b)      to   this      line    of\n\nquestioning is less than clear, Bayard's failure to brief the issue\n\nwaives it.

Rule 403\n\nstates that relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its probative\n\nvalue    is    substantially     outweighed          by    the    danger    of     unfair\n\nprejudice, confusion of issues, or misleading the jury.\"                         We have\n\ncharacterized Rule 403 judgments as \"battlefield determinations\"\n\nsubject to \"great deference.\"              United States v.

Bayard does not\n\nadequately explain why his conduct surrounding the Chase Card was\n\nnot probative of his credibility, so we assume without deciding\n\nthat it was.   He does argue that the risk of unfair prejudice was\n\nhigh, but we disagree.         Our review of the government's cross-\n\nexamination reveals that it was far from inflammatory. It was also\n\nquite short and limited in scope to what the government had\n\nproposed at the sidebar.           And, as noted, Bayard declined the\n\ndistrict   court's    offer   to   give    a    limiting   instruction.   See\n\nShinderman, 515 F.3d at 17 (\"Furthermore, the court offered to give\n\na limiting instruction; that the defendant eschewed this course\n\ndoes not minimize the value of the court's offer.\").              Given these\n\ncircumstances,   we    are    reluctant    to    second-guess   the   district\n\ncourt's judgment in allowing cross-examination to proceed.\n\n     B.    The CitiBank MasterCard\n\n           During its case-in-chief, the government called Jeffrey\n\nRamos, a custodian of records for Bank of America.                Among other\n\nthings, Ramos authenticated account statements provided by Bank of\n\nAmerica that reflected charges to the BofA Card.                Two of those\n\ncharges, in addition to those described earlier, were balance\n\ntransfers from a CitiBank MasterCard (the \"CitiBank Card\"), which\n\nwas yet another of Shovan's credit cards that Bayard apparently\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fused after her death.   On direct examination, the government asked\n\nRamos a series of questions concerning those transfers.        Based on\n\ncertain questions Bayard posed on cross, the government sought on\n\nre-direct    to   clarify   Ramos's    testimony   by   referencing     a\n\ncorresponding set of account statements provided by CitiBank.\n\n            Bayard objected on the basis that he never received\n\ncopies of the CitiBank records.        The government explained that\n\nBayard had received copies and that they had been marked as an\n\nexhibit, although the exhibit was not yet in evidence.        The trial\n\njudge voiced his concern over questioning Ramos about an exhibit\n\nthat was not in evidence and that he could not authenticate.          The\n\ngovernment ultimately proposed to introduce the CitiBank records by\n\nmeans of a certification, and then conduct its examination of\n\nRamos.   The court then admitted the CitiBank records over Bayard's\n\nrelevancy objection.\n\n            On appeal, Bayard argues that the prosecutor's questions\n\non re-direct concerning the CitiBank Card amounted to prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct. According to Bayard, the prosecutor \"testified through\n\nhis questions that there was another card which was allegedly\n\nobtained through improper means.\"      Bayard did not object on that\n\nground at trial, so our review is for plain error.

If that cryptic remark is meant\n\nto challenge the admission of the Citibank records, presumably on\n\nRule 404(b) grounds, the argument is woefully underdeveloped, and\n\nthus waived.     Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.

See Sรกnchez-Berrรญos, 424 F.3d at 73 (\"[U]nder\n\nplain error review, we have leeway to correct only the most\n\negregious of unpreserved errors.\").\n\n       C.        The Jury Instructions\n\n                 During the charge conference, there was considerable\n\ndebate as to the identity of the access device in this case.                 The\n\ngovernment, pointing to the broad statutory definition of \"access\n\ndevice,\" said that it was the plastic BofA Card itself (either the\n\nexpired or re-issued version), the account number embossed on the\n\nplastic, and the Bank of America account to which the card was\n\nlinked.         See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1029(e)(1).5   Bayard's counsel took a much\n\nnarrower view. He argued that the government must show that Bayard\n\nused an \"unauthorized access device,\" id. ยง 1029(a)(2) (emphasis\n\nsupplied), which is an access device that was \"lost, stolen,\n\nexpired, revoked, cancelled, or obtained with intent to defraud,\"\n\nid.    ยง 1029(e)(3).        According to him, evidence adduced at trial\n\nestablished that Shovan authorized Bayard to use the (by then\n\nexpired) BofA Card, along with its number and associated account,\n\nboth       of   which   remained   unchanged   since   the   time   Bayard   was\n\n\n       5\n      Defining \"access device\" as \"any card, plate, code, account\nnumber, electronic serial number, mobile identification number,\npersonal identification number, or other telecommunications\nservice, equipment, or instrument identifier, or other means of\naccount access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with\nanother access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any\nother thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of\nfunds (other than a transfer originated solely by paper\ninstrument).\"\n\n                                       -11-\n\fauthorized to use them.    Thus, he posited that the only access\n\ndevice that the government could argue was \"unauthorized\" was the\n\nre-issued plastic BofA Card, on the theory that it was \"stolen\" or\n\nfraudulently \"obtained\" when Bayard intercepted it in August 2008.6\n\n          The court agreed with Bayard that, under the rather\n\nunique circumstances of this case, only the re-issued plastic BofA\n\nCard -- and not its account or account number -- was arguably\n\n\"unauthorized.\"   Based on that understanding, the court delivered\n\nthe following instruction over the government's objection:\n\n          The term \"access device\" means any card, plate,\n     code, account number, or other means of account access\n     that can be used alone or in conjunction with another\n     access device to obtain money, goods, services or any\n     other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a\n     transfer of funds other than a transfer originated solely\n     by paper instrument. In this case, the access device\n     alleged to be unauthorized is the credit card issued in\n     August of 2008 ending in account number [supplied].\n\n          The term \"unauthorized access device\" includes any\n     credit card that was either stolen or obtained with the\n     intent to defraud. In this case the government claims\n     that the defendant stole and/or obtained with the intent\n     to defraud the Bank of America Visa card, last four\n\n\n     6\n      This was important because the bulk of Bayard's transactions,\nincluding his New Zealand booking and CitiBank balance transfers,\nwere executed online or over the phone using only the account or\naccount number. Under Bayard's hypothesis, those transactions did\nnot violate the statute because he did not physically \"swipe\" the\nplastic BofA Card. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1029(a)(2) (prohibiting \"use\"\nof an \"unauthorized access device\"). Although he did swipe the\ncard at Wal-Mart, the amount of his purchases there fell below the\nstatutory threshold. See id. (imposing liability on purchases of\n\"value aggregating $1,000 or more\" during any one-year period).\n     We do not address these contentions head-on, however, because\nBayard has not appealed the denial of his motion for judgment of\nacquittal.\n\n                               -12-\n\f     digits [supplied], that had been issued to Dorothy\n     Shovan. Accordingly, the government must prove beyond a\n     reasonable doubt either that the defendant stole that\n     credit card or that he obtained it with the intent to\n     defraud.7\n\n          Having gotten what he requested, Bayard now assails the\n\ncourt's instruction as confusing.      In particular, he argues that\n\nlisting \"account number\" as among the possible access devices\n\n\"created a serious risk that the jury would be confused as to\n\nwhether an account number satisfied the statute.\"     Because Bayard\n\nfailed to object to the instruction as delivered, we review for\n\nplain error, Ji v. Bose Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179747\"><a href=\"/opinion/179747/ji-v-bose-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125 (1st Cir. 2010),\n\nand quickly dispatch his plaint.       We see no likelihood of juror\n\nconfusion, given the court's clear and repeated statements that the\n\naccess device here was the re-issued plastic BofA Card. The phrase\n\n\"account number\" appears only in a list of what access devices\n\ncould be in general.   The court was free to include that list,\n\nwhich closely tracked the statute, for context.

Our\nprecedent is unsettled and the answer is far from obvious. See,\ne.g., United States v. DiPietro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563217\"><a href=\"/opinion/563217/united-states-v-robyn-dipietro/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 & n.3 (1st Cir.\n1991). We therefore save the question for another day.\n\n                                -13-\n\f                 Bayard    argues      that    the   district    court   should   have\n\ndismissed the case on speedy trial grounds, because 116 days\n\nelapsed between the return date of the indictment and when he moved\n\nfor dismissal.           But the critical date, for purposes of the Speedy\n\nTrial Act, was August 7, 2009, the day after he was arraigned in\n\nfederal court.8           See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(c)(1) (2006) (\"[T]rial . . .\n\nshall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making\n\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the\n\ndefendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in\n\nwhich       such      charge   in     pending,    whichever     date   last    occurs.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)); see also United States v.

The period between that date and the start of\n\nBayard's trial in October 2009 was well under seventy days.\n\n                 Next, he asserts that the court denied his requests to\n\nsubpoena four individuals, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(b).              Not true.     The transcript from the ex\n\nparte hearing in which Bayard sought subpoenas reveals that he\n\nwithdrew his requests for three of those four individuals.9                         The\n\njudge took under advisement Bayard's request for the remaining\n\n\n       8\n      Bayard specifically disavows any claim under the Sixth\nAmendment's Speedy Trial Clause. See generally Barker v. Wingo,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972).\n       9\n      The government does not point this out in its brief.  It\nexplains in a footnote that it was not present at the ex parte\nhearing and that a transcript was \"not made available.\"\n\n                                              -14-\n\findividual -- Tania Booth, the New Zealand resort representative --\n\nalthough it appears that the court never ruled on that particular\n\nrequest.   But at no point thereafter did Bayard ask the trial judge\n\nfor an up-or-down ruling, so the issue has been waived. DesRosiers\n\nv. Moran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572165\"><a href=\"/opinion/572165/steven-m-desrosiers-v-john-j-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1991).                   In any event,\n\nbecause Bayard's e-mail correspondence with Booth was admitted into\n\nthe record, her testimony likely would have been cumulative.\n\n           Third,   Bayard     critiques    the   timing   of    the   district\n\ncourt's ruling that precluded the government from using a prior\n\nconviction.    According to Bayard, by waiting until the last day of\n\ntrial to issue its ruling the court \"interfered\" with his \"tactical\n\ndecisions,\" including his decision to proceed pro se. If the court\n\nhad ruled earlier, Bayard contends, he would have retained counsel\n\nfor the entire trial.    We think not.      Bayard never indicated below,\n\nin extensive discussions on the matter, that his decision to\n\nproceed pro se hinged on an evidentiary ruling.                 Moreover, the\n\nrecord reveals that Bayard asked his stand-by counsel to step in\n\nbefore   the   court   ruled    on   the    admissibility       of   his   prior\n\nconviction, fatally undermining his claim.\n\n           Lastly, Bayard argues that the cumulative effect of the\n\ndistrict court's errors necessitates a new trial.                    See United\n\nStates v.
