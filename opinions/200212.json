FLETCHER, Senior Circuit Judge.       Non-party appellants\n\nStone & Webster Engineering Corporation and Stone & Webster, Inc.,\n\nappeal the district court’s decision to permit discovery from them\n\nin a dispute between plaintiff-appellee Federal Insurance Company\n\nand defendant-appellee Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company.           The\n\nunderlying case between Federal Insurance and Maine Yankee settled\n\nbefore trial.       Because there is no live controversy as to the\n\npropriety of the discovery that appellants challenge, we dismiss\n\nappellants’ appeal as moot.\n\n\n\n              I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          This appeal arises out of a dispute over decommissioning\n\nMaine Yankee Atomic Power’s retired nuclear plant in Wiscasset,\n\nMaine.   In 1998, Maine Yankee contracted with Stone & Webster\n\nEngineering    Corporation   to   decommission   the   plant.   Stone   &\n\nWebster, Inc., as a parent of Stone & Webster Engineering, secured\n\nits subsidiary’s performance.       Maine Yankee, following industry\n\npractice, also obtained payment and performance bonds from Federal\n\nInsurance as additional security for Stone & Webster Engineering’s\n\nperformance.\n\n          In May, 2000, Maine Yankee terminated the decommissioning\n\ncontract for cause and demanded that Federal Insurance perform its\n\nobligations under the additional bonds.      Shortly thereafter, Stone\n\n& Webster and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy reorganization\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\funder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101-1330, in\n\nfederal district court in Delaware.            In the Delaware bankruptcy\n\naction, Maine Yankee filed a proof of claim for approximately $78\n\nmillion against Stone & Webster Engineering. Federal Insurance\n\nfiled a contingent proof of claim against Stone & Webster for\n\nindemnification if Maine Yankee recovered under the bonds.\n\n          Almost simultaneously, in the Delaware bankruptcy court,\n\nFederal Insurance sought a separate declaratory judgment with\n\nrespect to its liability under the performance bond.                Over the\n\nopposition    of   Stone   &   Webster,   as    intervenor,   and    Federal\n\nInsurance, Maine Yankee successfully petitioned for the instant,\n\nseparate action to be transferred to federal district court in\n\nMaine.\n\n             Shortly after the transfer, Maine Yankee served two\n\nsubpoenas against Stone & Webster and Stone & Webster Engineering.\n\nBoth companies objected and claimed that the subpoenas violated the\n\nautomatic stay provision of Chapter 11, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(2). The\n\nmatter was argued before a magistrate judge who ordered Stone &\n\nWebster and Stone & Webster Engineering to comply.            The companies\n\ntimely objected to the decision, but the district court upheld it.\n\n             Stone & Webster and Stone & Webster Engineering sought\n\nreview in this court and simultaneously petitioned the Delaware\n\nbankruptcy court for a preliminary injunction against enforcement\n\nof the subpoenas.      We disposed of the appeal on jurisdictional\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fgrounds because we determined that the discovery order at issue, in\n\nthe posture presented, was neither a final order within the meaning\n\nof 28 U.S.C. § 1291, nor was it appealable as a collateral order.\n\nWe noted, in an unpublished order, that “[n]on parties can gain the\n\nright of appeal from a discovery order by defying it, being held in\n\ncontempt, and then appealing the contempt order.”          The bankruptcy\n\ncourt    independently   rejected     the    companies’   request   for    a\n\npreliminary injunction.        Stone & Webster and Stone & Webster\n\nEngineering then complied fully with the subpoenas.\n\n           Maine Yankee and Federal Insurance’s action did not reach\n\ntrial.   The parties settled their dispute and filed a stipulation\n\nof dismissal with prejudice, pursuant to which Federal Insurance\n\nagreed to pay Maine Yankee approximately $44 million under its bond\n\nobligations.    Upon dismissal of the action, Stone & Webster and\n\nStone & Webster Engineering took this appeal.\n\n\n\n                              II.   DISCUSSION\n\n           Appellants ask this court to reverse the district court’s\n\ndecision upholding the subpoenas or to vacate the district court’s\n\norders enforcing them. We may grant neither form of relief because\n\nappellants’    acquiescence    in   the     discovery   compelled   by    the\n\nsubpoenas deprives this court of jurisdiction over their appeal.\n\n           Federal jurisdiction, of course, is limited to “Cases\n\n[and] . . . Controversies.” U.S. Const. Art. III.            And, in each\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcase, the issues that we are called upon to decide must present an\n\nactual, live controversy.   Allende v. Shultz, 845 F.2d 1111, 1115\n\nn.7 (1st Cir. 1988).   In addition to the constitutional boundaries\n\nof our jurisdiction, Congress, as a general matter, has granted the\n\ncourts of appeals jurisdiction over only final orders in cases from\n\nlower courts.   See 28 U.S.C. § 1291.     Some exceptions exist.   For\n\ninstance, a litigant may appeal certain collateral orders.         See,\n\ne.g., Anderson v. City of Boston, 244 F.3d 236, 240 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(stating when collateral orders are appealable under Cohen v.\n\nBeneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949)).           Routine\n\ndiscovery orders – such as the orders enforcing the subpoenas at\n\nissue here – are not final orders, and no statute or doctrine\n\ninvests us with jurisdiction to decide an appeal of a routine\n\ndiscovery order.\n\n          This is not to say that appellate scrutiny of such orders\n\nis unavailable.    As we explained to appellants in their prior\n\nappeal, appellate review is available to litigants who are cited\n\nfor contempt.   See In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 123 F.3d 695, 696\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).   This is because when a litigant is adjudged to be\n\nin contempt, “the contempt order       is appealable . . . because as\n\nfar as that party is concerned the order is final because he or she\n\ncould not appeal from the final judgment of the action.”      6 James\n\nWm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 26.07[2][g] (3d ed.\n\n1999).\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          If a litigant, however, complies with a discovery order,\n\nthe question of its propriety ordinarily becomes moot.1        See United\n\nStates v. Anderson, 623 F.2d 720, 724 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449\n\nU.S. 1021 (1980); see also Office of Thrift Supervision v. Dobbs,\n\n931 F.2d 956, 957 (D.C. Cir. 1991).       This rule is firmly rooted and\n\nlong-settled.    It is merely an expression of the principle that\n\nguided   the    Supreme   Court’s    decision    in   United   States   v.\n\nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 26 (1950).          In Munsingwear the Court\n\nexplained that an appeal by the United States which sought vacatur\n\nof an opinion in a dismissed case was moot.           The Court reasoned\n\nthat the government had “slept on its rights,” id. at 41, by\n\nfailing to seek vacatur before the case was dismissed below and the\n\nCourt therefore lacked jurisdiction to grant relief.\n\n          Appellants argue that contempt is not the only route by\n\nwhich they may obtain such review, and they contend that their\n\nfailure to risk contempt has not mooted their appeal.          Appellants\n\nare correct that, in certain cases, risk of contempt is not\n\nnecessary for an appeal.     See Church of Scientology of California\n\nv. United States, 506 U.S. 9 (1992).            But a nonparty who has\n\ncomplied with a discovery order faces a difficult hurdle.\n\n\n\n     1\n        We have consistently held that a case becomes moot when\nthe issues presented are no longer “live” or the parties lack a\nlegally cognizable interest in the outcome of the controversy.\nSee Thomas R.W. v. Mass. Dept. of Educ., 130 F.3d 477, 479 (1st\nCir. 1997) (quoting Boston and Me. Corp. v. Bhd. of Maintenance\nof Way Employees, 94 F.3d 15, 20 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n                                    -7-\n\f              The Supreme Court’s decision in Church of Scientology\n\ndid not alter the Munsingwear rule.             In Church of Scientology, the\n\nCourt   explained       that   if   a   court   may   “fashion    some   form   of\n\nmeaningful relief,” id. (emphasis in original), a case is not moot.\n\nId.     There, the Court concluded that the Church’s interest in\n\nmaintaining the privacy of its papers could be served by the\n\n“partial remedy” of ordering the government to destroy or return\n\nall copies in its possession.             The Court therefore concluded that\n\nthe case was not moot even though a “fully satisfactory remedy” was\n\nunavailable.\n\n            In their effort to invoke Church of Scientology by\n\npointing to the possibility of “meaningful relief,” appellants\n\ninvoke 11 U.S.C. § 362(h), which provides for damages, actual and\n\npunitive,    for    a    “willful       violation”    of   an   automatic    stay.\n\nAppellants did not raise this argument in their opening brief, and\n\nwe question whether it has been preserved adequately.                       In any\n\nevent, we note that bankruptcy and district judges in Delaware and\n\na magistrate judge and a district judge in Maine all have assumed\n\nimplicitly or directly recognized the legitimacy of the challenged\n\ndiscovery.     Against such a background, the prospect of securing\n\nmeaningful relief for a willful violation of the automatic stay is\n\nfar too insubstantial to counter mootness. Appellants’ decision to\n\ncomply with the subpoenas thus mooted the dispute and forecloses\n\nour review.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f          The Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.\n\nv. Bonner Mall P’ship, 513 U.S. 18 (1994), a case decided after\n\nChurch of Scientology, is instructive.       In U.S. Bancorp, the\n\nappellant sought vacatur of an opinion in a case that had settled.\n\nThe Court refused to vacate the opinion and explained:\n\n          The principal condition to which we have\n          looked, is whether the party seeking relief\n          from the judgment below caused the mootness by\n          voluntary action. . . . A party who seeks\n          review of the merits of an adverse ruling, but\n          is frustrated by the vagaries of circumstance,\n          ought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce\n          in the judgment.      The same is true when\n          mootness results from unilateral action of the\n          party who prevailed below.     Where mootness\n          results from settlement, however, the losing\n          party has voluntarily forfeited his legal\n          remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal or\n          certiorari . . . .       The judgment is not\n          unreviewable, but simply unreviewed by his own\n          choice.\n\nId. at 24-25.    Although the instant case does not involve a\n\nsettlement between appellants and appellees, the considerations\n\nthat determined the decision in U.S. Bancorp apply just as easily\n\nhere.\n\n          Our conclusion is not draconian.   Contempt citations can\n\n– and often do – carry significant penalties.   But if a party risks\n\ncontempt to obtain review, lower courts are free to consider the\n\ncircumstances in determining appropriate sanctions and to stay\n\nthose sanctions pending appeal. The fact that the risk of contempt\n\nmay be uncomfortable for a litigant, however, does not provide a\n\nbasis for courts to act when they are without jurisdiction.\n\n                               -9-\n\f                        III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          Appellants chose to acquiesce in the orders they now\n\nask us to review.   Their decision to comply rather than to risk\n\ncontempt sanctions, however, ended the controversy and mooted the\n\nissue.   We dismiss their appeal.\n\n          DISMISSED. Costs shall be taxed in favor of appellee\n\nMaine Yankee.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

In 1998, Maine Yankee contracted with Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corporation to decommission the plant. Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., as a parent of Stone &amp; Webster Engineering, secured its subsidiary's performance. Maine Yankee, following industry practice, also obtained payment and performance bonds from Federal Insurance as additional security for Stone &amp; Webster Engineering's performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May, 2000, Maine Yankee terminated the decommissioning contract for cause and demanded that Federal Insurance perform its obligations under the additional bonds. Shortly thereafter, Stone &amp; Webster and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101-1330, in federal district court in Delaware. In the Delaware bankruptcy action, Maine Yankee filed a proof of claim for approximately $78 million against Stone &amp; Webster Engineering.

The underlying case between Federal Insurance and Maine Yankee settled before trial. Because there is no live controversy as to the propriety of the discovery that appellants challenge, we dismiss appellants' appeal as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>FACTUAL BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal arises out of a dispute over decommissioning Maine Yankee Atomic Power's retired nuclear plant in Wiscasset, Maine. In 1998, Maine Yankee contracted with Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corporation to decommission the plant. Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., as a parent of Stone &amp; Webster Engineering, secured its subsidiary's performance. Maine Yankee, following industry practice, also obtained payment and performance bonds from Federal Insurance as additional security for Stone &amp; Webster Engineering's performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May, 2000, Maine Yankee terminated the decommissioning contract for cause and demanded that Federal Insurance perform its obligations under the additional bonds. Shortly thereafter, Stone &amp; Webster and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101-1330, in federal district court in Delaware. In the Delaware bankruptcy action, Maine Yankee filed a proof of claim for approximately $78 million against Stone &amp; Webster Engineering. Federal Insurance filed a contingent proof of claim against Stone &amp; Webster for indemnification if Maine Yankee recovered under the bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost simultaneously, in the Delaware bankruptcy court, Federal Insurance sought a separate declaratory judgment with respect to its liability under the performance bond. Over the opposition of Stone &amp; Webster, as intervenor, and Federal Insurance, Maine Yankee successfully petitioned for the instant, separate action to be transferred to federal district court in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the transfer, Maine Yankee served two subpoenas against Stone &amp; Webster and Stone &amp; Webster Engineering. Both companies objected and claimed that the subpoenas violated the automatic stay provision of Chapter 11, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(2). The matter was argued before a magistrate judge who ordered Stone &amp; Webster and Stone &amp; Webster Engineering to comply. The companies timely objected to the decision, but the district court upheld it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stone &amp; Webster and Stone &amp; Webster Engineering sought review in this court and simultaneously petitioned the Delaware bankruptcy court for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the subpoenas. We disposed of the appeal on jurisdictional grounds because we determined that the discovery order at issue, in the posture presented, was neither a final order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, nor was it appealable as a collateral order. We noted, in an unpublished order, that \"[n]on parties can gain the right of appeal from a discovery order by defying it, being held in contempt, and then appealing the contempt order.\" The bankruptcy court independently rejected the companies' request for a preliminary injunction. Stone &amp; Webster and Stone &amp; Webster Engineering then complied fully with the subpoenas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine Yankee and Federal Insurance's action did not reach trial. The parties settled their dispute and filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, pursuant to which Federal Insurance agreed to pay Maine Yankee approximately $44 million under its bond obligations. Upon dismissal of the action, Stone &amp; Webster and Stone &amp; Webster Engineering took this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>DISCUSSION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants ask this court to reverse the district court's decision upholding the subpoenas or to vacate the district court's orders enforcing them. We may grant neither form of relief because appellants' acquiescence in the discovery compelled by the subpoenas deprives this court of jurisdiction over their appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal jurisdiction, of course, is limited to \"Cases [and] ... Controversies.\" U.S. Const. Art. III. And, in each case, the issues that we are called upon to decide must present an actual, live controversy. <i>Allende v.

In addition to the constitutional boundaries of our jurisdiction, Congress, as a general matter, has granted the courts of appeals jurisdiction over only final orders in cases from lower courts. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. Some exceptions exist. For instance, a litigant may appeal certain collateral orders. <i>See, e.g., Anderson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199354\"><a href=\"/opinion/199354/boston-childrens-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 240 (1st Cir.2001) (stating when collateral orders are appealable under <i>Cohen v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1528</span></a></span> (1949)). Routine discovery orders &#8212; such as the orders enforcing the subpoenas at issue here &#8212; are not final orders, and no statute or doctrine invests us with jurisdiction to decide an appeal of a routine discovery order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that appellate scrutiny of such orders is unavailable.

This is because when a litigant is adjudged to be in contempt, \"the contempt order is appealable ... because as far as that party is concerned the order is final because he or she could not appeal from the final judgment of the action.\" 6 James Wm.
