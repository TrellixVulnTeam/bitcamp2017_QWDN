This case requires us to\n\nconsider whether a company's filing of a bankruptcy petition and\n\nthe appointment of a trustee automatically terminates the election\n\nby its shareholders of \"S Corporation\" status under the Internal\n\nRevenue Code.     See 26 U.S.C. § 1361.      Specifically at issue is a\n\nnearly $200,000 income tax deficiency assessed against appellant\n\nAlphonse Mourad stemming from the sale of assets of a corporation\n\nof which he was the sole shareholder.        The United States Tax Court\n\nruled that Mourad was personally liable for the tax because his\n\ncompany, V & M Management, Inc., was an \"S Corporation\" whose gains\n\nand losses are passed through to shareholders.              See Mourad v.\n\nComm'r, 121 T.C. 1, 8 (2003).          The court rejected appellant's\n\nargument   that   V   &   M's   bankruptcy   filing   had   terminated   the\n\ncompany's S election, and it further concluded that appellant was\n\nnot entitled to a low-income housing credit to offset the tax\n\nliability. On appeal, appellant challenges both the assessment and\n\nthe denial of the credit.       As we find no legal or factual error, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n     V & M Management owned and operated a 275-unit apartment\n\ncomplex known as Mandela Apartments in Roxbury, Massachusetts, from\n\n1981 until 1997.      The property was sold in December 1997 for more\n\nthan $2.8 million as part of a reorganization plan developed by an\n\nindependent trustee after V & M filed a petition for reorganization\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\funder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.             For a number of years\n\nbefore the bankruptcy filing, which occurred in January 1996,              V &\n\nM had been operated as an \"S Corporation,\" a status available under\n\nSubchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §§ 1361-1379.\n\n       Subchapter S was added to the Tax Code to lessen the tax\n\nburden on small businesses and to eliminate disincentives for them\n\nto adopt the corporate form.        Bufferd v. Comm'r, 506 U.S. 523, 524-\n\n25 (1993); see also Durando v. United States, 70 F.3d 548, 551 (9th\n\nCir.       1995)   (\"Congress   created   S   corporations   to   give   small\n\nbusinesses the benefits of the corporate form, such as limited\n\nliability for shareholders, without the disadvantages of corporate\n\ntaxation.\"). When the shareholders of a qualified corporation make\n\na Subchapter S election, they switch from a multiple-level taxation\n\nsystem to\n\n       a \"pass-through\" taxation system under which income is\n       subjected to only one level of taxation. . . . The\n       corporation's profits [and losses] pass through directly\n       to its shareholders on a pro rata basis and are reported\n       on the shareholders' individual tax returns.         See\n       § 1366(a)(1)(A).\n\nGitlitz v. Comm'r, 531 U.S. 206, 209 (2001) (citing Bufferd, 506\n\nU.S. at 525).1\n\n\n\n       1\n       The income of corporations usually is subject to two levels\nof taxation; it is taxed when earned by the corporation, and the\nsame income is taxed again when it is distributed to shareholders\nin the form of dividends. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 301-385; Camilla Berit\nGalesi, \"Shareholders' Rights Regarding Termination of a Debtor\nCorporation's S Status in a Bankruptcy Setting,\" 10 J. Bankr. L. &\nPrac. 157, 159 (2001)[\"Shareholders' Rights\"].\n\n                                      -3-\n\f       Thus, for some number of years, V & M's income and any\n\noffsetting        expenses,    including       depreciation         of   the   business's\n\nproperty, were passed through to appellant.                         Appellant contends\n\nthat       that   arrangement       –   and    the   S   corporation       status    that\n\nauthorized it – should have come to an end when the trustee took\n\nover V & M and he no longer had control of the business.                          In the\n\nalternative, he argues that, if he must bear the tax liability of\n\nthe property sale, he is entitled to a low-income housing credit\n\nobtained by the trustee on behalf of the new owners of the\n\nproperty.\n\n       The    appellee,       the   Commissioner         of   the    Internal     Revenue\n\nService, maintains that V & M's S corporation election and the\n\npass-through system of taxation remained in effect for the 1997 tax\n\nyear, and that appellant does not qualify for a credit.2                               We\n\naddress each of these issues in turn.\n\n       A. Termination of Subchapter S status\n\n       The Tax Code provides that a shareholders' election to take S\n\ncorporation status remains in effect until it is terminated under\n\n26 U.S.C. § 1362(d).            See 26 U.S.C. § 1362(c).                 Subsection (d)\n\nidentifies three ways in which termination may occur: (1) if more\n\nthan fifty percent of the corporation's shareholders vote to revoke\n\n\n       2\n       The trustee prepared and filed S corporation returns on\nbehalf of V & M for the years 1995 through 1999, and on the 1997\nform reported that appellant had realized a gain of $2,088,554 from\nthe sale of Mandela Apartments. Appellant did not file individual\nfederal income tax returns for 1996 or 1997.\n\n                                              -4-\n\fthe election; (2) if the business ceases to be a \"small business\n\ncorporation,\" or (3) if the business's passive investment income\n\nexceeds 25 percent of gross receipts for three consecutive years\n\n(and the business earned profits each of those years).              See id.\n\n§§ 1362(d)(1), (2), (3).\n\n      Appellant asserts that section 1362(d)(2) is applicable here\n\nand that V & M's S corporation status ended when it entered\n\nbankruptcy because it no longer met the requirements of a \"small\n\nbusiness corporation.\"           Under the Tax Code, a small business\n\ncorporation must be a domestic corporation with fewer than 75\n\nshareholders, all of whom must be individuals and none of whom may\n\nbe a nonresident alien, and it may have only one class of stock.\n\nSee id. § 1361(b). Appellant argues that, because the trustee took\n\ncontrol of the company for the benefit of its creditors, appellant\n\nno   longer   was   its   real   owner.    This   transfer   of   power,   he\n\nmaintains, left V & M with new shareholders – the corporate\n\ncreditors – who were not individuals, and also generated more than\n\none class of stock because of the creditors' \"different rights and\n\npreferences.\"\n\n      We reject appellant's theory that his tenure as shareholder\n\nended when the trustee took over day-to-day operation of V & M.             A\n\nbankruptcy trustee steps into the shoes of the debtor - in this\n\ncase, the corporation - and the corporation and its shareholders\n\nare \"separate entities, including 'in respect of tax problems,'\"\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fDurando, 70 F.3d at 552 n.9 (quoting New Colonial Ice Co. v.\n\nHelvering,   292   U.S.   435,   442    (1934));    see   also   Bangor   Punta\n\nOperations, Inc. v. Bangor & Aroostook R.R. Co., 417 U.S. 703, 713\n\n(1974) (\"a corporation and its shareholders are deemed separate\n\nentities   for   most   purposes,\"      but   the   corporate    form   may   be\n\ndisregarded \"where it is used to defeat an overriding public\n\npolicy\"); Silverman & Sons Realty Trust v. Comm'r, 620 F.2d 314,\n\n317 (lst Cir. 1980) (noting \"general rule that corporation and\n\nstockholders are considered separate entities for tax purposes\").\n\nAlthough appellant's equity interest in V & M may have been without\n\nvalue by the time the bankruptcy filing occurred, see In re V & M\n\nMgmt., Inc., 321 F.3d 6, 8 (lst Cir. 2003), neither the trustee nor\n\nthe creditors displaced him as sole shareholder.                 Cf. Commodity\n\nFutures Trading Comm. v. Weintraub, 471 U.S. 343,                  353 (1985)\n\n(\"[T]he trustee plays the role most closely analogous to that of a\n\nsolvent corporation's management.\"); In re Sanders, 969 F.2d 591,\n\n593 (7th Cir. 1992) (\"[A] bankruptcy trustee succeeds only to the\n\ntitle and rights in property that the debtor had at the time [it]\n\nfiled the bankruptcy petition.\").\n\n     Bankruptcy law, moreover, explicitly provides that any income\n\nof the estate in a bankruptcy case, with certain exceptions not\n\nasserted as relevant here, \"may be taxed only as though such case\n\nhad not been commenced,\" see 11 U.S.C. § 346(c)(1), reinforcing the\n\nview that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing does not change the tax\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\frelationship between a debtor corporation and its shareholders.\n\nThis conclusion is further buttressed by the scant case law that\n\nexists.   In In re Stadler Assocs., Inc., 186 B.R. 762 (Bankr. S.D.\n\nFla. 1995), the sole shareholder of an S corporation that had filed\n\na petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code argued\n\nthat    the    bankruptcy   filing     had   terminated   the     debtor's   S\n\ncorporation status.      The bankruptcy court disagreed, holding that\n\ntermination was limited to the three methods set out in section\n\n1362(d) and that none of those had occurred.           See id. at 764.\n\n       Other   courts,   while   not    directly    considering    whether   a\n\nbankruptcy      filing   automatically       ends   Subchapter    S   status,\n\nimplicitly have adopted Stadler's view in the course of discussing\n\nwhether shareholders may choose to terminate S status pursuant to\n\nsection 1362(d) when a bankruptcy filing is anticipated.                 See,\n\ne.g., In re Bakersfield Westar, Inc., 226 B.R. 227, 235-37 (9th\n\nCir. BAP 1998); In re Trans-Lines West, Inc., 203 B.R. 653, 659-60\n\n(Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1996); see also \"Shareholders' Rights,\" 10 J.\n\nBankr. L. & Prac. at 176-80.         Such an inquiry would be unnecessary\n\nif bankruptcy automatically effected termination.\n\n       Having concluded that V & M did not convert to a standard C\n\ncorporation by virtue of a change in its shareholders, we likewise\n\nreject appellant's assertion that the company lost its small\n\nbusiness classification based on a change in the classes of stock.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fThere is no evidence in the record that shareholders other than\n\nappellant existed or exercised rights different from his.\n\n      Although we do not face in this case the question whether\n\nshareholders should be permitted to terminate S status pursuant to\n\nsection 1362(d)       when   a    bankruptcy    filing     is    imminent   or   has\n\noccurred, and thus need not consider the competing equities at\n\nissue, we recognize the logic in appellant's contention that it is\n\nunfair to assess tax liability on shareholders who do not receive\n\nthe   income    on   which   they    are   obliged    to   pay    the   tax.     See\n\n\"Shareholders' Rights,\" 10 J. Bankr. L. & Practice at 157; Richard\n\nA. Shaw, \"Taxing Shareholders on the Income of an S Corporation in\n\nBankruptcy,\" 1 No. 6 Bus. Entities 40, 47 (1999), 1999 WL 1419055,\n\nat *47 (criticizing courts for disallowing new tax elections, which\n\nhas the effect of \"sever[ing] the tax burden from the assets\n\nwithout the consent of the shareholders,\" and noting that this\n\n\"abuses the economics of both the tax and the bankruptcy systems\");\n\ncf. In re Forman Enters., Inc., 281 B.R. 600, 609-610 (W.D. Penn.\n\n2002)     (S   corporation       shareholders   not    unjustly      enriched    by\n\nretaining tax refunds for themselves rather than turning them over\n\nto chapter 7 trustee for distribution to debtor's creditors).\n\n        Here, appellant did not attempt a statutory revocation of the\n\nS corporation election. Moreover, the record indicates that he was\n\npersonally liable for V & M's debts.             See Mourad, 121 T.C. at 6;\n\nAppendix at 336.      To the extent that the proceeds from the sale of\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthe   apartment   complex   were   applied   to   the   company's   debts,\n\ntherefore, appellant received benefit along with the tax burden.3\n\n      Accordingly, we conclude that V & M remained an S corporation\n\nfollowing its entry into bankruptcy and that appellant properly was\n\nassessed pass-through tax liability on the asset sale.\n\n      B. Availability of the Low-income Housing Credit\n\n      Appellant argues that if he is to be assessed taxes on the\n\nincome generated by the sale of the Mandela Apartments property, he\n\nis entitled to the low-income housing credit available for such\n\nprojects under 26 U.S.C. § 42.4      Under the statute and its related\n\nregulations, see 26 C.F.R. § 1.42-1T, a detailed series of steps\n\nmust be followed by a property owner seeking the credit, none of\n\nwhich appellant completed.         The trustee, however, did help to\n\nsecure the credit on behalf of the new owners of the Mandela\n\nApartments, and appellant argues that equity entitles him to\n\nutilize the credit to offset his tax liability.\n\n\n\n      3\n       Appellant states in his brief that \"[t]he proceeds from the\ndisposition of the corporation's assets were paid directly to a\ncreditor's trust rather than the corporation.\"\n      4\n       Section 42 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 1986\nto stimulate the production of low-income rental housing.       See\n\"Joint Committee on Taxation's General Explanation of the Tax\nReform Act of 1986\" (Blue Books), Title II, Section E(2) (\"Congress\nbelieved a more efficient mechanism for encouraging the production\nof low-income rental housing could be provided through the low-\nincome rental housing tax credit.\"); Oti Kaga, Inc. v. South Dakota\nHous. Dev. Auth., 342 F.3d 871, 875 (8th Cir. 2003) (section 42's\ntax credit allocation program \"encourages investment in low-income\nhousing projects\").\n\n                                    -9-\n\f     This argument is entirely lacking in foundation.       So far as\n\nthe record on appeal shows, the tax credits granted to the project\n\nwere obtained for 1998.       See Appendix at 169 (\"Certificate of\n\nBinding Commitment\" from the Massachusetts Department of Housing\n\nand Community Development for \"$1,000,000 in 1998 Tax Credits for\n\nMandela Homes,\" granted under the \"Low-Income Housing Tax Credit\n\nProgram as authorized by Section 42(h)(1)(c) of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code of 1986\").     The tax liability at issue in this case is\n\nfor 1997.   Appellant thus appears to be seeking to use a tax credit\n\nthat does not exist.      The record does not permit the conclusion\n\nthat, had the trustee sought to obtain a tax credit for 1997, it\n\nwould have been granted.5    In these circumstances, we find no error\n\nin the district court's conclusion that appellant is responsible\n\nfor the full income tax liability generated from the sale of\n\nMandela Apartments.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       We note that appellant states in his brief that V & M\nqualified for the tax credit in 1994, two years before the trustee\ntook over operation of the business. It appears that no effort to\nsecure the credit was made until the trustee did so in anticipation\nof the change of ownership that occurred in December 1997.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f",

This conclusion is further buttressed by the scant case law that exists. In <i>In re Stadler Assocs., Inc.,</i> 186 B.R. 762 (Bankr. S.D.Fla.1995), the sole shareholder of an S corporation that had filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code argued that the bankruptcy filing had terminated the debtor's S corporation status. The bankruptcy court disagreed, holding that termination was limited to the three methods set out in section 1362(d) and that none of those had occurred. <i>See id.</i> at 764.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts, while not directly considering whether a bankruptcy filing automatically ends Subchapter S status, implicitly have adopted <i>Stadler's</i> view in the course of discussing whether shareholders may choose to terminate S status pursuant to section 1362(d) when a bankruptcy filing is anticipated. <i>See, e.g., In re Bakersfield Westar, Inc.,</i> 226 B.R. 227, 235-37 (9th Cir.BAP 1998); <i>In re Trans-Lines West, Inc.,</i> 203 B.R. 653, 659-60 (Bankr.

This conclusion is further buttressed by the scant case law that exists.

S.D.Fla.1995), the sole shareholder of an S corporation that had filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code argued that the bankruptcy filing had terminated the debtor's S corporation status.

To the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the apartment complex were applied to the company's debts, therefore, appellant received benefit along with the tax burden.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we conclude that V &amp; M remained an S corporation following its entry into bankruptcy and that appellant properly was assessed pass-through tax liability on the asset sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Availability of the Low-income Housing Credit</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that if he is to be assessed taxes on the income generated by the sale of the Mandela Apartments property, he is entitled to the low-income housing credit available for such projects under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 42.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Under the statute and its related regulations, <i>see</i> 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.42-1T, a detailed series of steps must be followed by a property owner seeking the credit, none of which appellant completed.

The tax liability at issue in this case is for 1997. Appellant thus appears to be seeking to use a tax credit that does not exist.
