Wendtland, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          July 12, 2004\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.       Dieudonna Georcely, a citizen of\n\nHaiti, arrived in the United States Virgin Islands on or about\n\nJanuary    25,   2002.      In   January    2002,   the   Immigration     and\n\nNaturalization Service (“INS”), as it was then named, charged\n\nGeorcely with removability under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2000)\n\nas an alien who had arrived in the United States without lawful\n\nauthority.       Georcely   conceded   removability   but   said   that    he\n\nintended to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture.1\n\n             On or about March 15, 2002, the immigration judge set a\n\nhearing to be held in St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, on April 29,\n\n2002.     Georcely had by then apparently relocated to Boca Raton,\n\nFlorida, to stay with a cousin.            On April 11, 2002, his lawyer\n\nmailed to the immigration judge a motion to change venue to Miami,\n\nFlorida.     The day before the scheduled hearing Georcely's counsel\n\ncalled the immigration court and was informed that the court had\n\nnot yet received the motion.\n\n             Neither Georcely nor his counsel appeared at the April\n\n29, 2002, hearing. As is permitted by the statute, the immigration\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Asylum and withholding of removal are both administrative\nmeasures, with somewhat different incidents, that can be invoked by\nan alien who is threatened with harm.           See 8 U.S.C. §§\n1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1), 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000); 8 C.F.R. §§\n208.13(b), 208.16 (2004); see also Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d\n118, 130 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fjudge conducted the hearing in absentia, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A)\n\n(2000), and on that same day ordered Georcely removed to Haiti.\n\n           On June 25, 2002, Georcely's counsel filed a motion to\n\nreopen and change venue claiming that Georcely \"in good faith\n\nbelieved that a change of venue to the Miami District, where he was\n\nresiding, would be or had been granted.\"        The apparent delay in the\n\nmail and failure of the immigration court to approve the transfer\n\nwere, he asserted, events \"beyond the knowledge much less control\n\nof   the   alien\"    and    supported     a   finding   of       “exceptional\n\ncircumstances\" justifying relief.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C),\n\n(e)(1) (2000).\n\n           The INS opposed the request to reopen and on July 18,\n\n2002, the immigration judge denied Georcely's motion.              The judge\n\nsaid that Georcely's attorney had \"filed many motions for reopening\n\nclaiming the same situation,\" that neither an alien nor his counsel\n\nwere entitled to assume that a motion to change venue will be\n\ngranted, and that Georcely's counsel was \"well aware\" that the\n\nmotion had not been granted because he had called the court the day\n\nbefore and was told the motion had not arrived.\n\n           On    August    16,   2002,    Georcely   filed   a    motion   to\n\nreconsider.     He said it was reasonable for him to believe that the\n\nmotion would be granted because at an earlier bond reduction\n\nhearing for Georcely, the immigration judge had inquired of the INS\n\nwhether it would oppose a change in venue to the Miami district if\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe petitioner so requested, and the INS attorney allegedly said\n\nshe would have no objection.      Georcely's counsel also argued that\n\nit was reasonable for him to think that his mailed motion would\n\narrive within 5 to 7 days--well within the 18 days before the\n\nhearing.\n\n             Georcely's counsel stated that his alien client \"had\n\ninquired repeatedly” as to whether the motion to change venue had\n\nbeen sent and was told that it had been.           Accordingly, Georcely\n\n“was unaware” that the motion had not been received or granted and\n\nthat he had not been excused from appearing in St. Thomas.        Even if\n\nGeorcely had known that he was not excused, said counsel, Georcely\n\ncould not have arrived in St. Thomas “on one day's notice.\"\n\n             Finally, Georcely’s counsel cited Matter of Lozada, 91 I.\n\n& N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), as holding that “ineffective assistance\n\nof   counsel    is   another   ground    for   finding   of   exceptional\n\ncircumstances.”      He described as “analogous”    another case (Matter\n\nof Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I. & N. Dec. 472 (BIA 1996)), where relief\n\nwas granted because counsel as a \"tactic of delay” deliberately\n\nmisinformed the respondent that he did not have to appear. Counsel\n\ncontinued:\n\n           Lozada required that a bar complaint be filed\n           in order to claim ineffective assistance of\n           counsel; however, [Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d\n           108, 110-11 (2d Cir. 1993) and Figueroa v.\n           INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989)] hold that\n           ineffective assistance of counsel can be\n           established without such complaint being made.\n           Obviously,    undersigned    is   less    than\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           comfortable making a self-denunciation to the\n           bar, but will do so if the Court so requires.\n\n           The immigration judge denied the motion to reconsider,\n\nsaying that this was the fifth time the court had to confront\n\ncounsel’s “way of representing clients before this Court” and that\n\nthe court \"will not tolerate any longer this counsel's way of\n\nrepresenting clients before this Court”; that lawyers who file\n\nmotions have to take account of the mails; and that “counsel was\n\nless than diligent in this and all the other cases where he brings\n\nup the same shaky excuses.”\n\n           Georcely's counsel then filed an appeal to the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), repeating earlier arguments and adding\n\nthat Georcely, \"unemployed and indigent, would not have been able\n\nto afford a ticket to go to St. Thomas in any event.\"               The BIA\n\ndenied   the   appeal,   saying   in   substance   that    the   exceptional\n\ncircumstances test was intended for compelling matters (e.g., a\n\nserious illness preventing attendance) and did not include an\n\nalien's voluntary absence from a scheduled hearing.\n\n           Georcely now appeals to this court.            At the threshold,\n\nwe face an issue of venue.         Shortly before the scheduled oral\n\nargument, Georcely's counsel moved to submit the case without\n\nargument (a motion we granted), observing in passing that the case\n\narose in the Virgin Islands and that the Third Circuit customarily\n\nhad jurisdiction over cases arising in the Virgin Islands.            See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291 (2000); 48 U.S.C. § 1613a(c) (2000); Government of\n\n                                   -5-\n\fVirgin Islands v. Rivera, 333 F.3d 143, 146 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\nConstruing     this   as    a   motion   to    change   venue,       the    government\n\nresponded, saying that it\n\n           agree[d] with the Petitioner that because the\n           hearing during which the Petitioner was\n           ordered removed in absentia took place in the\n           Virgin Islands, this case is not properly\n           before this Court, and should be transferred\n           to the Third Circuit.\n\n             The applicable statute for review of INS decisions, 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(2) (2000), provides (as to “venue and forms”) that\n\n“[t]he petition for review shall be filed with the court of appeals\n\nfor the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed\n\nthe proceedings.\"      The question posed by this language--actually a\n\ndouble question of some difficulty--can be understood only against\n\nthe background of the geographic operations of the immigration\n\ncourt in the Caribbean.\n\n             It appears from the information available to us that the\n\nimmigration court responsible for the present case is based in\n\nGuaynabo, Puerto Rico, that it has jurisdiction over Puerto Rico,\n\nSt.   Thomas   and    St.   Croix   (the       latter   two   being        U.S.   Virgin\n\nIslands), and that the immigration judge based in Guaynabo holds in\n\nperson hearings       in    the   Virgin      Islands   as    well    as    telephonic\n\nhearings with St. Croix.2         In our case--perhaps in all such cases--\n\n\n      2\n      See United States Department of Justice, Guaynabo, PR\nImmigration    Court   -    Frequently   Asked   Questions,   at\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/sibpages/saj/faq.htm (last visited May\n25, 2004).\n\n                                         -6-\n\fstamps on the documents indicate that filings by counsel with the\n\nimmigration court were sent to and docketed in Guaynabo.\n\n          Here, the immigration judge conducted the in absentia\n\nhearing that resulted in the removal order in St. Thomas; but there\n\nis a reasonable likelihood that the order was officially filed and\n\ndocketed at the headquarters in Guaynabo; admittedly, the record is\n\nunclear on this point.3       If the removal order \"completed\" the\n\nproceedings, the question posed would be whether the completion\n\noccurred in the Third Circuit where the ruling was made (St.\n\nThomas) or the First Circuit (Guaynabo) where we think that the\n\norder was officially filed and docketed.\n\n          If   the   order   was   officially   filed   and   docketed   in\n\nGuaynabo, the most straightforward reading of the language of\n\nsection 1252(b)(2) would probably lead us to conclude that the\n\nremoval proceedings were completed in Guaynabo (assuming that they\n\nwere completed by the removal order rather than by the later denial\n\nof the motion to reopen).     This is so because a judicial order is\n\nnormally effective when filed and docketed, see United States v.\n\nFiorelli, 337 F.3d 282, 287 (3d Cir. 2003); Willhauck v. Halpin,\n\n953 F.2d 689, 701 (1st Cir. 1991); 11 Wright, Miller, and Kane,\n\n\n\n     3\n      Mysteriously the removal order itself has a typed letterhead\nand, after the legend \"Immigration Court,\" there follows on a new\nline, \"St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.\" Whether this latter reference\nis merely to the site of the hearing or whether there is some\narrangement for filing and docketing in St. Thomas remains\nunexplained.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fFederal Practice and Procedure § 2785 (2d ed. 1995 & Supp. 2004),\n\nalthough exceptions exist.       As it happens, the appeal in this case\n\nwas originally filed in the Eleventh Circuit, presumably because\n\ncounsel hoped to associate it with the Miami office of the INS.\n\nWhen the INS then moved for a transfer to this circuit, a motion\n\nnot opposed by Georcely, the INS said that “the immigration judge\n\ncompleted proceedings in San Juan, Puerto Rico.”\n\n            This view that the place of filing and docketing controls\n\nmust   be   tentative.    The    statutory    language   is   so    far     from\n\nconclusive, see Ramos v. Ashcroft, No. 03-4050, 2004 U.S. App.\n\nLexis 11692, at *2-*3 (7th Cir. June 15, 2004), that absent\n\nlegislative history, policy concerns would matter if they weighed\n\nheavily on either side.         Further facts might affect the outcome\n\n(e.g., perhaps the removal order for some reason was effective when\n\nannounced).       And,   most    important,    a   definitive      ruling    is\n\nunnecessary here because--as we will see--the venue issue has been\n\nforfeited.\n\n            In the interest of getting issues on the table, a further\n\ncomplication should be mentioned.         Even if the removal proceedings\n\nmight otherwise be deemed to have been completed in St. Thomas\n\n(contrary to our tentative assessment), the removal order itself\n\nwas followed by a motion to reopen, later denied without an oral\n\nhearing.     Both the motion and the order denying it were filed and\n\ndocketed in Guaynabo.     See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(a) (2004) (\"All\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fdocuments   and   applications     that   are    to   be   considered     in   a\n\nproceeding before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the\n\nImmigration Court having administrative control over the Record of\n\nProceeding.\")     In such a case, does Guaynabo thereby become the\n\nplace of completion?\n\n            On this issue, the government argues that the place where\n\nthe immigration judge \"completed\" the proceedings is the place\n\nwhere the    immigration   judge    issued   a   final     order   of   removal\n\n\"notwithstanding the fact that [an] alien subsequently files a\n\nmotion to reopen or reconsider, except when the Judge grants the\n\nPetitioner's motion and reopens proceedings.\" The government reads\n\nNwaokolo v. INS, 314 F.3d 303 (7th Cir. 2002), as suggesting an\n\nopposite reading of the statute but regards it as mistaken.\n\n            In all events, we need not resolve such questions.             The\n\nchallenge is to venue, not jurisdiction; the statute says so, as\n\ndoes Nwaokolo, 314 F.3d at 306.       Objections to venue are normally\n\nwaived unless asserted in timely fashion.             28 U.S.C. § 1406(b)\n\n(2000); W.A. Stackpole Motor Transp., Inc. v. Malden Spinning &\n\nDyeing Co., 263 F.2d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 1958); 15 Wright, Miller &\n\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3829 (2d ed. 1986).\n\nAlthough section 1406(b) explicitly requires a “timely” objection\n\nin district court proceedings, Nwaokolo, 314 F.3d at 306, found the\n\nsame requirement implicitly applicable to immigration appeals, as\n\ndo we.\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f             Venue requirements are normally for the convenience of\n\nthe parties and, if the parties do not object, ordinarily there is\n\nno policy objection to proceeding in any court with jurisdiction.\n\nHere, the government sought, and Georcely did not contest, the\n\ntransfer to this circuit as the appropriate venue--and certainly\n\nthat   was   a    colorable   contention.     Any   contrary    suggestion,\n\nbelatedly made on the eve of a scheduled argument, is forfeited and\n\nneed not be considered.\n\n             No one circuit can speak definitively as to when the\n\nproceedings are “completed,” and yet uniform rules are highly\n\ndesirable for both the courts and the litigants.               Perhaps INS\n\nregulations would help toward a solution, see Ramos v. Ashcroft,\n\nsupra, 2004 U.S. App. Lexis 11692, at *2 (suggesting that course);\n\nCongress can certainly provide one.         Copies of this decision will\n\nbe sent to the appropriate congressional authorities and, in this\n\ncase, to the Attorney General.\n\n             Turning to the merits, we begin with the statutory\n\nframework.       When the BIA issues its own opinion, we review the\n\nBoard's decision and not the immigration judge's.              Albathani v.\n\nINS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).             The statute governing\n\njudicial review of in absentia removal orders confines review to\n\ncertain limited issues but among them is \"the reasons for the\n\nalien's not attending the proceeding.\"        8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(D).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fThe standard of review ordinarily varies with the nature of the\n\nissue, Bolton v. Taylor, 367 F.3d 5, 7-8 & n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          An order for removal entered in absentia may be rescinded\n\n\"upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of\n\nthe order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to\n\nappear was because of exceptional circumstances.\" 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229a(b)(5)(C).   The statute says that this means “exceptional\n\ncircumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious\n\nillness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but\n\nnot including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of\n\nthe alien.\"   Id. § 1229a(e)(1).\n\n          It appears that Georcely knew that a hearing had been set\n\nin St. Thomas--the notice to him so provided--and that his lawyer\n\nhad moved for a transfer of the matter to Miami.   But there is no\n\nclaim that his lawyer told him that the motion had been granted.\n\nSo Georcely, as well as his lawyer, were obligated to appear at the\n\nSt. Thomas hearing.    Simply to assume that the motion would be\n\ngranted because the INS had not objected is not remotely an\n\nexceptional circumstance beyond the alien’s control.   See Tang v.\n\nAshcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1195 (10th Cir. 2003).\n\n          The exceptional circumstances requirement, a fairly tough\n\none, was adopted by Congress precisely because failures to appear\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fat scheduled INS hearings had greatly burdened the agency.4                 To\n\ncharge Georcely with knowledge of his legal obligations may be\n\nunrealistic--he    apparently      does    not    read    English--but     such\n\nknowledge is expected of all, e.g., Atkins v. Parker, 472 U.S. 115,\n\n130 (1985); United States v. Aquino-Chacon, 109 F.3d 936, 938 (4th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 931 (1997), and the obligation as\n\napplied here is less surprising than many others.\n\n          Georcely’s counsel told the Board (late in the day and\n\nwithout evidence) that his client was indigent and could not at the\n\nlast minute have come back to St. Thomas.          If so, then he was ill-\n\nadvised to go to Miami in the first place.               Certainly he had no\n\nexcuse for waiting until the hearing date had passed to raise such\n\nan excuse.      Compare Herbert, 325 F.3d at 70, 72 (exceptional\n\ncircumstances    where   counsel   was     held   in   another   hearing   and\n\npromptly advised the immigration court); Romero-Morales v. INS, 25\n\nF.3d 125, 127, 129 (2d Cir. 1994).\n\n          We note also that Georcely did not submit affidavits or\n\nany evidentiary materials to the immigration judge or BIA in\n\nsupport of his claim that he was financially unable to travel to\n\nthe hearing, see, e.g., Ursachi v. INS, 296 F.3d 592, 594 (7th Cir.\n\n\n     4\n      Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2003). Prior\nto 1990, the statute required only that the alien show \"reasonable\ncause\" excusing his or her absence. Tang, 354 F.3d at 1194 n.3,\n1195 n.4; see also Maldonado-Perez v. INS, 865 F.2d 328, 333 (D.C.\nCir. 1989); Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 545,\n104 Stat 4978, 5063-65 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3), (f)(2)\n(repealed)).\n\n                                    -12-\n\f2002); In re J-P-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 33, 34-35 (BIA 1998).               Nor did\n\nhe explain how he was able to travel to Florida from the Virgin\n\nIslands but could not afford the return trip, see Hernandez-Vivas\n\nv. INS, 23 F.3d 1557, 1560 (9th Cir. 1994); Maldonado-Perez, 865\n\nF.2d at 333, or why he could not have stayed in the Virgin Islands\n\nin the first place until the motion was granted.\n\n           Turning from Georcely’s conduct to that of his counsel,\n\nthe BIA has held that ineffective assistance of counsel can under\n\ncertain circumstances count as an exceptional circumstance. See In\n\nRe Rivera, 21 I. & N. Dec. 599, 602-03 (BIA 1996).                Indeed,   in\n\nimmigration cases, ineffective assistance is sometimes treated as\n\na basis for relief without regard to such a statutory hook, even\n\nthough such proceedings are civil and the Sixth Amendment guarantee\n\ninapplicable.5\n\n           However,   if     freely    indulged,    ineffective    assistance\n\nclaims   would   undermine    the     stringent    requirements   of   section\n\n1229a(b)(5)(C) (and much else in the statute besides) so the BIA\n\nhas insisted that the alien has to comply with the procedural\n\nrequirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).\n\n\n\n     5\n      This is no easy accomplishment since plenty of other civil\ncases have serious consequences, yet the party is still charged\nwith his lawyer’s errors; but the cases do treat immigration\nproceedings differently, using the due process clause as the\njustification. See, for example, Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 99 n.3\n(1st Cir. 2001); Hernandez v. Reno, 238 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.\n2001); and Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1988), for\npertinent background.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fThese include the filing of a bar complaint against counsel or\n\nadequately explaining why the complaint has not been filed.             See\n\nTang, 354 F.3d at 1196; In Re Rivera, 21 I. & N. Dec. at 603.           So\n\nfar as we know, neither has occurred in this case.\n\n          Although     we   have   hinted   that   full   compliance   with\n\nLozada's requirements might be excused in an appropriate case,\n\nBetouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 147, 150 (1st Cir. 2004), the Lozada\n\nrequirements generally make sense.          It is all too easy after the\n\nfact to denounce counsel and achieve a further delay while that\n\nissue is sorted out.    And in the absence of a complaint to the bar\n\nauthorities, counsel may have all too obvious an incentive to help\n\nhis client disparage the quality of the representation.\n\n          The present case is a perfect example.              A claim of\n\ninadequate representation has not been squarely made either before\n\nthe Board or on this appeal.       Counsel has sought to make his own\n\ncarelessness, if that is the proper characterization, an excuse for\n\nGeorcely’s failure to appear, while never conceding that his own\n\nconduct as counsel was ineffective representation--a standard that\n\nrequires a showing of significant incompetence and a likely adverse\n\neffect on the ultimate outcome. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n\n668, 691-92 (1984).\n\n          It is not even clear that counsel was “incompetent,”\n\nalthough surely more sloppy than he should have been.           There was\n\nprobably good reason to expect that the mail would arrive more\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fquickly, that (given the alleged INS lack of opposition) the motion\n\nwould be granted, and that a new hearing date in Miami would be\n\nset.       This    self-induced    expectation     does   not   excuse   the\n\n“exceptional      circumstances”   test    for   reopening,   but   counsel’s\n\nfailure to check in timely fashion that the motion was received and\n\ngranted is a default hardly unknown in law practice.6\n\n            In all events, the ineffective assistance claim has not\n\nbeen squarely raised; no reason for ignoring Lozada has been\n\nsuggested; and ineffective assistance and prejudice are far from\n\napparent on this record.     If Georcely wishes to pursue this issue,\n\nhe is free to attempt habeas proceedings in the district court.\n\nSeveral circuits have suggested this remedy is available for such\n\nclaims, e.g., Chmakov v. Blackman, 266 F.3d 210, 215 (3d Cir.\n\n2001), but we have no occasion to address the subject here.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      The immigration judge’s suggestion that this was a routine\npractice by this counsel is a different matter but the immigration\ncourt is aware of the situation and is free to address the problem.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f",

Dieudonna Georcely, a citizen of\n\nHaiti, arrived in the United States Virgin Islands on or about\n\nJanuary    25,   2002.      In   January    2002,   the   Immigration     and\n\nNaturalization Service (“INS”), as it was then named, charged\n\nGeorcely with removability under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2000)\n\nas an alien who had arrived in the United States without lawful\n\nauthority.       Georcely   conceded   removability   but   said   that    he\n\nintended to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture.1\n\n             On or about March 15, 2002, the immigration judge set a\n\nhearing to be held in St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, on April 29,\n\n2002.     Georcely had by then apparently relocated to Boca Raton,\n\nFlorida, to stay with a cousin.            On April 11, 2002, his lawyer\n\nmailed to the immigration judge a motion to change venue to Miami,\n\nFlorida.     The day before the scheduled hearing Georcely's counsel\n\ncalled the immigration court and was informed that the court had\n\nnot yet received the motion.\n\n             Neither Georcely nor his counsel appeared at the April\n\n29, 2002, hearing. As is permitted by the statute, the immigration\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Asylum and withholding of removal are both administrative\nmeasures, with somewhat different incidents, that can be invoked by\nan alien who is threatened with harm.

See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C),\n\n(e)(1) (2000).\n\n           The INS opposed the request to reopen and on July 18,\n\n2002, the immigration judge denied Georcely's motion.              The judge\n\nsaid that Georcely's attorney had \"filed many motions for reopening\n\nclaiming the same situation,\" that neither an alien nor his counsel\n\nwere entitled to assume that a motion to change venue will be\n\ngranted, and that Georcely's counsel was \"well aware\" that the\n\nmotion had not been granted because he had called the court the day\n\nbefore and was told the motion had not arrived.\n\n           On    August    16,   2002,    Georcely   filed   a    motion   to\n\nreconsider.     He said it was reasonable for him to believe that the\n\nmotion would be granted because at an earlier bond reduction\n\nhearing for Georcely, the immigration judge had inquired of the INS\n\nwhether it would oppose a change in venue to the Miami district if\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe petitioner so requested, and the INS attorney allegedly said\n\nshe would have no objection.      Georcely's counsel also argued that\n\nit was reasonable for him to think that his mailed motion would\n\narrive within 5 to 7 days--well within the 18 days before the\n\nhearing.\n\n             Georcely's counsel stated that his alien client \"had\n\ninquired repeatedly” as to whether the motion to change venue had\n\nbeen sent and was told that it had been.           Accordingly, Georcely\n\n“was unaware” that the motion had not been received or granted and\n\nthat he had not been excused from appearing in St. Thomas.        Even if\n\nGeorcely had known that he was not excused, said counsel, Georcely\n\ncould not have arrived in St. Thomas “on one day's notice.\"\n\n             Finally, Georcely’s counsel cited Matter of Lozada, 91 I.\n\n& N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), as holding that “ineffective assistance\n\nof   counsel    is   another   ground    for   finding   of   exceptional\n\ncircumstances.”      He described as “analogous”    another case (Matter\n\nof Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I. & N. Dec. 472 (BIA 1996)), where relief\n\nwas granted because counsel as a \"tactic of delay” deliberately\n\nmisinformed the respondent that he did not have to appear. Counsel\n\ncontinued:\n\n           Lozada required that a bar complaint be filed\n           in order to claim ineffective assistance of\n           counsel; however, [Esposito v.

At the threshold,\n\nwe face an issue of venue.         Shortly before the scheduled oral\n\nargument, Georcely's counsel moved to submit the case without\n\nargument (a motion we granted), observing in passing that the case\n\narose in the Virgin Islands and that the Third Circuit customarily\n\nhad jurisdiction over cases arising in the Virgin Islands.

This is so because a judicial order is\n\nnormally effective when filed and docketed, see United States v.\n\nFiorelli, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782849\"><a href=\"/opinion/782849/united-states-v-joseph-fiorelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287 (3d Cir. 2003); Willhauck v.

As it happens, the appeal in this case\n\nwas originally filed in the Eleventh Circuit, presumably because\n\ncounsel hoped to associate it with the Miami office of the INS.\n\nWhen the INS then moved for a transfer to this circuit, a motion\n\nnot opposed by Georcely, the INS said that “the immigration judge\n\ncompleted proceedings in San Juan, Puerto Rico.”\n\n            This view that the place of filing and docketing controls\n\nmust   be   tentative.    The    statutory    language   is   so    far     from\n\nconclusive, see Ramos v. Ashcroft, No. 03-4050, 2004 U.S. App.\n\nLexis 11692, at *2-*3 (7th Cir. June 15, 2004), that absent\n\nlegislative history, policy concerns would matter if they weighed\n\nheavily on either side.         Further facts might affect the outcome\n\n(e.g., perhaps the removal order for some reason was effective when\n\nannounced).       And,   most    important,    a   definitive      ruling    is\n\nunnecessary here because--as we will see--the venue issue has been\n\nforfeited.\n\n            In the interest of getting issues on the table, a further\n\ncomplication should be mentioned.         Even if the removal proceedings\n\nmight otherwise be deemed to have been completed in St. Thomas\n\n(contrary to our tentative assessment), the removal order itself\n\nwas followed by a motion to reopen, later denied without an oral\n\nhearing.     Both the motion and the order denying it were filed and\n\ndocketed in Guaynabo.     See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(a) (2004) (\"All\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fdocuments   and   applications     that   are    to   be   considered     in   a\n\nproceeding before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the\n\nImmigration Court having administrative control over the Record of\n\nProceeding.\")     In such a case, does Guaynabo thereby become the\n\nplace of completion?\n\n            On this issue, the government argues that the place where\n\nthe immigration judge \"completed\" the proceedings is the place\n\nwhere the    immigration   judge    issued   a   final     order   of   removal\n\n\"notwithstanding the fact that [an] alien subsequently files a\n\nmotion to reopen or reconsider, except when the Judge grants the\n\nPetitioner's motion and reopens proceedings.\" The government reads\n\nNwaokolo v.

Perhaps INS\n\nregulations would help toward a solution, see Ramos v. Ashcroft,\n\nsupra, 2004 U.S. App. Lexis 11692, at *2 (suggesting that course);\n\nCongress can certainly provide one.         Copies of this decision will\n\nbe sent to the appropriate congressional authorities and, in this\n\ncase, to the Attorney General.\n\n             Turning to the merits, we begin with the statutory\n\nframework.       When the BIA issues its own opinion, we review the\n\nBoard's decision and not the immigration judge's.              Albathani v.\n\nINS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200413\"><a href=\"/opinion/200413/albathani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).             The statute governing\n\njudicial review of in absentia removal orders confines review to\n\ncertain limited issues but among them is \"the reasons for the\n\nalien's not attending the proceeding.\"        8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(D).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fThe standard of review ordinarily varies with the nature of the\n\nissue, Bolton v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200983\"><a href=\"/opinion/200983/bolton-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7-8 & n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          An order for removal entered in absentia may be rescinded\n\n\"upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of\n\nthe order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to\n\nappear was because of exceptional circumstances.\" 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229a(b)(5)(C).   The statute says that this means “exceptional\n\ncircumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious\n\nillness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but\n\nnot including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of\n\nthe alien.\"   Id. § 1229a(e)(1).\n\n          It appears that Georcely knew that a hearing had been set\n\nin St. Thomas--the notice to him so provided--and that his lawyer\n\nhad moved for a transfer of the matter to Miami.   But there is no\n\nclaim that his lawyer told him that the motion had been granted.\n\nSo Georcely, as well as his lawyer, were obligated to appear at the\n\nSt. Thomas hearing.    Simply to assume that the motion would be\n\ngranted because the INS had not objected is not remotely an\n\nexceptional circumstance beyond the alien’s control.   See Tang v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"164184\"><a href=\"/opinion/164184/tang-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1195 (10th Cir. 2003).\n\n          The exceptional circumstances requirement, a fairly tough\n\none, was adopted by Congress precisely because failures to appear\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fat scheduled INS hearings had greatly burdened the agency.4                 To\n\ncharge Georcely with knowledge of his legal obligations may be\n\nunrealistic--he    apparently      does    not    read    English--but     such\n\nknowledge is expected of all, e.g., Atkins v. Parker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111465\"><a href=\"/opinion/111465/atkins-v-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n130 (1985); United States v.

If so, then he was ill-\n\nadvised to go to Miami in the first place.               Certainly he had no\n\nexcuse for waiting until the hearing date had passed to raise such\n\nan excuse.      Compare Herbert, 325 F.3d at 70, 72 (exceptional\n\ncircumstances    where   counsel   was     held   in   another   hearing   and\n\npromptly advised the immigration court); Romero-Morales v.

Prior\nto 1990, the statute required only that the alien show \"reasonable\ncause\" excusing his or her absence. Tang, 354 F.3d at 1194 n.3,\n1195 n.4; see also Maldonado-Perez v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516899\"><a href=\"/opinion/516899/pablo-maldonado-perez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (D.C.\nCir. 1989); Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.

See In\n\nRe Rivera, 21 I. & N. Dec. 599, 602-03 (BIA 1996).                Indeed,   in\n\nimmigration cases, ineffective assistance is sometimes treated as\n\na basis for relief without regard to such a statutory hook, even\n\nthough such proceedings are civil and the Sixth Amendment guarantee\n\ninapplicable.5\n\n           However,   if     freely    indulged,    ineffective    assistance\n\nclaims   would   undermine    the     stringent    requirements   of   section\n\n1229a(b)(5)(C) (and much else in the statute besides) so the BIA\n\nhas insisted that the alien has to comply with the procedural\n\nrequirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).\n\n\n\n     5\n      This is no easy accomplishment since plenty of other civil\ncases have serious consequences, yet the party is still charged\nwith his lawyer’s errors; but the cases do treat immigration\nproceedings differently, using the due process clause as the\njustification. See, for example, Jobe v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199254\"><a href=\"/opinion/199254/jobe-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99 n.3\n(1st Cir. 2001); Hernandez v.

INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511756\"><a href=\"/opinion/511756/julio-lozada-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1988), for\npertinent background.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fThese include the filing of a bar complaint against counsel or\n\nadequately explaining why the complaint has not been filed.             See\n\nTang, 354 F.3d at 1196; In Re Rivera, 21 I. & N. Dec. at 603.           So\n\nfar as we know, neither has occurred in this case.\n\n          Although     we   have   hinted   that   full   compliance   with\n\nLozada's requirements might be excused in an appropriate case,\n\nBetouche v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200850\"><a href=\"/opinion/200850/betouche-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (1st Cir. 2004), the Lozada\n\nrequirements generally make sense.          It is all too easy after the\n\nfact to denounce counsel and achieve a further delay while that\n\nissue is sorted out.    And in the absence of a complaint to the bar\n\nauthorities, counsel may have all too obvious an incentive to help\n\nhis client disparage the quality of the representation.\n\n          The present case is a perfect example.              A claim of\n\ninadequate representation has not been squarely made either before\n\nthe Board or on this appeal.       Counsel has sought to make his own\n\ncarelessness, if that is the proper characterization, an excuse for\n\nGeorcely’s failure to appear, while never conceding that his own\n\nconduct as counsel was ineffective representation--a standard that\n\nrequires a showing of significant incompetence and a likely adverse\n\neffect on the ultimate outcome. Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 691-92 (1984).\n\n          It is not even clear that counsel was “incompetent,”\n\nalthough surely more sloppy than he should have been.           There was\n\nprobably good reason to expect that the mail would arrive more\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fquickly, that (given the alleged INS lack of opposition) the motion\n\nwould be granted, and that a new hearing date in Miami would be\n\nset.       This    self-induced    expectation     does   not   excuse   the\n\n“exceptional      circumstances”   test    for   reopening,   but   counsel’s\n\nfailure to check in timely fashion that the motion was received and\n\ngranted is a default hardly unknown in law practice.6\n\n            In all events, the ineffective assistance claim has not\n\nbeen squarely raised; no reason for ignoring Lozada has been\n\nsuggested; and ineffective assistance and prejudice are far from\n\napparent on this record.     If Georcely wishes to pursue this issue,\n\nhe is free to attempt habeas proceedings in the district court.\n\nSeveral circuits have suggested this remedy is available for such\n\nclaims, e.g., Chmakov v. Blackman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775000\"><a href=\"/opinion/775000/aleksandr-chmakov-nadejda-chmakova-denis-chmakov-v-j-scott-blackman-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (3d Cir.\n\n2001), but we have no occasion to address the subject here.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      The immigration judge’s suggestion that this was a routine\npractice by this counsel is a different matter but the immigration\ncourt is aware of the situation and is free to address the problem.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f</pre>",
