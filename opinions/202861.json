Quiñones-Torres on brief pro se.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Thomas F.\nKlumper, Assistant United States Attorney, and Rosa Emilia\nRodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              July 30, 2007\n\f              Per Curiam.        This appeal follows the district court's\n\ndenial of pro se appellant Jessie A. Quinones-Torres's original\n\nhabeas petition, two post-judgment motions, and request for a\n\ncertificate of appealability (\"COA\").\n\n              Appellant pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute at least 50 but no more than 150 kilograms of cocaine in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and one count of conspiracy to\n\nlaunder monetary instruments in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).\n\nPursuant to a binding plea agreement under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(c)(1)(C), the government agreed to recommend a sentence of not\n\nmore than 228 months (or 19 years), and appellant reserved the\n\nright    to   request    the    lower    end   of    the   applicable   guideline\n\nsentencing range.         At sentencing, the court departed downward\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0, reduced appellant's criminal history\n\ncategory from II to I, and sentenced him to 204 months (or 17\n\nyears) on each count, to run concurrently.1\n\n              Appellant's       habeas     petition        claimed    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel at each stage of the proceedings in the\n\ndistrict court, as well as on direct appeal.                     Appellant also\n\nrequested     a   new   trial   based    on    the   discovery   of   purportedly\n\n\n\n     1\n        The district court also sentenced appellant to supervised\nrelease terms of three years on the first count and two years on\nthe second, to run concurrently. The supervised release terms were\nerroneously recorded as five years and three years on the written\njudgment.    We previously remanded this case to correct this\nclerical error.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fexculpatory evidence he claims was improperly withheld by the\n\ngovernment.      The government does not challenge our jurisdiction to\n\nreview either the post-judgment motions or the underlying judgment.\n\nWe   will   assume,   without   deciding,     that    appellant    has   timely\n\nappealed from the denial of his § 2255 petition, see,             e.g., United\n\nStates v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 2000), and thus review\n\nhis ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\n\n             Appellant asserts that his counsel should have sought to\n\ndismiss the indictment, but each of the arguments he raises in\n\nsupport of this assertion is wrong as a matter of either law or\n\nfact.   See, e.g., United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 695-96,\n\n702 (1st Cir.) (single conspiracy defined; government need not\n\nprove overt acts in furtherance of narcotics conspiracy), cert.\n\ndenied, 528 U.S. 917 (1999); United States v. Guzman, 85 F.3d 823,\n\n826 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1020 (1996) (under dual\n\nsovereignty rule, no double jeopardy bar to state and federal\n\nprosecution of same offense); United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56\n\nF.3d 319, 327 n.5 (1st Cir. 1995) (substantive crime and conspiracy\n\nto commit that crime not the same offense for double jeopardy\n\npurposes).\n\n             Appellant   correctly   argues    that    the    district   court\n\noffered     an   incomplete   description   of   the    law   governing     co-\n\nconspirator liability and sentencing and incorrectly referred to\n\nthe money laundering count as a \"criminal forfeiture\" count at his\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fchange of plea and sentencing hearings, but he has failed to\n\nidentify any prejudice he suffered as a result.               Appellant argues\n\nthat his counsel did not make any objections to the presentence\n\nreport, but fails to offer any factual or legal basis for the\n\nobjections he claims his counsel should have made.\n\n             Rather, the record shows that appellant never disputed\n\nthe description of his participation in the conspiracy, thus\n\ndistinguishing this case from United States v. Rodriguez-Gonzalez,\n\n433 F.3d 165, 167-68 (1st Cir. 2005), and United States v. Colin-\n\nSolis, 354 F.3d 101, 102-03 (1st Cir. 2004).             As is true of the\n\npetitioner in United States v. Isom, \"[w]e see no reason why a\n\nreasonable    attorney    would   have    felt   the   need    to   clarify   to\n\n[appellant] what was crystal clear from the hearing:                    he was\n\npleading guilty to conspiring to possess ... cocaine, and he was\n\nfacing a [lengthy] sentence.\"        85 F.3d 831, 835 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nAppellant entered into a binding Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement\n\nwith the government, and he received precisely the sentence for\n\nwhich   he   bargained.      Nothing     in   the   record     indicates   that\n\nappellant's personal circumstances fell outside the \"heartland\" for\n\nsentencing purposes.      United States v. Bogdan, 284 F.3d 324, 327\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n             On this record, appellant was not entitled to a hearing\n\non his habeas petition.      United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).      Neither was appellant entitled to a default\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fjudgment simply because the government did not file an opposition\n\nto his habeas petition.      Gordon v. Duran, 895 F.2d 610, 612 (9th\n\nCir. 1990) (collecting cases).     Moreover, on his conclusory claim\n\nthat   the   government   improperly    withheld   exculpatory   evidence,\n\nappellant has not shown that the government failed to provide\n\ninformation that amounted to a \"material omission tantamount to a\n\nmisrepresentation\" or engaged in \"some particularly pernicious form\n\nof impermissible conduct ....\"     Ferrara v. United States, 456 F.3d\n\n278, 291 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing United States v. Brady, 397 U.S.\n\n742, 757 (1970), and United States v. Bouthot, 878 F.2d 1506, 1511\n\n(1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n             Thus, it is clear that no reasonable jurist would find\n\nthat the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims\n\nwas \"debatable or wrong,\" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 377-\n\n78 (2003) (quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000)),\n\nand there was no abuse of discretion in the court's denial of\n\nappellant's Rule 59(e) motions.        Cintron-Lorenzo v. Departmento de\n\nAsuntos Del Consumidor, 312 F.3d 522, 527 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
