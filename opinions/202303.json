R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 05-9008\n\n                     IN RE:      PATRICIA BUSHAY,\n\n                               Debtor,\n                        _____________________\n\n                           PATRICIA BUSHAY,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                           MARIE MCDONNELL,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY\n              APPELLATE PANEL FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     David G.

In this appeal from a final decision of the\n\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\"), appellant Patricia Bushay, a\n\nChapter 13 debtor, seeks further review of the bankruptcy court's\n\ndismissal of her adversary complaint for failure to comply with a\n\ndiscovery order. We review the bankruptcy court's ruling for abuse\n\nof discretion.   See Bachier-Ortiz v. Colon-Mendoza, 331 F.3d 193,\n\n194 (1st Cir. 2003).    Essentially for the reasons stated by the BAP\n\nin its thorough decision, see In re Bushay, 327 B.R. 695 (1st Cir.\n\nB.A.P. 2005), we affirm.      We add only that appellant's lack of\n\nnotice argument is based on an unreasonably narrow reading of the\n\norder to show cause, and her contention that she lacked notice that\n\nthe   court   would    consider   her   well-documented   history   of\n\nnoncompliance with discovery obligations over the course of the\n\nproceedings in addition to her noncompliance with the specific\n\ndiscovery order is belied by the transcript of the proceedings that\n\npreceded the show cause order.\n\n          To the extent appellant challenges the bankruptcy court's\n\nrevision of the procedural basis for denying appellee's motion for\n\nsummary judgment following its initial dismissal of the complaint,\n\nwe see no error nor discernable harm to appellant.\n\n          Affirmed.
