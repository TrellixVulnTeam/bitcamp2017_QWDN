Ernest C.

Lockhart and Gerard B. Sullivan, Assistant U.S.\nAttorneys, and Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n                            January 12, 2007\n\f           Per Curiam.      Joseph Nicolella (\"Nicolella\") appeals from\n\nhis 108-month, bottom-of-guidelines sentence on the grounds that\n\nthe district court erred in applying the kidnapping guideline and\n\nthat the resulting sentence was unreasonably high.1             After careful\n\nconsideration of the parties' briefs and the underlying record, we\n\naffirm the sentence for the reasons discussed below.\n\n           In return for Nicolella's pleading guilty to two counts\n\nof interstate domestic violence and two counts of interstate\n\nviolation of a protection order, the government dismissed a fifth\n\ncount of kidnapping arising from the same incident of domestic\n\nviolence as the other counts.           As Nicolella concedes, despite the\n\ndismissal of the kidnapping count, it was permissible for the\n\ndistrict court to consider the conduct underlying that count in\n\nsentencing.     See USSG § 1B1.3 comment. (backg'd); United States v.\n\nMarks, 365 F.3d 101, 107 n.4 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Nevertheless, Nicolella argues that the district court\n\nerred in applying the kidnapping guideline in calculating his\n\nadvisory guideline range for three reasons.            First, he argues that\n\nhis   conduct   did   not   rise   to    the   level   of   kidnapping.   The\n\ngovernment makes a strong argument that Nicolella waived that\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      He also argues that United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n(2005), was wrongly decided but recognizes that this court has no\npower to address that claim.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fargument by first raising it and then abandoning it at sentencing.2\n\nSee United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(finding it difficult to conceive of a more conspicuous example of\n\na [waiver]\" than when \"[a] party . . . identifies an issue, and\n\nthen explicitly withdraws it\").                 Moreover, as the district court\n\nrecognized, the absence of aggravating factors, such as a ransom\n\ndemand, sexual assault, or use of a dangerous weapon, does not mean\n\nthat the conduct did not constitute a kidnapping but only that no\n\nenhancement based on such factors was warranted.                            See USSG §\n\n2A4.1(b)(1)-(5).\n\n               Nicolella's second argument is that the district court\n\nerred in applying the kidnapping guideline, USSG § 2A4.1, rather\n\nthan the stalking or domestic violence guideline, USSG § 2A6.2.\n\nWhile       Nicolella   is    correct     in    starting      with    the   stalking    or\n\ndomestic violence guideline, which applies to his offenses of\n\nconviction under USSG App. A, his argument ignores or misreads the\n\ncross-reference contained in that very guideline.\n\n               That cross-reference, which the district court applied,\n\nprovides that \"[i]f the offense involved the commission of another\n\ncriminal offense, [the court should] apply the offense guideline .\n\n.   .   most    applicable      to   that      other   criminal       offense,   if    the\n\nresulting       offense      level   is   greater      than    that    determined      [by\n\n\n        2\n      By the end of the sentencing hearing, defense counsel had\nconceded that \"the elements of kidnapping are there\" and no longer\ndisputed \"[t]he fact that the kidnapping was present.\"\n\n                                            -3-\n\fapplication    of   the   base   offense    level      and    specific   offense\n\ncharacteristics for stalking or domestic violence].\"                     USSG §\n\n2A6.2(c)(1) (emphasis added).        Here, as discussed above, there is\n\nno question that the offenses of conviction involved the commission\n\nof kidnapping, that the guideline most applicable to the offense of\n\nkidnapping is section 2A4.1, and that the resulting offense level\n\nunder the kidnapping guideline is greater than that determined\n\nunder the stalking or domestic violence guideline.3               Accordingly,\n\nthe district court correctly applied the kidnapping guideline in\n\ndetermining Nicolella's offense level.\n\n            Nicollela's third argument, raised for the first time on\n\nappeal, is that, because use of the kidnapping cross-reference\n\ndramatically    increased    his    sentence,    the     district    court   was\n\nrequired to find the underlying facts by clear and convincing\n\nevidence.     The short answer to that argument is that even if a\n\nhigher standard of proof were constitutionally required in these\n\ncircumstances--a     question      that    we   need    not     decide   here4--\n\n\n     3\n      Under the kidnapping guideline, Nicolella's offense level was\n32, USSG § 2A4.1(a), while under the domestic violence guideline,\neven with a four-level increase for aggravating factors, his\noffense level would have been only 22, USSG § 2A6.2(a),(b).\n     4\n      Before Booker, we rejected that argument, United States v.\nLombard, 102 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1996), and have not had occasion\nto revisit it since then. Other circuits that have considered this\nargument post-Booker have reached varying conclusions. See United\nStates v. Reuter, 463 F.3d 792, 792-93 (7th Cir. 2006) (collecting\ncases).   Under those circumstances, any error in applying the\npreponderance of the evidence standard would not be sufficiently\n\"plain\" to warrant relief based on this unpreserved claim. See\n\n                                     -4-\n\fNicolella's admission of the underlying facts and his concession\n\nthat the elements of kidnapping were met renders the standard of\n\nproof irrelevant.\n\n            As   a   fallback    argument,    Nicolella     argues    that   his\n\nresulting    108-month    sentence   was     unreasonably    high    under   the\n\nstandards we articulated in United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d 514, 517 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).           Specifically, he argues\n\nonly that, in declining to impose a lesser sentence, the district\n\ncourt \"outweighed the severity of his crime.\"               That argument is\n\nmeritless.    The district court's characterization of the crime as\n\n\"very, very serious\" is amply supported by the record--including\n\ngruesome    photographs    and   graphic     grand-jury   testimony     of   the\n\nvictim--indicating that Nicolella repeatedly struck her in the face\n\nand threatened to kill her if she attempted to escape.               On appeal,\n\nNicolella points to no countervailing factors.            And, in any event,\n\nthe amount of weight given to the relevant factors is for the\n\ndistrict court, not an appellate court, to determine.                   United\n\nStates v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Affirmed.     See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\nUnited States v. Diaz, 285 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
