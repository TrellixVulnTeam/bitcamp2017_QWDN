Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                            Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n                  Farris* and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stephen Feldman with whom Feldman & Feldman was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Donald Feith, Assistant United States Attorney with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                                April 23, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            FARRIS, Circuit Judge.     Larry Stallings alleges that the\n\ndistrict court erred by admitting evidence of his prior wire\n\nconviction because admitting the evidence violated both a New\n\nHampshire district court local rule and Federal Rules of Evidence\n\n403 and 404(b).         We review applications of Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence 403 and 404(b) and district court local rules for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    United States v. Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2008); Crowe v. Bouduc, 334 F.3d 124, 134 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nCrowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 361 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The court admitted Stallings’s prior conviction in the\n\ninterest of justice because it found 1) the government did not act\n\nin bad faith; 2) the evidence was highly probative; and 3) there\n\nwas   no   unfair   prejudice   to   Stallings    as    a   result   of   the\n\nuntimeliness. District courts have “broad latitude in administering\n\nlocal rules,” Air Line Pilots Ass’n v. Precision Valley Aviation,\n\n26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 1994), and they may choose to forgive a\n\nparty’s violation of a local rule.          See United States v. Diaz-\n\nVillafone, 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1989). There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            Stallings    is   incorrect    that   the   district     court’s\n\nadmission of his prior wire fraud conviction violated Federal Rules\n\nof Evidence 403 and 404(b).      Evidence of his prior conviction was\n\noffered to rebut Stallings’s claim that he was unaware that he was\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fengaged in fraud.    His prior conviction thus tended to prove\n\nintent, knowledge, and absence of mistake.    Its admission did not\n\nviolate Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). “Only rarely—and in\n\nextraordinarily compelling circumstances—will [this court] reverse\n\na district court’s on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative\n\nweighing of probative value and unfair effect.”   United States v.\n\nWhitney, 524 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2008).
