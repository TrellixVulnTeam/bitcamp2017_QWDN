Camille Vélez-Rivé, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Nicolás Nogueras Cartagena and Julio C. Alejandro Serrano on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Jaime E. Toro-Monserrate and Toro, Colón, Mullet, Rivera &\nSifre, P.S.C. on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          March 9, 2009\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.            This is an appeal in a civil\n\nrights action.      The plaintiff (appellant here) claims that the\n\ndefendants terminated his banking and credit card relationships for\n\ndiscriminatory     reasons.    On     December    13,    2007,   the    parties\n\nconsented to have the case heard and determined by a magistrate\n\njudge.    See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).             After a period of pretrial\n\ndiscovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment.\n\n           The time for filing an opposition expired without any\n\nsuch opposition appearing.     Accordingly, the magistrate judge made\n\na notation on the docket deeming the summary judgment motion\n\n\"unopposed.\"   Only thereafter did the plaintiff serve an untimely\n\nmotion   seeking    a   continuance    and     leave    to   conduct    further\n\ndiscovery.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\n           In a detailed order, entered on April 9, 2008, the\n\nmagistrate judge denied the untimely Rule 56(f) motion.                Then the\n\nmagistrate judge, in a thoughtful opinion dated April 24, 2008,\n\ngranted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff\n\nmoved for reconsideration and, on May 16, 2008, the magistrate\n\njudge denied that motion.     This timely appeal followed.\n\n           We need not tarry.         We consistently have espoused the\n\nview that when a lower court accurately takes the measure of a\n\ncase, applies the correct legal rules, and articulates a convincing\n\nrationale, \"an appellate court should refrain from writing at\n\nlength to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\"\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fLawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co. of Am., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); accord, e.g., Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d\n\n381, 383 (1st Cir. 2000); Holders Capital Corp. v. Cal. Union Ins.\n\nCo. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36,\n\n38 (1st Cir. 1993).    The case at hand fits within the parameters of\n\nthat prescription; the magistrate judge's opinion is both closely\n\nreasoned and clearly correct.        Accordingly, unless there is some\n\nother meritorious ground for appeal, we would uphold the entry of\n\nsummary    judgment   for   essentially   the   reasons   limned   in   that\n\nopinion.\n\n            The plaintiff suggests one such ground: he argues that\n\nthe magistrate judge erred in denying his Rule 56(f) motion.            That\n\nissue was adverted to only fleetingly in the magistrate judge's\n\nopinion; her reasoning was contained in a separate (earlier) order.\n\nWe must, therefore, examine the contents of that order as well.\n\n            We begin with the standard of review: \"a district court's\n\ndenial of a Rule 56(f) motion is reviewed on appeal solely for\n\nabuse of discretion.\"       Rivera-Torres v. Rey-Hernández, 502 F.3d 7,\n\n10 (1st Cir. 2007).     There was no abuse of discretion here.\n\n            Writing at length about the plaintiff's Rule 56(f) motion\n\nwould serve no useful purpose.       As we said in Rivera-Torres, \"the\n\nprophylaxis of Rule 56(f) is not available merely for the asking.\"\n\nId.   Thus, one\n\n            who seeks to invoke the rule must act with due\n            diligence . . . [and] . . . must submit to the\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            trial    court   an    affidavit   or    other\n            authoritative document showing (i) good cause\n            for his inability to have discovered or\n            marshalled the necessary facts earlier in the\n            proceedings; (ii) a plausible basis for\n            believing that additional facts probably exist\n            and can be retrieved within a reasonable time;\n            and (iii) an explanation of how those facts,\n            if collected, will suffice to defeat the\n            pending summary judgment motion.\n\nId.   The instant motion cannot survive scrutiny under this test.\n\n            To begin, the plaintiff failed to exercise due diligence.\n\nHis Rule 56(f) motion, filed after the expiration of the time for\n\nopposing the summary judgment motion had elapsed and after the\n\nmagistrate judge had deemed that motion unopposed, was too late.\n\nSee D.P.R.R. 7.1(b).        To cinch matters, the motion, which the\n\nmagistrate     judge   understandably     termed    \"a    subterfuge,\"    was\n\nunaccompanied by any affidavit and manifestly insufficient to\n\nsatisfy the Rivera-Torres benchmarks or to engage the gears of Rule\n\n56(f).\n\n            We need go no further.      Having read the briefs with care\n\nand canvassed the record in its entirety, we find the magistrate\n\njudge's     handling   of   this   matter   to     be    fully   supportable.\n\nConsequently, we summarily affirm the judgment below. See 1st Cir.\n\nLoc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
