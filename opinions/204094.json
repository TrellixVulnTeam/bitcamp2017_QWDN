A    jury   convicted    Defendant-\n\nAppellant Sandry García-García of carjacking in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119(2) and of brandishing a firearm during and in\n\nrelation   to   a   crime   of   violence   in    violation     of   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).     The district court denied Defendant’s motions\n\nfor acquittal and a new trial and sentenced him to a total of 181\n\nmonths.    On appeal, Defendant first argues the district court\n\n“lacked jurisdiction” because the victim was not driving or a\n\npassenger in the vehicle when the alleged carjacking took place.\n\nDefendant, then, asserts that because he was not properly convicted\n\nof an underlying crime of violence, his firearm conviction cannot\n\nstand for “lack of jurisdiction.”               Defendant also claims that\n\nbecause police only conducted photo lineups, the out-of-court\n\nidentifications     were    impermissibly        suggestive.1        Exercising\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Defendant additionally argues the jury pool was not fairly\nrepresentative because he was “tried and convicted by a jury in a\nDistrict where 84.1% of all Puerto Rico residents do not command\nEnglish ‘very well.’” Brief of Defendant-Appellant at 19. Other\nthan that bald assertion, Defendant provides no legal or factual\nsupport for such a claim. We, therefore, refuse to consider it.\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(“[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\nsome effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.”).\nRegardless, we have repeatedly rejected such a claim. See United\nStates v. Rodríguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 2009)\n(explaining that an English proficiency requirement for jurors,\nincluding in Puerto Rico, does not violate a defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury made up of a fair cross section of the\ncommunity); United States v. González-Vélez, 466 F.3d 27, 40 (1st\nCir. 2006) (same); United States v. Dubón-Otero, 292 F.3d 1, 17\n(1st Cir. 2002)(same).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fjurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 1291, we reject his arguments and\n\naffirm the district court.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Because the attack on Federico López-Villafañe (“López”),\n\nwhich gave rise to Defendant’s present convictions, has already\n\ncome before this court in United States v. García-Álvarez, 541 F.3d\n\n8 (1st Cir. 2008), we recite here only the minimum facts necessary\n\nto explain our holding.     On the morning of April 12, 2006, López\n\nexited his apartment building and walked towards his car.      As he\n\napproached his car, four assailants attacked him.       Three of the\n\nassailants covered their faces with t-shirts. At the moment of the\n\nattack, López was standing about a foot and half away from his car.\n\nAccording to López, two of the four attackers carried nickel-plated\n\nautomatic pistols.   During the scuffle, the assailants’ t-shirt-\n\nmasks fell, revealing their faces.     López would later testify that\n\nDefendant hit him with a nickel-plated pistol on his forehead,\n\nface, knees, and shins.   The violence escalated.   Another attacker\n\nused a rock to beat López while the others held him.       They then\n\nforced him into his building’s basement.    The attackers duct taped\n\nhis feet, hands and eyes.    They demanded money, held a gun to his\n\nhead, and threatened to kill him if he did not cooperate.       They\n\ntook his house keys, car keys, and pocket money.    At one point, the\n\nattackers went upstairs to López’s apartment to search for money.\n\nEventually, López fled the basement.         A neighbor’s bodyguard\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\farrived and called the police.           López then saw his car leaving from\n\nthe opposite side of the building.                    He was later taken to a\n\nhospital where he received stitches to his head and legs and,\n\nlater, knee surgery.\n\n            Three     days     later,    police       showed     López    dozens    of\n\nphotographs at police headquarters.               He marked about twenty, but\n\ndid not definitively identify any one picture.                     A month later,\n\npolice showed him four to five sheets, each containing six to nine\n\nphotographs. From this array, López identified Defendant as one of\n\nthe men who assaulted him and took his car.                            He also later\n\nidentified Defendant in court.\n\n            López’s    maid,      Clemencia     Lewis,    also    encountered      the\n\nattackers   when    they      searched    his   apartment        for    money.     She\n\ntestified   that    she    came      face-to-face     with     Defendant,      another\n\nassailant pointed a silver gun at her, and a third person stood by.\n\nLewis further testified Defendant pushed her onto the floor, tied\n\nher hands and feet, and covered her head with a towel.                             She\n\nidentified Defendant as her attacker from a photo lineup the month\n\nfollowing the attack and later identified him again in court.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            Defendant        first    argues    the     district       court     lacked\n\njurisdiction as to his § 2119(2) conviction because López was not\n\ndriving or a passenger in his vehicle when the alleged carjacking\n\ntook place.    “Whoever, with the intent to cause death or serious\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fbodily harm takes a motor vehicle that has been transported,\n\nshipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the\n\nperson    or    presence   of   another   by   force   and   violence   or   by\n\nintimidation, or attempts to do so,” resulting in “serious bodily\n\ninjury,” is guilty of the crime of carjacking punishable by up to\n\ntwenty-five years in prison.          18 U.S.C. § 2119(2).         Defendant\n\nargues the carjacking statute requires the Government to prove he\n\nintended to cause death or serious bodily harm at the precise\n\nmoment he demanded or took control over the car by force or\n\nintimidation.        He reasons that because the evidence at trial\n\nindicated he and the other assailants did not drive López’s car\n\naway for twenty to thirty minutes after they beat, bound, and stole\n\nthe car keys from López, the Government failed to establish he\n\npossessed the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm at the\n\ntime the car was actually stolen.\n\n               Defendant’s second argument flows from the first.             Any\n\nperson who brandishes a firearm during and in relation to any crime\n\nof violence shall be sentenced to a minimum of seven years in\n\nprison.    18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).          Defendant claims because\n\nhis conviction of a crime of violence was improper for “lack of\n\njurisdiction,” his § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) firearm conviction is also\n\nfatally flawed for “lack of jurisdiction.”\n\n               We note for the sake of clarity and accuracy Defendant’s\n\nfirst and second arguments are inherently not jurisdictional.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fEssentially, he asserts the Government did not prove all elements\n\nof the crimes of §§ 2119(2) and 924(c)(1) because it failed, first,\n\nto show he intended to cause death or serious bodily harm at the\n\nmoment of the taking of the vehicle and, second, that he was\n\nproperly convicted of a crime of violence.   Lack of evidence as to\n\nan element of a federal crime, however, means the Government has\n\nnot met its burden sufficient to support a conviction, not that the\n\ndistrict court is deprived of jurisdiction to adjudicate the case.\n\nSee United States v. González-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 301 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (explaining that the argument that the facts are insufficient\n\nto satisfy the “results in serious bodily injury” element of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119(2) did not call into question the district court’s\n\njurisdiction, but rather the sufficiency of the evidence relating\n\nto the defendant’s guilt).   A federal criminal case generally lies\n\nwithin the subject matter jurisdiction of a district court if the\n\nindictment charges that the defendant committed a crime defined by\n\nCongress as a federal crime.   United States v. González, 311 F.3d\n\n440, 442 (1st Cir. 2002).      Therefore, unless Congress provided\n\notherwise, subject matter jurisdiction existed in the present case\n\nbecause Defendant was charged in district court under §§ 2119(2)\n\nand 924(c)(1), which are federal criminal statutes.        See id.\n\n(explaining that unless Congress provided otherwise, subject matter\n\njurisdiction existed in the case because the defendant was charged\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fin district court under 46 U.S.C. § 1903, which is a federal\n\ncriminal statute).\n\n            Therefore, Defendant’s argument, properly characterized,\n\nchallenges the sufficiency of the Government’s evidence, not the\n\ndistrict        court’s   constitutional     or     statutory    authority     to\n\nadjudicate the case against him.           Id.    Construing his argument as\n\na challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his\n\nconvictions, we review de novo, “evaluating whether, after viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.”             García-Álvarez, 541 F.3d at\n\n15 (quoting United States v. Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 48-49\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted)).\n\n            Even      properly   construed,       Defendant’s     argument     is\n\nunpersuasive.       Last year, we faced a similar argument made by one\n\nof Defendant’s compatriots in this criminal enterprise (who, as it\n\nhappens, is Defendant’s uncle).           In García-Álvarez, we explained\n\n§ 2119(2) requires the Government to establish the element of\n\nintent to cause death or serious bodily harm at the time the\n\ndefendant takes control of the motor vehicle.               García-Álvarez, 541\n\nF.3d at 15–16.       The victim need not be in close proximity to the\n\nmotor vehicle at the time of the taking.                  Id. at 16.     On these\n\nfacts,     we     concluded   Defendant     and     his    accomplices     gained\n\nconstructive control over López’s motor vehicle in the apartment\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbuilding’s basement, when they forced López to turn over his car\n\nkeys.    Id.    (citing United States v. Savarese, 385 F.3d 15, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2004)).       We also determined that the assailants’ intent to\n\ncause     death    or    serious   bodily   harm   was   “more     than   amply\n\nestablished” by the assailants’ use of force, including the use of\n\nfirearms, and the infliction of serious bodily harm upon López.\n\nId.     Moreover, “it was only upon being threatened with further\n\nviolence and even death that López surrendered his car keys.”               Id.\n\nGiven that the attackers’ assault on López left him bleeding and in\n\nneed of surgery, we concluded “it is beyond question that the\n\nassailants possessed the requisite intent to cause death or serious\n\nbodily injury.”         Id.\n\n               In ordinary circumstances, “it is axiomatic that new\n\npanels are bound by prior panel decisions in the absence of\n\nsupervening authority” from the Supreme Court or an en banc court.\n\nUnited States v. Holloway, 499 F.3d 114, 118 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nDefendant acknowledged this rule at oral argument but seemed to\n\nsuggest     that    extraordinary     circumstances      existed    warranting\n\nreversal of our fellow panel because the García-Álvarez opinion\n\nconflicted with the Supreme Court’s precedent in Holloway v. United\n\nStates, 526 U.S. 1, 12 (1999).         We understand Holloway to clarify\n\nthat “[t]he intent requirement of § 2119 is satisfied when the\n\nGovernment proves that at the moment the defendant demanded or took\n\ncontrol over the driver’s automobile the defendant possessed the\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fintent to seriously harm or kill the driver if necessary to steal\n\nthe car (or, alternatively, if unnecessary to steal the car).”\n\nHolloway, 526 U.S. at 12.        This is precisely the basis of our\n\nholding in García-Álvarez, in which we determined that at the\n\nmoment Defendant and the other assailants “took control” over\n\nLópez’s car by taking his keys from him at gunpoint, they possessed\n\nthe intent to seriously harm or kill him, satisfying § 2119's\n\nintent requirement.     Because we find no conflict between García-\n\nÁlvarez    and    Holloway     and,      therefore,         no   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, we conclude we are bound by the panel’s holding in\n\nGarcía-Álvarez that the intent requirement is satisfied when a\n\ndefendant intends to cause death or serious bodily injury at the\n\ntime he takes control of the vehicle, whether or not the car is\n\nimmediately driven.      The evidence in this case was more than\n\nsufficient to permit the jury to find that Defendant possessed such\n\nintent.   Accordingly, we affirm Defendant’s § 2119(2) and related\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) convictions.\n\n                                     III.\n\n          Defendant’s        photo     lineup      argument         is   equally\n\nunpersuasive.    Defendant contends that because his out-of-court\n\nidentifications were conducted only by photo spreads, they were\n\nimpermissibly    suggestive,    giving      rise   to   a    very    substantial\n\nlikelihood of misidentification.        The district court rejected this\n\nargument and denied his motion to suppress the out-of-court photo\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\flineup identifications.     The court reasoned that an identification\n\nneed not be done through a live lineup and, without any specific\n\nclaim of impermissibly suggestive procedure, the reliability of a\n\nphoto lineup is a question of credibility for the jury.\n\n            We “uphold a district court’s denial of a motion to\n\nsuppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.”\n\nUnited States v. de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nNo one contests that the police only conducted photo lineups to\n\nidentify Defendant.   We note, however, the police tried to conduct\n\na live lineup shortly after the incident, but Defendant fled,\n\nmaking that impossible.      Furthermore, Defendant has provided no\n\nlegal precedent to support his claim that conducting photo lineups\n\nalone, instead of a live lineup, is impermissibly suggestive.           He\n\nalso has not provided any evidence that the way in which the police\n\nconducted   the   photo   lineups   was    impermissibly   suggestive   or\n\nunreliable. His claim consequently fails. See García-Álvarez, 541\n\nF.3d at 15 (explaining that because the defendant did “not flag any\n\nof the procedures utilized during this [photo] identification as\n\nimpermissibly suggestive,” his claim failed).\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f",

García-Álvarez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203467\"><a href=\"/opinion/203467/united-states-v-garcia-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2008), we recite here only the minimum facts necessary\n\nto explain our holding.     On the morning of April 12, 2006, López\n\nexited his apartment building and walked towards his car.      As he\n\napproached his car, four assailants attacked him.       Three of the\n\nassailants covered their faces with t-shirts. At the moment of the\n\nattack, López was standing about a foot and half away from his car.\n\nAccording to López, two of the four attackers carried nickel-plated\n\nautomatic pistols.   During the scuffle, the assailants’ t-shirt-\n\nmasks fell, revealing their faces.     López would later testify that\n\nDefendant hit him with a nickel-plated pistol on his forehead,\n\nface, knees, and shins.   The violence escalated.   Another attacker\n\nused a rock to beat López while the others held him.       They then\n\nforced him into his building’s basement.    The attackers duct taped\n\nhis feet, hands and eyes.    They demanded money, held a gun to his\n\nhead, and threatened to kill him if he did not cooperate.       They\n\ntook his house keys, car keys, and pocket money.    At one point, the\n\nattackers went upstairs to López’s apartment to search for money.\n\nEventually, López fled the basement.         A neighbor’s bodyguard\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\farrived and called the police.           López then saw his car leaving from\n\nthe opposite side of the building.                    He was later taken to a\n\nhospital where he received stitches to his head and legs and,\n\nlater, knee surgery.\n\n            Three     days     later,    police       showed     López    dozens    of\n\nphotographs at police headquarters.               He marked about twenty, but\n\ndid not definitively identify any one picture.                     A month later,\n\npolice showed him four to five sheets, each containing six to nine\n\nphotographs. From this array, López identified Defendant as one of\n\nthe men who assaulted him and took his car.                            He also later\n\nidentified Defendant in court.\n\n            López’s    maid,      Clemencia     Lewis,    also    encountered      the\n\nattackers   when    they      searched    his   apartment        for    money.     She\n\ntestified   that    she    came      face-to-face     with     Defendant,      another\n\nassailant pointed a silver gun at her, and a third person stood by.\n\nLewis further testified Defendant pushed her onto the floor, tied\n\nher hands and feet, and covered her head with a towel.                             She\n\nidentified Defendant as her attacker from a photo lineup the month\n\nfollowing the attack and later identified him again in court.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            Defendant        first    argues    the     district       court     lacked\n\njurisdiction as to his § 2119(2) conviction because López was not\n\ndriving or a passenger in his vehicle when the alleged carjacking\n\ntook place.    “Whoever, with the intent to cause death or serious\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fbodily harm takes a motor vehicle that has been transported,\n\nshipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the\n\nperson    or    presence   of   another   by   force   and   violence   or   by\n\nintimidation, or attempts to do so,” resulting in “serious bodily\n\ninjury,” is guilty of the crime of carjacking punishable by up to\n\ntwenty-five years in prison.          18 U.S.C. § 2119(2).         Defendant\n\nargues the carjacking statute requires the Government to prove he\n\nintended to cause death or serious bodily harm at the precise\n\nmoment he demanded or took control over the car by force or\n\nintimidation.        He reasons that because the evidence at trial\n\nindicated he and the other assailants did not drive López’s car\n\naway for twenty to thirty minutes after they beat, bound, and stole\n\nthe car keys from López, the Government failed to establish he\n\npossessed the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm at the\n\ntime the car was actually stolen.\n\n               Defendant’s second argument flows from the first.             Any\n\nperson who brandishes a firearm during and in relation to any crime\n\nof violence shall be sentenced to a minimum of seven years in\n\nprison.    18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).          Defendant claims because\n\nhis conviction of a crime of violence was improper for “lack of\n\njurisdiction,” his § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) firearm conviction is also\n\nfatally flawed for “lack of jurisdiction.”\n\n               We note for the sake of clarity and accuracy Defendant’s\n\nfirst and second arguments are inherently not jurisdictional.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fEssentially, he asserts the Government did not prove all elements\n\nof the crimes of §§ 2119(2) and 924(c)(1) because it failed, first,\n\nto show he intended to cause death or serious bodily harm at the\n\nmoment of the taking of the vehicle and, second, that he was\n\nproperly convicted of a crime of violence.   Lack of evidence as to\n\nan element of a federal crime, however, means the Government has\n\nnot met its burden sufficient to support a conviction, not that the\n\ndistrict court is deprived of jurisdiction to adjudicate the case.\n\nSee United States v. González-Mercado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201515\"><a href=\"/opinion/201515/united-states-v-gonzalez-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (explaining that the argument that the facts are insufficient\n\nto satisfy the “results in serious bodily injury” element of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119(2) did not call into question the district court’s\n\njurisdiction, but rather the sufficiency of the evidence relating\n\nto the defendant’s guilt).   A federal criminal case generally lies\n\nwithin the subject matter jurisdiction of a district court if the\n\nindictment charges that the defendant committed a crime defined by\n\nCongress as a federal crime.   United States v. González, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200216\"><a href=\"/opinion/200216/united-states-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 442 (1st Cir. 2002).      Therefore, unless Congress provided\n\notherwise, subject matter jurisdiction existed in the present case\n\nbecause Defendant was charged in district court under §§ 2119(2)\n\nand 924(c)(1), which are federal criminal statutes.        See id.\n\n(explaining that unless Congress provided otherwise, subject matter\n\njurisdiction existed in the case because the defendant was charged\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fin district court under 46 U.S.C. § 1903, which is a federal\n\ncriminal statute).\n\n            Therefore, Defendant’s argument, properly characterized,\n\nchallenges the sufficiency of the Government’s evidence, not the\n\ndistrict        court’s   constitutional     or     statutory    authority     to\n\nadjudicate the case against him.           Id.    Construing his argument as\n\na challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his\n\nconvictions, we review de novo, “evaluating whether, after viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.”             García-Álvarez, 541 F.3d at\n\n15 (quoting United States v. Meléndez-Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201783\"><a href=\"/opinion/201783/united-states-v-melendez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48-49\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted)).\n\n            Even      properly   construed,       Defendant’s     argument     is\n\nunpersuasive.       Last year, we faced a similar argument made by one\n\nof Defendant’s compatriots in this criminal enterprise (who, as it\n\nhappens, is Defendant’s uncle).           In García-Álvarez, we explained\n\n§ 2119(2) requires the Government to establish the element of\n\nintent to cause death or serious bodily harm at the time the\n\ndefendant takes control of the motor vehicle.               García-Álvarez, 541\n\nF.3d at 15–16.       The victim need not be in close proximity to the\n\nmotor vehicle at the time of the taking.                  Id. at 16.     On these\n\nfacts,     we     concluded   Defendant     and     his    accomplices     gained\n\nconstructive control over López’s motor vehicle in the apartment\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbuilding’s basement, when they forced López to turn over his car\n\nkeys.    Id.    (citing United States v. Savarese, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201254\"><a href=\"/opinion/201254/united-states-v-savarese/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2004)).       We also determined that the assailants’ intent to\n\ncause     death    or    serious   bodily   harm   was   “more     than   amply\n\nestablished” by the assailants’ use of force, including the use of\n\nfirearms, and the infliction of serious bodily harm upon López.\n\nId.     Moreover, “it was only upon being threatened with further\n\nviolence and even death that López surrendered his car keys.”               Id.\n\nGiven that the attackers’ assault on López left him bleeding and in\n\nneed of surgery, we concluded “it is beyond question that the\n\nassailants possessed the requisite intent to cause death or serious\n\nbodily injury.”         Id.\n\n               In ordinary circumstances, “it is axiomatic that new\n\npanels are bound by prior panel decisions in the absence of\n\nsupervening authority” from the Supreme Court or an en banc court.\n\nUnited States v. Holloway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202916\"><a href=\"/opinion/202916/united-states-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 118 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nDefendant acknowledged this rule at oral argument but seemed to\n\nsuggest     that    extraordinary     circumstances      existed    warranting\n\nreversal of our fellow panel because the García-Álvarez opinion\n\nconflicted with the Supreme Court’s precedent in Holloway v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118265\"><a href=\"/opinion/118265/holloway-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1999).         We understand Holloway to clarify\n\nthat “[t]he intent requirement of § 2119 is satisfied when the\n\nGovernment proves that at the moment the defendant demanded or took\n\ncontrol over the driver’s automobile the defendant possessed the\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fintent to seriously harm or kill the driver if necessary to steal\n\nthe car (or, alternatively, if unnecessary to steal the car).”\n\nHolloway, 526 U.S. at 12.        This is precisely the basis of our\n\nholding in García-Álvarez, in which we determined that at the\n\nmoment Defendant and the other assailants “took control” over\n\nLópez’s car by taking his keys from him at gunpoint, they possessed\n\nthe intent to seriously harm or kill him, satisfying § 2119's\n\nintent requirement.     Because we find no conflict between García-\n\nÁlvarez    and    Holloway     and,      therefore,         no   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, we conclude we are bound by the panel’s holding in\n\nGarcía-Álvarez that the intent requirement is satisfied when a\n\ndefendant intends to cause death or serious bodily injury at the\n\ntime he takes control of the vehicle, whether or not the car is\n\nimmediately driven.      The evidence in this case was more than\n\nsufficient to permit the jury to find that Defendant possessed such\n\nintent.   Accordingly, we affirm Defendant’s § 2119(2) and related\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) convictions.\n\n                                     III.\n\n          Defendant’s        photo     lineup      argument         is   equally\n\nunpersuasive.    Defendant contends that because his out-of-court\n\nidentifications were conducted only by photo spreads, they were\n\nimpermissibly    suggestive,    giving      rise   to   a    very    substantial\n\nlikelihood of misidentification.        The district court rejected this\n\nargument and denied his motion to suppress the out-of-court photo\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\flineup identifications.     The court reasoned that an identification\n\nneed not be done through a live lineup and, without any specific\n\nclaim of impermissibly suggestive procedure, the reliability of a\n\nphoto lineup is a question of credibility for the jury.\n\n            We “uphold a district court’s denial of a motion to\n\nsuppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.”\n\nUnited States v. de Jesus-Rios, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604123\"><a href=\"/opinion/604123/united-states-v-jose-de-jesus-rios-aka-papo-rios-united-states-v-eva/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nNo one contests that the police only conducted photo lineups to\n\nidentify Defendant.   We note, however, the police tried to conduct\n\na live lineup shortly after the incident, but Defendant fled,\n\nmaking that impossible.      Furthermore, Defendant has provided no\n\nlegal precedent to support his claim that conducting photo lineups\n\nalone, instead of a live lineup, is impermissibly suggestive.           He\n\nalso has not provided any evidence that the way in which the police\n\nconducted   the   photo   lineups   was    impermissibly   suggestive   or\n\nunreliable. His claim consequently fails. See García-Álvarez, 541\n\nF.3d at 15 (explaining that because the defendant did “not flag any\n\nof the procedures utilized during this [photo] identification as\n\nimpermissibly suggestive,” his claim failed).\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f</pre>",
