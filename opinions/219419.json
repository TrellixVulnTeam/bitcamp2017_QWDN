Martin Richey, Federal Defender Office, on supplemental\nbrief for appellant.\n     Nina Goodman, Appellate Section, Criminal Division, U.S.\nDepartment of Justice, Carmen Milagros Ortiz, United States\nAttorney, Timothy E. Moran, Assistant United States Attorney,\nLanny A. Breuer, Assistant Attorney General, and Greg D. Andres,\nActing Deputy Assistant Attorney General, on supplemental brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 22, 2011\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.      Winston McGhee was convicted of\n\ndrug crimes committed in July 2006 and at sentencing determined to\n\nbe a career offender, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 (2008), based in part on a\n\nprior state youthful offender adjudication. On appeal, we affirmed\n\nboth the conviction and the resulting sentence, United States v.\n\nMcGhee, 627 F.3d 454, 461 (1st Cir. 2010), noting that the career\n\noffender designation was compelled by United States v. Torres, 541\n\nF.3d 48 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1987 (2009).\n\n           McGhee then petitioned for panel rehearing and rehearing\n\nen banc to challenge Torres.     The government then conceded that\n\nTorres' holding was incorrect, but it defended McGhee's sentence on\n\nother grounds.    After consulting with the en banc judges, this\n\npanel granted panel rehearing to reconsider Torres ourselves--a\n\npractice   occasionally   used      in    this    circuit     in      special\n\ncircumstances1--the en banc request then being dismissed as moot.\n\n           Career offender status, which affects both the guideline\n\nrange and criminal history category, requires that the defendant\n\nhas committed \"at least two prior felony convictions of either a\n\ncrime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\"              U.S.S.G.\n\n§   4B1.1(a).     The   commentary       on   guideline     section     4B1.2\n\n(\"Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1\") provides that\n\n\n\n     1\n      See United States v. Holloway, 630 F.3d 252, 255 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2011); United States v. Dowdell, 595 F.3d 50, 62 n.8 (1st Cir.\n2010); Gallagher v. Wilton Enters., Inc., 962 F.2d 120, 124 n.4\n(1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam).\n\n                                 -2-\n\f\"'[p]rior felony conviction' means a prior adult federal or state\n\nconviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for\n\na term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is\n\nspecifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual\n\nsentence imposed.\"             Id. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1 (emphasis added).2             It\n\ncontinues:\n\n                  A conviction for an offense committed at age\n                  eighteen or older is an adult conviction. A\n                  conviction for an offense committed prior to\n                  age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is\n                  classified as an adult conviction under the\n                  laws of the jurisdiction in which the\n                  defendant was convicted (e.g., a federal\n                  conviction for an offense committed prior to\n                  the defendant's eighteenth birthday is an\n                  adult   conviction  if   the  defendant   was\n                  expressly proceeded against as an adult).\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n                  Torres held that a prior offense committed before age 18\n\ncould        be     counted        towards    career    offender    status    without\n\nconsideration of the state's classification of the offense.                      541\n\nF.3d        at    51-52.      It    reached    this    conclusion   because   another\n\napplication note to section 4B1.2 provides that \"[t]he provisions\n\nof § 4A1.2 [governing criminal history generally] . . . are\n\napplicable to the counting of convictions under § 4B1.1.\" U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4B1.2 cmt. n.3.\n\n\n        2\n      \"[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or\nexplains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the\nConstitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a\nplainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\" Stinson v. United\nStates, 508 U.S. 36, 38 (1993).\n\n                                              -3-\n\f            Sections 4A1.1 and 4A1.2 are concerned with counting and\n\nweighting sentences of imprisonment to establish a defendant's\n\ncriminal history category--one of the two variables that fixes the\n\nguideline   sentencing     range;    section   4A1.2(d)   determines   which\n\nsentences for offenses committed prior to age 18 should be excluded\n\nby asking whether defendant was \"convicted as an adult\" and what\n\nlength and kind of sentence were imposed.          An application note to\n\nsection 4A1.2 states:\n\n            Section 4A1.2(d) covers offenses committed\n            prior to age eighteen.    Attempting to count\n            every juvenile adjudication would have the\n            potential for creating large disparities due\n            to the differential availability of records.\n            Therefore, for offenses committed prior to age\n            eighteen, only those that resulted in adult\n            sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year\n            and one month, or resulted in imposition of an\n            adult or juvenile sentence or release from\n            confinement on that sentence within five years\n            of the defendant's commencement of the instant\n            offense are counted.     To avoid disparities\n            from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the age\n            at   which  a   defendant   is  considered   a\n            \"juvenile,\" this provision applies to all\n            offenses committed prior to age eighteen.\n\n§ 4A1.2 cmt. n.7 (emphasis added).\n\n            Because of the cross-reference, Torres assumed that this\n\nprovision, governing the calculation of criminal history points,\n\nwas   sufficient    to   determine   career    offender   predicates   under\n\nsection 4B1.       And, as Torres had committed his latest offense\n\nwithin five years of what he claimed to be a juvenile offense, the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fcourt held that it was \"immaterial whether Torres was classified as\n\nan adult under [state] law.\"      541 F.3d at 52.\n\n          Although the maze of provisions is assuredly confusing,\n\nthere is now a consensus that Torres misread them.3               For career\n\noffender purposes, a conviction for an offense committed before age\n\n18 counts only if \"it is classified as an adult conviction under\n\nthe laws of\" that jurisdiction, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1; by\n\ncontrast, ordinary criminal history is computed under section 4A1\n\nby a different rule, which seeks more uniformity as to offenses\n\ncommitted before 18, id. § 4A1.2 cmt. n.7 (quoted above).\n\n          The career offender provision is the one at issue both in\n\nTorres and in this case.    Its specific and unqualified reliance on\n\nhow the state \"classified\" the conviction cannot be undone by\n\npointing to a general cross-reference in the career offender\n\nprovisions   to   a   different   set    of   provisions,   one    of   which\n\n(application note 7) takes a contrasting approach and counts for\n\nordinary criminal history points juvenile convictions that occurred\n\nwithin five years of the later offense.           Torres is therefore no\n\nlonger to be followed in this circuit.\n\n\n\n     3\n      The Acting Solicitor General started down this line by\ncalling the Torres theory \"somewhat doubtful,\" Brief for the United\nStates in Opposition at 10, Torres v. United States, 129 S. Ct.\n1987 (2009) (mem.) (No. 08-8227), while defending the outcome on\nother grounds, and the government's brief responding to the\npetition for rehearing en banc in this case states that the Torres\n\"holding misconstrues the career-offender provisions of the\nSentencing Guidelines and should be corrected.\"\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          There is disagreement among the circuits on a related set\n\nof issues involving the interplay of the career offender provisions\n\nwith application note 7,4 but these divisions do not affect the\n\noutcome here, and it will be time enough to address them when they\n\narise in a concrete case with briefing on the issue.     What does\n\nremain to be decided in this case is whether McGhee's prior\n\nconviction critical to his designation as a career offender is\n\n\"classified\" as an \"adult conviction\" under Massachusetts law.\n\n          McGhee had two prior offenses counted towards his career\n\noffender determination, both committed prior to age 18: he was\n\nadjudicated delinquent as a youthful offender for armed robbery and\n\nassault with a deadly weapon committed when he was 15, and he was\n\nconvicted in adult court of assault and battery with a dangerous\n\nweapon committed when he was 17.\n\n          McGhee objects only to counting the youthful offender\n\nadjudication for armed robbery, arguing that it is not \"classified\"\n\nas an adult conviction under Massachusetts law.   In applying many\n\nprovisions of the federal sentencing statutes and guidelines, the\n\nstate's labels are not determinative; a uniform treatment is sought\n\nin federal sentencing, 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B) (2006), and in\n\n\n     4\n      Compare United States v. Mason, 284 F.3d 555, 558-62 (4th\nCir. 2002) (holding that an offense for which the defendant\nreceived an adult conviction but a juvenile sentence was not a\ncareer offender predicate), with United States v. Carrillo, 991\nF.2d 590, 593-95 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 883 (1993)\n(holding that an adult sentence is any sentence imposed after an\nadult conviction).\n\n                               -6-\n\fvarious contexts the federal courts disregard state labels and\n\nemploy a uniform federal test where terms like \"burglary\" or\n\n\"felony\" drive guideline calculations.5\n\n          Doubtless influenced by this case law, several circuits\n\nhave sought to decide whether \"an adult conviction\" took place by\n\napplying solely objective criteria, framed by the federal courts,\n\nto the circumstances surrounding a state conviction, including the\n\nevents underlying the conviction and factors such as the forum,\n\nprocedure, sentence, and time served.     E.g., United States v.\n\nJones, 415 F.3d 256, 263-64 (2d Cir. 2005); United States v.\n\nPinion, 4 F.3d 941, 944-45 (11th Cir. 1993).\n\n          However, the language of the commentary to the guideline\n\nin this instance does place more emphasis than has occurred in\n\nother contexts on whether the conviction is \"classified\" as an\n\nadult offense \"under the laws of the jurisdiction\" of conviction,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1, undermining any presumption in favor of\n\na federal standard that disregards state labels.   See Dickerson v.\n\nNew Banner Inst., Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 119-20 (1983); United States\n\n\n\n     5\n      See, e.g., United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 8-9 (1st Cir.\n1994) (defining \"extortion\" for career offender status under\nsections 4B1.1 and 4B1.2); United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64,\n71-72 (1st Cir. 1991) (defining \"felony\" for offense conduct under\nsection 2L1.2(b)(1)); United States v. Unger, 915 F.2d 759, 762-63\n(1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1104 (1991) (computing\ncriminal history under section 4A1.2); see also Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 590-92 (1990) (defining \"burglary\" for the\npurposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)\n(2006)).\n\n                               -7-\n\fv. Turley, 352 U.S. 407, 411 (1957).    There may well be limits to\n\nhow far state labels even here can override circumstances, but ours\n\nis not an extreme case.\n\n           Massachusetts law originally provided that defendants\n\nbetween 7 and 17 were subject only to adjudication as a delinquent\n\nchild in the juvenile justice system, unless the court after a\n\nhearing transferred the defendant to the criminal justice system,\n\nfinding that trial as an adult was appropriate.    Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 119, §§ 52, 58, 58B, 61 (1994) (amended 1996).    But prior to\n\nMcGhee's offense, the transfer regime was repealed and a new\n\ncategory--\"youthful offender\"--was added, governing offenses except\n\nmurder.   1996 Mass. Acts 898, 905.\n\n           Youthful offenders are those who, between 14 and 17,\n\ncommit offenses for which adults could be imprisoned and also have\n\nbeen previously committed to the Department of Youth Services, have\n\ncommitted an offense involving the infliction or threat of serious\n\nbodily harm, or have committed certain firearms violations.   Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 119, § 52 (2008).    McGhee's offense could result in\n\nimprisonment for an adult and involved the threat of bodily harm,\n\nand so he was under Massachusetts law a youthful offender rather\n\nthan merely a juvenile delinquent.\n\n           Youthful offenders may be indicted, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n119, § 54, may suffer harsher sentences up to and including an\n\nadult sentence, id. § 58, and their records are open to the public,\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fid. § 60A; but jurisdiction of the matter remains in juvenile\n\ncourt, id. § 52, 58, and youthful offenders, like delinquent\n\nchildren, \"as far as practicable, . . . shall be treated, not as\n\ncriminals, but as children in need of aid, encouragement and\n\nguidance,\" id. § 53. The proceedings, the statute provides, \"shall\n\nnot be deemed criminal proceedings.\"     Id.\n\n           A wholly objective assessment would conclude that in the\n\narmed robbery case McGhee was treated, in several respects, much\n\nlike an adult: he was indicted, sentenced to an extended term of\n\nprobation, and upon violations of probation was held twice in an\n\nadult jail.   Yet, the venue was the Roxbury Juvenile Court, the\n\nprobation was with the Department of Youth Services, and McGhee was\n\nreleased from the department's custody at age 21; and, of course,\n\nstate law says that these are not \"deemed criminal proceedings\"\n\nunder state law.\n\n           We conclude that Massachusetts has \"classified\" \"youthful\n\noffender\" adjudications differently from \"adult convictions,\" and\n\nMcGhee's adjudication is not a career offender predicate.        Accord\n\nUnited States v. Peguero-Martinez, Criminal No. 10-10132-PBS, 2010\n\nWL 4955587, at *2, *4 (D. Mass. Nov. 30, 2010).     This is a judgment\n\ncall, but Massachusetts' nomenclature clearly distinguishes between\n\nyouthful offenders and adults, and to the extent that objective\n\ncriteria   apply,   the   treatment   accorded   under   state   law   is\n\nsignificantly different than that given adult offenders.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          At sentencing, the district court quite properly treated\n\nMcGhee as a career offender because Torres bound it to do so, but\n\nwe now must treat that retrospectively as error.               However, the\n\ngovernment argues that even if we reject its position that McGhee's\n\ndisputed conviction was an adult conviction, the district court's\n\nerror was harmless.   This is a close call in light of remarks made\n\nby the district court at the sentencing, but on balance we think\n\nthat a remand is still warranted.\n\n          Career   offender   status    usually   causes   a    significant\n\nincrease in the guideline range, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, which even post-\n\nBooker often influences the final sentence, see United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220, 245-46 (2005).         Here, McGhee's guideline\n\nrange should have been 92 to 115 months, but it was increased to\n\n210 to 262 months by the career offender designation. The district\n\ncourt granted a downward variance and sentenced him to 96 months'\n\nimprisonment.\n\n          In explaining the sentence, the district judge stated:\n\n          I thought this was a ten-year case, if that,\n          and I, also, recognize that . . . [McGhee] was\n          the subject of a substantial period of dead\n          time . . . . Now, that suggests that I have\n          to move outside of the Guideline system, and I\n          do, by reference to the factors in Section\n          3553.\n\nAfter subtracting 24 months of dead time during which McGhee was\n\nimprisoned awaiting trial in a case for which a nolle prosequi was\n\nultimately entered, the court arrived at the 96-month sentence.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            \"[O]nce   the   court   of   appeals   has   decided   that   the\n\ndistrict court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate\n\nunless the reviewing court concludes, on the record as a whole,\n\nthat the error was harmless, i.e., that the error did not affect\n\nthe district court's selection of the sentence imposed.\"           Williams\n\nv. United States, 503 U.S. 193, 203 (1992); see also Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 52(a).   Given the transcript, McGhee's sentence might well have\n\nbeen the same regardless of the career offender designation, but we\n\nare not certain enough to find harmless error.\n\n            The government relies on United States v. Teague, 469\n\nF.3d 205 (1st Cir. 2006).     There, as here, the district court found\n\nthe defendant to be a career offender but imposed a sentence well\n\nbelow the career offender range.           This court disagreed with the\n\ndesignation but held the error harmless because the district judge\n\nhad made clear that the designation had not mattered--only the\n\ncircumstances of the prior crimes and Teague's overall criminal\n\nrole had been considered.      Id. at 209-10.\n\n            The district court in our case explained his variant\n\nsentence, which was well below the career guideline range, but we\n\nthink the transcript is less clear than it was in Teague that the\n\ncareer offender designation was entirely irrelevant; that the\n\nsentence here was below the career offender range cannot alone be\n\ndispositive since the designation can be influential even if not\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\ftreated as controlling.   And it is easy enough to let the district\n\ncourt decide the matter for itself.\n\n          McGhee's sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

An application note to\n\nsection 4A1.2 states:\n\n            Section 4A1.2(d) covers offenses committed\n            prior to age eighteen.    Attempting to count\n            every juvenile adjudication would have the\n            potential for creating large disparities due\n            to the differential availability of records.\n            Therefore, for offenses committed prior to age\n            eighteen, only those that resulted in adult\n            sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year\n            and one month, or resulted in imposition of an\n            adult or juvenile sentence or release from\n            confinement on that sentence within five years\n            of the defendant's commencement of the instant\n            offense are counted.

And, as Torres had committed his latest offense\n\nwithin five years of what he claimed to be a juvenile offense, the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fcourt held that it was \"immaterial whether Torres was classified as\n\nan adult under [state] law.\"      541 F.3d at 52.\n\n          Although the maze of provisions is assuredly confusing,\n\nthere is now a consensus that Torres misread them.3               For career\n\noffender purposes, a conviction for an offense committed before age\n\n18 counts only if \"it is classified as an adult conviction under\n\nthe laws of\" that jurisdiction, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1; by\n\ncontrast, ordinary criminal history is computed under section 4A1\n\nby a different rule, which seeks more uniformity as to offenses\n\ncommitted before 18, id. § 4A1.2 cmt. n.7 (quoted above).\n\n          The career offender provision is the one at issue both in\n\nTorres and in this case.    Its specific and unqualified reliance on\n\nhow the state \"classified\" the conviction cannot be undone by\n\npointing to a general cross-reference in the career offender\n\nprovisions   to   a   different   set    of   provisions,   one    of   which\n\n(application note 7) takes a contrasting approach and counts for\n\nordinary criminal history points juvenile convictions that occurred\n\nwithin five years of the later offense.

What does\n\nremain to be decided in this case is whether McGhee's prior\n\nconviction critical to his designation as a career offender is\n\n\"classified\" as an \"adult conviction\" under Massachusetts law.\n\n          McGhee had two prior offenses counted towards his career\n\noffender determination, both committed prior to age 18: he was\n\nadjudicated delinquent as a youthful offender for armed robbery and\n\nassault with a deadly weapon committed when he was 15, and he was\n\nconvicted in adult court of assault and battery with a dangerous\n\nweapon committed when he was 17.\n\n          McGhee objects only to counting the youthful offender\n\nadjudication for armed robbery, arguing that it is not \"classified\"\n\nas an adult conviction under Massachusetts law.

There may well be limits to\n\nhow far state labels even here can override circumstances, but ours\n\nis not an extreme case.\n\n           Massachusetts law originally provided that defendants\n\nbetween 7 and 17 were subject only to adjudication as a delinquent\n\nchild in the juvenile justice system, unless the court after a\n\nhearing transferred the defendant to the criminal justice system,\n\nfinding that trial as an adult was appropriate.    Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 119, §§ 52, 58, 58B, 61 (1994) (amended 1996).    But prior to\n\nMcGhee's offense, the transfer regime was repealed and a new\n\ncategory--\"youthful offender\"--was added, governing offenses except\n\nmurder.   1996 Mass. Acts 898, 905.\n\n           Youthful offenders are those who, between 14 and 17,\n\ncommit offenses for which adults could be imprisoned and also have\n\nbeen previously committed to the Department of Youth Services, have\n\ncommitted an offense involving the infliction or threat of serious\n\nbodily harm, or have committed certain firearms violations.   Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 119, § 52 (2008).    McGhee's offense could result in\n\nimprisonment for an adult and involved the threat of bodily harm,\n\nand so he was under Massachusetts law a youthful offender rather\n\nthan merely a juvenile delinquent.\n\n           Youthful offenders may be indicted, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n119, § 54, may suffer harsher sentences up to and including an\n\nadult sentence, id. § 58, and their records are open to the public,\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fid. § 60A; but jurisdiction of the matter remains in juvenile\n\ncourt, id. § 52, 58, and youthful offenders, like delinquent\n\nchildren, \"as far as practicable, . . . shall be treated, not as\n\ncriminals, but as children in need of aid, encouragement and\n\nguidance,\" id. § 53. The proceedings, the statute provides, \"shall\n\nnot be deemed criminal proceedings.\"     Id.\n\n           A wholly objective assessment would conclude that in the\n\narmed robbery case McGhee was treated, in several respects, much\n\nlike an adult: he was indicted, sentenced to an extended term of\n\nprobation, and upon violations of probation was held twice in an\n\nadult jail.   Yet, the venue was the Roxbury Juvenile Court, the\n\nprobation was with the Department of Youth Services, and McGhee was\n\nreleased from the department's custody at age 21; and, of course,\n\nstate law says that these are not \"deemed criminal proceedings\"\n\nunder state law.\n\n           We conclude that Massachusetts has \"classified\" \"youthful\n\noffender\" adjudications differently from \"adult convictions,\" and\n\nMcGhee's adjudication is not a career offender predicate.

Mass. Nov. 30, 2010).     This is a judgment\n\ncall, but Massachusetts' nomenclature clearly distinguishes between\n\nyouthful offenders and adults, and to the extent that objective\n\ncriteria   apply,   the   treatment   accorded   under   state   law   is\n\nsignificantly different than that given adult offenders.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          At sentencing, the district court quite properly treated\n\nMcGhee as a career offender because Torres bound it to do so, but\n\nwe now must treat that retrospectively as error.               However, the\n\ngovernment argues that even if we reject its position that McGhee's\n\ndisputed conviction was an adult conviction, the district court's\n\nerror was harmless.   This is a close call in light of remarks made\n\nby the district court at the sentencing, but on balance we think\n\nthat a remand is still warranted.\n\n          Career   offender   status    usually   causes   a    significant\n\nincrease in the guideline range, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, which even post-\n\nBooker often influences the final sentence, see United States v.\n\nBooker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245-46 (2005).         Here, McGhee's guideline\n\nrange should have been 92 to 115 months, but it was increased to\n\n210 to 262 months by the career offender designation. The district\n\ncourt granted a downward variance and sentenced him to 96 months'\n\nimprisonment.\n\n          In explaining the sentence, the district judge stated:\n\n          I thought this was a ten-year case, if that,\n          and I, also, recognize that . . . [McGhee] was\n          the subject of a substantial period of dead\n          time . . . . Now, that suggests that I have\n          to move outside of the Guideline system, and I\n          do, by reference to the factors in Section\n          3553.\n\nAfter subtracting 24 months of dead time during which McGhee was\n\nimprisoned awaiting trial in a case for which a nolle prosequi was\n\nultimately entered, the court arrived at the 96-month sentence.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            \"[O]nce   the   court   of   appeals   has   decided   that   the\n\ndistrict court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate\n\nunless the reviewing court concludes, on the record as a whole,\n\nthat the error was harmless, i.e., that the error did not affect\n\nthe district court's selection of the sentence imposed.\"           Williams\n\nv.

Given the transcript, McGhee's sentence might well have\n\nbeen the same regardless of the career offender designation, but we\n\nare not certain enough to find harmless error.\n\n            The government relies on United States v.

There, as here, the district court found\n\nthe defendant to be a career offender but imposed a sentence well\n\nbelow the career offender range.           This court disagreed with the\n\ndesignation but held the error harmless because the district judge\n\nhad made clear that the designation had not mattered--only the\n\ncircumstances of the prior crimes and Teague's overall criminal\n\nrole had been considered.      Id. at 209-10.\n\n            The district court in our case explained his variant\n\nsentence, which was well below the career guideline range, but we\n\nthink the transcript is less clear than it was in Teague that the\n\ncareer offender designation was entirely irrelevant; that the\n\nsentence here was below the career offender range cannot alone be\n\ndispositive since the designation can be influential even if not\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\ftreated as controlling.   And it is easy enough to let the district\n\ncourt decide the matter for itself.\n\n          McGhee's sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f</pre>",
