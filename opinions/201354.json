Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Paul J. Haley for appellant.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        November 24, 2004\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        Charles Glenn was found guilty on\n\nSeptember 9, 2003, of one count of distribution of Xanax and one\n\ncount    of   distribution      of    cocaine        base    (\"crack      cocaine\")    in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).             He appeals from the denial, on\n\nuntimeliness grounds, of his motion for new trial and argues, in\n\nthis direct appeal, that if the new trial motion was too late, then\n\nhis counsel was ineffective for this and other reasons and so both\n\nthe denial of the new trial and his conviction should be vacated.\n\nThe short response is the motion was too late, not being filed\n\nwithin    the   seven    days   required        by    Federal    Rule      of   Criminal\n\nProcedure 33, and to obtain a remedy, if any, on his claims of\n\ntrial    counsel's      misfeasance,       he    must       pursue   an      ineffective\n\nassistance claim on collateral attack.\n\n              He also urges us to overrule Siciliano v. Vose, 834 F.2d\n\n29 (1st Cir. 1987), and hold that a trial judge must sua sponte\n\ninstruct a defendant on his right to testify.                    Not only does this\n\npanel lack the authority to overrule Siciliano, we would not, if we\n\ncould.    There are very good reasons for the Siciliano rule.\n\n              Finally, he argues the denial of his motion for mistrial,\n\nafter    certain   testimony     by    a   police       officer,       was    in   error,\n\nregardless of the fact that an appropriate limiting instruction was\n\ngiven.    We disagree.      In short, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                                        I.\n\n              At Glenn's trial, Frank Swirko, an undercover Manchester\n\npolice officer and member of the New Hampshire Attorney General's\n\nDrug Task Force, testified as follows. On February 6, 2002, Swirko\n\nwent to a hotel in Manchester on a tip from a confidential\n\ninformant that a woman, Tina Gerow, was selling crack cocaine\n\nthere.   After Swirko purchased crack from Gerow, the appellant,\n\nCharles Glenn, entered the room. Swirko acknowledged to Gerow that\n\nhe knew \"Charlie,\" and Glenn then offered to sell Swirko some Xanax\n\npills.   Swirko agreed, and later that evening purchased thirteen\n\npills of Xanax from Glenn for $80.\n\n              On February 19, 2002, the same confidential informant\n\ncalled Swirko and told him that he was with Glenn and that Glenn\n\nwanted   to    sell   Swirko   drugs.         Glenn   came   to   the   phone   and\n\nidentified himself as \"Black Charlie\" and \"Tina Gerow's Charlie.\"\n\nThe officer and defendant met at a bar about ten minutes later, and\n\nSwirko agreed to buy $125 worth of heroin from Glenn.                Another male\n\nwas with them as well, who wanted to buy $100 worth of crack\n\ncocaine. Following Glenn's instructions, Swirko then drove them to\n\nGlenn's source; the source did not have any heroin.                 Glenn said he\n\nwould get the desired crack cocaine from Tina Gerow; Swirko then\n\nadded his own request to buy some crack cocaine.                  They then drove\n\nto a nearby neighborhood where Glenn left the vehicle with money\n\nfrom Swirko and the other buyer, and returned with crack cocaine.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fBecause    Swirko   was   working   undercover    and   did    not     want    to\n\ncompromise    his   investigation   or    his   identity,     Glenn    was    not\n\narrested immediately.\n\n            On March 12, 2002, Glenn was indicted on one count of\n\ndistribution of Xanax and two counts of distribution of cocaine\n\nbase, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).            He was arrested in\n\nNovember 2002.      Before trial, the government filed a § 851 notice\n\nof sentence enhancement based on Glenn's prior drug convictions.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 851.\n\n             The defense filed a pre-trial motion in limine to prevent\n\nSwirko from referring in his testimony to any of Glenn's prior\n\narrests.   The government stated that any officers testifying about\n\ntheir familiarity with Glenn would only mention that they had known\n\nhim in the past, and would not mention any arrests.                   The court\n\nallowed the testimony, and offered Glenn's counsel the opportunity\n\nto have a jury instruction about the testimony both when offered\n\nand prior to deliberation.\n\n             Swirko's direct testimony was that during his thirteen\n\nyears as a police officer he had had many contacts with Glenn and\n\nso could identify Glenn easily.           During cross-examination, the\n\ndefense asked Swirko if he had ever identified Glenn through an\n\nidentification card, to which Swirko replied no.            On redirect, the\n\ngovernment responded by asking Swirko whether it was necessary to\n\nask Glenn for an identification card during the course of these\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ftransactions.    Swirko replied \"No,\" \"Because I knew Mr. Glenn.                           I\n\nknew who he was.       I had dealt with him numerous times in the past.\n\nI had viewed pictures of him.               I knew who he was.\"\n\n          Glenn's       counsel    objected          and    moved      for    a    mistrial,\n\nstating that the reference to viewing pictures suggested to the\n\njury that Swirko had seen mug shots of Glenn, in violation of the\n\nin limine order.       The court denied a mistrial, but gave a curative\n\ninstruction     that     any     testimony          concerning         Swirko's        prior\n\ninvolvement   with     the     defendant          could    only   be    considered       for\n\ndetermining     the    accuracy        of     Swirko's       identification.\n\n          Other witnesses cemented Glenn's guilt.                                 Tina Gerow\n\ntestified that the transactions of February 6 and 19 occurred as\n\nSwirko had testified. Surveillance officers working with Swirko on\n\nthe night of these transactions also testified that Glenn was the\n\nseller of the drugs.\n\n          Glenn       asserted    an    alibi        defense,       and      offered    four\n\nwitnesses to testify on his behalf.                  Each stated that at the time\n\nof the alleged offenses, Glenn was not in Manchester but rather was\n\nvisiting relatives in Massachusetts.                  Glenn did not testify.              On\n\nSeptember 9, 2003, the jury convicted Glenn for the February 6 sale\n\nof Xanax and the February 19 sale of cocaine base.\n\n          On December 30, 2003, Glenn's trial counsel withdrew from\n\nthe case and new counsel was appointed.                   On February 2, 2004,          more\n\nthan five months after his conviction, Glenn's new counsel filed a\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fmotion for new trial, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nbased on Glenn's trial counsel's purported refusal to allow Glenn\n\nto testify at trial.      The district court denied the motion as\n\nuntimely under Rule 33.\n\n           On March 4, 2004, the district court sentenced Glenn to\n\n262 months imprisonment. Glenn was sentenced as a career offender,\n\nbased on previous convictions for sale of controlled substances.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. § 851.      In addition to the issues raised earlier,\n\nGlenn raises for the first time on appeal an objection to his being\n\nsentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in light of the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531\n\n(2004).   We affirm the decisions of the district court on all\n\nclaims, and deny Glenn's Blakely claim raised for the first time\n\nhere.\n\n                                 II.\n\nA.   Denial of Motion for New Trial\n\n           Glenn admits the motion was late but says the lateness\n\nshould be excused on grounds of equitable tolling, based on the\n\nineffectiveness of his trial counsel.    He represents that he asked\n\ncounsel to withdraw immediately after the verdict, and that counsel\n\ndid not do so for several months, and in that time did not inform\n\nhim of the seven-day limitations period for filing a new trial\n\nmotion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           Review of the denial of a motion for new trial is for\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion.      United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez,\n\n258 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2001).         This court has repeatedly held\n\nthat the seven-day limitations period for Rule 33 motions is\n\njurisdictional, and therefore a district court is without power to\n\nhear such motions not filed within the seven-day period, unless\n\nbased on newly discovered evidence, in which case the limitations\n\nperiod is two years.      United States v. Diaz, 300 F.3d 66, 78 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     Glenn filed his motion almost five months after the\n\nseven-day period ended.     There was no error.\n\nB.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n           Glenn argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in\n\nthat counsel denied him his right to testify, did not properly\n\nresearch or prepare his alibi defense, and failed to file a timely\n\nnew trial motion.      Unless the record is sufficiently developed on\n\nappeal   such   that    reasoned   consideration   of   the   ineffective\n\nassistance claim is possible, the proper vehicle to raise such a\n\nclaim is a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.          United\n\nStates v. Genao, 281 F.3d 305, 313 (1st Cir. 2002).            There are\n\nsimply no facts of record on any of these claims, whatever their\n\nmerits, and Glenn does not fall within the exception.\n\nC.   Denial of Mistrial\n\n           Glenn argues that Officer Swirko's statement that he had\n\nseen pictures of Glenn in the past was so prejudicial that no jury\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\finstruction could cure the potential prejudice.            We will reverse a\n\ndenial of a motion for a mistrial only when the defendant shows\n\nclear prejudice rendering the district court's denial a manifest\n\nabuse of discretion.   United States v. Freeman, 208 F.3d 332, 339\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).     Where, as here, \"a curative instruction is\n\npromptly given, a mistrial is warranted only in rare circumstances\n\nimplying extreme prejudice.\" Id. (quoting United States v. Torres,\n\n162 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1998) (emphasis added)).\n\n           Glenn's claim is utterly frivolous. The district court's\n\ncurative instruction was more than adequate to cure any potential\n\nprejudice from Officer Swirko's statement that he had previously\n\nseen photographs of Glenn.     It is also far from clear that the\n\nparticular testimony was inadmissible.         Furthermore, given the\n\noverwhelming   evidence   of   Glenn's     guilt,     he    has   failed   to\n\ndemonstrate that this statement amounted to \"clear prejudice.\"\n\nD.   Lack of Judicial Instructions on Right to Testify\n\n           Glenn asks us to overturn an earlier decision of this\n\ncourt in Siciliano v. Vose, 834 F.2d 29 (1st Cir. 1987), which held\n\nthat the trial court is not constitutionally required to advise the\n\ndefendant of his right to testify or to procure an express waiver\n\nof that right from the defendant.        Id. at 30.        The reasoning of\n\nSiciliano, that such a rule might unduly pressure the defendant to\n\nwaive his \"more fragile\" constitutional right not to testify,\n\nretains force.   Id. at 30.     Moreover, only an en banc court or\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fintervening controlling law may reverse the rule established by an\n\nearlier panel.       See Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds To Go,\n\nInc., 370 F.3d 151, 160 & n.4 (1st Cir. 2004).           Even were we free\n\nto do so, we would not.\n\nE.   Blakely Claim\n\n           In supplemental briefing, Glenn asked us to remand his\n\ncase to the district court for resentencing in light of the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004).\n\nBecause Glenn did not challenge the constitutionality of his\n\nsentencing enhancement below, our review is for plain error.              See\n\nUnited States v. Cordoza-Estrada, 385 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nUnder plain error review, the challenging party has the burden of\n\nshowing   (1)   an   error,   (2)   that   is   plain,   (3)   that   affects\n\nsubstantial rights (i.e. the error was not harmless), and (4) that\n\nseriously undermines the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\n\nof judicial proceedings. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732\n\n(1993).   Glenn's claim fails to satisfy the prongs of plain error\n\nreview.   See United States v. Morgan, 384 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           The judgment and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

Glenn was sentenced as a career offender, based on previous convictions for sale of controlled substances. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851. In addition to the issues raised earlier, Glenn raises for the first time on appeal an objection to his being sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).

He represents that he asked counsel to withdraw immediately after the verdict, and that counsel did not do so for several months, and in that time did not inform him of the seven-day limitations period for filing a new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of the denial of a motion for new trial is for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez,</i> 258 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.2001). This court has repeatedly held that the seven-day limitations period for Rule 33 motions is jurisdictional, and therefore a district court is without power to hear such motions not filed within the seven-day period, unless based on newly discovered evidence, in which case the limitations period is two years. <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> 300 F.3d 66, 78 (1st Cir.2002). Glenn filed his motion almost five months after the seven-day period ended. There was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glenn argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in that counsel denied him his right to testify, did not properly research or prepare his alibi defense, and failed to file a timely new trial motion. Unless the record is sufficiently developed on appeal such that reasoned consideration of the ineffective assistance claim is possible, the proper vehicle to raise such a claim is a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. <i>United States v. Genao,</i> 281 F.3d 305, 313 (1st Cir.2002). There are simply no facts of record on any of these claims, whatever their merits, and Glenn does not fall within the exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C. Denial of Mistrial</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glenn argues that Officer Swirko's statement that he had seen pictures of Glenn in the past was so prejudicial that no jury instruction could cure the potential prejudice. We will reverse a denial of a motion for a mistrial only when the defendant shows clear prejudice rendering the district court's denial a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.2000). Where, as here, \"a curative instruction is promptly given, a mistrial is warranted only in rare circumstances implying <i>extreme prejudice.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v.

The district court's curative instruction was more than adequate to cure any potential prejudice from Officer Swirko's statement that he had previously seen photographs of Glenn. It is also far from clear that the particular testimony was inadmissible. Furthermore, given the overwhelming evidence of Glenn's guilt, he has failed to demonstrate that this statement amounted to \"clear prejudice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>D.

The reasoning of <i>Siciliano,</i> that such a rule might unduly pressure the defendant to waive his \"more fragile\" constitutional right <i>not</i> to testify, retains force. <i>Id.</i> at 30. Moreover, only an en banc court or intervening controlling law may reverse the rule established by an earlier panel. <i>See Charlesbank Equity Fund II v.

He appeals from the denial, on untimeliness grounds, of his motion for new trial and argues, in this direct appeal, that if the new trial motion was too late, then his counsel was ineffective for this and other reasons and so both the denial of the new trial and his conviction should be vacated. The short response is the motion was too late, not being filed within the seven days required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, and to obtain a remedy, if any, on his claims of trial counsel's misfeasance, he must pursue an ineffective assistance claim on collateral attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He also urges us to overrule <i>Siciliano v.

On February 6, 2002, Swirko went to a hotel in Manchester on a tip from a confidential informant that a woman, Tina Gerow, was selling crack cocaine there. After Swirko purchased crack from Gerow, the appellant, Charles Glenn, entered the room. Swirko acknowledged to Gerow that he knew \"Charlie,\" and Glenn then offered to sell Swirko some Xanax pills. Swirko agreed, and later that evening purchased thirteen pills of Xanax from Glenn for $80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 2002, the same confidential informant called Swirko and told him that he was with Glenn and that Glenn wanted to sell Swirko drugs. Glenn came to the phone and identified himself as \"Black Charlie\" and \"Tina Gerow's Charlie.\" The officer and defendant met at a bar about ten minutes later, and Swirko agreed to buy $125 worth of heroin from Glenn. Another male was with them as well, who wanted to buy $100 worth of crack cocaine. Following Glenn's instructions, Swirko then drove them to Glenn's source; the source did not have any heroin. Glenn said he would get the desired crack cocaine from Tina Gerow; Swirko then added his own request to buy some crack cocaine. They then drove to a nearby neighborhood where Glenn left the vehicle with money from Swirko and the other buyer, and returned with crack cocaine. Because Swirko was working undercover and did not want to compromise his investigation or his identity, Glenn was not arrested immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 12, 2002, Glenn was indicted on one count of distribution of Xanax and two counts of distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). He was arrested in November 2002. Before trial, the government filed a &#167; 851 notice of sentence enhancement based on Glenn's prior drug convictions. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense filed a pre-trial motion in limine to prevent Swirko from referring in his testimony to any of Glenn's prior arrests. The government stated that any officers testifying about their familiarity with Glenn would only mention that they had known him in the past, and would not mention any arrests. The court allowed the testimony, and offered Glenn's counsel the opportunity to have a jury instruction about the testimony both when offered and prior to deliberation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swirko's direct testimony was that during his thirteen years as a police officer he had had many contacts with Glenn and so could identify Glenn easily. During cross-examination, the defense asked Swirko if he had ever identified Glenn through an identification card, to which Swirko replied no. On redirect, the government responded by asking Swirko whether it was necessary to ask Glenn for an identification card during the course of these transactions. Swirko replied \"No,\" \"Because I knew Mr. Glenn. I knew who he was. I had dealt with him numerous times in the past. I had viewed pictures of him. I knew who he was.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glenn's counsel objected and moved for a mistrial, stating that the reference to viewing pictures suggested to the jury that Swirko had seen mug shots of Glenn, in violation of the in limine order. The court denied a mistrial, but gave a curative instruction that any testimony concerning Swirko's prior involvement with the defendant could only be considered for determining the accuracy of Swirko's identification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other witnesses cemented Glenn's guilt. Tina Gerow testified that the transactions of February 6 and 19 occurred as Swirko had testified.

Each stated that at the time of the alleged offenses, Glenn was not in Manchester but rather was visiting relatives in Massachusetts. Glenn did not testify. On September 9, 2003, the jury convicted Glenn for the February 6 sale of Xanax and the February 19 sale of cocaine base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 2003, Glenn's trial counsel withdrew from the case and new counsel was appointed.
