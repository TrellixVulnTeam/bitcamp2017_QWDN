Froilan    Negron     sued    Celebrity       Cruises,    Inc.\n\n(\"Celebrity\")       and     Royal     Caribbean        Cruises,        Ltd.   (\"Royal\n\nCaribbean\"),       Celebrity's      parent     corporation,       in    the   federal\n\ndistrict court in Puerto Rico for injuries he allegedly suffered\n\nwhile on a Celebrity cruise with his wife in 1998.                 On December 16,\n\n1999, Celebrity and Royal Caribbean filed a motion to dismiss under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on the ground that the forum selection\n\nclause on the back of the plaintiff's ticket provided that \"all\n\nactions related to alleged personal injuries will have to be filed\n\nbefore a United States District Court for the Southern District of\n\nNew York.\"        Negron opposed the motion, arguing that the forum\n\nselection clause was unreasonable and unenforceable.\n\n         Because documents were provided by both parties, the district\n\ncourt converted the motion into one for summary judgment. See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).           The district court then referred the motion\n\nto   a    magistrate     judge.     In   June    2001,   the   magistrate         judge\n\nrecommended       that   the    clause   be    found   valid   and      the   case   be\n\ndismissed.       The report advised the parties that in accordance with\n\nlocal rules, see D.P.R. R. 510.2A, they must file any objections to\n\nthe recommending report with the Clerk of Court within ten days and\n\nthat failure to do so would preclude appellate review.                    Negron did\n\nnot file objections within the ten-day period, and, on July 12,\n\n2001, the district judge adopted the recommendation and closed the\n\ncase.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f     On July 27, 2001, Negron filed a motion to set aside the\n\ndistrict court's order.           This motion focused primarily on the\n\nmerits of Negron's argument regarding the enforceability of the\n\nforum selection clause.       In a single paragraph, Negron explained\n\nhis failure to file timely objections: \"Through inadvertence, copy\n\nof the Report and Recommendation recently approved by this Court\n\nwas not properly filed as related to this case.                This mistake\n\nprecluded the undersigned from filing a timely objection to the\n\nReport and Recommendation.\"        The district court denied the motion,\n\nand Negron appealed.\n\n     The Federal Magistrates Act permitting district judges to\n\nrefer    certain   motions   to    magistrate   judges   for   consideration\n\npertinently provides:\n\n        The magistrate shall file his proposed findings and\n        recommendations . . . with the court and a copy shall\n        forthwith be mailed to all parties.     Within ten days\n        after being served with a copy, any party may serve and\n        file written objections to such proposed findings and\n        recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge\n        of the court shall make a de novo determination of those\n        portions of the report or specified proposed findings or\n        recommendations to which objection is made.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) (2000).\n\n        In accord with Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 155 (1985), this\n\ncircuit has determined \"that a party 'may' file objections within\n\nten days or he may not, as he chooses, but he 'shall' do so if he\n\nwishes further consideration.\" Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor\n\nCo., 616 F.2d 603, 605 (1st Cir. 1980); accord D.P.R. R. 510.2A\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f(\"Any objections to the Magistrate Judge's proposed findings,\n\nrecommendation or report must be filed with the Clerk of the Court\n\nwithin ten (10) days after being served with copy thereof. Failure\n\nto file objections within the specified time waives the right to\n\nappeal the District Court's order.\").\n\n     On appeal, Negron repeats that \"[t]hrough inadvertence, copy\n\nof the Report was not properly filed as related to this case.   This\n\nmistake precluded the undersigned from filing a timely objection\n\nreiterating the arguments that had been brought to the Court's\n\nattention in the Opposition to defendants' move for dismissal.\"\n\nSince the 10-day clock starts to run only when the parties are\n\nserved with a copy of the magistrate's report, we assume that\n\nNegron means that the report was received by his counsel but that\n\nhis counsel misfiled it.   In substance, Negron's motion asked the\n\ndistrict court to reopen the final judgment, excuse the failure to\n\nfile a timely objection, and consider on the merits his attack on\n\nthe forum selection clause.\n\n     Being filed more than 10 days after the judgment, the motion\n\nfalls outside the time limit for motions to alter or amend a\n\njudgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), but within the one-year limit\n\non motions for relief from judgment on the ground of excusable\n\nneglect under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).   Unfortunately for Negron,\n\nroutine carelessness by counsel leading to a late filing is not\n\nenough to constitute excusable neglect.
