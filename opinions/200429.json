Defendant-appellant         William\n\nMichael    Osbourne     appeals     the   partial    denial       of   his   pretrial\n\nsuppression motion, arguing that a statement made by the district\n\ncourt in the course of its extemporaneous oral ruling evinced both\n\na misunderstanding and material misapplication of Terry v. Ohio,\n\n392 U.S. 1 (1968).       Specifically, Osbourne contends that the court\n\nupheld a second pat-frisk of his person -- one that led to his\n\narrest for unlawful firearm possession -- only after mistakenly\n\nconcluding that, once there were legitimate grounds to pat-frisk\n\nhim, there was no limit to the number of pat-frisks that officers\n\non the scene were permitted to conduct.                     Our analysis of the\n\ncontext in which the court made the statement convinces us that\n\nOsbourne has read too much into it and that the court's ruling was\n\nnot based upon legal error.         We summarize the facts that lead us to\n\nthis conclusion.\n\n            Late in the afternoon of September 18, 2001, Boston\n\nPolice Detective Robert Fratalia was driving in the Roxbury section\n\nof   Boston   to   scout      out    locations      where     a    youth     violence\n\ninvestigative team with which he was working would be executing\n\nsearch warrants in the coming days. Federal agents Daniel Campbell\n\nand Michael Oppenheim accompanied Fratalia.                       The contemplated\n\nwarrants were to target members of the Esmond Street gang, which\n\nFratalia    knew   to    be   involved      in   drug   trafficking,         firearms\n\noffenses, and street violence with a rival gang.                        One of the\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fresidences to be searched was Osbourne's.     Fratalia had specific\n\nknowledge that Osbourne was a member of the Esmond Street gang's\n\n\"inner circle\" and a likely target in the on-going feud with the\n\nrival gang.   Fratalia also had been told that Osbourne carried a 9-\n\nmillimeter firearm on his person at all times.\n\n          As he was driving down Walnut Street, Fratalia noticed\n\nOsbourne's parked car.    Fratalia then observed Osbourne himself\n\nwalking down the street with one Clifford Carr.         Although he\n\ncontested it below, Osbourne now concedes that, when Fratalia first\n\nspotted him, Fratalia had grounds to reasonably suspect that\n\nOsbourne was in unlawful possession of a firearm. Fratalia decided\n\nto act on his suspicion by conducting a Terry stop of Osbourne.   He\n\nalerted Campbell and Oppenheim to Osbourne's presence, pulled his\n\npolice vehicle alongside of Osbourne and Carr, let Campbell and\n\nOppenheim out, and parked the car diagonally across the sidewalk in\n\nfront of them. At the suppression hearing, Fratalia described what\n\nhappened next:\n\n          Special Agent Campbell had gone towards ...\n          Osbourne, Special Agent Oppenheim kind of\n          stayed in back of Campbell closer to the\n          curbing where it met the street. I got out of\n          the vehicle and went immediately over to where\n          Osbourne and Carr had been.     Special Agent\n          Campbell did a quick pat-frisk of Mr. Osbourne\n          and went right to Mr. Carr upon him seeing me\n          being right next to him.\n\nAs Campbell began his pat-frisk of Carr, Fratalia conducted a pat-\n\nfrisk of Osbourne.   Almost immediately, Fratalia detected what he\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fbelieved to be the handle of a gun in Osbourne's waistband.                      He\n\nremoved    the    item,   discovered    that   it   was   a   fully    loaded     9-\n\nmillimeter semi-automatic handgun, and arrested Osbourne.\n\n            On October 17, 2001, a grand jury indicted Osbourne for\n\nbeing a felon in unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1) (2000). On February 27, 2002, Osbourne filed\n\na written motion to suppress evidence of the gun (as having been\n\nseized in violation of Terry) and certain statements he made to the\n\nofficers following his arrest (as having been elicited in violation\n\nof Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)).              Insofar as Osbourne\n\nsought suppression of the firearm, his motion argued only that\n\nFratalia lacked grounds for a reasonable suspicion that Osbourne\n\nwas armed and dangerous when Fratalia first saw him walking down\n\nthe street with Carr.         On March 20, 2002, the government filed a\n\nwritten opposition to Osbourne's motion, contending that the pat-\n\nfrisk leading to the discovery of the firearm was authorized under\n\nTerry because Fratalia reasonably suspected that Osbourne was\n\nunlawfully armed when he initially spotted Osbourne and Carr.\n\nAttached    to    the   government's    submission    was,     inter    alia,     an\n\naffidavit      from     Fratalia   acknowledging     that     \"Campbell      [had]\n\ncursorily pat-frisked Osbourne before moving over to Clifford Carr\"\n\nand   before     Fratalia   conducted    the   pat-frisk      that    led   to   the\n\ndiscovery of the firearm.          It was thus uncontested from the outset\n\nthat Fratalia was the second officer to pat-frisk Osbourne.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f          From   April   3   to   April   5,   2002,   the   district   court\n\nconducted a hearing on Osbourne's motion.              Consistent with his\n\nwritten motion, Osbourne sought during the hearing only to develop\n\ngrounds for arguing that Fratalia lacked a basis to reasonably\n\nsuspect Osbourne of being unlawfully armed and dangerous when he\n\nfirst spotted him on the street. Consequently, the lion's share of\n\nthe parties' closing arguments focused on the reliability of the\n\ndata giving rise to Fratalia's suspicion prior to the stop.               But\n\njust before concluding (and after the government had completed its\n\npresentation), Osbourne's counsel introduced an entirely new line\n\nof argument:\n\n                 [L]et me actually go back because I\n          skipped a very crucial point, if I may.\n\n                 The   testimony   was  that   Detective\n          Fratalia   let   Agent  Campbell   and   Agent\n          Oppenheim out of the car, and Agent Campbell\n          frisked Mr. Osborne ... first ....      So the\n          question, and I think it is a significant\n          question in this case, is what justified the\n          second frisk. And I would suggest that that\n          second frisk is not a legitimate frisk under\n          Terry.   Certainly not in the absence of any\n          evidence that the first frisk was not\n          thorough; not in the absence of any evidence\n          that Agent Campbell -- excuse me, that during\n          the time between frisk number one and frisk\n          number two Mr. Osbourne did anything that\n          would suggest that he may have gained access\n          to a weapon that was missed the first time.\n          So, frisk number two I would suggest isn't a\n          Terry frisk at all. It's a search. And it\n          requires probable cause.\n\n                 Now, that is consistent in terms of it\n          being a protective frisk, even if it's a\n          frisk, that rationale evaporates if ... one of\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          those officers has already done a protective\n          frisk and has not found anything.\n\n          Immediately   after   Osbourne's   counsel    concluded,   the\n\ndistrict court issued an oral ruling denying Osbourne's motion\n\ninsofar as it sought to suppress evidence of the firearm as having\n\nbeen obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.           The court\n\nfirst found facts consistent with the rendition we have just\n\nprovided and concluded that Fratalia had grounds to reasonably\n\nsuspect Osbourne of being unlawfully armed and dangerous when the\n\nepisode began.    As we have already stated, Osbourne does not\n\nchallenge this ruling on appeal.       The court then addressed and\n\nrejected Osbourne's argument that Fratalia's pat-frisk was unlawful\n\nbecause it followed Campbell's and was unaccompanied by evidence\n\nthat Campbell's was incomplete or inadequate.          In doing so, the\n\ncourt stated:\n\n                 In   the   event,   and   this   is   an\n          interesting wrinkle, it was not [Fratalia] who\n          first pat-frisked Mr. Osbourne but it was Mr.\n          Campbell, Officer Campbell, a younger officer,1\n          and not part of Fratalia's Boston Police\n          force.     Now, Fratalia was watching the\n          situation.    So he knew that Campbell had\n          already touched, and characterized it as a pat\n          frisk and I accept that.\n\n                 And so the question is what justified\n          Detective Fratalia from doing it himself?\n          Well, it seems to me it was a rapidly evolving\n          situation, and with two individuals, as\n          Fratalia approached, Campbell moved over to\n\n\n     1\n      All agree that this comment was mistaken and that there was\nno evidence that Campbell was younger than Fratalia.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           Carr, it's not clear that Oppenheim was doing\n           anything but surveilling the scene, I think it\n           was good police work. I don't think there's a\n           limitation on the number of people who can\n           pat-frisk you.     And I think for his own\n           safety, I don't think fear need enter into it,\n           I think for his own safety and those of the\n           other officers Detective Fratalia, under the\n           same standard, reasonable suspicion, though at\n           that time there was not probable cause, could\n           pat-frisk Mr. Osbourne, and then the weapon\n           was discovered. That's the Fourth Amendment\n           analysis. (Emphasis supplied).\n\n           Construing the underlined text as reflecting a belief on\n\nthe district court's part that the \"police may frisk a suspect as\n\nmany times as they wish, assuming a lawful basis for the first\n\nfrisk,\" Appellant's Br. at 9, Osbourne argues that the remark\n\nrepresents an erroneous distillation and application of Terry that\n\nundermines the court's suppression ruling. If we shared Osbourne's\n\nunderstanding of the statement, we would be inclined to agree.\n\nWhile many areas of Fourth Amendment doctrine are characterized by\n\nspecific   bright    line   principles     designed       for   straightforward\n\napplication by law enforcement officers, see Atwater v. City of\n\nLago, 532 U.S. 318, 347 (2001), \"reasonableness\" in the context of\n\na Terry stop is given content by balancing the need for the\n\nencroachment against its nature case by case and in light of all\n\nthe attendant circumstances, id. at 347 n.16; id. at 366 (O'Connor,\n\nJ., dissenting); United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1989);\n\nUnited   States     v.   Chhien,   266   F.3d   1,    6    (1st   Cir.   2001).\n\nConsequently, a one-size-fits-all rule such as the one Osbourne has\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\finferred from the court's statement would be unusual, if not an\n\nanathema, in the context of Terry.      But we do not understand the\n\ncourt's comment to reflect such an underlying perspective.\n\n          Rather, we regard the district court's \"there is no\n\nlimitation\" comment to be a rejection of what it understood to be\n\nOsbourne's own suggestion of an applicable categorical rule:        that\n\na second pat-frisk is per se unreasonable in the absence of\n\nevidence that the first frisk was cursory or that the subject of\n\nthe frisk had an opportunity to arm himself in the interim.       And in\n\nour view, the court was entirely correct to reject this suggestion.\n\nCf. Sokolow, 490 U.S. at 7-8 (rejecting a specific two-part rule\n\ndesigned by a court of appeals to assess the reasonableness of\n\nTerry stops of suspected drug couriers).      We can envision myriad\n\nfactual contexts in which courts could be called upon to assess the\n\nreasonableness   of   multiple   pat-frisks   of   a   single   suspect.\n\nEspecially given the absence of record evidence concerning the\n\neffectiveness of pat-frisks, our adoption of Osbourne's rigid\n\nformulation would unduly cabin the reasonableness inquiry to be\n\nconducted in such cases every bit as much as the rule he says the\n\ncourt applied.   See id.\n\n          In the end, the reasonableness of a second or subsequent\n\npat-frisk conducted pursuant to Terry is to be determined under a\n\nstandard that takes account of the fact that \"context is vital.\"\n\nUnited States v. Cook, 277 F.3d 82, 85 (1st Cir. 2002).              The\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fstandard is familiar:           \"A police officer may frisk a suspect --\n\nthat is, search the suspect's person for weapons -- on reasonable\n\nsuspicion   that    the       suspect   is   armed   and   dangerous.\"        United\n\nStates v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 41 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535\n\nU.S. 1007 (2002).         Here, the context in which Fratalia frisked\n\nOsbourne led the district court to conclude that Fratalia still\n\nentertained    such       a     reasonable     suspicion     as     to    Osbourne,\n\nnotwithstanding Campbell's \"quick\" (to use Fratalia's description)\n\ninitial frisk of him.          We agree with the court's conclusion.            This\n\nwas not a case involving an unknown suspect; Fratalia had specific\n\ninformation that Osbourne was \"always\" armed with a semi-automatic\n\nweapon and was a member of a violent street gang.                 Moreover, as the\n\ncourt   observed,     Fratalia      encountered      Osbourne      in    \"a   rapidly\n\nevolving situation\" in which the investigating officers needed to\n\nkeep tabs on not one suspect but two.                Under the circumstances,\n\nFratalia reasonably declined to regard the frisk conducted by\n\nCampbell as conclusive on the question whether Osbourne was armed\n\nand dangerous.\n\n            Accordingly, we affirm the court's partial denial of\n\nOsbourne's motion to suppress.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f",

Federal agents Daniel Campbell and Michael Oppenheim accompanied Fratalia. The contemplated warrants were to target members of the Esmond Street gang, which Fratalia knew to be involved in drug trafficking, firearms offenses, and street violence with a rival gang. One of the residences to be searched was Osbourne's. Fratalia had specific knowledge that Osbourne was a member of the Esmond Street gang's \"inner circle\" and a likely target in the on-going feud with the rival gang. Fratalia also had been told that Osbourne carried a 9-millimeter firearm on his person at all times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As he was driving down Walnut Street, Fratalia noticed Osbourne's parked car.

On February 27, 2002, Osbourne filed a written motion to suppress evidence of the gun (as having been seized in violation of <i>Terry</i>) and certain statements he made to the officers following his arrest (as having been elicited in violation of <i>Miranda v.

Insofar as Osbourne sought suppression of the firearm, his motion argued only that Fratalia lacked grounds for a reasonable suspicion that Osbourne was armed and dangerous when Fratalia first saw him walking down the street with Carr. On March 20, 2002, the government filed a written opposition to Osbourne's motion, contending that the pat-frisk leading to the discovery of the firearm was authorized under <i>Terry</i> because Fratalia reasonably suspected that Osbourne was unlawfully armed when he initially spotted Osbourne and Carr. Attached to the government's submission was, <i>inter alia,</i> an affidavit from Fratalia acknowledging that \"Campbell [had] cursorily pat-frisked Osbourne before moving over to Clifford Carr\" and before Fratalia conducted the pat-frisk that led to the discovery of the firearm. It was thus uncontested from the outset that Fratalia was the second officer to pat-frisk Osbourne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From April 3 to April 5, 2002, the district court conducted a hearing on Osbourne's motion.

Consequently, the lion's share of the parties' closing arguments focused on the reliability of the data giving rise to Fratalia's suspicion prior to the stop. But just before concluding (and after the government had completed its presentation), Osbourne's counsel introduced an entirely new line of argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[L]et me actually go back because I skipped a very crucial point, if I may.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony was that Detective Fratalia let Agent Campbell and Agent Oppenheim out of the car, and Agent Campbell frisked Mr. Osborne ... first.... So the question, and I think it is a significant question in this case, is what justified the second frisk. And I would suggest that that second frisk is not a legitimate frisk under <i>Terry.</i> Certainly not in the absence of any evidence that the first frisk was not thorough; not in the absence of any evidence that Agent Campbell &#8212; excuse me, that during the time between frisk number one and frisk number two Mr. Osbourne did anything that would suggest that he may have gained access to a weapon that was missed the first time. So, frisk number two I would suggest isn't a <i>Terry</i> frisk at all. It's a search. And it requires probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, that is consistent in terms of it being a protective frisk, even if it's a frisk, that rationale evaporates if ... one of those officers has already done a protective frisk and has not found anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after Osbourne's counsel concluded, the district court issued an oral ruling denying Osbourne's motion insofar as it sought to suppress evidence of the firearm as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The court first found facts consistent with the rendition we have just provided and concluded that Fratalia had grounds to reasonably suspect Osbourne of being unlawfully armed and dangerous when the episode began. As we have already stated, Osbourne does not challenge this ruling on appeal. The court then addressed and rejected Osbourne's argument that Fratalia's pat-frisk was unlawful because it followed Campbell's and was unaccompanied by evidence that Campbell's was incomplete or inadequate. In doing so, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event, and this is an interesting wrinkle, it was not [Fratalia] who first pat-frisked Mr. Osbourne but it was Mr. Campbell, Officer Campbell, a younger officer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and not part of Fratalia's Boston Police force. Now, Fratalia was watching the situation. So he knew that Campbell had already touched, and characterized it as a pat frisk and I accept that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And so the question is what justified Detective Fratalia from doing it himself? Well, it seems to me it was a rapidly evolving situation, and with two individuals, as Fratalia approached, Campbell moved over to Carr, it's not clear that Oppenheim was doing anything but surveilling the scene, I think it was good police work. <i>I don't think there's a limitation on the number of people who can pat-frisk you.</i> And I think for his own safety, I don't think fear need enter into it, I think for his own safety and those of the other officers Detective Fratalia, under the same standard, reasonable suspicion, though at that time there was not probable cause, could pat-frisk Mr. Osbourne, and then the weapon was discovered. That's the Fourth Amendment analysis.

If we shared Osbourne's understanding of the statement, we would be inclined to agree. While many areas of Fourth Amendment doctrine are characterized by specific bright line principles designed for straightforward application by law enforcement officers, <i>see Atwater v. City of Lago,</i> 532 U.S. 318, 347, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001), \"reasonableness\" in the context of a <i>Terry</i> stop is given content by balancing the need for the encroachment against its nature case by case and in light of all the attendant circumstances, <i>id.</i> at 347 n. 16, 121 S.Ct. 1536; <i>id.</i> at 366, 121 S.Ct. 1536 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); <i>United States v.

Consequently, a one-size-fits-all rule such as the one Osbourne has inferred from the court's statement would be unusual, if not an anathema, in the context of <i>Terry.</i> But we do not understand the court's comment to reflect such an underlying perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, we regard the district court's \"there is no limitation\" comment to be a rejection of what it understood to be Osbourne's own suggestion of an applicable categorical rule: that a second pat-frisk is <i>per se</i> unreasonable in the absence of evidence that the first frisk was cursory or that the subject of the frisk had an opportunity to arm himself in the interim. And in our view, the court was entirely correct to reject this suggestion. <i>Cf. Sokolow,</i> 490 U.S. at 7-8, 109 S.Ct. 1581 (rejecting a specific two-part rule designed by a court of appeals to assess the reasonableness of <i>Terry</i> stops of suspected drug couriers). We can envision myriad factual contexts in which courts could be called upon to assess the reasonableness of multiple pat-frisks of a single suspect. Especially given the absence of record evidence concerning the effectiveness of pat-frisks, our adoption of Osbourne's rigid formulation would unduly cabin the reasonableness inquiry to be conducted in such cases every bit as much as the rule he says the court applied. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the reasonableness of a second or subsequent pat-frisk conducted pursuant to <i>Terry</i> is to be determined under a standard that takes account of the fact that \"context is vital.\" <i>United States v. Cook,</i> 277 F.3d 82, 85 (1st Cir.2002). The standard is familiar: \"A police officer may frisk a suspect &#8212; that is, search the suspect's person for weapons &#8212; on reasonable suspicion that the suspect is armed and dangerous.\" <i>United States v.

Here, the context in which Fratalia frisked Osbourne led the district court to conclude that Fratalia still entertained such a reasonable suspicion as to Osbourne, notwithstanding Campbell's \"quick\" (to use Fratalia's description) initial frisk of him. We agree with the court's conclusion. This was not a case involving an unknown suspect; Fratalia had specific information that Osbourne was \"always\" armed with a semi-automatic weapon and was a member of a violent street gang. Moreover, as the court observed, Fratalia encountered Osbourne in \"a rapidly evolving situation\" in which the investigating officers needed to keep tabs on not one suspect but two.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span> (1968). Specifically, Osbourne contends that the court upheld a second pat-frisk of his person &#8212; one that led to his arrest for unlawful firearm possession &#8212; only after mistakenly concluding that, once there were legitimate grounds to pat-frisk him, there was no limit to the number of pat-frisks that officers on the scene were permitted to conduct. Our analysis of the context in which the court made the statement convinces us that Osbourne has read too much into it and that the court's ruling was not based upon legal error. We summarize the facts that lead us to this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Late in the afternoon of September 18, 2001, Boston Police Detective Robert Fratalia was driving in the Roxbury section of Boston to scout out locations where a youth violence investigative team with which he was working would be executing search warrants in the coming days. Federal agents Daniel Campbell and Michael Oppenheim accompanied Fratalia. The contemplated warrants were to target members of the Esmond Street gang, which Fratalia knew to be involved in drug trafficking, firearms offenses, and street violence with a rival gang. One of the residences to be searched was Osbourne's. Fratalia had specific knowledge that Osbourne was a member of the Esmond Street gang's \"inner circle\" and a likely target in the on-going feud with the rival gang. Fratalia also had been told that Osbourne carried a 9-millimeter firearm on his person at all times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As he was driving down Walnut Street, Fratalia noticed Osbourne's parked car. Fratalia then observed Osbourne himself walking down the street with one Clifford Carr. Although he contested it below, Osbourne now concedes that, when Fratalia first spotted him, Fratalia had grounds to reasonably suspect that Osbourne was in unlawful possession of a firearm. Fratalia decided to act on his suspicion by conducting a <i>Terry</i> stop of Osbourne. He alerted Campbell and Oppenheim to Osbourne's presence, pulled his police vehicle alongside of Osbourne and Carr, let Campbell and Oppenheim out, and parked the car diagonally across the sidewalk in front of them. At the suppression hearing, Fratalia described what happened next:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Special Agent Campbell had gone towards... Osbourne, Special Agent Oppenheim kind of stayed in back of Campbell closer to the curbing where it met the street. I got out of the vehicle and went immediately over to where Osbourne and Carr had been. Special Agent Campbell did a quick pat-frisk of Mr. Osbourne and went right to Mr. Carr upon him seeing me being right next to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Campbell began his pat-frisk of Carr, Fratalia conducted a pat-frisk of Osbourne. Almost immediately, Fratalia detected what he believed to be the handle of a gun in Osbourne's waistband. He removed the item, discovered that it was a fully loaded 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun, and arrested Osbourne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 2001, a grand jury indicted Osbourne for being a felon in unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (2000). On February 27, 2002, Osbourne filed a written motion to suppress evidence of the gun (as having been seized in violation of <i>Terry</i>) and certain statements he made to the officers following his arrest (as having been elicited in violation of <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966)). Insofar as Osbourne sought suppression of the firearm, his motion argued only that Fratalia lacked grounds for a reasonable suspicion that Osbourne was armed and dangerous when Fratalia first saw him walking down the street with Carr. On March 20, 2002, the government filed a written opposition to Osbourne's motion, contending that the pat-frisk leading to the discovery of the firearm was authorized under <i>Terry</i> because Fratalia reasonably suspected that Osbourne was unlawfully armed when he initially spotted Osbourne and Carr. Attached to the government's submission was, <i>inter alia,</i> an affidavit from Fratalia acknowledging that \"Campbell [had] cursorily pat-frisked Osbourne before moving over to Clifford Carr\" and before Fratalia conducted the pat-frisk that led to the discovery of the firearm. It was thus uncontested from the outset that Fratalia was the second officer to pat-frisk Osbourne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From April 3 to April 5, 2002, the district court conducted a hearing on Osbourne's motion. Consistent with his written motion, Osbourne sought during the hearing only to develop grounds for arguing that Fratalia lacked a basis to reasonably suspect Osbourne of being unlawfully armed and dangerous when he first spotted him on the street. Consequently, the lion's share of the parties' closing arguments focused on the reliability of the data giving rise to Fratalia's suspicion prior to the stop. But just before concluding (and after the government had completed its presentation), Osbourne's counsel introduced an entirely new line of argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[L]et me actually go back because I skipped a very crucial point, if I may.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony was that Detective Fratalia let Agent Campbell and Agent Oppenheim out of the car, and Agent Campbell frisked Mr. Osborne ... first.... So the question, and I think it is a significant question in this case, is what justified the second frisk.
