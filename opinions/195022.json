We  have carefully  reviewed the  parties'\n               \n\nbriefs and the record on  appeal.  Although contrary evidence\n\nwas presented, we find that substantial evidence supports the\n\nfinding  that the claimant  retained the mental  and physical\n\ncapacity to  perform the  easy to  learn, routine,  unskilled\n\njobs as determined by the  Secretary.  We affirm the judgment\n\nof the district court substantially for the reasons stated in\n\nthe  magistrate judge's opinion  dated January 22,  1993, and\n\nthe district court's opinion dated March 8, 1993.\n\n     We add  only the  following comments.   First,  claimant\n\ncontends  that the  ALJ  erred  in  finding  that  claimant's\n\ncondition does not qualify as a listed impairment pursuant to\n\n20  C.F.R. Part  404,  Subpt.  P, App.  1,    12.05C  (Mental\n\nRetardation).   Two  examining  psychologists  did find  that\n\nclaimant had a verbal IQ of 68.   However, a verbal IQ of 68,\n\nstanding  alone,  does  not  rise to  the  level  of severity\n\nrequired  to establish  a disorder  under section 12.05C.   A\n\nclaimant at that IQ level must also show \"a physical or other\n\nmental impairment  imposing additional and  significant work-\n\nrelated limitation of function.\"   20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt.\n\nP, App. 1,    12.05C.   Viewing  the record as  a whole,  and\n\ngiving  due  weight  to  the  ALJ's  evaluation  of  witness'\n\ncredibility and to his resolution of conflicts in the medical\n\nevidence, we  find  that substantial  evidence  supports  the\n\nconclusion that claimant  did not establish that  his hearing\n\n                             -2-\n\nimpairment,  and/or anxiety  disorder  imposes additional  or\n\nsignificant  work-related  limitations of  function so  as to\n\nsatisfy the second prong of section 12.05C.\n\n     Second,  claimant's assertion  that the  ALJ disregarded\n\nhis subjective complaints  of severe physical pain  is belied\n\nby  the  record.    The  ALJ  properly  considered  not  only\n\nclaimant's allegations  of pain  but his  prior work  record,\n\ninformation from  examining physicians  and claimant's  daily\n\nactivity.  See Avery v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services,\n                                                            \n\n797 F.2d  19,  23 (1st  Cir.  1986).   On  the basis  of  all\n\nrelevant evidence, the  ALJ supportably found that  there was\n\nno indication  that  claimant  suffered  sufficient  pain  to\n\nprevent or limit him from performing routine work activities,\n\nprovided that  those activities  did not  involve working  on\n\nunprotected heights,  being around moving machinery  or being\n\nin the presence of loud noises.  \n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -3-\n",
