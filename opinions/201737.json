Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n          Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Shannon Liss-Riordan, with whom Earl D. Munroe, Munroe & Chew,\nMichael M. McArdle, and Law Offices of Michael M. McArdle were on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Jeffrey G. Huvelle, with whom Frederick G. Sandstrom,\nCovington & Burling, Marc Schoenecker, and Verizon Services Group\nwere on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            August 2, 2005\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.          Plaintiffs-appellants Ronald R.\n\nEdes, Kevin Lyons, and John Parsons appeal the dismissal of their\n\nclaims against Defendants-appellees Verizon Communications, Inc.,\n\net al., under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,\n\n29 U.S.C ยง 1001-1461, as amended (\"ERISA\"). Plaintiffs allege that\n\nDefendants violated ERISA by relegating them to the payrolls of\n\nthird-party payroll agencies, thereby: (1) wrongfully denying them\n\nbenefits under ERISA plans; (2) interfering with their attainment\n\nof plan participation rights; (3) breaching fiduciary duties owed\n\nto   them;   (4)    failing   to   meet      ERISA's   minimum     participation\n\nstandards; and (5) using arbitrary, unwritten plan eligibility\n\ncriteria.    We affirm the district court's decision to dismiss each\n\nof these claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n                                       I.\n\n             As alleged in the complaint, Plaintiffs were hired by GTE\n\nService Corporation (\"GTE\"), a business unit of GTE Corporation\n\n(now   Verizon     Communications,     Inc.),    to    work   in   its   Danvers,\n\nMassachusetts, office in or around April 1994. Although Plaintiffs\n\nwere hired directly by GTE, each was told to sign on with one of\n\ntwo independent payroll agencies, FISC Inc. or BeneTemps Inc., who\n\nissued Plaintiffs' paychecks during the entire period of their\n\nemployment with GTE.      Plaintiffs received no paychecks or benefits\n\nfrom GTE during their tenure.          In all other respects, Plaintiffs\n\nwere   treated     like   \"regular,\"      full-time     GTE   employees.      In\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fparticular, Plaintiffs received the same training, performance\n\nreviews, and access to GTE facilities as other employees; were\n\ninvited to corporate functions, staff meetings, and committee\n\nservice    just   as   other    employees   were;     and    were   explicitly\n\ninstructed to identify themselves to outsiders as \"GTE employees\"\n\nrather than as temporary employees.          In short, according to the\n\ncomplaint,    Plaintiffs       were   \"thoroughly    integrated     in     GTE's\n\nworkforce.\"\n\n            In August 1998, GTE terminated Parsons' employment in\n\npreparation for closing the Danvers facility.               In December 1998,\n\nGTE terminated Edes' and Lyons' employment.                 On May 3, 1999,\n\nPlaintiffs made demands for ERISA plan benefits on the GTE Human\n\nResources Department.       GTE denied the claims on September 8, 1999\n\non the ground that Plaintiffs had not been employed by GTE, and\n\noffered Plaintiffs no administrative review options.\n\n            On October 10, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a putative class-\n\naction    complaint    in   federal    district     court    against     Verizon\n\nCommunications, Inc. (formerly GTE Corporation), seven named GTE\n\nERISA benefits plans and their administrators and fiduciaries,1 and\n\n\"GTE John Doe Unknown Plans 1 - 10.\"                Plaintiffs alleged, on\n\ninformation and belief, that because eligibility to participate in\n\n\n     1\n      The named plans include: GTE Employee Savings Plan, GTE\nEmployees Medical Plans, GTE Employees Dental Plans, GTE Retirement\nIncome Plans, GTE Tuition Reimbursement Plan, GTE Matching\nContribution to Education Plan, and GTE Plan for Group Insurance\nLong Term Disability Income Protection Plan.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fGTE's ERISA plans was \"expressly limited to employees who were paid\n\ndirectly by a participating business unit,\" Defendants had violated\n\ntheir rights under ERISA and state common law.\n\n          On February 20, 2002, Defendants moved to dismiss each of\n\nPlaintiffs' claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing,\n\ninter alia, that their claims of interference with attainment of\n\nparticipation rights and breach of fiduciary duty were time-barred\n\nand their state common-law claim preempted. After a hearing on the\n\nmotion, the court stayed discovery but did not stay automatic\n\ndisclosure, noting that Defendants had yet to disclose the plans'\n\nactual language.   On September 19, 2002, the court issued an order\n\ndenying Defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice to its\n\nrenewal \"once the precise language of the terms of eligibility is\n\nproduced.\"   In October 2002, Defendants submitted an attorney\n\ndeclaration with exhibits stating that they had disclosed plan\n\ndocuments to Plaintiffs in May and June 2002.      After the court\n\npermitted Plaintiffs to take a deposition to determine when the\n\nrelevant eligibility criteria had been included in GTE's ERISA\n\nplans, Defendants filed a memorandum in further support of their\n\nmotion to dismiss in January 2003.    Plaintiffs filed a memorandum\n\nin further opposition to the motion.2\n\n\n     2\n      In their memorandum, Plaintiffs protested that Defendants had\ndisclosed only one plan (the GTE Savings Plan), and only summary\nplan descriptions of the other GTE ERISA plans. As the district\ncourt noted, \"[w]hile plaintiffs complain that all plan documents\nhave not been submitted, they [did] not file a motion to compel\n\n                                -4-\n\f          On July 25, 2003, the district court issued a memorandum\n\nand order granting Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint.\n\nThe court held that Plaintiffs' claims of interference with plan\n\nparticipation rights and breach of fiduciary duty were time-barred\n\nand that their state common-law claim was preempted by ERISA. Edes\n\nv. Verizon Communications, Inc., 288 F. Supp. 2d 55, 59, 61-62, 64\n\n(D. Mass. 2003). The district court also concluded that Plaintiffs\n\notherwise failed to state claims for which relief could be granted.\n\nId. at 58-59, 64.   Plaintiffs timely appealed.3\n\n                                II.\n\n          We review de novo a district court's decision to dismiss\n\na complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \"accepting all well-pleaded\n\nfacts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nplaintiff.\"   Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor & Gamble Commercial Co.,\n\n228 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2000).        A \"complaint is properly\n\ndismissed only when the allegations are such that 'the plaintiff\n\ncan prove no set of facts to support [the] claim for relief.'\"   Id.\n\n(quoting Rockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 260 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)).   \"Granting a motion to dismiss based on a limitations\n\n\n[disclosure] pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a).\" Edes v. Verizon\nCommunications, Inc., 288 F. Supp. 2d 55, 58 n.4 (D. Mass. 2003).\nAccording to Defendants' attorney declaration and exhibits,\nDefendants disclosed the GTE Plan for Group Insurance, the GTE Plan\nfor Employees' Pensions, and the Long-Term Disability Income\nProtection Plan in addition to the GTE Savings Plan.\n     3\n      Plaintiffs do not appeal the district court's dismissal of\ntheir state common-law claim.\n\n                                -5-\n\fdefense is entirely appropriate when the pleader's allegations\n\nleave no doubt that an asserted claim is time-barred.\"                LaChapelle\n\nv. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nA.             Entitlement to Benefits Under the Plans\n\n               Plaintiffs    argue   that   the   district    court   improperly\n\ndismissed their claim of entitlement to plan benefits under ERISA\n\nยง 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. ยง 1102(a)(1)(B), for lack of standing.\n\nSee, e.g., Abraham v. Exxon Corp., 85 F.3d 1126, 1129 (5th Cir.\n\n1996)       (\"Whether   an   employee   has   standing   as   a   'participant'\n\ndepends, not on whether he is actually entitled to benefits, but on\n\nwhether he has a colorable claim that he will prevail in a suit for\n\nbenefits.\").       The district court made no reference in its decision\n\nto standing.        Rather, based on the plan documents submitted by\n\nDefendants, the court concluded that \"by the terms of the plans,\n\n[P]laintiffs are not entitled to benefits because they [were] not\n\npaid directly by GTE, but instead [were] paid by temporary payroll\n\nagencies.\"       Edes, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 58 (footnote omitted).4\n\n               Plaintiffs also insist that they may proceed with their\n\nclaim because they were common-law employees of GTE by virtue of\n\n\n\n        4\n      \"Where, as here, 'a complaint's factual allegations are\nexpressly linked to -- and admittedly dependent upon -- a document\n(the authenticity of which is not challenged), that document\neffectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can\nreview it in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).'\"\nPerry v. New Eng. Bus. Serv., Inc., 347 F.3d 343, 345 n.2 (1st Cir.\n2003) (quoting Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12,\n17 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n                                        -6-\n\ftheir full \"integrat[ion] in GTE's workforce.\" Whether or not this\n\nis so, the district court correctly concluded that \"[t]he fact that\n\n[P]laintiffs may be common law employees is not by itself enough to\n\nstate a valid claim for benefits under ERISA.\"         Edes, 288 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 58-59.      In an opinion published several months after the\n\ndistrict court rendered its decision, a panel of this circuit\n\nreached the same conclusion, stating that a plaintiff \"may have a\n\nplausible argument that he was a common law employee . . . , but it\n\nis the language of the Plan, not common law status, that controls.\"\n\nKolling v. Am. Power Conversion Corp., 347 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n          Plaintiffs' own complaint alleges, and the plan documents\n\nsubmitted by Defendants confirm, that GTE's ERISA plans explicitly\n\nexclude from participation employees who were not \"paid directly\"\n\nby GTE, without regard for their common-law employment status.5\n\nPlaintiffs   further   allege   that    they   were   in   fact   not   \"paid\n\ndirectly\" by GTE, but by third-party payroll agencies.              Because\n\nthey \"can prove no set of facts to support [their] claim\" for\n\nbenefits under the ERISA plans, Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 260, the\n\ndistrict court properly dismissed Plaintiffs' claim under ERISA\n\nยง 502(a)(1)(B).\n\n\n\n     5\n      Similarly, in their opening brief on appeal, Plaintiffs\n\"assum[e] that GTE's welfare plans all have similar criteria for\nparticipation.   Plan benefits are available to all active GTE\nemployees who are paid directly by GTE.\"\n\n                                  -7-\n\fB.           Interference with Attainment of Plan Participation Rights\n\n             Plaintiffs allege that Defendants misclassified them as\n\noff-payroll employees for the purpose of interfering with their\n\nattainment of plan participation rights in violation of ERISA\n\nยง 510, 29 U.S.C. ยง 1140.           That statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n             It shall be unlawful for any person to\n             discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline,\n             or discriminate against a participant or\n             beneficiary for exercising any right to which\n             he is entitled [under ERISA or an ERISA plan],\n             or for the purpose of interfering with the\n             attainment of any right to which such\n             participant may become entitled.\n\n29 U.S.C. ยง 1140.\n\n             The district court held that Plaintiffs could not state\n\na    claim   for    relief      under   this   provision      for   two   independent\n\nreasons.     \"First, an employer may hire employees under terms that\n\nrender them ineligible to receive benefits given to other employees\n\nwithout violating [ERISA] ยง 510.\"                Edes, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 59.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the district court's analysis ignored the\n\nlanguage in ERISA ยง 510 prohibiting employers from discriminating\n\nagainst      a   participant       or    beneficiary        \"for    the   purpose    of\n\ninterfering        with   the    attainment      of   any   right    to   which     such\n\nparticipant may become entitled\" under an ERISA plan.                       29 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1140 (emphasis added).                Plaintiffs argue that whether or not\n\nDefendants permissibly excluded them from plan eligibility at the\n\ntime they were hired as off-payroll employees, Defendants failed to\n\nmove them to the GTE payroll after they were hired, \"for the\n\n                                           -8-\n\fpurpose of interfering with the attainment\" of participation rights\n\nto which they should have become entitled.6\n\n           We need not decide the circumstances, if any, under which\n\nemployees who are ineligible for ERISA benefits at the time of\n\nhiring may state a claim under ERISA ยง 510, based on a defendant's\n\nfailure to reclassify them, because the district court properly\n\ndismissed the claim on the alternate ground that it was time-\n\nbarred.    See Edes, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 59.           The district court\n\ndetermined the applicable statute of limitations by reference to\n\nstate law.   See Muldoon v. C.J. Muldoon & Sons, 278 F.3d 31, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (\"Because Congress did not provide a\n\nstatute of limitations in the ERISA statute for section 510 claims,\n\nfederal courts must apply the limitations period of the state-law\n\ncause of action most analogous to the federal claim.\").              The\n\nclaimed wrong here is the misclassification of Plaintiffs in April\n\n1994 when they went on the payroll of the agency rather than the\n\ncompany.     Consequently,   the   district   court    properly   applied\n\nMassachusetts' three-year statute of limitations for torts, Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 260, ยง 2A, to Plaintiffs' claim under ERISA ยง 510.\n\n\n\n     6\n      More accurately, Plaintiffs allege that GTE designated them\nas \"temporary\" employees at the time they were hired and failed to\nreclassify them as \"regular\" employees at some point during their\nemployment. Because the dispositive issue determining eligibility\nfor participation in GTE's ERISA plans is not whether Plaintiffs\nwere \"temporary\" or \"regular\" employees but simply whether they\nwere \"paid directly\" by their employing business unit, we have\nconstrued Plaintiffs' claim accordingly.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            The district court next applied federal law to determine\n\nthe date on which Plaintiffs' claim accrued and started the clock\n\non the three-year statute of limitations.        Tolle v. Carroll Touch,\n\nInc., 977 F.2d 1129, 1138 (7th Cir. 1992) (federal common law\n\ndetermines date of accrual of cause of action under ERISA ยง 510);\n\nN. Cal. Retail Clerks Unions v. Jumbo Markets, Inc., 906 F.2d 1371,\n\n1372 (9th Cir. 1990) (federal common law determines when cause of\n\naction by trust funds to recover employer's contribution accrues\n\nunder    ERISA).   For   a   claim   under   ERISA    ยง   510,   \"it   is   the\n\n[challenged employment] decision and the participant's discovery of\n\nthis decision that dictates accrual\" of Plaintiffs' cause of\n\naction.    Tolle, 977 F.2d at 1140-41.       Applying this rule in light\n\nof Plaintiffs' allegation that they were directed to sign on with\n\nthird-party payroll agencies at their time of hire, the district\n\ncourt concluded that \"[t]he statute of limitations clock began on\n\n[P]laintiffs' claim when [P]laintiffs were hired in April 1994 and\n\nclassified as employees of a temporary payroll agency instead of as\n\nregular employees of GTE.\"      Edes, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 59.\n\n            Plaintiffs argue that even if they discovered the factual\n\nbasis for their claim as early as April 1994, their complaint\n\nalleges a continuing tort that tolled the statute of limitations\n\nuntil they received their last paychecks.7           Under this theory, in\n\n\n     7\n      We grant Plaintiffs the inference that Parsons, whom the\ncomplaint alleges was terminated in August 1998, continued to\nreceive paychecks through October 1998, within the three years\n\n                                     -10-\n\fPlaintiffs' words, \"[e]very time [Plaintiffs] received a paycheck\n\nfrom [a] third-party payroll company while still being denied\n\nbenefits under any of the GTE ERISA plans they were incurring new\n\ninjury, as a result of [Defendants'] continuing wrongful behavior.\"\n\nAs authority for this argument, Plaintiffs cite Doe v. Town of\n\nBlandford, 525 N.E.2d 403 (Mass. 1988), a case in which a claimant\n\nunder the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act alleged the continuing\n\ntorts of negligent supervision and failure to fire, which tolled\n\nthe time period for presentment of her claim to an executive\n\nofficer of a public employer as required by statute.\n\n          Even   assuming   for     the   sake   of   argument   that\n\nMassachusetts' continuing tort doctrine is applicable to a federal\n\nclaim under ERISA ยง 510 (an issue we do not decide),8 Plaintiffs\n\nhave not alleged a continuing tort. While Plaintiffs may have felt\n\nthe ongoing effects of their ineligibility for ERISA benefits every\n\ntime they received a paycheck from a third-party payroll agency,\n\n\n\nprior to the filing of the complaint on October 10, 2001.      See\nClorox Co. P.R., 228 F.3d at 30 (court reviewing motion to dismiss\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) must grant all reasonable\ninferences in the plaintiff's favor).\n     8\n      Cf. Pisciotta v. Teledyne Indus., Inc., 91 F.3d 1326, 1332\n(9th Cir. 1996) (rejecting continuing violation theory for claim\nsubject to state statute of limitations under ERISA ยง 510 by\nanalogy to ERISA ยง 413); see generally Rodriguez Narvaez v.\nNazario, 895 F.2d 38, 42 (1st Cir. 1990) (discussing, in context of\nfederal civil rights actions subject to state statutes of\nlimitations, considerations involved in determining whether to\napply state law exceptions to application of state statutes of\nlimitations).\n\n                                  -11-\n\fPlaintiffs' own allegations make clear that Defendants' wrongful\n\nconduct, if any, involved the misclassification of Plaintiffs as\n\noff-payroll employees at their time of hire in April 1994.     See\n\nBerry v. Allstate Ins. Co., 252 F. Supp. 2d 336, 346 (E.D. Tex.\n\n2003) (\"Allstate's refusal to allow Plaintiffs to participate in\n\nits benefit plans was the single act that served as the basis for\n\nthe alleged wrongful discrimination.\"), aff'd, 84 Fed. Appx. 442\n\n(5th Cir. 2004). The district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs'\n\nERISA ยง 510 claim as time-barred.9\n\nC.        Breaches of Fiduciary Duty\n\n          Plaintiffs allege that the defendant plan fiduciaries\n\nbreached their fiduciary duties in violation of ERISA ยง 404, 29\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1104, by: (1) misclassifying Plaintiffs as off-payroll\n\nemployees ineligible to participate in GTE's ERISA plans and (2)\n\ncreating a structural defect in the design of the plans through the\n\nuse of arbitrary eligibility criteria to exclude a disproportionate\n\nnumber of employees from plan participation in violation of ERISA's\n\n\n     9\n      Plaintiffs do not renew their argument, made before the\ndistrict court, that the statute of limitations was tolled while\nthey exhausted administrative remedies. See Edes, 288 F. Supp. 2d\nat 60-61. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that under Massachusetts law\nthe statute of limitations should be equitably tolled because they\nreasonably relied on GTE's representations that it would eventually\nplace them on GTE's direct payroll. Not only does the complaint\nfail to allege any facts supporting this argument, but Plaintiffs\nhave forfeited the argument through their failure to raise it\nbelow. United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992)\n(\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an\nargument to the district court, [he] may not unveil it in the court\nof appeals.\").\n\n                               -12-\n\fminimum participation standards.10     The district court held that\n\nPlaintiffs' claims were barred by the ERISA statute of limitations\n\napplicable to breaches of fiduciary duty.    ERISA ยง 413, 29 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1113, prohibits commencement of such claims \"after the earlier\n\nof\":\n\n            (1) six years after (A) the date of the last\n            action which constituted a part of the breach\n            or violation, or (B) in the case of an\n            omission, the latest date on which the\n            fiduciary could have cured the breach or\n            violation, or\n\n            (2) three years after the earliest date on\n            which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of\n            the breach or violation . . . .\n\n(emphasis added).11   Pursuant to ยง 413, \"ERISA provides that claims\n\nbased on a breach of fiduciary duty must be brought within six\n\n\n\n       10\n      The Ninth Circuit has permitted enforcement of ERISA ยง 404\nunder a \"structural defect\" theory, which posits that \"rules that\nexclude employees from receiving benefits for reasons that are\narbitrary and capricious are structurally defective and violate\nsection 1104.\" Siles v. ILGWU Nat'l Retirement Fund, 783 F.2d 923,\n929 (9th Cir. 1986); see also Abraham, 85 F.3d at 1129-30\n(discussing \"structural defect\" theory).      Defendants argued in\ntheir memorandum in further support of their motion to dismiss that\nPlaintiffs' structural defect claim arising out of an alleged\nstructural defect in plan design (as distinct from a structural\ndefect in plan administration) is not cognizable under ERISA ยง 404.\nThe district court did not address this argument, and neither do\nwe. We discuss the merits of Plaintiffs' independent claim that\nthe plans' use of arbitrary eligibility criteria violates ERISA's\nminimum participation standards, ERISA ยง 202, 29 U.S.C. ยง 1052, in\nPart II.D.\n       11\n      ERISA ยง 413 also contains an exception for \"fraud or\nconcealment,\" neither of which Plaintiffs allege, permitting an\naction to \"be commenced not later than six years after the date of\ndiscovery of such breach or violation.\" 29 U.S.C. ยง 1113.\n\n                                -13-\n\fyears of the breach or 'the latest date on which the fiduciary\n\ncould have cured the breach or violation,' and within three years\n\nof the date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the\n\nbreach.\" Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp., 298 F.3d 102, 118 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).   The district court found Plaintiffs' claim barred by\n\nthe three-year statute of limitations because \"[P]laintiffs did\n\nhave actual knowledge of their status in 1994, yet failed to\n\ncommence their case until 2001.\"   Edes, 288 F. Supp. 2d 55, 61.12\n\n          Plaintiffs argue on appeal that \"actual knowledge of a\n\nbreach or violation\" within the meaning of ERISA ยง 413 \"requires a\n\nshowing that plaintiffs actually knew not only of the events that\n\noccurred which constitute the breach or violation but also that\n\nthose events supported a claim of breach of fiduciary duty or\n\nviolation under ERISA.\"   Int'l Union of Elec., Elec., Salaried,\n\nMach. & Furniture Workers v. Murata Erie N. Am., Inc., 980 F.2d\n\n889, 900 (3d Cir. 1992); see also Maher v. Strachan Shipping Co.,\n\n68 F.3d 951, 954 (5th Cir. 1995) (applying Third Circuit test).\n\nThe issue of defining \"actual knowledge\" has vexed the circuits.\n\nThe briefing purports to divine a clear circuit split.     On that\n\nview, as noted, the Third and Fifth Circuits follow a rule that for\n\nan ERISA ยง 404 claim to accrue, a plaintiff must know of not only\n\n\n\n     12\n      Defendants did not argue below, nor do they argue on appeal,\nthat Plaintiffs' claim of breach of fiduciary duty is independently\nbarred by the alternate six-year statute of limitations in ERISA\nยง 413(1).\n\n                               -14-\n\fall the facts and events constituting the fiduciary breach, but\n\nalso \"that those events supported a claim of breach of fiduciary\n\nduty or violation under ERISA.\"    Murata, 980 F.2d at 900; see also\n\nMaher, 68 F.3d at 954 (quoting Murata).     By contrast, the Sixth,\n\nSeventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits are said to have a hard and\n\nfast rule that a plaintiff need only have had \"knowledge of the\n\nfacts or transaction that constituted the alleged violation\" -- and\n\nnot knowledge that those facts support a legal claim -- to start\n\nthe limitation period running.      Martin v. Consultants & Adm'rs,\n\nInc., 966 F.2d 1078, 1086 (7th Cir. 1992); see also Wright v.\n\nHeyne, 349 F.3d 321, 330 (6th Cir. 2003); Blanton v. Anzalone, 760\n\nF.2d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 1985).     Accord Brock v. Nellis, 809 F.2d\n\n753, 755 (11th Cir. 1987).     The Second and D.C. Circuits, on this\n\nscale, have hybrid analyses.    See Caputo v. Pfizer, Inc., 267 F.3d\n\n181, 193 (2d Cir. 2001) (plaintiff need have \"knowledge of all\n\nmaterial facts necessary to understand that an ERISA fiduciary has\n\nbreached his or her duty,\" but \"need not have knowledge of the\n\nrelevant law\") (citing Maher, 68 F.3d at 954; Gluck v. Unisys\n\nCorp., 960 F.2d 1168, 1177 (3d Cir. 1992); and Blanton, 760 F.2d at\n\n992); Fink v. Nat'l Sav. & Trust Co., 772 F.2d 951, 957 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1985) (\"The disclosure of a transaction that is not inherently a\n\nstatutory breach of fiduciary duty . . . cannot communicate the\n\nexistence of an underlying breach.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f             We   think     the    differences         are    exaggerated,   and    the\n\npositions of the circuits, as evidenced by how they apply the\n\n\"rules\" to the facts, are much more nuanced.                   Further, even if the\n\nlanguage set forth above were an accurate depiction, we would find\n\nourselves in the middle.\n\n             Settling on a description of the appropriate standard to\n\napply is a complex venture.                 Prior to 1987, ERISA ยง 413 also\n\n\"contained a constructive knowledge provision, stating that the\n\nthree-year    limitations          period    began      when   a   plaintiff    'could\n\nreasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge' from certain\n\nreports filed with the Secretary of Labor.\"                     Martin, 966 F.2d at\n\n1085 n.6 (citing earlier version and legislative history).                       Given\n\nthis explicit statutory alteration, as the Seventh Circuit has\n\nrecognized,       \"actual      knowledge         must    be     distinguished      from\n\nconstructive knowledge\" in applying ERISA ยง 413.                   Id. at 1086.     Yet\n\n\"[i]t   is    difficult       to    say     in   the    abstract    precisely      what\n\nconstitutes 'actual knowledge' of a 'breach or violation.'\"                        Id.\n\nWhere the alleged breach arises out of a financial transaction\n\ninvolving ERISA plan funds, determining where the distinction\n\nbetween actual and constructive knowledge lies in a particular case\n\nmay depend \"on the level of generality employed in characterizing\n\nthe transaction at issue,\" which may depend, in turn, on an\n\nexamination       of   \"the       complexity      of     the    underlying     factual\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\ftransaction,   the    complexity      of     the    legal   claim    and     the\n\negregiousness of the alleged violation.\"            Id.\n\n           We agree with the observation that the primary purpose of\n\na statute of limitations is to \"prevent[] plaintiffs from sleeping\n\non their rights and [to] prohibit[] the prosecution of stale\n\nclaims.\"   Wright, 349 F.3d at 330.          The amendment to ERISA ยง 413\n\nmeans that knowledge of facts cannot be attributed to plaintiffs\n\nwho have no actual knowledge of them.              We also agree that there\n\ncannot be actual knowledge of a violation for purposes of the\n\nlimitation period unless a plaintiff knows \"the essential facts of\n\nthe transaction or conduct constituting the violation.\"                  Martin,\n\n966 F.2d at 1086.     And, like the Martin court, we recognize that\n\ndetermining the meaning of complex transactions may take some time;\n\nmere knowledge of facts indicating that \"'something was awry'\" does\n\nnot always mean there is actual knowledge of a violation.                   Id.\n\n(quoting Radiology Ctr., S.C. v. Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., 919 F.2d\n\n1216, 1221 (7th Cir. 1990)).         On the other hand, we do not think\n\nCongress   intended   the   actual    knowledge      requirement    to   excuse\n\nwillful blindness by a plaintiff.           See id. at 1086 n.7.\n\n           The question of when there is \"actual knowledge of a\n\nviolation,\" as Martin notes, is one which may change with different\n\nfacts.   Here we need not go into the permutations of that question,\n\nbecause it is clear that Plaintiffs had the requisite \"actual\n\nknowledge\" in April 1994. Plaintiffs' claim of breach of fiduciary\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fduty arises not from an intricate financial transaction, cf., e.g.,\n\nid. at 1087-88 (analyzing claim against fund trustees for use of\n\nimproper contract bidding process as violation of duty to eliminate\n\nimprudent investments), but from GTE's decision to hire Plaintiffs\n\nwithout rendering them eligible to participate in its ERISA plans.\n\nIn essence, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had a fiduciary duty\n\nto classify them as eligible for plan participation, and to design\n\ntheir plans accordingly, based on their status as common-law\n\nemployees, regardless of the plans' actual eligibility criteria.\n\n              As   the   facts   alleged   in   their   complaint    establish,\n\nPlaintiffs knew in April 1994 that they were not classified as\n\nemployees on GTE's direct payroll.              At the same time, Plaintiffs\n\nreceived no ERISA benefits from GTE.              These facts establish that\n\nPlaintiffs had actual knowledge that if Defendants had a fiduciary\n\nduty to classify them as eligible for ERISA plan participation\n\nand/or to design their plans accordingly, they had breached that\n\nduty.      Accordingly, Plaintiffs need not have had actual knowledge\n\nof   the    plans'   eligibility    criteria      to   start   the   statute   of\n\nlimitations running, and their claim of breach of fiduciary duty in\n\nviolation of ERISA ยง 404, filed more than three years later, is\n\ntime-barred under ERISA ยง 413.\n\nD.            Violation of ERISA's Minimum Participation Standards\n\n              ERISA sets minimum participation standards in the form of\n\nlimits on a plan's imposition of age- or length-of-service-related\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fconditions of participation, see ERISA ยง 202(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1052(a)(1),    on   any    employee        who   is    \"otherwise    entitled   to\n\nparticipate in the plan,\" 29 U.S.C. ยง 1052(a)(4).                 A provision of\n\nthe Code of Federal Regulations, 26 C.F.R. ยง 1.410(a)-3(e)(1),\n\nwhich is made applicable to ERISA's statutory minimum participation\n\nstandards under ERISA ยง 3002(c), 29 U.S.C. ยง 1202(c), clarifies\n\nthat \"[p]lan provisions which have the effect of requiring an age\n\nor service requirement . . . will be treated as if they imposed an\n\nage or service requirement,\" thereby preventing a plan from evading\n\nERISA's   minimum   participation          standards    through     creative   plan\n\ndesign.   Apart from these limitations, \"[s]o long as a plan does\n\nnot discriminate based on age or length of service, nothing in\n\nERISA requires a plan to extend benefits to every common law\n\nemployee.\"    Kolling, 347 F.3d at 14.\n\n           Plaintiffs make a cursory attempt to argue that the GTE\n\nERISA plans' eligibility criterion -- whether an employee is \"paid\n\ndirectly\" or by a third-party payroll agency -- is a condition of\n\nparticipation imposed on employees who are \"otherwise entitled to\n\nparticipate\"    that      \"ha[s]     the    effect\"     of   a    minimum-service\n\nrequirement exceeding the permissible limits of ERISA's minimum\n\nparticipation standards.           Under Plaintiffs' theory, \"[s]ince GTE\n\ncould choose at any time (or never)\" to place Plaintiffs on GTE's\n\nown payroll, \"what GTE has created are exclusions of uncertain and\n\narbitrary duration.\"       Even if this is so, Plaintiffs' indefinite\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fexclusion from plan eligibility simply renders them employees who\n\nare   not   (and   may   never    be)   \"entitled     to   participate   in    the\n\nplan[s],\" 29 U.S.C. ยง 1052(a)(4) -- not employees who are otherwise\n\neligible but who are nevertheless excluded pending completion of a\n\nspecific period of service exceeding the minimum permitted under\n\nERISA.\n\n            Despite Plaintiffs' attempt to hitch their claim to\n\nERISA's minimum participation standards limiting the use of age- or\n\nlength-of-service-related conditions of participation, their true\n\ncomplaint remains that the GTE ERISA plans use arbitrary criteria\n\nto    establish    an    employee's      threshold     eligibility   for      plan\n\nparticipation -- a complaint that has nothing to do with ERISA's\n\nminimum participation standards.               Indeed, Plaintiffs identify no\n\nstatutory provision that prohibits the use of such arbitrary\n\neligibility criteria.            Rather, Plaintiffs rely on a Treasury\n\nregulation, 26 C.F.R. ยง 1.410(b)-4(b), which sets forth one method\n\nby which an ERISA plan may voluntarily satisfy certain requirements\n\nin order to qualify for preferential tax treatment.              See 26 U.S.C.\n\nยง 410(b); 26 C.F.R. ยง 1.410(b)-2(b).\n\n            Under ยง 1.410(b)-4(b),\n\n            [a plan] classification is established by the\n            employer in accordance with this paragraph (b)\n            if and only if, based on all the facts and\n            circumstances,    the     classification    is\n            reasonable and is established under objective\n            business criteria that identify the category\n            of employees who benefit under the plan.\n            Reasonable classifications generally include\n\n                                        -20-\n\f            specified    job   categories,   nature   of\n            compensation (i.e., salaried or hourly),\n            geographic location, and similar bona fide\n            business   criteria.     An  enumeration  of\n            employees by name or other specific criteria\n            having substantially the same effect as an\n            enumeration by name is not considered a\n            reasonable classification.\n\n(emphases added.)       According to Plaintiffs, the GTE ERISA plans'\n\nuse of arbitrary distinctions between employees who are \"paid\n\ndirectly\" and those who are paid by third-party payroll agencies\n\nhas \"substantially the same effect as an enumeration by name\" and\n\n\"is not considered a reasonable classification . . . established\n\nunder objective business criteria\" within the meaning of the\n\nregulation.      On this basis, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants\n\nimpermissibly excluded them from plan eligibility.\n\n            There are two problems with this argument.                    Even if\n\nPlaintiffs    are     right    that   the     GTE   ERISA   plans   violate      this\n\nregulation (a judgment we do not make), Plaintiffs themselves\n\nrecognize that ยง 1.410(b)-4(b) is not incorporated into ERISA.\n\nHence a violation of this regulation cannot be a violation of ERISA\n\nthrough incorporation. Nor does ยง 1.410(b)-4(b) confer substantive\n\nrights   on   ERISA     plan    participants        or   would-be    participants\n\nindependent of ERISA's statutory provisions.                 The district court\n\nconcluded     that,    \"[w]hile       GTE's    classification       may   well     be\n\nunreasonable and arbitrary under the Treasury regulations, . . .\n\nthis failure to comply with the tax regulations does not permit the\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fCourt to rewrite the plan.\"    Edes, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 64.   As the\n\nFifth Circuit reasoned in Abraham, 85 F.3d at 1131:\n\n          [t]he [Treasury] regulations purport to do no\n          more than determine whether a plan is a\n          qualified tax plan.     Failure to meet the\n          requirements of those regulations results in\n          the loss of a beneficial tax status; it does\n          not permit a court to rewrite the plan to\n          include additional employees.    The Treasury\n          regulations do not create substantive rights\n          under ERISA that would permit the relief\n          [plaintiff] requests.\n\nAccord Bronk v. Mountain States Tel. & Tel., Inc., 140 F.3d 1335,\n\n1338 (10th Cir. 1998); Montesano v. Xerox Corp., 117 F. Supp. 2d\n\n147, 162 (D. Conn. 2000), aff'd in part and rev'd on an unrelated\n\nground, 256 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 2001).   Plaintiffs therefore fail\n\nto state a claim under ERISA based on Defendants' alleged violation\n\nof 26 C.F.R. ยง 1.410(b)-4(b) or, in the alternative, under that\n\nregulation standing alone.13\n\n\n     13\n      Plaintiffs belatedly argue that an ERISA plan may, by its own\nterms, provide that the plan must comply with Treasury regulations\ngoverning qualification for preferred tax status. See Bronk, 140\nF.3d at 1338 (distinguishing plans containing explicit provisions\n\"that they must comply with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code and\nTreasury Department regulations governing tax-qualification\"). In\na footnote in their opening brief on appeal, Plaintiffs assert that\nGTE's ERISA plans \"state an intent to comply with the tax law.\nThus, they would be constructed to comply with the tax law\"\n(referring, presumably, to those tax laws that govern qualification\nfor preferred tax status). In their complaint, however, Plaintiffs\nalleged only that one set of GTE plans, the GTE Retirement Income\nPlans, are \"intended to comply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986,\nsubsequent legislation, and relevant rulings and regulations.\" At\noral argument, Plaintiffs asserted that Defendants' failure to\ndisclose the complete language of each GTE ERISA plan prevented\nthem from determining whether any of the plans contain such a\nrequirement. As we have noted, Plaintiffs did not seek to compel\n\n                                -22-\n\fE.        Lack of Written Plan Eligibility Criteria\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are in violation of\n\nERISA ยง 402, 29 U.S.C. ยง 1102(a)(1), which requires that \"[e]very\n\nemployee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant\n\nto a written instrument,\" because eligibility for participation in\n\nGTE ERISA plans cannot be determined without recourse to payroll\n\nlists that are not part of the plan documents themselves.       The\n\nstatutory requirement that plan terms be set forth in writing\n\nserves the purpose of \"ensur[ing] that participants know their\n\nrights and obligations under the plan, and to provide some degree\n\nof certainty in the administration of benefits.\"    Fenton v. John\n\nHancock Mut. Life. Ins. Co., 400 F.3d 83, 88-89 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citations omitted), petition for cert. filed, 2005 WL 1656497\n\n(U.S. July 13, 2005) (No. 05-80) (presenting question whether\n\ndistrict court properly considered summary plan descriptions in\n\nreview of administrator's denial of benefits).     Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the plans' arbitrary distinction between employees who are\n\n\"paid directly\" and those who are paid by third-party payroll\n\nagencies evades this requirement because it fails to establish\n\nobjective criteria for determining plan eligibility.        To the\n\ncontrary, as the district court stated, the \"plan documents specify\n\n\ndisclosure of additional plan documents. See supra, note 2. More\nimportantly, Plaintiffs have forfeited the argument that GTE's\nERISA plans are, by their own terms, subject to rules governing\nqualification for favorable tax treatment by failing to raise it\nbefore the district court. See Slade, 980 F.2d at 30.\n\n                               -23-\n\f'objective criteria' for eligibility: whether or not employees are\n\npaid directly by GTE.\"   Edes, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 64.    The plan\n\ndocuments thus provide adequate notice of participation rights\n\nbased on an employee's readily discernable payroll status, and the\n\ndistrict court properly held that Plaintiffs failed to state a\n\nclaim for a violation of ERISA ยง 402.\n\n                              III.\n\n          Because Plaintiffs' claims of interference with their\n\nattainment of plan participation rights and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty under ERISA ยงยง 510 and 404 are time-barred, and because\n\nPlaintiffs have otherwise failed to state claims for which relief\n\nmay be granted, the decision of the district court dismissing the\n\ncomplaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -24-\n\f",

Edes, Kevin Lyons, and John Parsons appeal the dismissal of their claims against Defendants-appellees Verizon Communications, Inc., et al., under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C &#167; 1001-1461, as amended (\"ERISA\"). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated ERISA by relegating them to the payrolls of third-party payroll agencies, thereby: (1) wrongfully denying them benefits under ERISA plans; (2) interfering with their attainment of plan participation rights; (3) breaching fiduciary duties owed to them; (4) failing to meet ERISA's minimum participation standards; and (5) using arbitrary, unwritten plan eligibility criteria. We affirm the district court's decision to dismiss each of these claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As alleged in the complaint, Plaintiffs were hired by GTE Service Corporation (\"GTE\"), a business unit of GTE Corporation (now Verizon Communications, Inc.), to work in its Danvers, Massachusetts, office in or around April 1994. Although Plaintiffs were hired directly by GTE, each was told to sign on with one of two independent payroll agencies, FISC Inc. or BeneTemps Inc., who issued Plaintiffs' paychecks during the entire period of their employment with GTE. Plaintiffs received no paychecks or benefits from GTE during their tenure. In all other respects, Plaintiffs were treated like \"regular,\" full-time GTE employees. In particular, Plaintiffs received the same training, performance reviews, and access to GTE facilities as other employees; were invited to corporate functions, staff meetings, and committee service just as other employees were; and were explicitly instructed to identify themselves to outsiders as \"GTE employees\" rather than as temporary employees. In short, according to the complaint, Plaintiffs were \"thoroughly integrated in GTE's workforce.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1998, GTE terminated Parsons' employment in preparation for closing the Danvers facility. In December 1998, GTE terminated Edes' and Lyons' employment. On May 3, 1999, Plaintiffs made demands for ERISA plan benefits on the GTE Human Resources Department. GTE denied the claims on September 8, 1999 on the ground that Plaintiffs had not been employed by GTE, and offered Plaintiffs no administrative review options.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a putative class-action complaint in federal district court against Verizon Communications, Inc. (formerly GTE Corporation), seven named GTE ERISA benefits plans and their administrators and fiduciaries,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and \"GTE John Doe Unknown Plans 1-10.\" Plaintiffs alleged, on information and belief, that because eligibility to participate in GTE's ERISA plans was \"expressly limited to employees who were paid directly by a participating business unit,\" Defendants had violated their rights under ERISA and state common law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 20, 2002, Defendants moved to dismiss each of Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that their claims of interference with attainment of participation rights and breach of fiduciary duty were time-barred and their state common-law claim preempted. After a hearing on the motion, the court stayed discovery but did not stay automatic disclosure, noting that Defendants had yet to disclose the plans' actual language. On September 19, 2002, the court issued an order denying Defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice to its renewal \"once the precise language of the terms of eligibility is produced.\" In October 2002, Defendants submitted an attorney declaration with exhibits stating that they had disclosed plan documents to Plaintiffs in May and June 2002. After the court permitted Plaintiffs to take a deposition to determine when the relevant eligibility criteria had been included in GTE's ERISA plans, Defendants filed a memorandum in further support of their motion to dismiss in January 2003. Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in further opposition to the motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 2003, the district court issued a memorandum and order granting Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. The court held that Plaintiffs' claims of interference with plan participation rights and breach of fiduciary duty were time-barred and that their state common-law claim was preempted by ERISA. <i>Edes v. Verizon Communications, Inc.,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d 55, 59, 61-62, 64 (D.Mass. 2003). The district court also concluded that Plaintiffs otherwise failed to state claims for which relief could be granted. <i>Id.</i> at 58-59, 64. Plaintiffs timely appealed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> a district court's decision to dismiss a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \"accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\" <i>Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Commercial Co.,</i> 228 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir.2000). A \"complaint is properly dismissed only when the allegations are such that `the plaintiff can prove no set of facts to support [the] claim for relief.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Rockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp.,</i> 26 F.3d 254, 260 (1st Cir.1994)). \"Granting a motion to dismiss based on a limitations defense is entirely appropriate when the pleader's allegations leave no doubt that an asserted claim is time-barred.\" <i>LaChapelle</i> v. <i>Berkshire Life Ins.

Entitlement to Benefits Under the Plans</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly dismissed their claim of entitlement to plan benefits under ERISA &#167; 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1102(a)(1)(B), for lack of standing. <i>See, e.g., Abraham v. Exxon Corp.,</i> 85 F.3d 1126, 1129 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"Whether an employee has standing as a `participant' depends, not on whether he is actually entitled to benefits, but on whether he has a colorable claim that he will prevail in a suit for benefits.\"). The district court made no reference in its decision to standing. Rather, based on the plan documents submitted by Defendants, the court concluded that \"by the terms of the plans, [P]laintiffs are not entitled to benefits because they [were] not paid directly by GTE, but instead [were] paid by temporary payroll agencies.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 58 (footnote omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also insist that they may proceed with their claim because they were common-law employees of GTE by virtue of their full \"integrat[ion] in GTE's workforce.\" Whether or not this is so, the district court correctly concluded that \"[t]he fact that [P]laintiffs may be common law employees is not by itself enough to state a valid claim for benefits under ERISA.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 58-59. In an opinion published several months after the district court rendered its decision, a panel of this circuit reached the same conclusion, stating that a plaintiff \"may have a plausible argument that he was a common law employee . . ., but it is the language of the Plan, not common law status, that controls.\" <i>Kolling v. Am. Power Conversion Corp.,</i> 347 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' own complaint alleges, and the plan documents submitted by Defendants confirm, that GTE's ERISA plans explicitly exclude from participation employees who were not \"paid directly\" by GTE, without regard for their common-law employment status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Plaintiffs further allege that they were in fact not \"paid directly\" by GTE, but by third-party payroll agencies. Because they \"can prove no set of facts to support [their] claim\" for benefits under the ERISA plans, <i>Rockwell,</i> 26 F.3d at 260, the district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs' claim under ERISA &#167; 502(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Interference with Attainment of Plan Participation Rights</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendants misclassified them as off-payroll employees for the purpose of interfering with their attainment of plan participation rights in violation of ERISA &#167; 510, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1140. That statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled [under ERISA or an ERISA plan], or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that Plaintiffs could not state a claim for relief under this provision for two independent reasons. \"First, an employer may hire employees under terms that render them ineligible to receive benefits given to other employees without violating [ERISA] &#167; 510.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 59. Plaintiffs argue that the district court's analysis ignored the language in ERISA &#167; 510 prohibiting employers from discriminating against a participant or beneficiary \"for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant <i>may become entitled</i>\" under an ERISA plan. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1140 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs argue that whether or not Defendants permissibly excluded them from plan eligibility at the time they were hired as off-payroll employees, Defendants failed to move them to the GTE payroll after they were hired, \"for the purpose of interfering with the attainment\" of participation rights to which they should have become entitled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide the circumstances, if any, under which employees who are ineligible for ERISA benefits at the time of hiring may state a claim under ERISA &#167; 510, based on a defendant's failure to reclassify them, because the district court properly dismissed the claim on the alternate ground that it was time-barred. <i>See Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 59. The district court determined the applicable statute of limitations by reference to state law. <i>See Muldoon v. C.J. Muldoon &amp; Sons,</i> 278 F.3d 31, 32 (1st Cir.2002) (per curiam) (\"Because Congress did not provide a statute of limitations in the ERISA statute for section 510 claims, federal courts must apply the limitations period of the state-law cause of action most analogous to the federal claim.\"). The claimed wrong here is the misclassification of Plaintiffs in April 1994 when they went on the payroll of the agency rather than the company. Consequently, the district court properly applied Massachusetts' three-year statute of limitations for torts, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 2A, to Plaintiffs' claim under ERISA &#167; 510.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court next applied federal law to determine the date on which Plaintiffs' claim accrued and started the clock on the three-year statute of limitations. <i>Tolle v. Carroll Touch, Inc.,</i> 977 F.2d 1129, 1138 (7th Cir.1992) (federal common law determines date of accrual of cause of action under ERISA &#167; 510); <i>N. Cal. Retail Clerks Unions v. Jumbo Markets, Inc.,</i> 906 F.2d 1371, 1372 (9th Cir.1990) (federal common law determines when cause of action by trust funds to recover employer's contribution accrues under ERISA). For a claim under ERISA &#167; 510, \"it is the [challenged employment] decision and the participant's discovery of this decision that dictates accrual\" of Plaintiffs' cause of action. <i>Tolle,</i> 977 F.2d at 1140-41. Applying this rule in light of Plaintiffs' allegation that they were directed to sign on with third-party payroll agencies at their time of hire, the district court concluded that \"[t]he statute of limitations clock began on [P]laintiffs' claim when [P]laintiffs were hired in April 1994 and classified as employees of a temporary payroll agency instead of as regular employees of GTE.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that even if they discovered the factual basis for their claim as early as April 1994, their complaint alleges a continuing tort that tolled the statute of limitations until they received their last paychecks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Under this theory, in Plaintiffs' words, \"[e]very time [Plaintiffs] received a paycheck from [a] third-party payroll company while still being denied benefits under any of the GTE ERISA plans they were incurring new injury, as a result of [Defendants'] continuing wrongful behavior.\" As authority for this argument, Plaintiffs cite <i>Doe v. Town of Blandford,</i> 402 Mass. 831, 525 N.E.2d 403 (1988), a case in which a claimant under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act alleged the continuing torts of negligent supervision and failure to fire, which tolled the time period for presentment of her claim to an executive officer of a public employer as required by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming for the sake of argument that Massachusetts' continuing tort doctrine is applicable to a federal claim under ERISA &#167; 510 (an issue we do not decide),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Plaintiffs have not alleged a continuing tort. While Plaintiffs may have felt the ongoing effects of their ineligibility for ERISA benefits every time they received a paycheck from a third-party payroll agency, Plaintiffs' own allegations make clear that Defendants' wrongful conduct, if any, involved the misclassification of Plaintiffs as off-payroll employees at their time of hire in April 1994. <i>See Berry v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 252 F.Supp.2d 336, 346 (E.D.Tex.2003) (\"Allstate's refusal to allow Plaintiffs to participate in its benefit plans was the single act that served as the basis for the alleged wrongful discrimination.\"), <i>aff'd,</i> 84 Fed.Appx. 442 (5th Cir.2004). The district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs' ERISA &#167; 510 claim as time-barred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Breaches of Fiduciary Duty</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that the defendant plan fiduciaries breached their fiduciary duties in violation of ERISA &#167; 404, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1104, by: (1) misclassifying Plaintiffs as off-payroll employees ineligible to participate in GTE's ERISA plans and (2) creating a structural defect in the design of the plans through the use of arbitrary eligibility criteria to exclude a disproportionate number of employees from plan participation in violation of ERISA's minimum participation standards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The district court held that Plaintiffs' claims were barred by the ERISA statute of limitations applicable to breaches of fiduciary duty. ERISA &#167; 413, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1113, prohibits commencement of such claims \"after the earlier of\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) six years after (A) the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation, or (B) in the case of an omission, the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had <i>actual knowledge</i> of the breach or violation . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Pursuant to &#167; 413, \"ERISA provides that claims based on a breach of fiduciary duty must be brought within six years of the breach or `the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation,' <i>and</i> within three years of the date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach.\" <i>Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp.,</i> 298 F.3d 102, 118 (1st Cir.2002). The district court found Plaintiffs' claim barred by the three-year statute of limitations because \"[P]laintiffs did have actual knowledge of their status in 1994, yet failed to commence their case until 2001.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d 55, 61.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue on appeal that \"actual knowledge of a breach or violation\" within the meaning of ERISA &#167; 413 \"requires a showing that plaintiffs actually knew not only of the events that occurred which constitute the breach or violation but also that those events supported a claim of breach of fiduciary duty or violation under ERISA.\" <i>Int'l Union of Elec., Elec., Salaried, Mach. &amp; Furniture Workers v. Murata Erie N. Am., Inc.,</i> 980 F.2d 889, 900 (3d Cir.1992); <i>see also Maher v. Strachan Shipping Co.,</i> 68 F.3d 951, 954 (5th Cir. 1995) (applying Third Circuit test). The issue of defining \"actual knowledge\" has vexed the circuits. The briefing purports to divine a clear circuit split. On that view, as noted, the Third and Fifth Circuits follow a rule that for an ERISA &#167; 404 claim to accrue, a plaintiff must know of not only all the facts and events constituting the fiduciary breach, but also \"that those events supported a claim of breach of fiduciary duty or violation under ERISA.\" <i>Murata,</i> 980 F.2d at 900; <i>see also Maher,</i> 68 F.3d at 954 (quoting <i>Murata</i>). By contrast, the Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits are said to have a hard and fast rule that a plaintiff need only have had \"knowledge of the <i>facts</i> or <i>transaction</i> that constituted the alleged violation\"&#8212;and not knowledge that those facts support a legal claim&#8212;to start the limitation period running. <i>Martin v. Consultants &amp; Adm'rs, Inc.,</i> 966 F.2d 1078, 1086 (7th Cir.1992); <i>see also Wright v. Heyne,</i> 349 F.3d 321, 330 (6th Cir.2003); <i>Blanton v. Anzalone,</i> 760 F.2d 989, 992 (9th Cir.1985). <i>Accord Brock v. Nellis,</i> 809 F.2d 753, 755 (11th Cir.1987). The Second and D.C. Circuits, on this scale, have hybrid analyses. <i>See Caputo v. Pfizer, Inc.,</i> 267 F.3d 181, 193 (2d Cir.2001) (plaintiff need have \"knowledge of all material. facts necessary to understand that an ERISA fiduciary has breached his or her duty,\" but \"need not have knowledge of the relevant law\") (citing <i>Maher,</i> 68 F.3d at 954; <i>Gluck v. Unisys Corp.,</i> 960 F.2d 1168, 1177 (3d Cir.1992); and <i>Blanton,</i> 760 F.2d at 992); <i>Fink v. Nat'l Sav. &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 772 F.2d 951, 957 (D.C.Cir.1985) (\"The disclosure of a transaction that is not inherently a statutory breach of fiduciary duty . . . cannot communicate the existence of an underlying breach.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the differences are exaggerated, and the positions of the circuits, as evidenced by how they apply the \"rules\" to the facts, are much more nuanced. Further, even if the language set forth above were an accurate depiction, we would find ourselves in the middle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Settling on a description of the appropriate standard to apply is a complex venture. Prior to 1987, ERISA &#167; 413 also \"contained a constructive knowledge provision, stating that the three-year limitations period began when a plaintiff `could reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge' from certain reports filed with the Secretary of Labor.\" <i>Martin,</i> 966 F.2d at 1085 n. 6 (citing earlier version and legislative history). Given this explicit statutory alteration, as the Seventh Circuit has recognized, \"actual knowledge must be distinguished from constructive knowledge\" in applying ERISA &#167; 413. <i>Id.</i> at 1086. Yet \"[i]t is difficult to say in the abstract precisely what constitutes `actual knowledge' of a `breach or violation.'\" <i>Id.</i> Where the alleged breach arises out of a financial transaction involving ERISA plan funds, determining where the distinction between actual and constructive knowledge lies in a particular case may depend \"on the level of generality employed in characterizing the transaction at issue,\" which may depend, in turn, on an examination of \"the complexity of the underlying factual transaction, the complexity of the legal claim and the egregiousness of the alleged violation.\" <i>Id.</i> We agree with the observation that the primary purpose of a statute of limitations is to \"prevent[] plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights and [to] prohibit[] the prosecution of stale claims.\" <i>Wright,</i> 349 F.3d at 330. The amendment to ERISA &#167; 413 means that knowledge of <i>facts</i> cannot be attributed to plaintiffs who have no actual knowledge of them. We also agree that there cannot be actual knowledge of a violation for purposes of the limitation period unless a plaintiff knows \"the essential facts of the transaction or conduct constituting the violation.\" <i>Martin,</i> 966 F.2d at 1086. And, like the <i>Martin</i> court, we recognize that determining the meaning of complex transactions may take some time; mere knowledge of facts indicating that \"`something was awry'\" does not always mean there is actual knowledge of a violation. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Radiology Ctr., S.C. v. Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co.,</i> 919 F.2d 1216, 1221 (7th Cir.1990)). On the other hand, we do not think Congress intended the actual knowledge requirement to excuse willful blindness by a plaintiff. <i>See id.</i> at 1086 n. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of when there is \"actual knowledge of a violation,\" as <i>Martin</i> notes, is one which may change with different facts. Here we need not go into the permutations of that question, because it is clear that Plaintiffs had the requisite \"actual knowledge\" in April 1994. Plaintiffs' claim of breach of fiduciary duty arises not from an intricate financial transaction, <i>cf., e.g., id.</i> at 1087-88 (analyzing claim against fund trustees for use of improper contract bidding process as violation of duty to eliminate imprudent investments), but from GTE's decision to hire Plaintiffs without rendering them eligible to participate in its ERISA plans. In essence, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had a fiduciary duty to classify them as eligible for plan participation, and to design their plans accordingly, based on their status as common-law employees, regardless of the plans' actual eligibility criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the facts alleged in their complaint establish, Plaintiffs knew in April 1994 that they were not classified as employees on GTE's direct payroll. At the same time, Plaintiffs received no ERISA benefits from GTE. These facts establish that Plaintiffs had actual knowledge that if Defendants had a fiduciary duty to classify them as eligible for ERISA plan participation and/or to design their plans accordingly, they had breached that duty. Accordingly, Plaintiffs need not have had actual knowledge of the plans' eligibility criteria to start the statute of limitations running, and their claim of breach of fiduciary duty in violation of ERISA &#167; 404, filed more than three years later, is time-barred under ERISA &#167; 413.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

A provision of the Code of Federal Regulations, 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.410(a)-3(e)(1), which is made applicable to ERISA's statutory minimum participation standards under ERISA &#167; 3002(c), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1202(c), clarifies that \"[p]lan provisions which have the effect of requiring an age or service requirement ... will be treated as if they imposed an age or service requirement,\" thereby preventing a plan from evading ERISA's minimum participation standards through creative plan design. Apart from these limitations, \"[s]o long as a plan does not discriminate based on age or length of service, nothing in ERISA requires a plan to extend benefits to every common law employee.\" <i>Kolling,</i> 347 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs make a cursory attempt to argue that the GTE ERISA plans' eligibility criterion&#8212;whether an employee is \"paid directly\" or by a third-party payroll agency&#8212;is a condition of participation imposed on employees who are \"otherwise entitled to participate\" that \"ha[s] the effect\" of a minimum-service requirement exceeding the permissible limits of ERISA's minimum participation standards. Under Plaintiffs' theory, \"[s]ince GTE could choose at any time (or never)\" to place Plaintiffs on GTE's own payroll, \"what GTE has created are exclusions of uncertain and arbitrary duration.\" Even if this is so, Plaintiffs' indefinite exclusion from plan eligibility simply renders them employees who are not (and may never be) \"entitled to participate in the plan[s],\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1052(a)(4)&#8212;not employees who are otherwise eligible but who are nevertheless excluded pending completion of a specific period of service exceeding the minimum permitted under ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Plaintiffs' attempt to hitch their claim to ERISA's minimum participation standards limiting the use of age&#8212;or length-of-service-related conditions of participation, their true complaint remains that the GTE ERISA plans use arbitrary criteria to establish an employee's <i>threshold</i> eligibility for plan participation&#8212;a complaint that has nothing to do with ERISA's minimum participation standards. Indeed, Plaintiffs identify no statutory provision that prohibits the use of such arbitrary eligibility criteria. Rather, Plaintiffs rely on a Treasury regulation, 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.410(b)-4(b), which sets forth one method by which an ERISA plan may voluntarily satisfy certain requirements in order to qualify for preferential tax treatment. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 410(b); 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.410(b)-2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 1.410(b)-4(b),</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a plan] classification is established by the employer in accordance with this paragraph (b) if and only if, based on all the facts and circumstances, <i>the classification is reasonable and is established under objective business criteria</i> that identify the category of employees who benefit under the plan. Reasonable classifications generally include specified job categories, nature of compensation (i.e., salaried or hourly), geographic location, and similar bona fide business criteria. <i>An enumeration of employees by name or other specific criteria having substantially the same effect as an enumeration by name is not considered a reasonable classification.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphases added.) According to Plaintiffs, the GTE ERISA plans' use of arbitrary distinctions between employees who are \"paid directly\" and those who are paid by third-party payroll agencies has \"substantially the same effect as an enumeration by name\" and \"is not considered a reasonable classification . . . established under objective business criteria\" within the meaning of the regulation. On this basis, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants impermissibly excluded them from plan eligibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two problems with this argument. Even if Plaintiffs are right that the GTE ERISA plans violate this regulation (a judgment we do not make), Plaintiffs themselves recognize that &#167; 1.410(b)-4(b) is not incorporated into ERISA. Hence a violation of this regulation cannot be a violation of ERISA through incorporation. Nor does &#167; 1.410(b)-4(b) confer substantive rights on ERISA plan participants or would-be participants independent of ERISA's statutory provisions. The district court concluded that, \"[w]hile GTE's classification may well be unreasonable and arbitrary under the Treasury regulations,. . . this failure to comply with the tax regulations does not permit the Court to rewrite the plan.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 64.

Failure to meet the requirements of those regulations results in the loss of a beneficial tax status; it does not permit a court to rewrite the plan to include additional employees.

The statutory requirement that plan terms be set forth in writing serves the purpose of \"ensur[ing] that participants know their rights and obligations under the plan, and to provide some degree of certainty in the administration of benefits.\" <i>Fenton v.

Plaintiffs argue that the plans' arbitrary distinction between employees who are \"paid directly\" and those who are paid by third-party payroll agencies evades this requirement because it fails to establish objective criteria for determining plan eligibility. To the contrary, as the district court stated, the \"plan documents specify `objective criteria' for eligibility: whether or not employees are paid directly by GTE.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 64.

In a footnote in their opening brief on appeal, Plaintiffs assert that GTE's ERISA plans \"state an intent to comply with the tax law. Thus, they would be constructed to comply with the tax law\" (referring, presumably, to those tax laws that govern qualification for preferred tax status). In their complaint, however, Plaintiffs alleged only that one set of GTE plans, the GTE Retirement Income Plans, are \"intended to comply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, subsequent legislation, and relevant rulings and regulations.\" At oral argument, Plaintiffs asserted that Defendants' failure to disclose the complete language of each GTE ERISA plan prevented them from determining whether any of the plans contain such a requirement.

Although Plaintiffs were hired directly by GTE, each was told to sign on with one of two independent payroll agencies, FISC Inc. or BeneTemps Inc., who issued Plaintiffs' paychecks during the entire period of their employment with GTE. Plaintiffs received no paychecks or benefits from GTE during their tenure. In all other respects, Plaintiffs were treated like \"regular,\" full-time GTE employees. In particular, Plaintiffs received the same training, performance reviews, and access to GTE facilities as other employees; were invited to corporate functions, staff meetings, and committee service just as other employees were; and were explicitly instructed to identify themselves to outsiders as \"GTE employees\" rather than as temporary employees.

After a hearing on the motion, the court stayed discovery but did not stay automatic disclosure, noting that Defendants had yet to disclose the plans' actual language. On September 19, 2002, the court issued an order denying Defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice to its renewal \"once the precise language of the terms of eligibility is produced.\" In October 2002, Defendants submitted an attorney declaration with exhibits stating that they had disclosed plan documents to Plaintiffs in May and June 2002.

Prior to 1987, ERISA &#167; 413 also \"contained a constructive knowledge provision, stating that the three-year limitations period began when a plaintiff `could reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge' from certain reports filed with the Secretary of Labor.\" <i>Martin,</i> 966 F.2d at 1085 n. 6 (citing earlier version and legislative history). Given this explicit statutory alteration, as the Seventh Circuit has recognized, \"actual knowledge must be distinguished from constructive knowledge\" in applying ERISA &#167; 413. <i>Id.</i> at 1086. Yet \"[i]t is difficult to say in the abstract precisely what constitutes `actual knowledge' of a `breach or violation.'\" <i>Id.</i> Where the alleged breach arises out of a financial transaction involving ERISA plan funds, determining where the distinction between actual and constructive knowledge lies in a particular case may depend \"on the level of generality employed in characterizing the transaction at issue,\" which may depend, in turn, on an examination of \"the complexity of the underlying factual transaction, the complexity of the legal claim and the egregiousness of the alleged violation.\" <i>Id.</i> We agree with the observation that the primary purpose of a statute of limitations is to \"prevent[] plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights and [to] prohibit[] the prosecution of stale claims.\" <i>Wright,</i> 349 F.3d at 330. The amendment to ERISA &#167; 413 means that knowledge of <i>facts</i> cannot be attributed to plaintiffs who have no actual knowledge of them. We also agree that there cannot be actual knowledge of a violation for purposes of the limitation period unless a plaintiff knows \"the essential facts of the transaction or conduct constituting the violation.\" <i>Martin,</i> 966 F.2d at 1086. And, like the <i>Martin</i> court, we recognize that determining the meaning of complex transactions may take some time; mere knowledge of facts indicating that \"`something was awry'\" does not always mean there is actual knowledge of a violation. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Radiology Ctr., S.C. v. Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552215\"><a href=\"/opinion/552215/the-radiology-center-sc-and-enrique-schwarz-md-v-stifel-nicolaus/\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span>, 1221 (7th Cir.1990)). On the other hand, we do not think Congress intended the actual knowledge requirement to excuse willful blindness by a plaintiff. <i>See id.</i> at 1086 n. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of when there is \"actual knowledge of a violation,\" as <i>Martin</i> notes, is one which may change with different facts. Here we need not go into the permutations of that question, because it is clear that Plaintiffs had the requisite \"actual knowledge\" in April 1994. Plaintiffs' claim of breach of fiduciary duty arises not from an intricate financial transaction, <i>cf., e.g., id.</i> at 1087-88 (analyzing claim against fund trustees for use of improper contract bidding process as violation of duty to eliminate imprudent investments), but from GTE's decision to hire Plaintiffs without rendering them eligible to participate in its ERISA plans. In essence, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had a fiduciary duty to classify them as eligible for plan participation, and to design their plans accordingly, based on their status as common-law employees, regardless of the plans' actual eligibility criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the facts alleged in their complaint establish, Plaintiffs knew in April 1994 that they were not classified as employees on GTE's direct payroll. At the same time, Plaintiffs received no ERISA benefits from GTE. These facts establish that Plaintiffs had actual knowledge that if Defendants had a fiduciary duty to classify them as eligible for ERISA plan participation and/or to design their plans accordingly, they had breached that duty. Accordingly, Plaintiffs need not have had actual knowledge of the plans' eligibility criteria to start the statute of limitations running, and their claim of breach of fiduciary duty in violation of ERISA &#167; 404, filed more than three years later, is time-barred under ERISA &#167; 413.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

A provision of the Code of Federal Regulations, 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.410(a)-3(e)(1), which is made applicable to ERISA's statutory minimum participation standards under ERISA &#167; 3002(c), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1202(c), clarifies that \"[p]lan provisions which have the effect of requiring an age or service requirement ... will be treated as if they imposed an age or service requirement,\" thereby preventing a plan from evading ERISA's minimum participation standards through creative plan design. Apart from these limitations, \"[s]o long as a plan does not discriminate based on age or length of service, nothing in ERISA requires a plan to extend benefits to every common law employee.\" <i>Kolling,</i> 347 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs make a cursory attempt to argue that the GTE ERISA plans' eligibility criterion&#8212;whether an employee is \"paid directly\" or by a third-party payroll agency&#8212;is a condition of participation imposed on employees who are \"otherwise entitled to participate\" that \"ha[s] the effect\" of a minimum-service requirement exceeding the permissible limits of ERISA's minimum participation standards. Under Plaintiffs' theory, \"[s]ince GTE could choose at any time (or never)\" to place Plaintiffs on GTE's own payroll, \"what GTE has created are exclusions of uncertain and arbitrary duration.\" Even if this is so, Plaintiffs' indefinite exclusion from plan eligibility simply renders them employees who are not (and may never be) \"entitled to participate in the plan[s],\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1052(a)(4)&#8212;not employees who are otherwise eligible but who are nevertheless excluded pending completion of a specific period of service exceeding the minimum permitted under ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Plaintiffs' attempt to hitch their claim to ERISA's minimum participation standards limiting the use of age&#8212;or length-of-service-related conditions of participation, their true complaint remains that the GTE ERISA plans use arbitrary criteria to establish an employee's <i>threshold</i> eligibility for plan participation&#8212;a complaint that has nothing to do with ERISA's minimum participation standards. Indeed, Plaintiffs identify no statutory provision that prohibits the use of such arbitrary eligibility criteria. Rather, Plaintiffs rely on a Treasury regulation, 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.410(b)-4(b), which sets forth one method by which an ERISA plan may voluntarily satisfy certain requirements in order to qualify for preferential tax treatment. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 410(b); 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.410(b)-2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 1.410(b)-4(b),</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a plan] classification is established by the employer in accordance with this paragraph (b) if and only if, based on all the facts and circumstances, <i>the classification is reasonable and is established under objective business criteria</i> that identify the category of employees who benefit under the plan. Reasonable classifications generally include specified job categories, nature of compensation (i.e., salaried or hourly), geographic location, and similar bona fide business criteria. <i>An enumeration of employees by name or other specific criteria having substantially the same effect as an enumeration by name is not considered a reasonable classification.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphases added.) According to Plaintiffs, the GTE ERISA plans' use of arbitrary distinctions between employees who are \"paid directly\" and those who are paid by third-party payroll agencies has \"substantially the same effect as an enumeration by name\" and \"is not considered a reasonable classification . . . established under objective business criteria\" within the meaning of the regulation. On this basis, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants impermissibly excluded them from plan eligibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two problems with this argument. Even if Plaintiffs are right that the GTE ERISA plans violate this regulation (a judgment we do not make), Plaintiffs themselves recognize that &#167; 1.410(b)-4(b) is not incorporated into ERISA. Hence a violation of this regulation cannot be a violation of ERISA through incorporation. Nor does &#167; 1.410(b)-4(b) confer substantive rights on ERISA plan participants or would-be participants independent of ERISA's statutory provisions. The district court concluded that, \"[w]hile GTE's classification may well be unreasonable and arbitrary under the Treasury regulations,. . . this failure to comply with the tax regulations does not permit the Court to rewrite the plan.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 64. As the Fifth Circuit reasoned in <i>Abraham,</i> 85 F.3d at 1131:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he [Treasury] regulations purport to do no more than determine whether a plan is a qualified tax plan. Failure to meet the requirements of those regulations results in the loss of a beneficial tax status; it does not permit a court to rewrite the plan to include additional employees. The Treasury regulations do not create substantive rights under ERISA that would permit the relief [plaintiff] requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Accord Bronk v.

To the contrary, as the district court stated, the \"plan documents specify `objective criteria' for eligibility: whether or not employees are paid directly by GTE.\" <i>Edes,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 64.
