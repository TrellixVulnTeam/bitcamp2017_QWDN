Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nChristopher C. Fuller, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Janice K.\nRedfern, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n\n                           September 8, 2005\n\f          Per Curiam.         Petitioner Abdul Kigozi, a native and\n\ncitizen of Uganda, seeks review of an order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirming a decision of an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ).       The IJ denied requests for three forms of\n\nrelief: asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).          We lack jurisdiction to review\n\neither the asylum claim (because it was dismissed as untimely) or\n\nthe CAT claim (because it was not pursued before the BIA).             Our\n\nmerits review is accordingly confined to the claim for withholding.\n\nHaving found substantial evidence supporting the denial of that\n\nrequest, we deny the petition for review.\n\n          The general rule, subject to certain exceptions, is that\n\nan asylum claim must be filed within one year of an alien’s arrival\n\nin this country.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).       Petitioner, who\n\narrived on November 17, 1999, missed this deadline by at least\n\neight months.        To overcome this default, he sought to invoke an\n\nexception that applies when “extraordinary circumstances” have\n\ncontributed to the delay in filing.         Id. § 1158(a)(2)(D).    In one\n\nrespect, petitioner had a colorable (if unfortunate) argument:\n\nseveral weeks before the deadline expired, he had been diagnosed\n\nwith   both    HIV     and   tuberculosis    and   had   been   temporarily\n\nquarantined.    Yet the IJ deemed the exception inapplicable because\n\npetitioner had unjustifiably waited until the eleventh hour to\n\ninitiate the application process.          Petitioner’s challenge to this\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fruling necessarily fails, inasmuch as we lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview it.     By statute, “‘[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to\n\nreview   any   determination     of   the   Attorney   General’   concerning\n\nwhether an applicant for asylum filed an untimely application or\n\nqualifies for the exception to the filing requirement.”            Njenga v.\n\nAshcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 339 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(3)); accord, e.g., Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           We also lack jurisdiction to review petitioner’s CAT\n\nclaim, due to his failure to pursue it before the BIA.            In neither\n\nhis notice of appeal nor his brief to the BIA did he make any\n\nreference to this claim.       Exhaustion of administrative remedies is\n\nstatutorily    mandated,   see    8   U.S.C.   §   1252(d)(1),    and   is   a\n\njurisdictional requirement, see, e.g., Un v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d\n\n205, 210 (1st Cir. 2005); Sousa v. INS, 226 F.3d 28, 31-32 & n.3 (1st\n\nCir. 2000). Accordingly, “theories not advanced before the BIA may\n\nnot be surfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial\n\nreview.”     Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThis rule applies even where, as here, the BIA has summarily\n\naffirmed and we are thus reviewing the IJ’s decision.             See, e.g.,\n\nUn, 415 F.3d at 210-11 (declining to consider CAT claim); Olujoke\n\nv. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2005) (same).           We add that\n\npetitioner’s challenge in this regard would likely fail on the\n\nmerits in any event, as the following discussion suggests.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f             This leaves petitioner’s claim for withholding of removal\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).            To obtain such relief, petitioner\n\nmust show that, if removed, “he is more likely than not to face\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.”              Sharari, 407\n\nF.3d at 474.     He can do so in either of two ways: (i) by showing\n\nthat he has suffered such persecution in the past, thereby creating\n\na rebuttable presumption of its recurrence; or (ii) by showing that\n\nit is more likely than not that he will suffer such persecution in\n\nthe future, i.e., that he has a well-founded fear thereof which is\n\nboth subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.                 See, e.g.,\n\nSilva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).                We review the\n\nagency’s findings for substantial evidence and will reverse only if\n\nthe evidence “would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a\n\ncontrary determination.”         Id. at 5 (quoting Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\n168   F.3d   565,   569   (1st   Cir.    1999),   and   citing    8    U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n             The evidence pertinent to this claim can be briefly\n\nrecounted.      Petitioner’s      fear   of   persecution   stems      from   his\n\npolitical activities in Uganda between 1988 and 1994.              During that\n\ntime, first as a college student and then as an instructor, he was\n\ninvolved with an organization called the “Allied Democratic Forces”\n\n(ADF)–-a rebel group opposed to the policies of the governing\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fregime.    Petitioner served as a recruiter and attended clandestine\n\nmeetings.    His father was also a supporter.\n\n            In July 1994, petitioner was seized by armed men and\n\ntaken to a military prison, where he was detained for at least nine\n\ndays.     He was there questioned about the ADF’s operations, was\n\nphysically abused on a regular basis, and was seriously beaten at\n\nleast twice, suffering internal injuries and a lost tooth in the\n\nprocess.     He was then released without explanation or charges.\n\nWithin    weeks,   petitioner   was    summarily   fired   from    his   two\n\ngovernment-affiliated    jobs   (as    bank   researcher   and    university\n\nlecturer), for reasons that he suspected were connected to his ADF\n\nactivity.\n\n            For nearly three years thereafter, petitioner remained in\n\nUganda in the same geographical location as before. Various family\n\nmembers lived with or near him, including his parents, his two\n\nyoung children, and his girlfriend (who was also the mother of his\n\nchildren).    Unable to find work, allegedly because his arrest had\n\nsaddled him with an “anti-government” reputation, he was forced to\n\nrely on savings and friends.            Petitioner suffered no further\n\nphysical abuse during this period but continued to be questioned\n\noccasionally, even though he had ceased all political activity\n\nafter his detention. He asserted that such questioning amounted to\n\n“psychological torture” but did not elaborate.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          In March 1997 petitioner moved to South Africa, where he\n\nobtained a teaching position.      He decided to leave Uganda, he\n\ntestified, because the questioning of him had “intensified” and\n\npeople had started “disappearing.” At some point in 1998, he began\n\nreceiving anonymous telephone calls from individuals with Ugandan\n\naccents who accused him of continuing to support the ADF.      As a\n\nresult, petitioner relocated to Namibia in February 1999, where he\n\nsecured another teaching job.    Despite his efforts to conceal his\n\nwhereabouts, the anonymous calls resumed in June or July of that\n\nyear, numbering about three per month. And they grew more ominous,\n\nwarning petitioner that “wh[er]ever you go we’re following you and\n\nwe will get you.”   Petitioner again packed up and, with a visitor’s\n\nvisa, arrived in the United States in November 1999.\n\n          Petitioner’s family members, meanwhile, have remained in\n\nUganda.   Several months after petitioner’s departure, his father\n\nwas questioned about his whereabouts; the same thing happened in\n\nDecember 1999 after petitioner had left Namibia.    Otherwise, none\n\nof petitioner’s family members have been harassed on account of his\n\nADF involvement. Petitioner also testified that his father in 1996\n\nwas himself accused of being an ADF sympathizer, but that nothing\n\ncame of the incident.\n\n          While we do not minimize the mistreatment involved here,\n\ncf. Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005) (“any\n\nbeating at the hands of the police is one beating too many”), we\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fcannot say that this evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that\n\nreached below.             As did the IJ, we think it significant that\n\npetitioner     ceased       all     political     activity    following     his    1994\n\ndetention; that he was able to travel in and out of the country in\n\n1997 without difficulty; that during the 32 months between his\n\ndetention and his departure, he remained in the same geographical\n\nlocation without suffering further harm; and that his family\n\nmembers, including his ADF-sympathizing father, have continued to\n\nreside   in    that    area    without     serious       incident.     Moreover,     in\n\nresponse to comparable accounts of physical abuse, this court and\n\nothers have upheld denials of relief, even in the more lenient\n\nasylum context. See, e.g., id. (collecting cases and describing as\n\nimportant factor “whether the mistreatment can be said to be\n\nsystematic      rather       than    reflective     of    a   series   of   isolated\n\nincidents”).          We    also    note   that    the    circumstances     here    are\n\nsufficiently distinguishable from those in our recent Un decision\n\nto avoid the concerns raised there (which petitioner has not voiced\n\nin any event).        See 415 F.3d at 208-10.\n\n              The petition for review is denied.              The motion for stay\n\nof removal is denied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f",

Petitioner suffered no further\n\nphysical abuse during this period but continued to be questioned\n\noccasionally, even though he had ceased all political activity\n\nafter his detention. He asserted that such questioning amounted to\n\n“psychological torture” but did not elaborate.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          In March 1997 petitioner moved to South Africa, where he\n\nobtained a teaching position.      He decided to leave Uganda, he\n\ntestified, because the questioning of him had “intensified” and\n\npeople had started “disappearing.” At some point in 1998, he began\n\nreceiving anonymous telephone calls from individuals with Ugandan\n\naccents who accused him of continuing to support the ADF.      As a\n\nresult, petitioner relocated to Namibia in February 1999, where he\n\nsecured another teaching job.    Despite his efforts to conceal his\n\nwhereabouts, the anonymous calls resumed in June or July of that\n\nyear, numbering about three per month. And they grew more ominous,\n\nwarning petitioner that “wh[er]ever you go we’re following you and\n\nwe will get you.”   Petitioner again packed up and, with a visitor’s\n\nvisa, arrived in the United States in November 1999.\n\n          Petitioner’s family members, meanwhile, have remained in\n\nUganda.   Several months after petitioner’s departure, his father\n\nwas questioned about his whereabouts; the same thing happened in\n\nDecember 1999 after petitioner had left Namibia.    Otherwise, none\n\nof petitioner’s family members have been harassed on account of his\n\nADF involvement. Petitioner also testified that his father in 1996\n\nwas himself accused of being an ADF sympathizer, but that nothing\n\ncame of the incident.\n\n          While we do not minimize the mistreatment involved here,\n\ncf. Bocova v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (1st Cir. 2005) (“any\n\nbeating at the hands of the police is one beating too many”), we\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fcannot say that this evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that\n\nreached below.             As did the IJ, we think it significant that\n\npetitioner     ceased       all     political     activity    following     his    1994\n\ndetention; that he was able to travel in and out of the country in\n\n1997 without difficulty; that during the 32 months between his\n\ndetention and his departure, he remained in the same geographical\n\nlocation without suffering further harm; and that his family\n\nmembers, including his ADF-sympathizing father, have continued to\n\nreside   in    that    area    without     serious       incident.     Moreover,     in\n\nresponse to comparable accounts of physical abuse, this court and\n\nothers have upheld denials of relief, even in the more lenient\n\nasylum context. See, e.g., id. (collecting cases and describing as\n\nimportant factor “whether the mistreatment can be said to be\n\nsystematic      rather       than    reflective     of    a   series   of   isolated\n\nincidents”).          We    also    note   that    the    circumstances     here    are\n\nsufficiently distinguishable from those in our recent Un decision\n\nto avoid the concerns raised there (which petitioner has not voiced\n\nin any event).        See 415 F.3d at 208-10.\n\n              The petition for review is denied.              The motion for stay\n\nof removal is denied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f</pre>",
