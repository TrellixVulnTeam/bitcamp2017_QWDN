Sandoval on brief for appellant.\n     H. S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Sonia I. Torres-Pabón,\nChief, Criminal Division, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa and Thomas F.\nKlumper, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         January 8, 2004\n\n\n\n\n*Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge.           Defendant-appellant Miguel H.\n\nColón-Solís (Colón) appeals from a sentence imposed after a guilty\n\nplea to a single count of conspiring to distribute a controlled\n\nsubstance (cocaine).          See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.               The\n\nappellant's principal argument is that the district court erred in\n\nimposing a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, id. § 841(b)(1)(A),\n\nwithout making a specific finding that he — rather than the charged\n\nconspiracy — was accountable for a particular quantity of drugs.\n\n              This argument presents a question of first impression in\n\nthis circuit.     We phrase the question as follows:             When a defendant\n\nadmits that the conspiracy to which he belonged handled drug\n\nquantities sufficient to trigger a statutory mandatory minimum\n\nsentence, does he automatically become subject to that mandatory\n\nminimum without a further finding that the triggering amounts were\n\nattributable to, or foreseeable by, him?             We join several of our\n\nsister   circuits      in   answering    this   question    in    the   negative.\n\nAccordingly, we vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for\n\nresentencing.\n\n              Because the appellant's sentence followed an admission of\n\nguilt,   we    glean   the   pertinent    facts    from    the    change-of-plea\n\ncolloquy, the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), and\n\nthe transcript of the disposition hearing.                See United States v.\n\nDietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).           The government charged the\n\nappellant, along with a number of others, with conspiring to\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fdistribute narcotics as a member of the so-called La Cabra drug\n\nring. See United States v. Pérez-Ruiz, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir.\n\n2003) [No. 02-1466, slip op. at 3] (describing the La Cabra drug\n\nring).   On the eve of trial, he entered a straight guilty plea.            In\n\ndoing so, the appellant admitted that the conspiracy had handled\n\nmore than five kilograms of cocaine (the triggering amount for a\n\nten-year    mandatory    minimum    sentence      under     21     U.S.C.    §\n\n841(b)(1)(A)).     The   change-of-plea       proceeding    left   open     the\n\nquestion whether the appellant himself was responsible for a lesser\n\ndrug quantity.\n\n           The   appellant   was   one   of   several     codefendants      who\n\nsimultaneously changed their pleas.            Perhaps because of this\n\ncircumstance, the proffer made by the government at the appellant's\n\nchange-of-plea hearing was conspicuous for its scantiness.                  The\n\nprosecutor stated only that the appellant had served as a runner\n\n\"on occasions\" for Miguel O'Conner-Colón (La Cabra) and, as such,\n\nhad (i) assisted in the packaging and processing of narcotics, and\n\n(ii) delivered narcotics to drug points.          The prosecutor did not\n\nallude in any way to specific drug weights.\n\n           The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nApril 12, 2001.    The appellant argued that he should not be held\n\nresponsible for five kilograms or more of cocaine (and that,\n\ntherefore, the mandatory minimum was irrelevant).                  The court\n\nbrushed aside this argument, noted that the indictment charged\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fdistribution of five kilograms or more of cocaine, and found that\n\nthe appellant had admitted to this \"basic drug amount\" at the\n\nchange-of-plea hearing.               On that foundation — and that foundation\n\nalone      —    the   court    found    the    appellant       responsible        for   five\n\nkilograms or more of cocaine.                 Relying on this finding, the court\n\ninvoked         21    U.S.C.   §      841(b)(1)(A)       and    imposed      a     ten-year\n\nincarcerative sentence.               This appeal followed.\n\n                We review de novo properly preserved challenges to a\n\nsentencing court's conclusions of law.                   United States v. St. Cyr,\n\n977    F.2d      698,   701    (1st    Cir.    1992).         The   appellant      properly\n\npreserved his claim that the district court erred in failing to\n\nmake       an   individualized         finding      as   to     the   drug       quantities\n\nattributable to, or foreseeable by, him.                   See Pérez-Ruiz, ___ F.3d\n\nat ___ [slip op. at 22-23].                    Finding the record barren — it\n\ncontains no evidence of any particular drug quantities attributable\n\nto, or foreseeable by, the appellant; no specific finding as to any\n\ndrug quantity attributable to, or foreseeable by, him;1 and no\n\nrelevant stipulations — we validate the appellant's claim of error.\n\nWe explain briefly.\n\n\n\n       1\n      At the request of defense counsel, the district court reduced\nthe appellant's base offense level to take account of the fact that\nheroin — a substance handled by the La Cabra drug ring — was not\ndistributed in the La Ferran ward (where the appellant had worked).\nThis reduction suggests that the court understood the concept of\nindividual accountability, but it does not compensate for the lack\nof specific findings vis-à-vis the quantities of cocaine\nattributable to, or foreseeable by, the appellant.\n\n                                              -4-\n\f              The sentencing court appears to have applied a per se\n\nrule, automatically attributing to the appellant the full amount of\n\nthe   drugs    charged   in   the    indictment   and   attributed   to   the\n\nconspiracy as a whole.        This was error.\n\n              To be sure, we derive the applicable statutory maximum in\n\na drug conspiracy case from a conspiracy-wide perspective.            Id. at\n\n___ [slip op. at 31]; Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 43 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1048 (2002).                Nevertheless, we\n\nconsistently have required a defendant-specific determination of\n\ndrug quantity as a benchmark for individualized sentencing under\n\nthe guidelines. See, e.g., United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601,\n\n604 (1st Cir. 1990); USSG §1B1.3.            Thus, when a district court\n\ndetermines drug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant\n\nconvicted of participating in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, the\n\ncourt is required to make an individualized finding as to drug\n\namounts attributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.2               In\n\nthe absence of such an individualized finding, the drug quantity\n\nattributable to the conspiracy as a whole cannot automatically be\n\nshifted to the defendant.           See United States v. Valencia-Lucena,\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      This does not mean, of course, that the defendant must have\npersonally handled the drugs for which he is held responsible. A\ndefendant also may be held responsible for drugs involved in his\n\"relevant conduct.\"    USSG §1B1.3.    In a proper case, \"[s]uch\nconduct may include a defendant's own acts or the acts of others.\"\nUnited States v. Laboy, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 02-\n1865, slip op. at 8].\n\n                                       -5-\n\f988 F.2d 228, 234-35 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Thompson,\n\n944 F.2d 1331, 1343-44 (7th Cir. 1991).\n\n          A mandatory minimum operates in much the same way. It is\n\nmade potentially available by a finding that the conspiracy as a\n\nwhole handled (or at least contemplated) the necessary triggering\n\namount.   But to apply the mandatory minimum to a particular\n\ncoconspirator, the sentencing court must make a specific finding,\n\nsupportable by a preponderance of the evidence, ascribing the\n\ntriggering amount to that coconspirator.     See United States v.\n\nSwiney, 203 F.3d 397, 401-06 (6th Cir. 2000); United States v.\n\nBecerra, 992 F.2d 960, 967 n.2 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v.\n\nGilliam, 987 F.2d 1009, 1013-14 (4th Cir. 1993).\n\n          That principle is dispositive in this case.    Where, as\n\nhere, a defendant admits that the conspiracy to which he belonged\n\nhandled drug quantities sufficient to trigger a mandatory minimum\n\nsentence, he becomes potentially eligible for the mandatory minimum\n\n— but that provision cannot be applied in his case without an\n\nindividualized finding that the triggering amount was attributable\n\nto, or foreseeable by, him.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f          We    need   go   no    further.3     Given   the   lack   of   any\n\nindividualized findings of drug quantity, we must vacate the\n\nappellant's    sentence     and   remand   to   the   district   court    for\n\nresentencing.   We take no view as to what sentence is appropriate;\n\nwe merely hold that any sentence imposed must be accompanied by\n\nparticularized findings as to the drug amounts attributable to, or\n\nforeseeable by, the appellant.\n\n\n\n          The conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and\n\nthe case is remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Given our disposition of the appellant's principal claim of\nerror, we need not reach his challenge to the district court's\napplication of the doctrine laid down in Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000). We note, however, that substantially the\nsame challenge appears to have been considered and rejected in\nearlier decisions. See, e.g., United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 281\nF.3d 320, 325 (1st Cir.) (collecting cases), cert. denied, 537 U.S.\n869 (2002).\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",

Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s (Col&#243;n) appeals from a sentence imposed after a guilty plea to a single count of conspiring to distribute a controlled substance (cocaine). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846. The appellant's principal argument is that the district court erred in imposing a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, <i>id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), without making a specific finding that he &#8212; rather than the charged conspiracy &#8212; was accountable for a particular quantity of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument presents a question of first impression in this circuit. We phrase the question as follows: When a defendant admits that the conspiracy to which he belonged handled drug quantities sufficient to trigger a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, does he automatically become subject to that mandatory minimum without a further finding that the triggering amounts were attributable to, or foreseeable by, him? We join several of our sister circuits in answering this question in the negative. Accordingly, we vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellant's sentence followed an admission of guilt, we glean the pertinent facts from the change-of-plea colloquy, the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the disposition hearing. <i>See United States v. Dietz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1991). The government charged the appellant, along with a number of others, with conspiring to distribute narcotics as a member of the so-called La Cabra drug ring. <i>See United States v. P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200773\"><a href=\"/opinion/200773/united-states-v-perez-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003) (describing the La Cabra drug ring). On the eve of trial, he entered a straight guilty plea. In doing so, the appellant admitted that the conspiracy had handled more than five kilograms of cocaine (the triggering amount for a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)). The change-of-plea proceeding left open the question whether the appellant himself was responsible for a lesser drug quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was one of several codefendants who simultaneously changed their pleas. Perhaps because of this circumstance, the proffer made by the government at the appellant's change-of-plea hearing was conspicuous for its scantiness. The prosecutor stated only that the appellant had served as a runner \"on occasions\" for Miguel O'Conner-Col&#243;n (La Cabra) and, as such, had (i) assisted in the packaging and processing of narcotics, and (ii) delivered narcotics to drug points. The prosecutor did not allude in any way to specific drug weights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened the disposition hearing on April 12, 2001. The appellant argued that he should not be held responsible for five kilograms or more of cocaine (and that, therefore, the mandatory minimum was irrelevant). The court brushed aside this argument, noted that the indictment charged distribution of five kilograms or more of cocaine, and found that the appellant had admitted to this \"basic drug amount\" at the change-of-plea hearing. On that foundation &#8212; and that foundation alone &#8212; the court found the appellant responsible for five kilograms or more of cocaine. Relying on this finding, the court invoked 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) and imposed a ten-year incarcerative sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo properly preserved challenges to a sentencing court's conclusions of law. <i>United States v. St. Cyr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1992). The appellant properly preserved his claim that the district court erred in failing to make an individualized finding as to the drug quantities attributable to, or foreseeable by, him. <i>See P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 16. Finding the record barren &#8212; it contains no evidence of any particular drug quantities attributable to, or foreseeable by, the appellant; no specific finding as to any drug quantity attributable to, or foreseeable by, him;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and no relevant stipulations &#8212; we validate the appellant's claim of error. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court appears to have applied a per se rule, automatically attributing to the appellant the full amount of the drugs charged in the indictment and attributed to the conspiracy as a whole. This was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we derive the applicable statutory maximum in a drug conspiracy case from a conspiracy-wide perspective. <i>Id.</i> at 16; <i>Derman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200045\"><a href=\"/opinion/200045/derman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></span> (2002). Nevertheless, we consistently have required a defendant-specific determination of drug quantity as a benchmark for individualized sentencing under the guidelines. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 604 (1st Cir.1990); USSG &#167; 1B1.3. Thus, when a district court determines drug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant convicted of participating in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the absence of such an individualized finding, the drug quantity attributable to the conspiracy as a whole cannot automatically be shifted to the defendant. <i>See United States v. Valencia-Lucena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602341\"><a href=\"/opinion/602341/united-states-v-carlos-valencia-lucena-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 234-35 (1st Cir. 1993); <i>United States v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568519\"><a href=\"/opinion/568519/united-states-v-randolph-thompson-terrius-wynn-alcus-todd-thompson-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1343-44 (7th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A mandatory minimum operates in much the same way. It is made <i>potentially</i> available by a finding that the conspiracy as a whole handled (or at least contemplated) the necessary triggering amount. But to apply the mandatory minimum to a particular coconspirator, the sentencing court must make a specific finding, supportable by a preponderance of the evidence, ascribing the triggering amount to that coconspirator. <i>See United States v. Swiney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767605\"><a href=\"/opinion/767605/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant98-50195343/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span>, 401-06 (6th Cir. 2000); <i>United States v. Becerra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606083\"><a href=\"/opinion/606083/united-states-v-jose-becerra-salvatore-larizza-gabriel-becerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>, 967 n. 2 (9th Cir.1993); <i>United States v. Gilliam,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601799\"><a href=\"/opinion/601799/united-states-v-edward-b-gilliam-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span>, 1013-14 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That principle is dispositive in this case. Where, as here, a defendant admits that the conspiracy to which he belonged handled drug quantities sufficient to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence, he becomes potentially eligible for the mandatory minimum &#8212; but that provision cannot be applied in his case without an individualized finding that the triggering amount was attributable to, or foreseeable by, him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Given the lack of any individualized findings of drug quantity, we must vacate the appellant's sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing. We take no view as to what sentence is appropriate; we merely hold that any sentence imposed must be accompanied by particularized findings as to the drug amounts attributable to, or foreseeable by, the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the request of defense counsel, the district court reduced the appellant's base offense level to take account of the fact that heroin-a substance handled by the La Cabra drug ring-was not distributed in the La Ferran ward (where the appellant had worked). This reduction suggests that the court understood the concept of individual accountability, but it does not compensate for the lack of specific findings vis-&#224;-vis the quantities of cocaine attributable to, or foreseeable by, the appellant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This does not mean, of course, that the defendant must have personally handled the drugs for which he is held responsible.
