Jamie Edelkind was convicted of\n\nfour counts of bank fraud directed against federally insured banks,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1344 (2000),1 and he now appeals.                      The story can be\n\nbriefly told, reserving details for our discussion of specific\n\nissues       raised   on    appeal.     So    far     as   those    issues    concern\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, we set forth the facts assuming that\n\nthe jury resolved credibility disputes and drew inferences in the\n\ngovernment's favor.          United States v. Romero-Carrion, 54 F.3d 15,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                   Facing bankruptcy in the summer of 2000, Edelkind\n\nconcocted a false resume for his stay-at-home wife Linda, forging\n\ndocuments to make her appear to be a well-paid executive in a\n\n(sham) technology company he called \"Apostille, Inc.\"                     Using the\n\nforged documents, Edelkind convinced a lender, America's Moneyline\n\n(\"Moneyline\"), to extend a mortgage of $800,000 in Linda's name in\n\norder       to   purchase   the   former     \"Honey    Fitz\"   mansion       in   Hull,\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      Section 1344 makes it unlawful, inter alia, to \"knowingly\nexecute[], or attempt[] to execute, a scheme or artifice . . . to\ndefraud a financial institution . . . .\" For reasons explained in\nUnited States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 n.11 (1st Cir. 1994),\nthe term \"financial institution\" is read restrictively in light of\nanother definition, 18 U.S.C. § 20 (2000), confining the statute's\nreach to certain types of financial institutions including banks\nthat are \"federally insured.\"     Brandon, 17 F.3d at 424.     The\nstatute also makes it unlawful to deprive a financial institution\nof property by reason of fraud but the parties have focused upon\nthe defrauding provision.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f           Edelkind then repeatedly refinanced the Hull property for\n\nlarger and larger amounts, each time paying down outstanding\n\nprevious loans and retaining the surplus or \"cash out\" amount.   He\n\npersuaded lenders to extend the loans on the basis of false\n\nrepresentations and fabricated documents, including tax forms,\n\nshowing Linda to be earning from $200,000 to over $1 million per\n\nyear.   Specifically:\n\n                  •In September 2001, Edelkind refinanced\n           the Hull property by securing a $1 million\n           mortgage in Linda's name from South Shore\n           Savings Bank (\"South Shore\"), a federally\n           insured lender. He retained $143,781.53 after\n           paying down the Moneyline loan.\n\n                  •In spring 2002, Edelkind used the\n           property as collateral to obtain several home\n           equity loans in Linda's name, including a\n           $350,000 line of credit from Wells Fargo, a\n           federally insured bank.\n\n                   •In March 2003, Edelkind refinanced the\n           Hull property again, this time with a $2.1\n           million    mortgage   in  Linda's   name   from\n           Washington Mutual Bank (\"Washington Mutual\"),\n           another federally insured bank. He retained\n           $205,370.29 after paying off South Shore,\n           Wells Fargo, and other lenders.\n\n                  •In August 2004, representing that\n           Linda's income was $1.1 million a year,\n           Edelkind obtained a $3.3 million loan through\n           Fairmont Funding (\"Fairmont\"), a non-federally\n           insured mortgage broker, which funded the loan\n           with the approval of Aurora Loan Services\n           (\"Aurora\"), itself a subsidiary of Lehman\n           Brothers, a federally insured bank.     Lehman\n           Brothers later purchased the loan. Edelkind\n           used the proceeds to pay off the Washington\n           Mutual loan and an additional $356,242.38 that\n           had been run up on the Wells Fargo credit\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           line, leaving him with $569,878.83 in cash\n           surplus.\n\n           Remarkably, the last of these loans was secured after the\n\ngovernment in March 2004 had filed a three-count information\n\ncharging Edelkind with bank fraud in connection with the loans from\n\nSouth Shore, Wells Fargo, and Washington Mutual. In early November\n\n2004,   Linda   and   her    children    fled   to   Norway.    Approximately\n\n$273,000 was wired to Norway and $47,000 withdrawn from ATMs in\n\nMassachusetts and Norway between August and December 2004.\n\n           In February 2005, the government filed a superseding\n\ninformation     adding   a   fourth     count   directed   to   the   Fairmont\n\ntransaction and including criminal forfeiture allegations under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C) (2000) and 28 U.S.C.A. § 2461(c) (West Supp.\n\n2005) (subsequently amended 2006).            After a jury trial later that\n\nmonth, the district court entered a judgment of conviction on each\n\nof the four counts.      In June, the court forfeited the Hull property\n\nand two bank checks deemed to be funds derived from the offenses.\n\nIn July, Edelkind was sentenced to 60 months in prison and ordered\n\nto pay restitution.\n\n           Edelkind's first claim on appeal is that no proper\n\nverdict of conviction was ever returned by the jury.              Instead of\n\nhaving the jury return a written verdict of \"guilty\" or \"not\n\nguilty\" on each count, the district judge submitted to the jury a\n\nfour-part form whose first question asked the jury to say (\"yes\" or\n\n\"no\") whether they \"unanimously find that the government has proven\n\n                                        -4-\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt that Jamie Edelkind knowingly executed or\n\nattempted to execute a scheme to defraud\" South Shore.      The form\n\nthen asked the same question as to Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual,\n\nand Fairmont, respectively.\n\n            The jury returned a written verdict of \"yes\" on all four\n\ncounts.     The judge then asked the foreperson, \"As I read your\n\nverdict, your answer, whether you find the defendant guilty as to\n\nCount 1, is 'yes'; on Count 2 is 'yes'; on Count 3 is 'yes'; and\n\nCount 4 is 'yes.'   Am I correct?\"   The foreperson responded, \"Yes.\"\n\nDefense counsel declined the judge's offer to poll the jury and\n\nalso did not inquire whether the jury intended its verdict to be\n\none of \"guilty\" on each count.\n\n            Although we have not adopted a flat rule against special\n\ninterrogatories in criminal cases, they pose special dangers. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Spock, 416 F.2d 165, 182 (1st Cir. 1969)\n\n(progression of special questions can exert judicial pressure on\n\njury). They also sometimes offer benefits, notably in very complex\n\ncriminal cases, where they can reduce risk of juror confusion.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Palmeri, 630 F.2d 192, 202 (3d Cir.\n\n1980).    The present appeal better illustrates the dangers than the\n\nbenefits.\n\n            Edelkind's broadest claim is that no guilty verdict was\n\ndelivered by the jury on any of the counts.      The form did not in\n\nterms ask whether Edelkind was guilty, and his appellate counsel\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsuggests that the foreperson's response when questioned by the\n\ntrial judge was ambiguous.     Counsel posits that the foreperson\n\nmight have meant only that the \"yes\" lines had been checked--not\n\nthat the jury had intended to find Edelkind \"guilty\" of the\n\noffenses specified in the indictment.\n\n          Nothing in the rules requires a written verdict at all.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 31.   Here, there was a written verdict which,\n\nif ambiguous, was clarified when the judge asked whether the\n\ndefendant has been found \"guilty\" on each count.   The lack of any\n\nobjection when the foreperson answered and the judge proceeded to\n\nenter a judgment of conviction shows that trial counsel had no\n\ndoubt that the jury had equated its verdict with guilt.   There was\n\nno error, plain or otherwise, in treating the verdict as one of\n\nguilty on each count.\n\n          A narrower version of the argument, also made on appeal,\n\nhas more bite.    Edelkind points out that the phrasing of the\n\nverdict form itself omitted, for each count, an element of the\n\nstatutory offense--specifically, that the defrauded institution be\n\none that was federally insured.    This is itself an example of the\n\nproblems with using detailed verdict forms rather than simply\n\nasking whether the defendant was guilty of the offense charged.\n\n          Nevertheless, we conclude that there was no prejudicial\n\nerror in the omission of the federally insured requirement from the\n\nverdict form. Special verdicts are not required in criminal cases,\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fand, when they are used, there is no automatic requirement that a\n\nspecial verdict form include every element of the offense so long\n\nas the jury is instructed as to all elements.           See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Stonefish, 402 F.3d 691, 699 (6th Cir. 2005).           Here the\n\njury was specifically instructed that they “must be convinced\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt” of each of the four elements of the\n\noffense,   including   (as   one   of   the   four   elements)   that   “the\n\nfinancial institution in question was federally insured.”\n\n           The defendant's next argument is that the verdict form\n\nand the jury instructions charged him with defrauding Fairmont and\n\nnot with defrauding Lehman Brothers, and that he could not properly\n\nbe convicted of defrauding Fairmont, which was not a federally\n\ninsured institution. The district court’s initial jury instruction\n\n(which was given orally but later provided to the jury in written\n\nform) described count 4 as charging Edelkind with executing “a\n\nscheme to defraud . . . upon Fairmont Funding, LTD, which [is a]\n\nfinancial institution.”      The special verdict form submitted to the\n\njury asked, as to count 4, whether the government had proved\n\n           a scheme to defraud Fairmont Funding, LTD in\n           connection with a loan . . . originated by\n           Fairmont   Funding,  LTD,   and  subsequently\n           assigned to Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB.\n\n           Just before the court read the jury instructions and\n\nprovided the jury with the special verdict form, Edelkind filed a\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal arguing that “Count Four is\n\nentirely dependant on Fairmont Funding [and] the Government has\n\n                                   -7-\n\ffailed to prove federal jurisdiction” because Fairmont is not a\n\nfinancial institution under 18 U.S.C. § 20.       The basis for defense\n\ncounsel's motion was that Edelkind had to know that a \"financial\n\ninstitution\" would be the ultimate victim of his fraud.                  The\n\ndistrict judge rightly found this position to be at odds with\n\nBrandon, 17 F.3d at 425, and rejected the motion for acquittal.\n\n           After the instructions were read to the jury, defense\n\ncounsel orally objected to them and to the verdict form on the\n\nground   that   Fairmont   was   not   a   financial     institution,    and\n\nreiterated   his   position   that   Edelkind   needed    to   know   that   a\n\n\"financial institution\" would be injured.       The court then provided\n\na curative instruction stating that “Lehman Brothers but not\n\nFairmont was a financial institution.\" Since the court had already\n\ntold the jury that a financial institution had to be defrauded or\n\ndeprived of money by fraud,2 the jury was informed that it could\n\nnot convict on the theory that the defendant had defrauded Fairmont\n\nalone.\n\n           It is quite true that the curative instruction came late\n\nin the day and apparently Edelkind's counsel did not ask for a\n\n\n     2\n      The instructions required that the jury find that Edelkind\nexecuted “a scheme or artifice (1) to defraud a financial\ninstitution or (2) to obtain any of the money . . . under the\ncustody or control of a financial institution by means of false or\nfraudulent pretenses.” The court specified that “scheme to defraud\na financial institution” meant “any deliberate course of conduct by\nwhich someone intends to deceive or cheat that financial\ninstitution and to obtain – and intends to obtain something of\nvalue, such as money.”\n\n                                     -8-\n\ftranscript page reflecting it to accompany the original written\n\ninstructions sent into the jury room; but the curative instruction\n\nwas virtually the last instruction that the jury heard before\n\nretiring. Nor was defense counsel entitled to have the jury ignore\n\nthe fraud upon Fairmont; on the government's theory of the case,\n\nfalse representations to it were the instrument by which money was\n\nsecured from Lehman Brothers.\n\n             The question then becomes whether the jury was adequately\n\nadvised that it needed to find fraud on Lehman Brothers.           In this\n\nrespect both the verdict form and the instructions were deficient.\n\nThe verdict form made only passing mention of Lehman Brothers as\n\nhaving acquired the loan. While the \"cured\" instructions generally\n\nrequired a finding that a financial institution had been defrauded\n\nand   that    Lehman   Brothers   was   a   financial    institution,   the\n\ninstructions failed to specifically identify Lehman Brothers as\n\nallegedly defrauded.\n\n             Edelkind did not request revision of the verdict form or\n\nan instruction that, in order to convict on count 4, the jury had\n\nto find that Lehman Brothers was defrauded.             Indeed, Edelkind's\n\ncounsel objected (unsuccessfully) to any mention of Lehman Brothers\n\nin the supplemental instruction. Counsel had good reason to direct\n\nattention away from Lehman Brothers; but Edelkind was surely on\n\nnotice that the government's own theory of the case was that Lehman\n\nBrothers had been the victim of the fraud (albeit indirectly)\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fbecause the fraud on Fairmont had operated to deprive Lehman\n\nBrothers of its money.3\n\n            Under these circumstances, we conclude that Edelkind's\n\nfailure to object to the instruction and verdict form as omitting\n\nLehman Brothers makes those errors reviewable only for plain error.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); United States v. Newton, 891 F.2d 944, 949\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).    Edelkind says that trial counsel had a duty to\n\nobject only to mistakes inimical to his client's interest, not to\n\nones that would undermine any verdict against his client.            The\n\npotential of such errors to undermine the verdict is why an\n\nobjection is required at the time--not an excuse for failing to\n\nmake a timely objection.\n\n            Edelkind also says that the errors were \"structural,\"\n\nrequiring   reversal   without   regard   to   prejudice.    \"Structural\n\nerrors\" comprise a small category of mistakes so identified by the\n\nSupreme Court, but generally exclude erroneous jury instructions\n\n(despite the fact that they \"preclud[e] the jury from making a\n\nfinding on the actual element of the offense\").             See Neder v.\n\nUnited States, 527 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1999) (collecting examples).        The\n\nerror in Neder itself–-the omission of an element of the offense\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      For example, at the charge conference, defense counsel\nstated: \"And it's the government's view that when a defendant deals\nwith somebody like Fairmont Funding . . . and then they happen to\nsell their . . . paper to a federally insured bank like Lehman\nBrothers, that you just assume the risk so-to-speak.\"\n\n                                  -10-\n\ffrom the instructions-–was not deemed structural; mere lack of\n\nclarity is clearly a lesser error and not \"structural.\"\n\n           To establish \"plain\" error, Edelkind must show (1) error,\n\n(2)   plainness,    (3)    prejudice,     and   (4)   an   outcome    that     is   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice or akin to it.           United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 732-37 (1993). The flaws in the initial instructions and\n\nverdict form were error and only partly corrected as to the former;\n\nwe will assume that any remaining error was plain.                   The problems\n\nfor Edelkind are to show prejudice and miscarriage of justice.\n\n           The banking institutions defrauded in the first three\n\ncounts were federally insured.              As to count 4, the evidence\n\n(discussed below) amply permitted a reasonable jury to find that\n\nLehman Brothers was defrauded. Therefore Edelkind cannot show that\n\nthe   mistakes     probably     altered   the   outcome     or     undermine    our\n\nconfidence in the verdict, United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542\n\nU.S. 74, 81-82 (2004); Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, let alone constitute\n\na miscarriage of justice.\n\n           Turning to the sufficiency of the evidence, Edelkind's\n\nattack on this ground is directed only to count 4.                 The government\n\nquestions whether his motion for a judgment of acquittal in the\n\ndistrict court preserved all of the claims he now makes under this\n\nhead.   Because we find that the evidence was sufficient in each of\n\nthe   aspects    raised,   we    bypass   the   waiver     issue    (which   poses\n\ndifficulties of its own).\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            Section   1344,    as   already    noted,     makes    criminal   the\n\nknowing execution of a scheme to defraud a federally insured bank.\n\nSee note 1, above.       Neither Fairmont nor Aurora was federally\n\ninsured.     Edelkind   says    that   there    is   no    proof   that   Lehman\n\nBrothers, although federally insured, was the intended or direct\n\nvictim of his scheme to defraud, and therefore the scheme cannot\n\nhave been one \"to defraud a financial institution\" as defined by\n\nCongress.\n\n            The statute says that the scheme to defraud a protected\n\nfinancial institution must be \"knowingly\" executed. In Brandon, 17\n\nF.3d at 425, this court held that the government does not have to\n\nshow that the defendant knew which particular bank might be injured\n\nor that it was federally insured.           Id. at 426.     The statute gives\n\nfair warning that bank fraud is unlawful: one who defrauds a bank\n\nsimply assumes the risk that the victim is federally insured.                 Id.\n\n            The greater difficulty, and the main focus of Edelkind's\n\nobjection, concerns whether Lehman Brothers was in fact defrauded.\n\nEdelkind secured the count 4 loan from Fairmont, which was not\n\nfederally insured.       But the government offered evidence that\n\nFairmont did no more than \"table fund\" the loan, that is, it agreed\n\nto make the loan only if another lender first agreed to purchase\n\nthe loan thereafter. The other lender, on the government's theory,\n\nwas Lehman Brothers.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f            Edelkind argues on appeal that Lehman Brothers was not\n\nthe   victim   of   his    scheme   to    defraud    because   his   fraudulent\n\nstatements about his wife's credentials and earnings never reached\n\nLehman   Brothers;    he    says    the   misrepresentations     only    reached\n\nAurora, Lehman Brothers' non-federally insured subsidiary.                   So,\n\nEdelkind says, he never defrauded Lehman Brothers as section 1344\n\nrequires.\n\n            Neither the statute nor the case law fully instructs just\n\nhow tight a factual nexus is required to allow a jury to decide\n\nthat a scheme, formally aimed at one (uninsured) company, operates\n\nin substance to defraud another (insured) entity with whom the\n\ndefendant has not dealt directly.            In our view the statute does\n\napply where the federally insured institution takes part in an\n\nintegrated transaction and is thereby injured by the defendant, who\n\nintended to defraud another party to the transaction.                   Scienter\n\nexists, the causal connection is sufficient, and under Brandon the\n\ndefendant cannot escape liability by virtue of his ignorance of the\n\noverall arrangement.\n\n            Here,    the   government      offered    evidence   that     Lehman\n\nBrothers' forms and guidelines were used by Fairmont and Aurora in\n\ntable funding the loan, that a Lehman Brothers official (not just\n\nits subsidiary Aurora) signed off on the loan before Fairmont made\n\nit, and that Fairmont transferred the loan to Lehman Brothers--not\n\nto Aurora--about a month after the closing between Edelkind and\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fFairmont.    Thus the loan--although formally made by Fairmont--was\n\nfrom the outset part of an integrated transaction, the first step\n\nof which was dependent on approval by Lehman Brothers, and the pre-\n\nplanned second step of which was a transfer of the mortgage to\n\nLehman Brothers itself.\n\n            Given these predicates--Edelkind's intent to defraud, the\n\nintegrated transaction, and the financial injury to which Lehman\n\nBrothers was exposed--the jury was entitled to find that Edelkind\n\ndefrauded   Lehman   Brothers,   a   federally   insured   bank.4   The\n\nsituation would be quite different, and liability might well be\n\ndoubtful, if the involvement of the federally insured entity was\n\nnot contemplated at the outset and came about later from a separate\n\ntransaction, for example, by the happenstance of an insured bank\n\npurchasing an earlier loan under-secured because of an earlier,\n\nindependent fraud.     We leave such line-drawing for a case that\n\nposes the issue.\n\n            We turn now to an ancillary order of forfeiture following\n\nthe jury verdict.     In this criminal proceeding, the government\n\nsought forfeiture, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C) and 28\n\nU.S.C.A. § 2461(c), of the Hull property used in the scheme and of\n\n$579,805.73 in proceeds traceable to the final loan. Edelkind\n\n\n\n     4\n      Edelkind says the government offered no proof that Lehman\nBrothers was federally insured on the day that it took over the\nFairmont loan, but Lehman Brothers was insured when it approved the\nFairmont loan, thus exposing itself to ultimate loss.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fargues that the two forfeiture statutes invoked by the government\n\ndo not allow this forfeiture to be implemented in a criminal\n\nproceeding, but rather only in a separate civil proceeding.5\n\n            The argument turns upon a difference in the scope of the\n\nmain federal statutes governing civil and criminal forfeitures, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 981, 982, on a bridging statute, 28 U.S.C.A. § 2461(c),\n\nand on a related factual premise. The civil forfeiture statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C), pertinently subjects to forfeiture any\n\nproperty \"which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable\n\nto\"   a   violation    of   section     1344;        by   contrast   the   criminal\n\nforfeiture    statute,      18    U.S.C.       §    982(a)(2)(B),    subjects     to\n\nforfeiture \"any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds\n\nthe person obtained directly or indirectly, as the result of\" such\n\na violation (emphasis added).\n\n            Edelkind    says     that   the        property   forfeited    here   was\n\nobtained by his wife and therefore is not property that he (\"the\n\nperson\") ever obtained.          Therefore, he concludes, the property was\n\nopen to a civil forfeiture action but not a criminal one.                         The\n\ngovernment answers by saying that the bridging statute, 28 U.S.C.A.\n\n§ 2461(c), allowed it to rely upon the civil forfeiture provision\n\n\n      5\n      There is good reason to think that Edelkind waived this\nargument at sentencing. When the judge stated that \"there is no\nlegal question that forfeiture will be required. I haven't heard\nthe defense counsel argue to the contrary,\" defense counsel then\nreplied: \"I think we are out of it at this point, Your Honor.\" No\nmention was made of the argument now made on appeal. Nonetheless,\nwe reach the merits to resolve the issue definitively.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fin the criminal case. The statute, as it stood between 2000 and\n\n2006, provided (emphasis added):\n\n           If a forfeiture of property is authorized in\n           connection with a violation of an Act of\n           Congress, and any person is charged in an\n           indictment or information with such violation\n           but no specific statutory provision is made\n           for criminal forfeiture upon conviction, the\n           Government may include the forfeiture in the\n           indictment or information in accordance with\n           the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and\n           upon conviction, the court shall order the\n           forfeiture of the property . . . .\n\n           Edelkind argues that section 2461(c) does not apply in\n\nthis case because a \"specific statutory provision is made for\n\ncriminal forfeiture upon conviction,\" namely, section 982, which\n\nexpressly applies to violations of the bank fraud statute.                The\n\ngovernment responds that section 982 was not available in this case\n\non Edelkind's own premise that the forfeited property was not his\n\nown, and therefore it could use the bridging statute to enforce\n\nsection 981 in the criminal case.\n\n           Edelkind's best argument is that Congress could not have\n\nintended   section   2461(c)   to   apply   to   offenses   for   which    it\n\ndeliberately drafted criminal forfeiture provisions narrower in\n\nscope   than   the   corresponding     civil     forfeiture   provisions.\n\nOtherwise, section 2461(c) would override the extra limitations\n\nthat Congress imposed in the original criminal forfeiture statute\n\n(here, the requirement that the defendant personally obtain the\n\nproperty forfeited criminally).\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f          The government's response is that section 2461(c), as it\n\nstood when this case was tried, fills the gap between criminal and\n\ncivil forfeiture by making criminal forfeiture available in every\n\ncriminal case that the criminal forfeiture statute does not reach\n\nbut for which civil forfeiture is legally authorized.            On this\n\nview, Edelkind's own argument that the criminal statute did not\n\nreach the property (because it was not his) shows why the civil\n\nstatute is available (because the property was traceable to the\n\nfraud).\n\n          The case law is of little help. Edelkind cites to United\n\nStates v. Croce, 345 F. Supp. 2d 492, 496 (E.D. Pa. 2004), but it\n\nhas since been repudiated by the Third Circuit, see United States\n\nv. Vampire Nation, 451 F.3d 189, 199 (3d Cir. 2006).       United States\n\nv. Day, 416 F. Supp. 2d 79, 86 (D.D.C. 2006), followed Croce but\n\nUnited States v. Schlesinger, 396 F. Supp. 2d 267, 275 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n2005), came out the other way.\n\n          Neither language nor case law is conclusive, but it seems\n\nto us that Congress intended for section 2461 to apply in this\n\nsituation.   This intuition is supported by the legislative history\n\nof the bridging statute itself.         Far from wanting to limit the\n\nsubstantive reach of the criminal forfeiture statute, Congress made\n\nclear in enacting the bridging statute that it hoped to encourage\n\nthe use of criminal forfeiture procedures, with their greater\n\nprotections,   \"whenever   any   form    of   forfeiture   is   otherwise\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fauthorized by statute.\"         H.R. Rep. 105-358(I), 1997 WL 677201 at\n\n*35-36 (1997).6       Our intuition is further confirmed by Congress'\n\nlater     amendment   that    resolves     doubts   for     the   future   in   the\n\ngovernment's favor.      See USA PATRIOT Improvement and Authorization\n\nAct of 2005, Pub. L. 109-177, § 410 (2006).\n\n             Thus, if Edelkind is right that section 982(a)(2) would\n\nnot authorize forfeiture in this case, then \"no specific statutory\n\nprovision\" provided for criminal forfeiture upon his conviction,\n\nand   section    2461(c)      authorizes    the     court    to   apply    section\n\n981(a)(1)(C) to fill the gap.        If Edelkind's premise is wrong and\n\nsection 982(a)(2) would authorize criminal forfeiture in this case,\n\nthen section 2461(c) does not apply--but neither has Edelkind been\n\nprejudiced by the government's citation error.                See Rule 7(c)(3).\n\n             The last issue on this appeal concerns the calculation of\n\nEdelkind's sentence.         The sentencing guideline range is driven in\n\npart by the amount of loss resulting from the offense and in part\n\nby other factors.      U.S.S.G. §2B1.1(b).          Using the 2004 edition of\n\nthe guidelines, the district court determined that Edelkind's\n\nviolations had inflicted a net loss exceeding $1 million--bringing\n\nthe offense level to 23, §2B1.1(a)(1), (b)(1)(I); and that a\n\n\n      6\n      See also H.R. Rep. 106-1048, 2001 WL 67919 at *61 (2001)\n(Congress intended to make criminal forfeiture available \"wherever\nfederal law allows for civil forfeiture of property involved in a\nspecific crime...\"); H.R. Rep. 105-358(I) at *35 (stating that the\npurpose of the amendment was to \"give the government the option of\npursuing criminal forfeiture as an alternative to civil forfeiture\nif civil forfeiture is otherwise authorized.\").\n\n                                     -18-\n\ffurther two level enhancement (to 25) was required because--in the\n\nwords of the guideline--\"the defendant derived more than $1,000,000\n\nin gross receipts from one or more financial institutions as a\n\nresult of the offense.\"      Id. §2B1.1(b)(13)(A).\n\n            At sentencing, the judge proposed to use an offense level\n\nof 25, and defense counsel began to argue that the net loss was\n\nunder $1 million, which would have substantially reduced the\n\noffense level; but counsel conceded that if the gross receipts\n\nenhancement   applied,   the   language   of   section   2B1.1(b)(13)(D)\n\nprescribed a minimum offense level of 24 regardless of a smaller\n\nnet loss.   The judge, it appears, adopted this solution, departing\n\ndownward slightly in the final sentence.7\n\n            Edelkind does not dispute that he inflicted gross losses\n\nin excess of $1 million; but he says that the \"gross receipts\"\n\nenhancement should not have been applied because the gross receipts\n\nwere derived not by Edelkind, but by his wife--in whose name the\n\nHull property had been acquired and to whom the proceeds of the\n\nrefinancing   loans   were   directed.    He   adds   that   a   prenuptial\n\nagreement with his wife provided that property and assets obtained\n\nby her were to be and remain her personal property.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      An adjusted offense level of 24, given Edelkind's criminal\nhistory, corresponded to a range of 63 to 78 months. Because the\njudge thought that the criminal history points overstated\nEdelkind's past wrongdoing, the judge departed downward to the 60-\nmonth sentence ultimately imposed.\n\n                                  -19-\n\f               The district court rejected this argument, reading the\n\nguideline to refer not to a defendant's formal legal control of the\n\ngross receipts, but instead to his individual culpability.                 The\n\ndistrict judge stated: \"It seems to me that if you procure funds\n\nfor somebody else and the other person gets the advantage of it,\n\nthat your moral responsibility is the same whether you take the\n\nmoney or not, particularly if the person you get it for is your\n\nwife.\"       We review de novo the meaning of the guideline.         See United\n\nStates v. Alli, 444 F.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n               What case law exists largely supports a realistic rather\n\nthan     a     formal   approach     to    applying   the   \"gross   receipts\"\n\nenhancement.        Several cases support the enhancement where the\n\nwrongfully obtained funds went to a company controlled by the\n\ndefendant even though the funds were held in the corporation's\n\nname.        See United States v. Pendergraph, 388 F.3d 109, 113 (4th\n\nCir. 2004) (defendant had controlling interest in company and \"thus\n\ncontrolled the fraudulently acquired funds\"); United States v.\n\nStolee, 172 F.3d 630, 631 (8th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (defendant\n\nwas \"the sole owner and president\" of the company); United States\n\nv. Bennett, 161 F.3d 171, 192-93 (3d Cir. 1998) (defendant had 100%\n\ninterest in company).        Compare       United States v. Colton, 231 F.3d\n\n890,    911-12     (4th   Cir.     2000)    (distinguishing   non-controlling\n\ninterest).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\f             To sustain the result in this case, it is enough here to\n\nhold that the enhancement is not automatically defeated because\n\nformal ownership of the \"gross receipts\" is in another.                Rather,\n\ngiven its aim, the guideline may be applied where the defendant\n\neither     controls   (even   though      indirectly)   the   fraud   proceeds\n\nattributed to him or where he causes them to be lodged in another\n\nwith the expectation that he will enjoy the benefits.               Whether any\n\nlesser showing would suffice need not be decided.\n\n             This reading distinguishes property that goes solely to\n\na co-conspirator and, on the affirmative side, it charges the\n\ndefendant with proceeds that he controls or enjoys.             Such proceeds\n\ncan, as a matter of language, be regarded as individually derived\n\nby the defendant.     Given the guideline's concern with culpability,\n\nthis reading makes far more sense than making the guideline turn\n\nsolely upon formal ownership under state marital or real property\n\nlaw.\n\n             United States v. Castellano, 349 F.3d 483, 485-87 (7th\n\nCir. 2003), relied upon by Edelkind, is arguably sound on its own\n\nfacts and easily distinguishable.           There the defendant had founded\n\nthe company holding the proceeds but did not own any stock; and\n\nonly a modest portion ($200,000) of what the fraud netted the\n\ncompany could be traced through to the defendant's compensation.\n\nSo   far   as   Castellano    is   read   to   make   state   law   formalities\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fconclusive, it would conflict with the realistic approach taken by\n\nother circuits, which we follow here.\n\n             The pre-sentence report notes that \"[w]ith the borrowed\n\nmoney, Edelkind... financed a lavish lifestyle for himself and his\n\nfamily.\"     Although Edelkind objected to certain details in the\n\nreport's assertion, the thrust of the report is supported by other\n\nevidence and reasonable inference.      Thus, the record confirms that\n\nEdelkind enjoyed the fruits of the scheme to defraud, and having\n\nmasterminded the scheme and enjoyed benefits from it, Edelkind\n\nhimself \"derived\" the illegal loan proceeds within the terms of the\n\nguideline.\n\n           Edelkind next says that the $1 million gross receipts\n\nfigure can be met only if the Fairmont loan proceeds are included--\n\nit being the largest of refinancings–and that they should not be\n\nincluded because under section 2B1.1(b)(13)(A) of the guidelines,\n\nthe receipts exceeding $1 million must be derived \"from one or more\n\nfinancial institutions\" (emphasis added).        As noted, Fairmont was\n\nnot a financial institution within the meaning of section 1344.\n\n           However,   the   guideline   has    its   own   definition   of\n\n\"financial institution\" which includes \"any state or foreign bank,\n\ntrust company, credit union, insurance company, investment company,\n\nmutual fund, savings (building and loan) association, union or\n\nemployee pension fund;... and any similar entity, whether or not\n\ninsured by the federal government.\"           §2B1.1 Application Note 1\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f(emphasis added).          In other words, it is the character of the\n\ninstitution     and    not     federal       insurance     that    matters      to    the\n\nguideline.\n\n             Fairmont was described by its witness at trial as \"a\n\nmortgage bank, mortgage lender\" and referred to in its affidavit as\n\na \"licensed private mortgage lender.\" Edelkind offers us no reason\n\nto   think   that    Fairmont       falls    outside    the     circle    of   \"similar\n\nentities,\" and the case law confirms a broad interpretation.\n\nUnited States v. Ferrarini, 219 F.3d 145, 161 (2d Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"premium finance company\" is within the application note); see\n\nalso   Brandon,       17   F.3d     at   426      (using   the     term    \"financial\n\ninstitution\" colloquially to include uninsured mortgage brokers).\n\n             Finally, Edelkind points to an apparent computational\n\nerror in determining the amount of net loss from his frauds--the\n\nfigure that drove the initial determination of his offense level\n\n(before the gross receipts enhancement).                        The district court\n\ncalculated    the     gross    amount       of   the   frauds    and   then,     as   the\n\nguideline provides, subtracted the present value of the mortgaged\n\nHull property, which remained available to offset the losses.\n\nU.S.S.G. §2B1.1 Application Note 3(E).\n\n             In calculating the value of the Hull property, the\n\ndistrict     judge    picked    a    figure      between   the    widely       differing\n\nestimates offered by the government and by Edelkind.                       Well after\n\nsentencing, it emerged from a newly discovered memorandum that--in\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fmaking his own calculation--the district judge had apparently\n\nadopted a final net loss figure $500,000 higher than he had\n\nintended. At sentencing, counsel knew the final figure adopted but\n\nnot the judge's private miscalculation.\n\n            The time for correcting the sentence had passed, Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 35(a), and this appeal had already been lodged with this\n\ncourt.    The district judge said at a post-sentencing conference\n\nconcerning the calculation error that he would leave the matter to\n\nthis court, which could remand, if necessary.              The judge said that\n\nhe was not prepared to say whether use of the lower net loss figure\n\nhe had intended would have made any difference to the sentence.\n\n            It is clear that the error did not matter.            The district\n\ncourt    used   an   offense   level   of     24   in   determining   Edelkind's\n\nsentence before departing downward.                As already explained, the\n\ngross receipts enhancement prescribed a minimum offense level of 24\n\nregardless of the net loss.        §2B1.1(b)(13)(D).         Edelkind concedes\n\nin his brief that \"[i]f the §2B1.1(b)(13) enhancement applies\"--as\n\nwe have found that it does--\"the offense level would rise to 24 in\n\nboth cases.\"     Thus, the net loss figure, whether in error or not,\n\nhad no ultimate effect on the sentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f",

The\nstatute also makes it unlawful to deprive a financial institution\nof property by reason of fraud but the parties have focused upon\nthe defrauding provision.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f           Edelkind then repeatedly refinanced the Hull property for\n\nlarger and larger amounts, each time paying down outstanding\n\nprevious loans and retaining the surplus or \"cash out\" amount.   He\n\npersuaded lenders to extend the loans on the basis of false\n\nrepresentations and fabricated documents, including tax forms,\n\nshowing Linda to be earning from $200,000 to over $1 million per\n\nyear.   Specifically:\n\n                  •In September 2001, Edelkind refinanced\n           the Hull property by securing a $1 million\n           mortgage in Linda's name from South Shore\n           Savings Bank (\"South Shore\"), a federally\n           insured lender. He retained $143,781.53 after\n           paying down the Moneyline loan.\n\n                  •In spring 2002, Edelkind used the\n           property as collateral to obtain several home\n           equity loans in Linda's name, including a\n           $350,000 line of credit from Wells Fargo, a\n           federally insured bank.\n\n                   •In March 2003, Edelkind refinanced the\n           Hull property again, this time with a $2.1\n           million    mortgage   in  Linda's   name   from\n           Washington Mutual Bank (\"Washington Mutual\"),\n           another federally insured bank. He retained\n           $205,370.29 after paying off South Shore,\n           Wells Fargo, and other lenders.\n\n                  •In August 2004, representing that\n           Linda's income was $1.1 million a year,\n           Edelkind obtained a $3.3 million loan through\n           Fairmont Funding (\"Fairmont\"), a non-federally\n           insured mortgage broker, which funded the loan\n           with the approval of Aurora Loan Services\n           (\"Aurora\"), itself a subsidiary of Lehman\n           Brothers, a federally insured bank.     Lehman\n           Brothers later purchased the loan. Edelkind\n           used the proceeds to pay off the Washington\n           Mutual loan and an additional $356,242.38 that\n           had been run up on the Wells Fargo credit\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           line, leaving him with $569,878.83 in cash\n           surplus.\n\n           Remarkably, the last of these loans was secured after the\n\ngovernment in March 2004 had filed a three-count information\n\ncharging Edelkind with bank fraud in connection with the loans from\n\nSouth Shore, Wells Fargo, and Washington Mutual. In early November\n\n2004,   Linda   and   her    children    fled   to   Norway.    Approximately\n\n$273,000 was wired to Norway and $47,000 withdrawn from ATMs in\n\nMassachusetts and Norway between August and December 2004.\n\n           In February 2005, the government filed a superseding\n\ninformation     adding   a   fourth     count   directed   to   the   Fairmont\n\ntransaction and including criminal forfeiture allegations under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C) (2000) and 28 U.S.C.A. § 2461(c) (West Supp.\n\n2005) (subsequently amended 2006).            After a jury trial later that\n\nmonth, the district court entered a judgment of conviction on each\n\nof the four counts.      In June, the court forfeited the Hull property\n\nand two bank checks deemed to be funds derived from the offenses.\n\nIn July, Edelkind was sentenced to 60 months in prison and ordered\n\nto pay restitution.\n\n           Edelkind's first claim on appeal is that no proper\n\nverdict of conviction was ever returned by the jury.              Instead of\n\nhaving the jury return a written verdict of \"guilty\" or \"not\n\nguilty\" on each count, the district judge submitted to the jury a\n\nfour-part form whose first question asked the jury to say (\"yes\" or\n\n\"no\") whether they \"unanimously find that the government has proven\n\n                                        -4-\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt that Jamie Edelkind knowingly executed or\n\nattempted to execute a scheme to defraud\" South Shore.      The form\n\nthen asked the same question as to Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual,\n\nand Fairmont, respectively.\n\n            The jury returned a written verdict of \"yes\" on all four\n\ncounts.     The judge then asked the foreperson, \"As I read your\n\nverdict, your answer, whether you find the defendant guilty as to\n\nCount 1, is 'yes'; on Count 2 is 'yes'; on Count 3 is 'yes'; and\n\nCount 4 is 'yes.'   Am I correct?\"   The foreperson responded, \"Yes.\"\n\nDefense counsel declined the judge's offer to poll the jury and\n\nalso did not inquire whether the jury intended its verdict to be\n\none of \"guilty\" on each count.\n\n            Although we have not adopted a flat rule against special\n\ninterrogatories in criminal cases, they pose special dangers. See,\n\ne.g., United States v.

They also sometimes offer benefits, notably in very complex\n\ncriminal cases, where they can reduce risk of juror confusion.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Palmeri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382072\"><a href=\"/opinion/382072/united-states-v-palmeri-ernest-p-sr-in-no-79-2147-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (3d Cir.\n\n1980).    The present appeal better illustrates the dangers than the\n\nbenefits.\n\n            Edelkind's broadest claim is that no guilty verdict was\n\ndelivered by the jury on any of the counts.      The form did not in\n\nterms ask whether Edelkind was guilty, and his appellate counsel\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsuggests that the foreperson's response when questioned by the\n\ntrial judge was ambiguous.     Counsel posits that the foreperson\n\nmight have meant only that the \"yes\" lines had been checked--not\n\nthat the jury had intended to find Edelkind \"guilty\" of the\n\noffenses specified in the indictment.\n\n          Nothing in the rules requires a written verdict at all.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 31.   Here, there was a written verdict which,\n\nif ambiguous, was clarified when the judge asked whether the\n\ndefendant has been found \"guilty\" on each count.   The lack of any\n\nobjection when the foreperson answered and the judge proceeded to\n\nenter a judgment of conviction shows that trial counsel had no\n\ndoubt that the jury had equated its verdict with guilt.   There was\n\nno error, plain or otherwise, in treating the verdict as one of\n\nguilty on each count.\n\n          A narrower version of the argument, also made on appeal,\n\nhas more bite.    Edelkind points out that the phrasing of the\n\nverdict form itself omitted, for each count, an element of the\n\nstatutory offense--specifically, that the defrauded institution be\n\none that was federally insured.    This is itself an example of the\n\nproblems with using detailed verdict forms rather than simply\n\nasking whether the defendant was guilty of the offense charged.\n\n          Nevertheless, we conclude that there was no prejudicial\n\nerror in the omission of the federally insured requirement from the\n\nverdict form. Special verdicts are not required in criminal cases,\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fand, when they are used, there is no automatic requirement that a\n\nspecial verdict form include every element of the offense so long\n\nas the jury is instructed as to all elements.           See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Stonefish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789714\"><a href=\"/opinion/789714/united-states-v-patrick-michael-stonefish/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 699 (6th Cir. 2005).           Here the\n\njury was specifically instructed that they “must be convinced\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt” of each of the four elements of the\n\noffense,   including   (as   one   of   the   four   elements)   that   “the\n\nfinancial institution in question was federally insured.”\n\n           The defendant's next argument is that the verdict form\n\nand the jury instructions charged him with defrauding Fairmont and\n\nnot with defrauding Lehman Brothers, and that he could not properly\n\nbe convicted of defrauding Fairmont, which was not a federally\n\ninsured institution. The district court’s initial jury instruction\n\n(which was given orally but later provided to the jury in written\n\nform) described count 4 as charging Edelkind with executing “a\n\nscheme to defraud . . . upon Fairmont Funding, LTD, which [is a]\n\nfinancial institution.”      The special verdict form submitted to the\n\njury asked, as to count 4, whether the government had proved\n\n           a scheme to defraud Fairmont Funding, LTD in\n           connection with a loan . . . originated by\n           Fairmont   Funding,  LTD,   and  subsequently\n           assigned to Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB.\n\n           Just before the court read the jury instructions and\n\nprovided the jury with the special verdict form, Edelkind filed a\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal arguing that “Count Four is\n\nentirely dependant on Fairmont Funding [and] the Government has\n\n                                   -7-\n\ffailed to prove federal jurisdiction” because Fairmont is not a\n\nfinancial institution under 18 U.S.C. § 20.       The basis for defense\n\ncounsel's motion was that Edelkind had to know that a \"financial\n\ninstitution\" would be the ultimate victim of his fraud.                  The\n\ndistrict judge rightly found this position to be at odds with\n\nBrandon, 17 F.3d at 425, and rejected the motion for acquittal.\n\n           After the instructions were read to the jury, defense\n\ncounsel orally objected to them and to the verdict form on the\n\nground   that   Fairmont   was   not   a   financial     institution,    and\n\nreiterated   his   position   that   Edelkind   needed    to   know   that   a\n\n\"financial institution\" would be injured.       The court then provided\n\na curative instruction stating that “Lehman Brothers but not\n\nFairmont was a financial institution.\" Since the court had already\n\ntold the jury that a financial institution had to be defrauded or\n\ndeprived of money by fraud,2 the jury was informed that it could\n\nnot convict on the theory that the defendant had defrauded Fairmont\n\nalone.\n\n           It is quite true that the curative instruction came late\n\nin the day and apparently Edelkind's counsel did not ask for a\n\n\n     2\n      The instructions required that the jury find that Edelkind\nexecuted “a scheme or artifice (1) to defraud a financial\ninstitution or (2) to obtain any of the money . . . under the\ncustody or control of a financial institution by means of false or\nfraudulent pretenses.” The court specified that “scheme to defraud\na financial institution” meant “any deliberate course of conduct by\nwhich someone intends to deceive or cheat that financial\ninstitution and to obtain – and intends to obtain something of\nvalue, such as money.”\n\n                                     -8-\n\ftranscript page reflecting it to accompany the original written\n\ninstructions sent into the jury room; but the curative instruction\n\nwas virtually the last instruction that the jury heard before\n\nretiring. Nor was defense counsel entitled to have the jury ignore\n\nthe fraud upon Fairmont; on the government's theory of the case,\n\nfalse representations to it were the instrument by which money was\n\nsecured from Lehman Brothers.\n\n             The question then becomes whether the jury was adequately\n\nadvised that it needed to find fraud on Lehman Brothers.           In this\n\nrespect both the verdict form and the instructions were deficient.\n\nThe verdict form made only passing mention of Lehman Brothers as\n\nhaving acquired the loan. While the \"cured\" instructions generally\n\nrequired a finding that a financial institution had been defrauded\n\nand   that    Lehman   Brothers   was   a   financial    institution,   the\n\ninstructions failed to specifically identify Lehman Brothers as\n\nallegedly defrauded.\n\n             Edelkind did not request revision of the verdict form or\n\nan instruction that, in order to convict on count 4, the jury had\n\nto find that Lehman Brothers was defrauded.             Indeed, Edelkind's\n\ncounsel objected (unsuccessfully) to any mention of Lehman Brothers\n\nin the supplemental instruction. Counsel had good reason to direct\n\nattention away from Lehman Brothers; but Edelkind was surely on\n\nnotice that the government's own theory of the case was that Lehman\n\nBrothers had been the victim of the fraud (albeit indirectly)\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fbecause the fraud on Fairmont had operated to deprive Lehman\n\nBrothers of its money.3\n\n            Under these circumstances, we conclude that Edelkind's\n\nfailure to object to the instruction and verdict form as omitting\n\nLehman Brothers makes those errors reviewable only for plain error.\n\nFed.

Edelkind says that trial counsel had a duty to\n\nobject only to mistakes inimical to his client's interest, not to\n\nones that would undermine any verdict against his client.            The\n\npotential of such errors to undermine the verdict is why an\n\nobjection is required at the time--not an excuse for failing to\n\nmake a timely objection.\n\n            Edelkind also says that the errors were \"structural,\"\n\nrequiring   reversal   without   regard   to   prejudice.    \"Structural\n\nerrors\" comprise a small category of mistakes so identified by the\n\nSupreme Court, but generally exclude erroneous jury instructions\n\n(despite the fact that they \"preclud[e] the jury from making a\n\nfinding on the actual element of the offense\").

The government\n\nquestions whether his motion for a judgment of acquittal in the\n\ndistrict court preserved all of the claims he now makes under this\n\nhead.   Because we find that the evidence was sufficient in each of\n\nthe   aspects    raised,   we    bypass   the   waiver     issue    (which   poses\n\ndifficulties of its own).\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            Section   1344,    as   already    noted,     makes    criminal   the\n\nknowing execution of a scheme to defraud a federally insured bank.\n\nSee note 1, above.       Neither Fairmont nor Aurora was federally\n\ninsured.     Edelkind   says    that   there    is   no    proof   that   Lehman\n\nBrothers, although federally insured, was the intended or direct\n\nvictim of his scheme to defraud, and therefore the scheme cannot\n\nhave been one \"to defraud a financial institution\" as defined by\n\nCongress.\n\n            The statute says that the scheme to defraud a protected\n\nfinancial institution must be \"knowingly\" executed. In Brandon, 17\n\nF.3d at 425, this court held that the government does not have to\n\nshow that the defendant knew which particular bank might be injured\n\nor that it was federally insured.           Id. at 426.     The statute gives\n\nfair warning that bank fraud is unlawful: one who defrauds a bank\n\nsimply assumes the risk that the victim is federally insured.                 Id.\n\n            The greater difficulty, and the main focus of Edelkind's\n\nobjection, concerns whether Lehman Brothers was in fact defrauded.\n\nEdelkind secured the count 4 loan from Fairmont, which was not\n\nfederally insured.       But the government offered evidence that\n\nFairmont did no more than \"table fund\" the loan, that is, it agreed\n\nto make the loan only if another lender first agreed to purchase\n\nthe loan thereafter. The other lender, on the government's theory,\n\nwas Lehman Brothers.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f            Edelkind argues on appeal that Lehman Brothers was not\n\nthe   victim   of   his    scheme   to    defraud    because   his   fraudulent\n\nstatements about his wife's credentials and earnings never reached\n\nLehman   Brothers;    he    says    the   misrepresentations     only    reached\n\nAurora, Lehman Brothers' non-federally insured subsidiary.                   So,\n\nEdelkind says, he never defrauded Lehman Brothers as section 1344\n\nrequires.\n\n            Neither the statute nor the case law fully instructs just\n\nhow tight a factual nexus is required to allow a jury to decide\n\nthat a scheme, formally aimed at one (uninsured) company, operates\n\nin substance to defraud another (insured) entity with whom the\n\ndefendant has not dealt directly.            In our view the statute does\n\napply where the federally insured institution takes part in an\n\nintegrated transaction and is thereby injured by the defendant, who\n\nintended to defraud another party to the transaction.                   Scienter\n\nexists, the causal connection is sufficient, and under Brandon the\n\ndefendant cannot escape liability by virtue of his ignorance of the\n\noverall arrangement.\n\n            Here,    the   government      offered    evidence   that     Lehman\n\nBrothers' forms and guidelines were used by Fairmont and Aurora in\n\ntable funding the loan, that a Lehman Brothers official (not just\n\nits subsidiary Aurora) signed off on the loan before Fairmont made\n\nit, and that Fairmont transferred the loan to Lehman Brothers--not\n\nto Aurora--about a month after the closing between Edelkind and\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fFairmont.    Thus the loan--although formally made by Fairmont--was\n\nfrom the outset part of an integrated transaction, the first step\n\nof which was dependent on approval by Lehman Brothers, and the pre-\n\nplanned second step of which was a transfer of the mortgage to\n\nLehman Brothers itself.\n\n            Given these predicates--Edelkind's intent to defraud, the\n\nintegrated transaction, and the financial injury to which Lehman\n\nBrothers was exposed--the jury was entitled to find that Edelkind\n\ndefrauded   Lehman   Brothers,   a   federally   insured   bank.4   The\n\nsituation would be quite different, and liability might well be\n\ndoubtful, if the involvement of the federally insured entity was\n\nnot contemplated at the outset and came about later from a separate\n\ntransaction, for example, by the happenstance of an insured bank\n\npurchasing an earlier loan under-secured because of an earlier,\n\nindependent fraud.     We leave such line-drawing for a case that\n\nposes the issue.\n\n            We turn now to an ancillary order of forfeiture following\n\nthe jury verdict.     In this criminal proceeding, the government\n\nsought forfeiture, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C) and 28\n\nU.S.C.A. § 2461(c), of the Hull property used in the scheme and of\n\n$579,805.73 in proceeds traceable to the final loan. Edelkind\n\n\n\n     4\n      Edelkind says the government offered no proof that Lehman\nBrothers was federally insured on the day that it took over the\nFairmont loan, but Lehman Brothers was insured when it approved the\nFairmont loan, thus exposing itself to ultimate loss.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fargues that the two forfeiture statutes invoked by the government\n\ndo not allow this forfeiture to be implemented in a criminal\n\nproceeding, but rather only in a separate civil proceeding.5\n\n            The argument turns upon a difference in the scope of the\n\nmain federal statutes governing civil and criminal forfeitures, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 981, 982, on a bridging statute, 28 U.S.C.A. § 2461(c),\n\nand on a related factual premise. The civil forfeiture statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C), pertinently subjects to forfeiture any\n\nproperty \"which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable\n\nto\"   a   violation    of   section     1344;        by   contrast   the   criminal\n\nforfeiture    statute,      18    U.S.C.       §    982(a)(2)(B),    subjects     to\n\nforfeiture \"any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds\n\nthe person obtained directly or indirectly, as the result of\" such\n\na violation (emphasis added).\n\n            Edelkind    says     that   the        property   forfeited    here   was\n\nobtained by his wife and therefore is not property that he (\"the\n\nperson\") ever obtained.          Therefore, he concludes, the property was\n\nopen to a civil forfeiture action but not a criminal one.                         The\n\ngovernment answers by saying that the bridging statute, 28 U.S.C.A.\n\n§ 2461(c), allowed it to rely upon the civil forfeiture provision\n\n\n      5\n      There is good reason to think that Edelkind waived this\nargument at sentencing. When the judge stated that \"there is no\nlegal question that forfeiture will be required. I haven't heard\nthe defense counsel argue to the contrary,\" defense counsel then\nreplied: \"I think we are out of it at this point, Your Honor.\" No\nmention was made of the argument now made on appeal. Nonetheless,\nwe reach the merits to resolve the issue definitively.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fin the criminal case. The statute, as it stood between 2000 and\n\n2006, provided (emphasis added):\n\n           If a forfeiture of property is authorized in\n           connection with a violation of an Act of\n           Congress, and any person is charged in an\n           indictment or information with such violation\n           but no specific statutory provision is made\n           for criminal forfeiture upon conviction, the\n           Government may include the forfeiture in the\n           indictment or information in accordance with\n           the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and\n           upon conviction, the court shall order the\n           forfeiture of the property . . . .\n\n           Edelkind argues that section 2461(c) does not apply in\n\nthis case because a \"specific statutory provision is made for\n\ncriminal forfeiture upon conviction,\" namely, section 982, which\n\nexpressly applies to violations of the bank fraud statute.                The\n\ngovernment responds that section 982 was not available in this case\n\non Edelkind's own premise that the forfeited property was not his\n\nown, and therefore it could use the bridging statute to enforce\n\nsection 981 in the criminal case.\n\n           Edelkind's best argument is that Congress could not have\n\nintended   section   2461(c)   to   apply   to   offenses   for   which    it\n\ndeliberately drafted criminal forfeiture provisions narrower in\n\nscope   than   the   corresponding     civil     forfeiture   provisions.\n\nOtherwise, section 2461(c) would override the extra limitations\n\nthat Congress imposed in the original criminal forfeiture statute\n\n(here, the requirement that the defendant personally obtain the\n\nproperty forfeited criminally).\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f          The government's response is that section 2461(c), as it\n\nstood when this case was tried, fills the gap between criminal and\n\ncivil forfeiture by making criminal forfeiture available in every\n\ncriminal case that the criminal forfeiture statute does not reach\n\nbut for which civil forfeiture is legally authorized.            On this\n\nview, Edelkind's own argument that the criminal statute did not\n\nreach the property (because it was not his) shows why the civil\n\nstatute is available (because the property was traceable to the\n\nfraud).\n\n          The case law is of little help.

This intuition is supported by the legislative history\n\nof the bridging statute itself.         Far from wanting to limit the\n\nsubstantive reach of the criminal forfeiture statute, Congress made\n\nclear in enacting the bridging statute that it hoped to encourage\n\nthe use of criminal forfeiture procedures, with their greater\n\nprotections,   \"whenever   any   form    of   forfeiture   is   otherwise\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fauthorized by statute.\"         H.R.

See USA PATRIOT Improvement and Authorization\n\nAct of 2005, Pub. L. 109-177, § 410 (2006).\n\n             Thus, if Edelkind is right that section 982(a)(2) would\n\nnot authorize forfeiture in this case, then \"no specific statutory\n\nprovision\" provided for criminal forfeiture upon his conviction,\n\nand   section    2461(c)      authorizes    the     court    to   apply    section\n\n981(a)(1)(C) to fill the gap.        If Edelkind's premise is wrong and\n\nsection 982(a)(2) would authorize criminal forfeiture in this case,\n\nthen section 2461(c) does not apply--but neither has Edelkind been\n\nprejudiced by the government's citation error.                See Rule 7(c)(3).\n\n             The last issue on this appeal concerns the calculation of\n\nEdelkind's sentence.         The sentencing guideline range is driven in\n\npart by the amount of loss resulting from the offense and in part\n\nby other factors.      U.S.S.G. §2B1.1(b).          Using the 2004 edition of\n\nthe guidelines, the district court determined that Edelkind's\n\nviolations had inflicted a net loss exceeding $1 million--bringing\n\nthe offense level to 23, §2B1.1(a)(1), (b)(1)(I); and that a\n\n\n      6\n      See also H.R. Rep. 106-1048, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">67919</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *61 (2001)\n(Congress intended to make criminal forfeiture available \"wherever\nfederal law allows for civil forfeiture of property involved in a\nspecific crime...\"); H.R. Rep. 105-358(I) at *35 (stating that the\npurpose of the amendment was to \"give the government the option of\npursuing criminal forfeiture as an alternative to civil forfeiture\nif civil forfeiture is otherwise authorized.\").\n\n                                     -18-\n\ffurther two level enhancement (to 25) was required because--in the\n\nwords of the guideline--\"the defendant derived more than $1,000,000\n\nin gross receipts from one or more financial institutions as a\n\nresult of the offense.\"      Id. §2B1.1(b)(13)(A).\n\n            At sentencing, the judge proposed to use an offense level\n\nof 25, and defense counsel began to argue that the net loss was\n\nunder $1 million, which would have substantially reduced the\n\noffense level; but counsel conceded that if the gross receipts\n\nenhancement   applied,   the   language   of   section   2B1.1(b)(13)(D)\n\nprescribed a minimum offense level of 24 regardless of a smaller\n\nnet loss.   The judge, it appears, adopted this solution, departing\n\ndownward slightly in the final sentence.7\n\n            Edelkind does not dispute that he inflicted gross losses\n\nin excess of $1 million; but he says that the \"gross receipts\"\n\nenhancement should not have been applied because the gross receipts\n\nwere derived not by Edelkind, but by his wife--in whose name the\n\nHull property had been acquired and to whom the proceeds of the\n\nrefinancing   loans   were   directed.    He   adds   that   a   prenuptial\n\nagreement with his wife provided that property and assets obtained\n\nby her were to be and remain her personal property.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      An adjusted offense level of 24, given Edelkind's criminal\nhistory, corresponded to a range of 63 to 78 months. Because the\njudge thought that the criminal history points overstated\nEdelkind's past wrongdoing, the judge departed downward to the 60-\nmonth sentence ultimately imposed.\n\n                                  -19-\n\f               The district court rejected this argument, reading the\n\nguideline to refer not to a defendant's formal legal control of the\n\ngross receipts, but instead to his individual culpability.                 The\n\ndistrict judge stated: \"It seems to me that if you procure funds\n\nfor somebody else and the other person gets the advantage of it,\n\nthat your moral responsibility is the same whether you take the\n\nmoney or not, particularly if the person you get it for is your\n\nwife.\"       We review de novo the meaning of the guideline.

Rather,\n\ngiven its aim, the guideline may be applied where the defendant\n\neither     controls   (even   though      indirectly)   the   fraud   proceeds\n\nattributed to him or where he causes them to be lodged in another\n\nwith the expectation that he will enjoy the benefits.               Whether any\n\nlesser showing would suffice need not be decided.\n\n             This reading distinguishes property that goes solely to\n\na co-conspirator and, on the affirmative side, it charges the\n\ndefendant with proceeds that he controls or enjoys.             Such proceeds\n\ncan, as a matter of language, be regarded as individually derived\n\nby the defendant.

There the defendant had founded\n\nthe company holding the proceeds but did not own any stock; and\n\nonly a modest portion ($200,000) of what the fraud netted the\n\ncompany could be traced through to the defendant's compensation.\n\nSo   far   as   Castellano    is   read   to   make   state   law   formalities\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fconclusive, it would conflict with the realistic approach taken by\n\nother circuits, which we follow here.\n\n             The pre-sentence report notes that \"[w]ith the borrowed\n\nmoney, Edelkind... financed a lavish lifestyle for himself and his\n\nfamily.\"     Although Edelkind objected to certain details in the\n\nreport's assertion, the thrust of the report is supported by other\n\nevidence and reasonable inference.      Thus, the record confirms that\n\nEdelkind enjoyed the fruits of the scheme to defraud, and having\n\nmasterminded the scheme and enjoyed benefits from it, Edelkind\n\nhimself \"derived\" the illegal loan proceeds within the terms of the\n\nguideline.\n\n           Edelkind next says that the $1 million gross receipts\n\nfigure can be met only if the Fairmont loan proceeds are included--\n\nit being the largest of refinancings–and that they should not be\n\nincluded because under section 2B1.1(b)(13)(A) of the guidelines,\n\nthe receipts exceeding $1 million must be derived \"from one or more\n\nfinancial institutions\" (emphasis added).        As noted, Fairmont was\n\nnot a financial institution within the meaning of section 1344.\n\n           However,   the   guideline   has    its   own   definition   of\n\n\"financial institution\" which includes \"any state or foreign bank,\n\ntrust company, credit union, insurance company, investment company,\n\nmutual fund, savings (building and loan) association, union or\n\nemployee pension fund;... and any similar entity, whether or not\n\ninsured by the federal government.\"           §2B1.1 Application Note 1\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f(emphasis added).          In other words, it is the character of the\n\ninstitution     and    not     federal       insurance     that    matters      to    the\n\nguideline.\n\n             Fairmont was described by its witness at trial as \"a\n\nmortgage bank, mortgage lender\" and referred to in its affidavit as\n\na \"licensed private mortgage lender.\" Edelkind offers us no reason\n\nto   think   that    Fairmont       falls    outside    the     circle    of   \"similar\n\nentities,\" and the case law confirms a broad interpretation.\n\nUnited States v.

The district court\n\ncalculated    the     gross    amount       of   the   frauds    and   then,     as   the\n\nguideline provides, subtracted the present value of the mortgaged\n\nHull property, which remained available to offset the losses.\n\nU.S.S.G. §2B1.1 Application Note 3(E).\n\n             In calculating the value of the Hull property, the\n\ndistrict     judge    picked    a    figure      between   the    widely       differing\n\nestimates offered by the government and by Edelkind.                       Well after\n\nsentencing, it emerged from a newly discovered memorandum that--in\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fmaking his own calculation--the district judge had apparently\n\nadopted a final net loss figure $500,000 higher than he had\n\nintended. At sentencing, counsel knew the final figure adopted but\n\nnot the judge's private miscalculation.\n\n            The time for correcting the sentence had passed, Fed. R.\n\nCrim.

The district judge said at a post-sentencing conference\n\nconcerning the calculation error that he would leave the matter to\n\nthis court, which could remand, if necessary.              The judge said that\n\nhe was not prepared to say whether use of the lower net loss figure\n\nhe had intended would have made any difference to the sentence.\n\n            It is clear that the error did not matter.            The district\n\ncourt    used   an   offense   level   of     24   in   determining   Edelkind's\n\nsentence before departing downward.                As already explained, the\n\ngross receipts enhancement prescribed a minimum offense level of 24\n\nregardless of the net loss.        §2B1.1(b)(13)(D).         Edelkind concedes\n\nin his brief that \"[i]f the §2B1.1(b)(13) enhancement applies\"--as\n\nwe have found that it does--\"the offense level would rise to 24 in\n\nboth cases.\"     Thus, the net loss figure, whether in error or not,\n\nhad no ultimate effect on the sentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f</pre>",
