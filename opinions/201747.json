Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n          Torruella, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\f     George H. Murphy, was on brief for appellant, Shawn Monteiro.\n     Jay Markell, was on brief for appellant, William Johnson.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 9, 2005\n\f           HOWARD,     Circuit    Judge.        William     Johnson    and    Shawn\n\nMonteiro     pleaded    guilty     to     charges      stemming       from    their\n\nparticipation     in    drug     distribution         and    money     laundering\n\nconspiracies.     Johnson received a 97-month sentence, and Monteiro\n\nreceived   a   70-month     sentence.         Both   defendants   appeal      their\n\nsentences.     We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           The facts are derived from the plea and sentencing\n\nhearings and the presentence reports. See United States v. Tejada-\n\nBeltran, 50 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir. 1995).             In the late 1990s, the\n\ndefendants, who were old friends, cooperated in extensive drug\n\ndistribution     and   money     laundering      conspiracies.          The    drug\n\nconspiracy involved arranging for shipments of marijuana from\n\nCalifornia to Massachusetts and Rhode Island, where it could be\n\ndivided and sold to individuals for profit.\n\n           Johnson engaged Andre Turner, an acquaintance of his to\n\nwhom he introduced Monteiro as a \"drug associate[],\" to ship the\n\ndrugs from California.       Turner sent the marijuana to locations in\n\nMassachusetts and Rhode Island identified by Johnson, where it\n\nusually was retrieved by Robert Bukin, one of the defendants'\n\nassociates (though occasionally the defendants retrieved the drugs\n\nthemselves).      After the marijuana arrived, the defendants and\n\nothers divided it and distributed it to local customers.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f               The defendants earned substantial cash sums from their\n\ndrug enterprise and devised a scheme to launder the money by wiring\n\nit    through    Western   Union.     Johnson     personally     made    29    wire\n\ntransfers and received many others from conspiracy members.                     He\n\nalso recruited other individuals, including Christopher Spaulding\n\nand Johnson's cousin, Charles Vaughn to make transfers on his\n\nbehalf.    Monteiro engaged in similar conduct.            He personally wired\n\nover $10,000 to people in California.            He also recruited Courtney\n\nWooten, Leah Texeira Baez, Ana Monteiro, and Lori Pierce to wire\n\nmoney for him.      There was evidence that approximately $1.8 million\n\nwas    wired     through   Western   Union      during    the   course   of    the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n               On these facts, Johnson pleaded guilty to conspiring to\n\npossess marijuana with the intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. § 846,\n\nconspiring to launder money, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), and possessing\n\nmarijuana with the intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).\n\nMonteiro pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess marijuana with the\n\nintent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. § 846, and conspiring to launder\n\nmoney, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).\n\n               At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard from\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration Agent John O'Donoghue, who was\n\nassigned to investigate the defendants' activities.               He testified\n\nto    several    statements   made   to   him    during   the   course    of   his\n\ninvestigation that implicated the defendants and demonstrated that\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthey were working together as part of a single conspiracy to\n\ndistribute drugs and to launder the cash generated by their illicit\n\nenterprise.\n\n             After   O'Donoghue's      testimony,       the    district   court\n\nannounced     its    sentencing      calculation    for       each    defendant.\n\nConcerning Johnson, the court based the sentence on the money\n\nlaundering conviction because it yielded the highest offense level\n\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2 (2001). The\n\nbase offense level for money laundering conducted in connection\n\nwith drug offenses is defined as the base offense level for the\n\nunderlying drug offenses.         See U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(a)(1).          The base\n\noffense level for Johnson's drug offenses was 26.               The court added\n\ntwo levels because Johnson was convicted of money laundering under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1956, see U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), and four more\n\nlevels   because     Johnson   led   or     organized    a    money   laundering\n\nconspiracy which included at least five people, see U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.1(a).1    The court then subtracted three levels because Johnson\n\naccepted responsibility, see U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.                 Johnson's total\n\noffense level was 29 which, because of his category II criminal\n\nhistory, yielded a sentencing range between 97 and 121 months.\n\nJohnson moved for a downward departure based on his poor health and\n\n\n     1\n      In applying the enhancement, the court acknowledged that\nthere was some \"degree of decentralization,\" but concluded that\nthere was credible evidence of \"an overarching agreement\" among\nfive or more people to recruit others to launder money through wire\ntransfers.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fpresentence rehabilitation.          The court denied the motions and\n\nsentenced Johnson to 97 months in prison.\n\n            The court conducted a similar calculation for Monteiro.\n\nHis sentence was also based on the money laundering conviction.\n\nBecause the court attributed smaller amounts of marijuana to\n\nMonteiro than to Johnson, the base offense level was 24.            The court\n\nthen applied the same adjustments made to Johnson's offense level\n\nto arrive at a total offense level of 27.           Because Monteiro had a\n\ncategory I criminal history, the sentencing range was 70 to 87\n\nmonths' imprisonment. The court sentenced Monteiro to 70 months in\n\nprison.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            The defendants' primary contention is that the district\n\ncourt     erred   in    applying   the     four-level     role-in-the-offense\n\nenhancement.       They     also   argue    that   they    are   entitled   to\n\nresentencing under United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n\nAdditionally, Johnson challenges the district court's denial of his\n\nmotions for a downward departure.\n\n            A.         Role-in-the-Offense Enhancement\n\n            The defendants challenge the application of the role-in-\n\nthe-offense enhancement on two grounds. First, they argue that the\n\nevidence was insufficient for the court to conclude that there was\n\nan overarching conspiracy to launder money involving five or more\n\npeople.    At most, they contend, the evidence showed that Monteiro\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fand Johnson each led his own separate conspiracy, neither of which\n\ncontained the five-person minimum. Second, they argue that, to the\n\nextent there was evidence of a single conspiracy, it came from the\n\nhearsay testimony of the agent who investigated the crime and\n\ntherefore was unreliable.\n\n            The    enhancement       applies      where     the     government\n\ndemonstrates,     by   a    preponderance    of   the   evidence,   that    \"the\n\ndefendant was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that\n\ninvolved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a); United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (en banc).           The determination that a given set of facts\n\njustifies    application       of   the     enhancement   is   \"entitled      to\n\nconsiderable deference and must stand unless clearly erroneous.\"\n\nUnited States v. Brown, 298 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir. 2002).                 Thus,\n\nthe battle over the enhancement \"will almost always be won or lost\n\nin the district court.\"        United States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 142\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).       Whether a set of crimes can be attributed to one\n\nconspiracy is a question of fact, see United States v. Glaum, 356\n\nF.3d 169, 176 (1st Cir. 2004), vacated on other grounds by 125 S.\n\nCt. 1030 (2005), the resolution of which typically depends on\n\nevidence of common purpose, interdependence among the elements of\n\nthe plan, and overlap among the participants, see United States v.\n\nPortela, 167 F.3d 687, 695 (1st Cir. 1999).               But these factors\n\nserve only as a guide; \"[n]o magic formula exists for determining\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fwhen a set of jointly committed crimes adds up to an overarching\n\nconspiracy or enterprise.\"            United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 659,\n\n665 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The   court       heard   testimony     that   the    defendants       were\n\npartners in a drug distribution ring, including testimony that\n\nJohnson introduced Monteiro as his \"drug associate[].\"                      The ring\n\ngenerated significant sums of cash which provided the defendants\n\nwith a common motive to launder money.              There also was substantial\n\ntestimonial and documentary proof of overlap among conspiracy\n\nparticipants.      Andre Turner not only received Western Union wires\n\nfrom Johnson, but also from Wooten and Baez (who were recruited by\n\nMonteiro).      Spaulding was introduced to both Monteiro and Johnson\n\nand proceeded to wire approximately $75,000 on their behalf.                       And\n\nthe record is replete with evidence of individuals recruited by\n\neach defendant wiring money to common recipients.                      The court was\n\njustified    in       concluding      that   this    overlap      in     method    and\n\nparticipants was not a coincidence, but rather evidence of an\n\nagreement between the defendants to launder the money that they\n\nobtained from their drug conspiracy.\n\n            The challenge to the reliability of Agent O'Donoghue's\n\ntestimony fares no better.            The defendants claim that the district\n\ncourt   could     not    rely    on   the    agent's   testimony         because   the\n\ngovernment      did     not    produce   the   declarants        whose    statements\n\nO'Donoghue relayed.           But there is no obligation on the part of the\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fgovernment to produce the declarants so long as the court has a\n\nbasis for measuring the reliability of the testifying officer.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 261-62 (1st Cir.\n\n1996); United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d 959, 971 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n            The record demonstrates such a basis. Agent O'Donoghue's\n\ntestimony   was     consistent   with   information      in   the   presentence\n\nreports,    which     included      summaries     of   interviews    with    the\n\ndeclarants.    The district court also had before it documentary\n\nevidence, in the form of a summary of Western Union receipts, which\n\nshowed the defendants and their associates wiring money to many of\n\nthe same recipients.      See Phaneuf, 91 F.3d at 261-62 (stating that\n\nreliability   of     hearsay   at    sentencing    can   be   demonstrated   by\n\nreference to other evidence in the case).              Furthermore, the court\n\ndid not adopt the agent's testimony wholesale; it declined to\n\ncredit the statements of witnesses who may have had reason to\n\ndepict the defendants in an unflattering light.2\n\n\n     2\n      Monteiro also argues that the district court's application of\nthe role-in-the-offense enhancement was clearly wrong because the\ncourt's finding of a single conspiracy conflicted with its decision\nnot to attribute to him all of the money laundered by the\nconspiracy. According to Monteiro, this shows that there was not\na single money laundering conspiracy. We disagree. The court used\nthe amount of money laundered in the conspiracy as a factor in\nestimating drug quantity. The district court indicated that it\nrelied on a reduced amount of money laundered through the\nconspiracy to arrive at a conservative drug quantity estimate.\nSee United States v. Marks, 365 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir. 2004)\n(stating that in choosing between plausible estimates of drug\nquantity district courts are \"to err on the side of caution\"). It\n\n                                       -9-\n\f             B.      Downward Departure\n\n             Johnson contends that the district court erroneously\n\nconcluded that it did not have the legal authority to depart\n\ndownward     based    on    his   poor    health    and   his    presentence\n\nrehabilitation.      The government counters that the court understood\n\nthat it could depart on both of these grounds, but that it declined\n\nto do so as a matter of discretion.            Therefore, the government\n\nargues we do not have jurisdiction to review Johnson's claims.\n\n             Although a district court's discretionary denial of a\n\ndeparture is not appealable, see United States v. Dewire, 271 F.3d\n\n333,   337   (1st    Cir.   2001),   a   refusal   to   depart   based   on   a\n\nmisunderstanding of the law is reviewed de novo, see United States\n\nv. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1991).               The line between\n\ndiscretionary and legal denials of downward departure requests has\n\nnot always been clear.      See United States v. Saldana, 109 F.3d 100,\n\n\n\nsimply does not follow that the court's conservative drug quantity\nestimate (which benefitted Monteiro) necessarily precluded the\ncourt from finding a single conspiracy.\n\n     In addition, Monteiro contends that the court violated his due\nprocess rights by applying the role-in-the-offense enhancement to\nthe money laundering conviction instead of the drug conviction. He\nclaims prejudice because applying the enhancement to the drug\nconviction would have resulted in a lower total offense level.\nThere is no merit to this argument. The district court must\nseparately evaluate the defendant's leadership role for each count.\nSee United States v. Thiongo, 344 F.3d 55, 62 n.5 (1st Cir. 2003).\nAs set forth above, the court's determination that Monteiro was an\norganizer or leader of the money laundering conspiracy was based on\nreliable evidence, and therefore it was appropriate for the court\nto apply the enhancement.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f103 (1st Cir. 1997). We explained the distinction in United States\n\nv. Pierro:\n\n          If the judge sets differential factfinding and\n          evaluative judgment to one side, and says, in\n          effect, \"the circumstance of which you speak,\n          even if it exists, does not constitute a\n          legally sufficient basis for departure,\" then\n          the correctness of that quintessentially legal\n          determination may be tested on appeal. But if\n          the judge says, in effect, either that \"this\n          circumstance of which you speak has not been\n          shown to exist in this case\" or, alternatively\n          that \"while this circumstance of which you\n          speak might exist and might constitute a\n          legally cognizable basis for a departure in a\n          theoretical sense, it does not render this\n          particular case sufficiently unusual to\n          warrant departing,\" then, in either such\n          event, no appeal lies.\n\n32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          Under this standard, the government's jurisdictional\n\narguments achieve mixed results. With regard to the requested poor\n\nhealth departure, the court reasoned that Johnson would receive\n\nadequate health care in prison; it did not evince an understanding\n\nthat it was legally constrained from granting a health-related\n\ndeparture.    This, then, was a discretionary decision which we will\n\nnot review.   See United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n              The   requested   presentence   rehabilitation   departure\n\npresents a different situation.      The district court ruled that the\n\n\"degree of discretion\" afforded by the caselaw did not extend to\n\nthe circumstances of this case.      This is a legal ruling infected,\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fJohnson contends, by the court's misunderstanding of the amount of\n\ndiscretion it possessed.           We review this claim de novo.\n\n            Johnson presented the court with information that, after\n\nhe learned about the investigation into his criminal conduct, \"he\n\nbegan . . . to earn a living through honest hard work as a\n\ncarpenter.\"     He also began to address his substance abuse problem\n\nby agreeing to remain in custody where he could participate in a\n\ndrug rehabilitation program pending the resolution of the criminal\n\ncharges.\n\n            The   district    court     accurately      perceived   the   narrow\n\nparameters within which it was empowered to grant a downward\n\ndeparture for presentence rehabilitation.               See United States v.\n\nCraven, 239 F.3d 91, 99 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating that \"downward\n\ndepartures for presentence rehabilitation are hen's-teeth rare\").\n\nIn United States v. Rushby, 936 F.2d 41, 42-43 (1991), we concluded\n\nthat a defendant was not entitled to a downward departure for\n\npresentence rehabilitation based on proof that the defendant had\n\nenrolled in a substance abuse treatment program, was attending to\n\nhis family responsibilities, and was holding gainful employment.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 114 (1st Cir.\n\n1990), we set aside a downward departure grounded on presentence\n\nrehabilitation     where     the    defendant    entered   a   halfway    house,\n\nremained substance-free, and found employment.                 The court was\n\ncorrect    in   concluding    that     these    cases   precluded   a   downward\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fdeparture based on Johnson's procuring employment and beginning a\n\ndrug treatment program.\n\n            C.         Booker Claim\n\n            Finally, we consider the defendants' claim that they\n\nwere entitled to resentencing under Booker. See Booker, 125 S. Ct.\n\n738   (declaring   the     Guidelines      advisory    in   preserving   their\n\nconstitutionality).         The   defendants      essentially   recast   their\n\nargument concerning the role-in-the-offense enhancement as a Booker\n\nclaim.     They argue that the district court's imposition of the\n\nrole-in-the-offense enhancement was dubious because it was based on\n\nhearsay.\n\n            To support this argument, the defendants invoke Crawford\n\nv. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004) (holding that certain types of\n\nhearsay    are   not    admissible    at     a   criminal   trial   under   the\n\nConfrontation Clause).

Johnson received a 97-month sentence, and Monteiro received a 70-month sentence. Both defendants appeal their sentences. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are derived from the plea and sentencing hearings and the presentence reports. <i>See United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir.1995). In the late 1990s, the defendants, who were old friends, cooperated in extensive drug distribution and money laundering conspiracies. The drug conspiracy involved arranging for shipments of marijuana from California to Massachusetts and Rhode Island, where it could be divided and sold to individuals for profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson engaged Andre Turner, an acquaintance of his to whom he introduced Monteiro as a \"drug associate[ ],\" to ship the drugs from California. Turner sent the marijuana to locations in Massachusetts and Rhode Island identified by Johnson, where it usually was retrieved by Robert Bukin, one of the defendants' associates (though occasionally the defendants retrieved the drugs themselves). After the marijuana arrived, the defendants and others divided it and distributed it to local customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants earned substantial cash sums from their drug enterprise and devised a scheme to launder the money by wiring it through Western Union. Johnson personally made 29 wire transfers and received many others from conspiracy members. He also recruited other individuals, including Christopher Spaulding and Johnson's cousin, Charles Vaughn to make transfers on his behalf. Monteiro engaged in similar conduct. He personally wired over $10,000 to people in California. He also recruited Courtney Wooten, Leah Texeira Baez, Ana Monteiro, and Lori Pierce to wire money for him. There was evidence that approximately $1.8 million was wired through Western Union during the course of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, Johnson pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, conspiring to launder money, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h), and possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Monteiro pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and conspiring to launder money, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard from Drug Enforcement Administration Agent John O'Donoghue, who was assigned to investigate the defendants' activities. He testified to several statements made to him during the course of his investigation that implicated the defendants and demonstrated that they were working together as part of a single conspiracy to distribute drugs and to launder the cash generated by their illicit enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After O'Donoghue's testimony, the district court announced its sentencing calculation for each defendant. Concerning Johnson, the court based the sentence on the money laundering conviction because it yielded the highest offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2 (2001). The base offense level for money laundering conducted in connection with drug offenses is defined as the base offense level for the underlying drug offenses. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(a)(1). The base offense level for Johnson's drug offenses was 26. The court added two levels because Johnson was convicted of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), and four more levels because Johnson led or organized a money laundering conspiracy which included at least five people, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court then subtracted three levels because Johnson accepted responsibility, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. Johnson's total offense level was 29 which, because of his category II criminal history, yielded a sentencing range between 97 and 121 months. Johnson moved for a downward departure based on his poor health and presentence rehabilitation. The court denied the motions and sentenced Johnson to 97 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court conducted a similar calculation for Monteiro. His sentence was also based on the money laundering conviction. Because the court attributed smaller amounts of marijuana to Monteiro than to Johnson, the base offense level was 24. The court then applied the same adjustments made to Johnson's offense level to arrive at a total offense level of 27. Because Monteiro had a category I criminal history, the sentencing range was 70 to 87 months' imprisonment. The court sentenced Monteiro to 70 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' primary contention is that the district court erred in applying the four-level role-in-the-offense enhancement. They also argue that they are entitled to resentencing under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Additionally, Johnson challenges the district court's denial of his motions for a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Role-in-the-Offense Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants challenge the application of the role-in-the-offense enhancement on two grounds. First, they argue that the evidence was insufficient for the court to conclude that there was an overarching conspiracy to launder money involving five or more people. At most, they contend, the evidence showed that Monteiro and Johnson each led his own separate conspiracy, neither of which contained the five-person minimum. Second, they argue that, to the extent there was evidence of a single conspiracy, it came from the hearsay testimony of the agent who investigated the crime and therefore was unreliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The enhancement applies where the government demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \"the defendant was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a); <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc). The determination that a given set of facts justifies application of the enhancement is \"entitled to considerable deference and must stand unless clearly erroneous.\" <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 298 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, the battle over the enhancement \"will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" <i>United States v. Santos,</i> 357 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir.2004). Whether a set of crimes can be attributed to one conspiracy is a question of fact, <i>see United States v. Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d 169, 176 (1st Cir.2004), <i>vacated on other grounds by</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 1030, 160 L.Ed.2d 994 (2005), the resolution of which typically depends on evidence of common purpose, interdependence among the elements of the plan, and overlap among the participants, <i>see United States v. Portela,</i> 167 F.3d 687, 695 (1st Cir.1999). But these factors serve only as a guide; \"[n]o magic formula exists for determining when a set of jointly committed crimes adds up to an overarching conspiracy or enterprise.\" <i>United States v. Shea,</i> 211 F.3d 658, 665 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court heard testimony that the defendants were partners in a drug distribution ring, including testimony that Johnson introduced Monteiro as his \"drug associate[].\" The ring generated significant sums of cash which provided the defendants with a common motive to launder money. There also was substantial testimonial and documentary proof of overlap among conspiracy participants. Andre Turner not only received Western Union wires from Johnson, but also from Wooten and Baez (who were recruited by Monteiro). Spaulding was introduced to both Monteiro and Johnson and proceeded to wire approximately $75,000 on their behalf. And the record is replete with evidence of individuals recruited by each defendant wiring money to common recipients. The court was justified in concluding that this overlap in method and participants was not a coincidence, but rather evidence of an agreement between the defendants to launder the money that they obtained from their drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenge to the reliability of Agent O'Donoghue's testimony fares no better. The defendants claim that the district court could not rely on the agent's testimony because the government did not produce the declarants whose statements O'Donoghue relayed. But there is no obligation on the part of the government to produce the declarants so long as the court has a basis for measuring the reliability of the testifying officer. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Phaneuf,</i> 91 F.3d 255, 261-62 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Rojo-Alvarez,</i> 944 F.2d 959, 971 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates such a basis. Agent O'Donoghue's testimony was consistent with information in the presentence reports, which included summaries of interviews with the declarants. The district court also had before it documentary evidence, in the form of a summary of Western Union receipts, which showed the defendants and their associates wiring money to many of the same recipients. <i>See Phaneuf,</i> 91 F.3d at 261-62 (stating that reliability of hearsay at sentencing can be demonstrated by reference to other evidence in the case). Furthermore, the court did not adopt the agent's testimony wholesale; it declined to credit the statements of witnesses who may have had reason to depict the defendants in an unflattering light.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Downward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson contends that the district court erroneously concluded that it did not have the legal authority to depart downward based on his poor health and his presentence rehabilitation. The government counters that the court understood that it could depart on both of these grounds, but that it declined to do so as a matter of discretion. Therefore, the government argues we do not have jurisdiction to review Johnson's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a district court's discretionary denial of a departure is not appealable, <i>see United States v. Dewire,</i> 271 F.3d 333, 337 (1st Cir.2001), a refusal to depart based on a misunderstanding of the law is reviewed de novo, <i>see United States v. Romolo,</i> 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1991). The line between discretionary and legal denials of downward departure requests has not always been clear. <i>See United States v. Saldana,</i> 109 F.3d 100, 103 (1st Cir.1997). We explained the distinction in <i>United States v. Pierro</i>:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the judge sets differential factfinding and evaluative judgment to one side, and says, in effect, \"the circumstance of which you speak, <i>even if it exists,</i> does not constitute a legally sufficient basis for departure,\" then the correctness of that quintessentially <i>legal</i> determination may be tested on appeal. But if the judge says, in effect, either that \"this circumstance of which you speak has not been shown to exist in this case\" or, alternatively that \"while this circumstance of which you speak might exist and might constitute a legally cognizable basis for a departure in a theoretical sense, it does not render this particular case sufficiently unusual to warrant departing,\" then, in either such event, no appeal lies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this standard, the government's jurisdictional arguments achieve mixed results. With regard to the requested poor health departure, the court reasoned that Johnson would receive adequate health care in prison; it did not evince an understanding that it was legally constrained from granting a health-related departure. This, then, was a discretionary decision which we will not review. <i>See United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 30 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requested presentence rehabilitation departure presents a different situation. The district court ruled that the \"degree of discretion\" afforded by the caselaw did not extend to the circumstances of this case. This is a legal ruling infected, Johnson contends, by the court's misunderstanding of the amount of discretion it possessed. We review this claim de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson presented the court with information that, after he learned about the investigation into his criminal conduct, \"he began . . . to earn a living through honest hard work as a carpenter.\" He also began to address his substance abuse problem by agreeing to remain in custody where he could participate in a drug rehabilitation program pending the resolution of the criminal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accurately perceived the narrow parameters within which it was empowered to grant a downward departure for presentence rehabilitation. <i>See United States v. Craven,</i> 239 F.3d 91, 99 (1st Cir.2001) (stating that \"downward departures for presentence rehabilitation are hen's-teeth rare\"). In <i>United States v. Rushby,</i> 936 F.2d 41, 42-43 (1991), we concluded that a defendant was not entitled to a downward departure for presentence rehabilitation based on proof that the defendant had enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program, was attending to his family responsibilities, and was holding gainful employment. Similarly, in <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 114 (1st Cir.1990), we set aside a downward departure grounded on presentence rehabilitation where the defendant entered a halfway house, remained substance-free, and found employment. The court was correct in concluding that these cases precluded a downward departure based on Johnson's procuring employment and beginning a drug treatment program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Booker</i> Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we consider the defendants' claim that they were entitled to resentencing under <i>Booker. See Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (declaring the Guidelines advisory in preserving their constitutionality). The defendants essentially recast their argument concerning the role-in-the-offense enhancement as a <i>Booker</i> claim. They argue that the district court's imposition of the role-in-the-offense enhancement was dubious because it was based on hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support this argument, the defendants invoke <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (holding that certain types of hearsay are not admissible at a criminal trial under the Confrontation Clause). They suggest that the logic of <i>Crawford</i> (which was decided after the district court imposed sentence) may encourage the court to rely less heavily on hearsay if given an opportunity to resentence. The defendants did not raise a <i>Booker</i> argument below, so our review is for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76-77 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A prerequisite for this court to order resentencing based on an unpreserved <i>Booker</i> claim is a demonstration by the defendant that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence under the now advisory Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 75. We are not \"overly demanding as to proof of [such] probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the [court] might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants have not satisfied this burden. <i>Crawford</i> does not apply to sentencing, <i>see United States v. Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d 174, 178-79, 2005 WL 1594576, at *4-*5 (1st Cir.2005), and there is nothing (but the defendants' assertions) to suggest that <i>Crawford's</i> rationale would have any impact on the sentences imposed in this case. Besides <i>Crawford,</i> the defendants have not identified anything in the record from which we can conclude that the court shared the defendants' doubt about the appropriateness of the role-in-the-offense enhancement simply because the evidentiary basis for the enhancement was comprised of hearsay. We therefore have no basis for ordering a remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the defendants' sentences are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In applying the enhancement, the court acknowledged that there was some \"degree of decentralization,\" but concluded that there was credible evidence of \"an overarching agreement\" among five or more people to recruit others to launder money through wire transfers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Monteiro also argues that the district court's application of the role-in-the-offense enhancement was clearly wrong because the court's finding of a single conspiracy conflicted with its decision not to attribute to him all of the money laundered by the conspiracy. According to Monteiro, this shows that there was not a single money laundering conspiracy. We disagree. The court used the amount of money laundered in the conspiracy as a factor in estimating drug quantity. The district court indicated that it relied on a reduced amount of money laundered through the conspiracy to arrive at a conservative drug quantity estimate<i>See United States v. Marks,</i> 365 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir.2004) (stating that in choosing between plausible estimates of drug quantity district courts are \"to err on the side of caution\"). It simply does not follow that the court's conservative drug quantity estimate (which benefitted Monteiro) necessarily precluded the court from finding a single conspiracy.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Monteiro contends that the court violated his due process rights by applying the role-in-the-offense enhancement to the money laundering conviction instead of the drug conviction. He claims prejudice because applying the enhancement to the drug conviction would have resulted in a lower total offense level. There is no merit to this argument. The district court must separately evaluate the defendant's leadership role for each count. <i>See United States v. Thiongo,</i> 344 F.3d 55, 62 n. 5 (1st Cir.2003). As set forth above, the court's determination that Monteiro was an organizer or leader of the money laundering conspiracy was based on reliable evidence, and therefore it was appropriate for the court to apply the enhancement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The defendants argue that they had no obligation to object below to preserve their<i>Booker</i> claim because their claim \"involve[s] a constitutional principle that had not been previously recognized.\" We already have rejected this argument. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are derived from the plea and sentencing hearings and the presentence reports. <i>See United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir.1995). In the late 1990s, the defendants, who were old friends, cooperated in extensive drug distribution and money laundering conspiracies. The drug conspiracy involved arranging for shipments of marijuana from California to Massachusetts and Rhode Island, where it could be divided and sold to individuals for profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson engaged Andre Turner, an acquaintance of his to whom he introduced Monteiro as a \"drug associate[ ],\" to ship the drugs from California. Turner sent the marijuana to locations in Massachusetts and Rhode Island identified by Johnson, where it usually was retrieved by Robert Bukin, one of the defendants' associates (though occasionally the defendants retrieved the drugs themselves). After the marijuana arrived, the defendants and others divided it and distributed it to local customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants earned substantial cash sums from their drug enterprise and devised a scheme to launder the money by wiring it through Western Union. Johnson personally made 29 wire transfers and received many others from conspiracy members. He also recruited other individuals, including Christopher Spaulding and Johnson's cousin, Charles Vaughn to make transfers on his behalf. Monteiro engaged in similar conduct. He personally wired over $10,000 to people in California. He also recruited Courtney Wooten, Leah Texeira Baez, Ana Monteiro, and Lori Pierce to wire money for him. There was evidence that approximately $1.8 million was wired through Western Union during the course of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, Johnson pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, conspiring to launder money, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h), and possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Monteiro pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and conspiring to launder money, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard from Drug Enforcement Administration Agent John O'Donoghue, who was assigned to investigate the defendants' activities. He testified to several statements made to him during the course of his investigation that implicated the defendants and demonstrated that they were working together as part of a single conspiracy to distribute drugs and to launder the cash generated by their illicit enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After O'Donoghue's testimony, the district court announced its sentencing calculation for each defendant. Concerning Johnson, the court based the sentence on the money laundering conviction because it yielded the highest offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2 (2001). The base offense level for money laundering conducted in connection with drug offenses is defined as the base offense level for the underlying drug offenses. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(a)(1). The base offense level for Johnson's drug offenses was 26. The court added two levels because Johnson was convicted of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), and four more levels because Johnson led or organized a money laundering conspiracy which included at least five people, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court then subtracted three levels because Johnson accepted responsibility, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. Johnson's total offense level was 29 which, because of his category II criminal history, yielded a sentencing range between 97 and 121 months. Johnson moved for a downward departure based on his poor health and presentence rehabilitation. The court denied the motions and sentenced Johnson to 97 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court conducted a similar calculation for Monteiro. His sentence was also based on the money laundering conviction. Because the court attributed smaller amounts of marijuana to Monteiro than to Johnson, the base offense level was 24. The court then applied the same adjustments made to Johnson's offense level to arrive at a total offense level of 27. Because Monteiro had a category I criminal history, the sentencing range was 70 to 87 months' imprisonment. The court sentenced Monteiro to 70 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' primary contention is that the district court erred in applying the four-level role-in-the-offense enhancement. They also argue that they are entitled to resentencing under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). Additionally, Johnson challenges the district court's denial of his motions for a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Role-in-the-Offense Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants challenge the application of the role-in-the-offense enhancement on two grounds. First, they argue that the evidence was insufficient for the court to conclude that there was an overarching conspiracy to launder money involving five or more people. At most, they contend, the evidence showed that Monteiro and Johnson each led his own separate conspiracy, neither of which contained the five-person minimum. Second, they argue that, to the extent there was evidence of a single conspiracy, it came from the hearsay testimony of the agent who investigated the crime and therefore was unreliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The enhancement applies where the government demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \"the defendant was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a); <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744197\"><a href=\"/opinion/744197/united-states-v-ceferino-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc). The determination that a given set of facts justifies application of the enhancement is \"entitled to considerable deference and must stand unless clearly erroneous.\" <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200067\"><a href=\"/opinion/200067/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, the battle over the enhancement \"will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" <i>United States v. Santos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200851\"><a href=\"/opinion/200851/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 142 (1st Cir.2004). Whether a set of crimes can be attributed to one conspiracy is a question of fact, <i>see United States v. Glaum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200833\"><a href=\"/opinion/200833/united-states-v-glaum/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 176 (1st Cir.2004), <i>vacated on other grounds by</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></span> (2005), the resolution of which typically depends on evidence of common purpose, interdependence among the elements of the plan, and overlap among the participants, <i>see United States v. Portela,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761694\"><a href=\"/opinion/761694/united-states-v-rafael-portela-united-states-of-america-v-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 695 (1st Cir.1999). But these factors serve only as a guide; \"[n]o magic formula exists for determining when a set of jointly committed crimes adds up to an overarching conspiracy or enterprise.\" <i>United States v. Shea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768605\"><a href=\"/opinion/768605/united-states-v-anthony-m-shea-united-states-of-america-v-michael-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 665 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court heard testimony that the defendants were partners in a drug distribution ring, including testimony that Johnson introduced Monteiro as his \"drug associate[].\" The ring generated significant sums of cash which provided the defendants with a common motive to launder money. There also was substantial testimonial and documentary proof of overlap among conspiracy participants. Andre Turner not only received Western Union wires from Johnson, but also from Wooten and Baez (who were recruited by Monteiro). Spaulding was introduced to both Monteiro and Johnson and proceeded to wire approximately $75,000 on their behalf. And the record is replete with evidence of individuals recruited by each defendant wiring money to common recipients. The court was justified in concluding that this overlap in method and participants was not a coincidence, but rather evidence of an agreement between the defendants to launder the money that they obtained from their drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenge to the reliability of Agent O'Donoghue's testimony fares no better. The defendants claim that the district court could not rely on the agent's testimony because the government did not produce the declarants whose statements O'Donoghue relayed. But there is no obligation on the part of the government to produce the declarants so long as the court has a basis for measuring the reliability of the testifying officer. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Phaneuf,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196902\"><a href=\"/opinion/196902/united-states-v-phaneuf/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 261-62 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Rojo-Alvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568494\"><a href=\"/opinion/568494/united-states-v-alvaro-rojo-alvarez-united-states-v-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span>, 971 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates such a basis. Agent O'Donoghue's testimony was consistent with information in the presentence reports, which included summaries of interviews with the declarants. The district court also had before it documentary evidence, in the form of a summary of Western Union receipts, which showed the defendants and their associates wiring money to many of the same recipients. <i>See Phaneuf,</i> 91 F.3d at 261-62 (stating that reliability of hearsay at sentencing can be demonstrated by reference to other evidence in the case). Furthermore, the court did not adopt the agent's testimony wholesale; it declined to credit the statements of witnesses who may have had reason to depict the defendants in an unflattering light.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Downward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson contends that the district court erroneously concluded that it did not have the legal authority to depart downward based on his poor health and his presentence rehabilitation. The government counters that the court understood that it could depart on both of these grounds, but that it declined to do so as a matter of discretion. Therefore, the government argues we do not have jurisdiction to review Johnson's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a district court's discretionary denial of a departure is not appealable, <i>see United States v. Dewire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199682\"><a href=\"/opinion/199682/united-states-v-dewire/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 337 (1st Cir.2001), a refusal to depart based on a misunderstanding of the law is reviewed de novo, <i>see United States v. Romolo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563790\"><a href=\"/opinion/563790/united-states-v-christopher-j-romolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991). The line between discretionary and legal denials of downward departure requests has not always been clear. <i>See United States v. Saldana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197274\"><a href=\"/opinion/197274/united-states-v-saldana/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.1997). We explained the distinction in <i>United States v. Pierro</i>:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the judge sets differential factfinding and evaluative judgment to one side, and says, in effect, \"the circumstance of which you speak, <i>even if it exists,</i> does not constitute a legally sufficient basis for departure,\" then the correctness of that quintessentially <i>legal</i> determination may be tested on appeal. But if the judge says, in effect, either that \"this circumstance of which you speak has not been shown to exist in this case\" or, alternatively that \"while this circumstance of which you speak might exist and might constitute a legally cognizable basis for a departure in a theoretical sense, it does not render this particular case sufficiently unusual to warrant departing,\" then, in either such event, no appeal lies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 619 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this standard, the government's jurisdictional arguments achieve mixed results. With regard to the requested poor health departure, the court reasoned that Johnson would receive adequate health care in prison; it did not evince an understanding that it was legally constrained from granting a health-related departure. This, then, was a discretionary decision which we will not review. <i>See United States v. Teeter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requested presentence rehabilitation departure presents a different situation. The district court ruled that the \"degree of discretion\" afforded by the caselaw did not extend to the circumstances of this case. This is a legal ruling infected, Johnson contends, by the court's misunderstanding of the amount of discretion it possessed. We review this claim de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson presented the court with information that, after he learned about the investigation into his criminal conduct, \"he began . . . to earn a living through honest hard work as a carpenter.\" He also began to address his substance abuse problem by agreeing to remain in custody where he could participate in a drug rehabilitation program pending the resolution of the criminal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accurately perceived the narrow parameters within which it was empowered to grant a downward departure for presentence rehabilitation. <i>See United States v. Craven,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199260\"><a href=\"/opinion/199260/united-states-v-craven/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 99 (1st Cir.2001) (stating that \"downward departures for presentence rehabilitation are hen's-teeth rare\"). In <i>United States v. Rushby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563223\"><a href=\"/opinion/563223/united-states-v-john-rushby/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 42-43 (1991), we concluded that a defendant was not entitled to a downward departure for presentence rehabilitation based on proof that the defendant had enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program, was attending to his family responsibilities, and was holding gainful employment. Similarly, in <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 114 (1st Cir.1990), we set aside a downward departure grounded on presentence rehabilitation where the defendant entered a halfway house, remained substance-free, and found employment. The court was correct in concluding that these cases precluded a downward departure based on Johnson's procuring employment and beginning a drug treatment program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Booker</i> Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we consider the defendants' claim that they were entitled to resentencing under <i>Booker. See Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (declaring the Guidelines advisory in preserving their constitutionality). The defendants essentially recast their argument concerning the role-in-the-offense enhancement as a <i>Booker</i> claim. They argue that the district court's imposition of the role-in-the-offense enhancement was dubious because it was based on hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support this argument, the defendants invoke <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (2004) (holding that certain types of hearsay are not admissible at a criminal trial under the Confrontation Clause). They suggest that the logic of <i>Crawford</i> (which was decided after the district court imposed sentence) may encourage the court to rely less heavily on hearsay if given an opportunity to resentence. The defendants did not raise a <i>Booker</i> argument below, so our review is for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 76-77 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A prerequisite for this court to order resentencing based on an unpreserved <i>Booker</i> claim is a demonstration by the defendant that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence under the now advisory Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 75.

Besides <i>Crawford,</i> the defendants have not identified anything in the record from which we can conclude that the court shared the defendants' doubt about the appropriateness of the role-in-the-offense enhancement simply because the evidentiary basis for the enhancement was comprised of hearsay. We therefore have no basis for ordering a remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the defendants' sentences are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In applying the enhancement, the court acknowledged that there was some \"degree of decentralization,\" but concluded that there was credible evidence of \"an overarching agreement\" among five or more people to recruit others to launder money through wire transfers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Monteiro also argues that the district court's application of the role-in-the-offense enhancement was clearly wrong because the court's finding of a single conspiracy conflicted with its decision not to attribute to him all of the money laundered by the conspiracy. According to Monteiro, this shows that there was not a single money laundering conspiracy. We disagree. The court used the amount of money laundered in the conspiracy as a factor in estimating drug quantity. The district court indicated that it relied on a reduced amount of money laundered through the conspiracy to arrive at a conservative drug quantity estimate<i>See United States v. Marks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200982\"><a href=\"/opinion/200982/united-states-v-marks/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 105 (1st Cir.2004) (stating that in choosing between plausible estimates of drug quantity district courts are \"to err on the side of caution\"). It simply does not follow that the court's conservative drug quantity estimate (which benefitted Monteiro) necessarily precluded the court from finding a single conspiracy.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Monteiro contends that the court violated his due process rights by applying the role-in-the-offense enhancement to the money laundering conviction instead of the drug conviction. He claims prejudice because applying the enhancement to the drug conviction would have resulted in a lower total offense level. There is no merit to this argument. The district court must separately evaluate the defendant's leadership role for each count. <i>See United States v. Thiongo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200648\"><a href=\"/opinion/200648/united-states-v-thiongo/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 62 n. 5 (1st Cir.2003). As set forth above, the court's determination that Monteiro was an organizer or leader of the money laundering conspiracy was based on reliable evidence, and therefore it was appropriate for the court to apply the enhancement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The defendants argue that they had no obligation to object below to preserve their<i>Booker</i> claim because their claim \"involve[s] a constitutional principle that had not been previously recognized.\" We already have rejected this argument. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
