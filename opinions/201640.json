Plaintiff Tomás Céspedes-Rodríguez appeals\n\nfrom the entry of judgments as a matter of law in favor of\n\ndefendants    Víctor    Rivera    Hernandez    and    María    Rosa    Iturregui-\n\nGonzález on his claims that he was the victim of unlawful political\n\ndiscrimination, in violation of his First Amendment rights, and an\n\nunlawful termination from tenured public employment, in violation\n\nof his due process rights.          Our consideration of the briefs and\n\nrecord convinces us that there is little to add to the two\n\nthoughtful opinions issued by the district court in support of its\n\nrulings -- especially in view of the fact that the argument section\n\nin plaintiff's brief (which contains only a few of the citations to\n\nthe record required by Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)) largely fails\n\nto engage the court's reasoning.            Consequently, we affirm largely\n\non   the   basis   of   the   district   court's     opinions    and    keep   our\n\nadditional remarks brief.         See, e.g., Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch\n\nDev., Inc., 368 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            In July 1997, Céspedes, a member of Puerto Rico's New\n\nProgressive Party, assumed a trust position -- that of special aide\n\nin   charge   of   Management      Information       Systems    --    within   the\n\nVocational Rehabilitation Administration of Puerto Rico (\"VRA\").\n\nIn May 2000, Céspedes was granted a probationary (because an\n\nelection was fewer than six months away) \"transfer\" to the career\n\nposition of Executive Director IV, but the evidence shows that he\n\nretained his trust duties and, by special exception, his former\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\flevel of pay (which was almost double the pay of a typical\n\nExecutive Director IV).       This transfer was effectuated to protect\n\nCéspedes' employment in the event of a change in administrations\n\n-- an event which transpired in January 2001 after the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party won the November 2000 elections.\n\n           In January 2001, Rivera was appointed Puerto Rico's\n\nSecretary of Labor and Human Resources, and Iturregui was appointed\n\nadministrator of the VRA (which falls under the auspices of the\n\nDepartment of Labor and Human Resources).               On February 5, 2001,\n\nIturregui confirmed Céspedes' appointment to the Executive Director\n\nIV position, thus ending the probationary period.                  Thereafter,\n\nhowever, Céspedes' employment situation began to sour as he lost\n\nhis office, access to a company car, and his former job duties.\n\n(In September 2001, a new trust position of Director of Management\n\nInformation Services was created and awarded to one Ramón Burgos.\n\nCéspedes was made Burgos' Deputy Director -- at the same salary --\n\nbut Burgos assumed many of the job duties that Céspedes formerly\n\nperformed.)   Céspedes complained to the Personnel Administration\n\nSystem Appeal Board that he was the victim of unlawful political\n\ndiscrimination     and    sought   a   meeting   with    Iturregui,   but    his\n\ncomplaints went nowhere.       Céspedes felt ostracized at work and, in\n\nMarch 2002, began three months of sick leave for depression.\n\n           On October 24, 2002, Céspedes was suspended from his\n\nposition   after   a     general   personnel     records   audit   ordered    by\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fIturregui allegedly uncovered evidence that Céspedes had falsified\n\nhis resumé and had obtained his salary exception by dishonestly\n\nrepresenting that he had a private sector offer at a high salary.\n\nOn November 22, 2002, Céspedes received an informal hearing before\n\nan   attorney.     Céspedes   denied   the   allegations   and   submitted\n\nevidence that they were false but was dismissed anyway, on December\n\n5, 2002.     The present lawsuit followed, but judgments as a matter\n\nof law in favor of Rivera and Iturregui were entered by the\n\ndistrict court under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 after the plaintiff rested.\n\n             The district court concluded, and we agree, that Céspedes\n\nhad failed to meet his \"threshold burden to produce sufficient\n\ndirect or circumstantial evidence from which a rational jury could\n\nfind that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor behind the adverse employment action [complained of].\"\n\nRodriquez-Rios v. Cordero, 138 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 1998).         While\n\nthis standard is necessarily imprecise, and evidentiary sufficiency\n\nin close cases may reside in the eye of the beholder, the evidence\n\nCéspedes submitted (which we have summarized in a light most\n\nfavorable to him, see Guilloty Perez v. Pierluisi, 339 F.3d 43, 50\n\n(1st Cir. 2003)), is insufficient.\n\n           Céspedes makes much of the fact that the supposedly less\n\nqualified Burgos, who was a member of the Popular Democratic Party,\n\nwas assigned to assume the directorship duties that he formerly\n\nexercised.    But the record demonstrates that those duties were, in\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\ffact, trust duties which defendants were entitled to assign to a\n\npolitical confidante.    See Nieves-Luciano v. Hernández-Torres, 397\n\nF.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2005).      Céspedes also highlights the evidence\n\nthat his termination was based on trumped-up charges, but even if\n\nwe accept for the sake of argument that there is a trialworthy\n\nissue here, Céspedes still must show that the pretext masked\n\nunlawful political discrimination on the part of defendants (and\n\nnot the \"mere\" desire to rid themselves of a vociferously unhappy\n\nemployee). Cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S.\n\n133, 146-49 (2000) (pretext evidence in a Title VII case is\n\nsufficient only if the factfinder may infer that the pretext masks\n\ndiscrimination on the forbidden ground); Feliciano de la Cruz v. El\n\nConquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 6-9 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(similar).1 Thus, the pretext evidence, while certainly probative,\n\nchannels our inquiry back to the basic question whether there is\n\nenough evidence for the jury to have found that Céspedes was\n\nterminated because of his political affiliation.\n\n          We share the district court's conviction that the answer\n\nto this question is \"no.\"            No rational jury could find that\n\nCéspedes' political affiliation (rather than his reaction to the\n\nloss of   the   job   duties   and   perquisites   that   accompanied   his\n\n\n\n     1\n      In citing these cases, we do not imply that the McDonnell\nDouglas burden-shifting framework applicable to Title VII cases\napplies in the First Amendment political discrimination context.\nRather, we express no opinion on the issue.\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftransfer from a supervisory trust position to a less prestigious\n\nand demanding career position) was the real reason for the charges\n\nagainst him.         At most, the evidence tended to show only that\n\nCéspedes was dismissed unfairly by people who knew him to be of a\n\ndifferent political affiliation than themselves more than a year\n\nand a half after they took power.         For the reasons set forth by the\n\ndistrict court, this is not enough.\n\n              Two final arguments advanced by Céspedes warrant only\n\nbrief responses.       First, Céspedes contends that the district court\n\nerroneously prevented him from introducing additional probative\n\nevidence of discrimination in the form of a letter his father wrote\n\ncomplaining about political discrimination at the VRA, and formal\n\ncomplaints of discrimination filed before various tribunals by\n\nCéspedes and other VRA employees.           Such evidentiary determinations\n\nare reviewed only for an abuse of discretion, see, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Mercado Irizarry, 404 F.3d 497, 500 (1st Cir. 2005), and\n\nthe court here reasonably concluded that this evidence, some of\n\nwhich was hearsay, only tended to establish the authors' beliefs\n\nand   could    not   substitute    for    actual   evidence     of    the   events\n\ndescribed and the reasons those events occurred.              Second, Céspedes\n\ncontends      that   the   jury   could   have   found   that   his    dismissal\n\nconstituted      a   substantive    due     process   violation.        But    the\n\nsubstantive due process doctrine is reserved for truly outrageous\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fgovernment conduct, see, e.g., Rivera v. Rhode Island, 402 F.3d 27,\n\n36 (1st Cir. 2005), and this case does not merit that description.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",
