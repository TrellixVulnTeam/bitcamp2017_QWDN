See Rule 50(b), F.R.C.P., 28 U.S.C.A.  The jury brought in a verdict of $25,000 in favor of the plaintiff on the complaint, and a verdict for $8,489.95, with interest, in favor of the defendant on its counterclaims.  Thereafter the district court allowed a motion by defendant for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the plaintiff's claim, and allowed a motion by defendant for judgment pursuant to the verdict in respect of its counterclaims.  A judgment was entered accordingly.  Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from that part of the final judgment which was based upon the allowance of defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  Thus the judgment in favor of the defendant on its counterclaims is not now before us for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as we can perceive, the case presents no substantial issues of law; and we are of the opinion that on the facts the district court committed no error in granting judgment for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are quite lengthy and complex, but for present purposes we may curtail somewhat the factual statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the case has been presented to us, it is necessary to consider only the cause of action set out in the first paragraph of Count 5 of the complaint, alleging as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Count 5-- The plaintiff says that on or about March 16, 1948 the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an agreement, evidenced by writings, signed by both parties, under the terms of which the defendant agreed to manufacture and deliver to the plaintiff 5,000 lamp shades which would be of merchantable quality, reasonably fit for a purpose intended and made known to the defendant, and free from any defects rendering them unmerchantable, which defects would not be apparent on reasonable examination; that the defendant did fail to manufacture and deliver such lamp shades in accordance with its agreement, all to the damage of the plaintiff.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the plaintiff Egyptian Chemical Co. was a manufacturer of embalming fluid and funeral supplies.  Some time in 1947 plaintiff's president, Herman A. Snider, conceived the idea of selling plastic lamp shades to the funeral trade in place of the conventional glass shades.  This idea represented an experiment, since hitherto no such plastic shades had been put on the market or manufactured.  Snider was well aware of the problem of manufacturing a shade made of thermoplastic material, in that the continual application of high temperatures to the plastic material would affect it in such a way as to render it useless for lamp shades of the usual type.  He discussed the idea of a plastic shade with a patent attorney as early as June, 1947.  At about the same time he also discussed the idea with Mr. Jack Beaty, who later became the plaintiff's chief salesman.  In December, 1947, Snider and Beaty consulted a representative of the duPont Company, who suggested the use of duPont nylon, and recommended the defendant, a custom molder of plastics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, Snider got in contact with Mr. Clifford A. McBride, defendant's president, and after certain preliminary negotiations an agreement was reached between the plaintiff and defendant which was the basis of the plaintiff's cause of action stated in Count 5 of the complaint.  Even before this agreement was reached, however, Snider had taken steps to advertise to the trade these proposed plastic shades and to hire additional employees in connection with a selling campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement referred to in Count 5 was evidenced by a writing by the defendant dated March 15, 1948, and by plaintiff's reply thereto dated the next day.  Defendant's letter of March 15, 1948, was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Egyptian Chemical Company, '173 Milk Street, Boston 9, Mass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Attention Mr. Herman A.

He also suggests to you that the inside of the nylon shade be fluted so that the cone you propose to set against the walls of the interior thereof will have air vents running up to the edge of the cone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Naturally, we hope that work on this item can be expedited so that we may receive the shades in the shortest possible period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Very truly yours, 'Egyptian Chemical Company.'  'Herman A. Snider</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did Snider give defendant that check for $6,000 covering the cost of making the mold, as per the agreement, but in addition, on May 3, 1948, he gave defendant a check for $14,000, representing advance payment of one half the dollar amount of $5,000 nylon shades of neutral color at $5.60 per shade-- also in compliance with the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 8, 1948, Snider applied for a patent on a plastic lamp shade with a circulating air passage.  In his patent application Snider explained that, to avoid deterioration of the plastic material by the application of heat, a metal floor or coil was provided to deflect the heat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 15, 1948, defendant submitted samples to Snider in accordance with the agreement.  These samples had metallic foils adhesively attached to the inner part of the shade, as in the design in Snider's original patent application.  It is clear that Snider never approved these samples.  He was much disappointed that tests of the samples disclosed evidence of discoloration from heat.  Some more effective means of deflecting the heat from the nylon was needed.  It then occurred to Snider to use a detached reflector affixed to the shade by bosses, and the design for such detached reflector was incorporated by amendment in his original patent application.  Certain changes in the mold were thereby made necessary, and Snider authorized the defendant to make such changes.  Even before the receipt of the foregoing samples, plaintiff had put out to the trade an advertising brochure asserting that the forthcoming shade is 'an Egyptian Exclusive, developed in Egyptian's own research laboratories, under the direction of Mr. Jack O. Beaty.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, by November 1, 1948, plaintiff had abandoned the project of producing and selling a nylon shade, for the use of nylon was concluded to be 'out of the question.'  Discussion was had with defendant on the substitution of cellulose acetate.  The use of this different plastic material, plus the decision to place a detached reflector on the shade by use of molded bosses, necessitated the return of the mold to the manufacturer for structural changes, which changes were made some time before December, 1948.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But on December 4, 1948, which was after Snider had abandoned as impracticable the project for nylon shades, Snider demanded of defendant the return of the check for $6,000 for the mold and the check for $14,000 given as advance payment on the nylon shades.  Defendant complied, and returned both these checks to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During January, 1949, defendant manufactured and delivered to the plaintiff 822 shades made of cellulose acetate.  Inspection was made by plaintiff's foreman, and these shades were promptly sent on to plaintiff's customers who had ordered nylon shades.  Most of the 822 shades were returned to Snider with the complaint of breakage around the neck.  Snider made no claim that this breakage was due to any breach of contract by defendant, but brought suit against the transporting carrier charging negligence by the carrier as the cause of the breakage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though no agreement had been reached between the parties as to the price or terms of payment for the acetate shades, defendant later billed the plaintiff for the 822 shades at $5.00 per shade, or a total of $4,110.  As of April 12, 1949, plaintiff's indebtedness to the defendant stood in the sum of $11,487.38, composed of this item of $4,110, plus $6,000 as the cost of the mold, plus an additional amount of $1,166.69 covering authorized structural changes in the mold, plus two or three minor items.  On that day plaintiff paid defendant $5,000, reducing this indebtedness to $6,487.38.  After a conference on May 10, 1949, Snider gave defendant a promissory note for.$5,487.38 (the amount of the indebtedness less an agreed credit of $1,000).  This note was payable in installments, with an acceleration clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, plaintiff ordered 1,000 acetate shades at $4.00 per shade.  On May 17, 1949, defendant accepted this order from the plaintiff 'for molded Plastic Lampshades to be molded from Celanese Acetate XF H5 which you have approved' and stated that the acceptance was on the basis of agreed terms, as follows: 'Prior to shipment being made you are to come here with signed trade acceptances executed by authorized officers of Egyptian Chemical Company and payable in thirty (30) days.'  Pursuant thereto, plaintiff on May 20, 1949, submitted its trade acceptance in the sum of $4,000, due June 19, 1949.  The 1,000 shades were promptly manufactured and delivered to plaintiff.  Snider tested some of them and claims to have found that they had an odor and discoloration from the heat.  Nevertheless he dispatched the shades to plaintiff's customers.  Some of such shades were returned by the customers showing a charred condition around the neck.  But plaintiff paid its trade acceptance of May 20, 1949, when due, without complaint or protest to defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1949, Snider ordered another batch of 1,000 acetate shades, and on July 25, 1949, executed a trade acceptance therefor in the amount of $4,000, maturing one month later.  Defendant manufactured and delivered the 1,000 shades during July, but at the date of maturity plaintiff defaulted in payment of the trade acceptance.  At this time plaintiff had also defaulted on the second installment on its promissory note of May 10, 1949, leaving a balance due thereon of $4,487.38.  These two defaults were the basis of defendant's counterclaims in this case, on which defendant has obtained a verdict and judgment for the full amount claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is manifest that the agreement between the parties evidenced by the letters of March 15 and March 16, 1948, above set forth, contained no express warranties by the defendant.  Also, from the circumstances above related, it is manifest that we could not, as a matter of law, imply on the defendant's part a warranty of merchantability of the nylon shades or a warranty of fitness for the expected use by the buyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, too, we think it is clear that the respective obligations of the parties to the agreement of March 16, 1948, were rescinded by mutual consent when Snider made known to the defendant his conclusion that the use of nylon was impracticable and on behalf of his company demanded and received back the advance payments which the plaintiff had made on account of the executory contract.  The facts will not sustain an interpretation that the original agreement was merely modified by the substitution of 5,000 shades of cellulose acetate for 5,000 shades of nylon plastic, leaving the other terms of the agreement intact.  This is because at the time the parties agreed to try out cellulose acetate they came to no understanding as to the price of the acetate shades, which everyone assumed would be somewhat cheaper; and for lack of definiteness in this respect there could be no enforceable obligation on the defendant's part to manufacture 5,000 acetate shades.  At the conference of May 10, 1949, agreement was reached for the manufacture of 1,000 acetate shades in consideration of a trade acceptance in the sum of $4,000.  In June of 1949 another order for 1,000 acetate shades was given on the same terms.  In other words, after the rescission of the original agreement for nylon shades, the parties evidently proceeded on an order-by-order basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover the plaintiff, having accepted the shipment of 822 acetate shades and the two subsequent shipments of 1,000 acetate shades each, without making reasonably prompt complaint to the defendant of any defects claimed to constitute a breach on the defendant's part, cannot now complain of any breach by the defendant with respect to the 2,822 shades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And even if by modification of the original contract the defendant had assumed an obligation to manufacture and deliver a total of 5,000 acetate shades, the plaintiff would be in no position to enforce a claim for the nondelivery of the remaining 2,178 acetate shades because of the plaintiff's own material breaches of contract, as established, indeed, by the verdict and judgment for defendant on its counterclaims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Thus the judgment in favor of the defendant on its counterclaims is not now before us for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as we can perceive, the case presents no substantial issues of law; and we are of the opinion that on the facts the district court committed no error in granting judgment for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are quite lengthy and complex, but for present purposes we may curtail somewhat the factual statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the case has been presented to us, it is necessary to consider only the cause of action set out in the first paragraph of Count 5 of the complaint, alleging as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Count 5-- The plaintiff says that on or about March 16, 1948 the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an agreement, evidenced by writings, signed by both parties, under the terms of which the defendant agreed to manufacture and deliver to the plaintiff 5,000 lamp shades which would be of merchantable quality, reasonably fit for a purpose intended and made known to the defendant, and free from any defects rendering them unmerchantable, which defects would not be apparent on reasonable examination; that the defendant did fail to manufacture and deliver such lamp shades in accordance with its agreement, all to the damage of the plaintiff.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the plaintiff Egyptian Chemical Co. was a manufacturer of embalming fluid and funeral supplies.  Some time in 1947 plaintiff's president, Herman A. Snider, conceived the idea of selling plastic lamp shades to the funeral trade in place of the conventional glass shades.  This idea represented an experiment, since hitherto no such plastic shades had been put on the market or manufactured.  Snider was well aware of the problem of manufacturing a shade made of thermoplastic material, in that the continual application of high temperatures to the plastic material would affect it in such a way as to render it useless for lamp shades of the usual type.  He discussed the idea of a plastic shade with a patent attorney as early as June, 1947.  At about the same time he also discussed the idea with Mr. Jack Beaty, who later became the plaintiff's chief salesman.  In December, 1947, Snider and Beaty consulted a representative of the duPont Company, who suggested the use of duPont nylon, and recommended the defendant, a custom molder of plastics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, Snider got in contact with Mr. Clifford A. McBride, defendant's president, and after certain preliminary negotiations an agreement was reached between the plaintiff and defendant which was the basis of the plaintiff's cause of action stated in Count 5 of the complaint.  Even before this agreement was reached, however, Snider had taken steps to advertise to the trade these proposed plastic shades and to hire additional employees in connection with a selling campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement referred to in Count 5 was evidenced by a writing by the defendant dated March 15, 1948, and by plaintiff's reply thereto dated the next day.  Defendant's letter of March 15, 1948, was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Egyptian Chemical Company, '173 Milk Street, Boston 9, Mass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Attention Mr. Herman A.

'Herman A. Snider</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did Snider give defendant that check for $6,000 covering the cost of making the mold, as per the agreement, but in addition, on May 3, 1948, he gave defendant a check for $14,000, representing advance payment of one half the dollar amount of $5,000 nylon shades of neutral color at $5.60 per shade-- also in compliance with the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 8, 1948, Snider applied for a patent on a plastic lamp shade with a circulating air passage.  In his patent application Snider explained that, to avoid deterioration of the plastic material by the application of heat, a metal floor or coil was provided to deflect the heat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 15, 1948, defendant submitted samples to Snider in accordance with the agreement.  These samples had metallic foils adhesively attached to the inner part of the shade, as in the design in Snider's original patent application.  It is clear that Snider never approved these samples.  He was much disappointed that tests of the samples disclosed evidence of discoloration from heat.  Some more effective means of deflecting the heat from the nylon was needed.  It then occurred to Snider to use a detached reflector affixed to the shade by bosses, and the design for such detached reflector was incorporated by amendment in his original patent application.  Certain changes in the mold were thereby made necessary, and Snider authorized the defendant to make such changes.  Even before the receipt of the foregoing samples, plaintiff had put out to the trade an advertising brochure asserting that the forthcoming shade is 'an Egyptian Exclusive, developed in Egyptian's own research laboratories, under the direction of Mr. Jack O. Beaty.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, by November 1, 1948, plaintiff had abandoned the project of producing and selling a nylon shade, for the use of nylon was concluded to be 'out of the question.'  Discussion was had with defendant on the substitution of cellulose acetate.  The use of this different plastic material, plus the decision to place a detached reflector on the shade by use of molded bosses, necessitated the return of the mold to the manufacturer for structural changes, which changes were made some time before December, 1948.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But on December 4, 1948, which was after Snider had abandoned as impracticable the project for nylon shades, Snider demanded of defendant the return of the check for $6,000 for the mold and the check for $14,000 given as advance payment on the nylon shades.  Defendant complied, and returned both these checks to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During January, 1949, defendant manufactured and delivered to the plaintiff 822 shades made of cellulose acetate.  Inspection was made by plaintiff's foreman, and these shades were promptly sent on to plaintiff's customers who had ordered nylon shades.  Most of the 822 shades were returned to Snider with the complaint of breakage around the neck.  Snider made no claim that this breakage was due to any breach of contract by defendant, but brought suit against the transporting carrier charging negligence by the carrier as the cause of the breakage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though no agreement had been reached between the parties as to the price or terms of payment for the acetate shades, defendant later billed the plaintiff for the 822 shades at $5.00 per shade, or a total of $4,110.  As of April 12, 1949, plaintiff's indebtedness to the defendant stood in the sum of $11,487.38, composed of this item of $4,110, plus $6,000 as the cost of the mold, plus an additional amount of $1,166.69 covering authorized structural changes in the mold, plus two or three minor items.  On that day plaintiff paid defendant $5,000, reducing this indebtedness to $6,487.38.  After a conference on May 10, 1949, Snider gave defendant a promissory note for.$5,487.38 (the amount of the indebtedness less an agreed credit of $1,000).  This note was payable in installments, with an acceleration clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, plaintiff ordered 1,000 acetate shades at $4.00 per shade.  On May 17, 1949, defendant accepted this order from the plaintiff 'for molded Plastic Lampshades to be molded from Celanese Acetate XF H5 which you have approved' and stated that the acceptance was on the basis of agreed terms, as follows: 'Prior to shipment being made you are to come here with signed trade acceptances executed by authorized officers of Egyptian Chemical Company and payable in thirty (30) days.'  Pursuant thereto, plaintiff on May 20, 1949, submitted its trade acceptance in the sum of $4,000, due June 19, 1949.  The 1,000 shades were promptly manufactured and delivered to plaintiff.  Snider tested some of them and claims to have found that they had an odor and discoloration from the heat.  Nevertheless he dispatched the shades to plaintiff's customers.  Some of such shades were returned by the customers showing a charred condition around the neck.  But plaintiff paid its trade acceptance of May 20, 1949, when due, without complaint or protest to defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1949, Snider ordered another batch of 1,000 acetate shades, and on July 25, 1949, executed a trade acceptance therefor in the amount of $4,000, maturing one month later.  Defendant manufactured and delivered the 1,000 shades during July, but at the date of maturity plaintiff defaulted in payment of the trade acceptance.  At this time plaintiff had also defaulted on the second installment on its promissory note of May 10, 1949, leaving a balance due thereon of $4,487.38.  These two defaults were the basis of defendant's counterclaims in this case, on which defendant has obtained a verdict and judgment for the full amount claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is manifest that the agreement between the parties evidenced by the letters of March 15 and March 16, 1948, above set forth, contained no express warranties by the defendant.  Also, from the circumstances above related, it is manifest that we could not, as a matter of law, imply on the defendant's part a warranty of merchantability of the nylon shades or a warranty of fitness for the expected use by the buyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, too, we think it is clear that the respective obligations of the parties to the agreement of March 16, 1948, were rescinded by mutual consent when Snider made known to the defendant his conclusion that the use of nylon was impracticable and on behalf of his company demanded and received back the advance payments which the plaintiff had made on account of the executory contract.  The facts will not sustain an interpretation that the original agreement was merely modified by the substitution of 5,000 shades of cellulose acetate for 5,000 shades of nylon plastic, leaving the other terms of the agreement intact.  This is because at the time the parties agreed to try out cellulose acetate they came to no understanding as to the price of the acetate shades, which everyone assumed would be somewhat cheaper; and for lack of definiteness in this respect there could be no enforceable obligation on the defendant's part to manufacture 5,000 acetate shades.  At the conference of May 10, 1949, agreement was reached for the manufacture of 1,000 acetate shades in consideration of a trade acceptance in the sum of $4,000.  In June of 1949 another order for 1,000 acetate shades was given on the same terms.  In other words, after the rescission of the original agreement for nylon shades, the parties evidently proceeded on an order-by-order basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover the plaintiff, having accepted the shipment of 822 acetate shades and the two subsequent shipments of 1,000 acetate shades each, without making reasonably prompt complaint to the defendant of any defects claimed to constitute a breach on the defendant's part, cannot now complain of any breach by the defendant with respect to the 2,822 shades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And even if by modification of the original contract the defendant had assumed an obligation to manufacture and deliver a total of 5,000 acetate shades, the plaintiff would be in no position to enforce a claim for the nondelivery of the remaining 2,178 acetate shades because of the plaintiff's own material breaches of contract, as established, indeed, by the verdict and judgment for defendant on its counterclaims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
