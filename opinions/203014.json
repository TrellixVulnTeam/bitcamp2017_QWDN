On October 11, 2002, Ernest Edwards\n\nsuffered injuries during a hunting excursion when a safety harness\n\nsecuring him to a tree malfunctioned, causing him to fall seventeen\n\nfeet to the ground.     On July 9, 2004, Edwards filed suit in the\n\nfederal district court in Maine against the safety harness's\n\nmanufacturer,   Game   Tracker,   Inc.      (Edwards'    wife      was   also   a\n\nplaintiff in the action but nothing turns on her participation.)\n\nOn February 8, 2006, Edwards obtained a $1,964,931.23 default\n\njudgment   against   Game   Tracker,     which   by   then   had    filed   for\n\nbankruptcy protection.\n\n           Unable to execute on the judgment against Game Tracker,\n\nEdwards (and his wife) sued in the same federal court under Maine's\n\nreach and apply statute, 24-A M.R.S.A. ยง 2904 (2000), seeking to\n\ncollect from Lexington Insurance Company, Game Tracker's insurer.1\n\nLexington had previously received notice of Edwards' suit against\n\nGame Tracker and had disclaimed coverage under all three policies\n\nthat Lexington had issued to Game Tracker and its affiliates.\n\n           In due course, Lexington moved for summary judgment,\n\nwhich the district court granted, finding that none of the three\n\npolicies at issue covered Edwards' claim against Game Tracker: a\n\n\n\n     1\n      Maine's reach and apply statute allows an injured party who\nhas obtained a final judgment against an insured tortfeasor to\ninstitute a separate civil action against the insurer to satisfy\nthe judgment if, among other things, the tortfeasor \"was insured\nagainst such liability.\" 24-A M.R.S.A. ยง 2904; see also Ashe v.\nEnterprise Rent-a-Car, 838 A.2d 1157, 1162 (Me. 2003).\n\n                                   -2-\n\f\"claims-made policy\"2 because Edwards had failed to provide notice\n\nof the claim to Game Tracker or Lexington within the required\n\nperiod; an \"occurrence policy\" because the policy contained an\n\nendorsement      excluding   injuries        caused    by   safety     belts   and\n\nharnesses; and a third policy both because notice was not timely\n\nmade and because the insured was Gorilla, Inc., not Game Tracker.\n\nEdwards now appeals the rulings as to the first two policies.\n\n           We review a district court's entry of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party and indulging reasonable inferences in his favor.\n\nIverson v. City Of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006).                    The\n\nmoving   party    is   entitled   to   summary        judgment    if   the   record\n\ndemonstrates \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986).\n\n           Claims-Made Policy--Policy #6478065. Edwards first seeks\n\nsatisfaction of the judgment against Game Tracker under a claims-\n\nmade policy issued by Lexington to Game Tracker.                 The policy would\n\n\n     2\n      \"Claims-made\" policies cover claims arising out of incidents\nthat occurred during or prior to the policy period, depending on\nthe terms of the policy, but only if a claim is made during the\npolicy period. With claims-made policies, the insured event is the\nclaim.   By contrast, \"occurrence policies\" cover insured events\nthat occur during the policy period. With occurrence policies, the\ninsured event is the occurrence, not the claim. See DiLuglio v.\nNew Eng. Ins. Co., 959 F.2d 355, 358 (1st Cir. 1992); 7 Russ &\nSegalla, Couch on Insurance ยง 102:20 (3d ed. 1997 & Supp. 2007).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fhave covered an incident such as the one suffered by Edwards, but\n\nonly if notice of a claim was provided to either Game Tracker or\n\nLexington during the claim period, which ran from April 2002 to\n\nJune 2003.\n\n          During discovery, Lexington sought proof that Edwards had\n\nprovided notice within the claim period.          Although asked the\n\nquestion three different ways, Edwards could not state that he had\n\nprovided notice to Game Tracker, its affiliates, or Lexington\n\nduring the notice period. Instead, he said that attempts to locate\n\nand contact Game Tracker were made in the winter of 2003, that his\n\nattorney at some unspecified point had telephone conversations with\n\none or more Game Tracker representatives, and that formal notice\n\nwas provided to Game Tracker in January 2004--after the required\n\ncut-off date.\n\n          Based   on   Edwards'    failure   to    provide   evidence\n\nestablishing timely notice--evidence that one would expect to be\n\navailable to a plaintiff or his attorney if timely notice was\n\ngiven--the district court found that there was no genuine dispute\n\nof material fact and that for lack of timely notice, the claims-\n\nmade insurance policy did not cover Edwards' claim.     Edwards does\n\nnot now argue that notice was timely provided but instead offers\n\nreasons why the policy's unambiguous notice requirement should not\n\npreclude coverage.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f             Edwards first argues that Lexington breached its duty to\n\ndefend     Game   Tracker   in   Edwards'   initial    action   against   Game\n\nTracker.     On this premise, he argues that Lexington is estopped\n\nfrom disclaiming coverage now; alternatively, Edwards says that\n\nunder Maine law Lexington at least bore the burden of proving non-\n\ncoverage as a result of that earlier alleged dereliction in failing\n\nto provide a defense.\n\n             Edwards was not a party to the insurance contract, or a\n\nthird party beneficiary, or the insured's assignee.             Maine's reach\n\nand apply statute places Edwards in Game Tracker's shoes to the\n\nextent he seeks whatever indemnification might have been owed to\n\nGame Tracker under its insurance policies.            Less clear is Edwards'\n\nability to claim benefits or advantage based on other contractual\n\nduties owed by the insurer to the insured, such as the duty to\n\ndefend.3\n\n             Indeed, the extent to which an injured third party steps\n\ninto the shoes of the insured when proceeding against the insurer\n\nis a question that arises in diverse contexts, affecting the claims\n\navailable to the injured party and the defenses available to the\n\n\n     3\n      Compare Smith v. Allstate Ins. Co., 483 A.2d 344, 346 (Me.\n1984) (injured third party \"has no judicially protectible interest\nin whether [the insurer] or independent counsel secured by\n[insured] provides [the insured's] defense in [a] negligence action\nagainst him\"), with Restatement (Second) of Judgments ยง 57, cmt. g\n(1982) (\"When allowed to proceed directly against the indemnitor,\nthe injured party does so by subrogation and has the benefit of the\nsame rules of preclusion and estoppel as the indemnitee would\nhave.\").\n\n                                      -5-\n\finsurer.         Case law varies among the states.4                The answer may also\n\nvary       depending    on   the     nature    of    the    insurance      contract,    the\n\nlanguage of the statute under which the injured third party is\n\nproceeding, and the balancing of competing policy concerns.\n\n                 The Maine SJC has not yet clearly determined whether an\n\ninjured third party may generally seek the collateral benefits of\n\na breach of the duty to defend which would otherwise belong to the\n\ninsured.         Compare Elliott v. Hanover Ins. Co., 711 A.2d 1310, 1311\n\n(Me. 1998) (allowing claim by an injured third party who was an\n\nassignee of the insured), with Smith v. Allstate Ins. Co., 483 A.2d\n\n344,       346   (Me.   1984)   (injured       third       party   \"has    no    judicially\n\nprotectible        interest     in    whether       [the    insurer]      or    independent\n\ncounsel secured by [insured] provides [the insured's] defense in\n\n[a] negligence action against him\").\n\n                 However,    Edwards'     estoppel          argument      was     expressly\n\nrejected in Elliott, which said that \"[a]n insurer that breaches\n\nits duty to defend . . . is not estopped from asserting noncoverage\n\nas a defense in a subsequent action brought by the insured or the\n\n\n\n       4\n      Compare, as to an insurer's bad faith refusals to settle,\nThompson v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. of New York, 250 So. 2d 259,\n264 (Fla. 1971), with Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Cos.,\n758 P.2d 58, 68 (Cal. 1988); see also Right of Injured Person\nRecovering Excess Judgment Against Insured to Maintain Action\nAgainst Liability Insurer for Wrongful Failure to Settle Claim, 63\nA.L.R.3d 677 (1975); and compare, as to insurer's use of a defense\nlike non-cooperation when sued by injured party, Peters v.\nSaulinier, 222 N.E.2d 871, 874 (Mass. 1967), with Michaud v. Mut.\nFire, Marine & Inland Ins. Co., 505 A.2d 786, 788-89 (Me. 1986).\n\n                                              -6-\n\finsured's assignee.\"   711 A.2d at 1313; see also Bucci v. Essex\n\nIns. Co., 393 F.3d 285, 295 (1st Cir. 2005).    Elliott does say that\n\nan insurer that breached its duty to defend may be bound in an\n\nindemnity action by \"any factual issues that might have been\n\nlitigated in the underlying negligence action,\" 711 A.2d at 1314,\n\nbut here the timing of the claim was not among the facts necessary\n\nto prove the insured's liability.      See Bucci, 393 F.3d at 296.\n\n           Nor has Edwards established that the duty to defend was\n\nbreached, which under Maine law might have triggered a shift in the\n\nburden of proof as to coverage for the purpose of indemnification.\n\nElliott, 711 A.2d at 1313-14.    The problem for Edwards is that in\n\norder to shift the burden of proof with regard to indemnification,\n\nhe first had to show that there was a breach of the duty to defend.\n\nAnd to do so, he had to prove that a claim was timely made;\n\notherwise, there was neither a duty to defend nor to indemnify the\n\ninsured.\n\n           The evidence as to notice is clearly inadequate to prove\n\ntimely notice was given.        Lexington, in an affidavit and in\n\nresponse to an interrogatory from Edwards, said that it did not\n\nreceive notice of Edwards' claim from Edwards, Game Tracker, or\n\nanyone else, until July 9, 2004, over a year after the expiration\n\nof the claim period.   And, as already explained, Edwards offered\n\nevidence only that \"'formal written' Notice of Claim,\" was provided\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fto Game Tracker in January of 2004, that is, after the close of the\n\nclaim period.\n\n          Edwards counters with the \"eight corners rule,\" according\n\nto which the duty to defend is determined \"by comparing the\n\nallegations in the underlying complaint with the provisions of the\n\ninsurance policy.    If a complaint reveals a potential . . . that\n\nthe facts ultimately proved may come within the coverage, a duty to\n\ndefend exists.โ5    Edwards argues that therefore the district court\n\nshould have compared the complaint in the underlying action with\n\nthe insurance policy to determine whether there was a duty to\n\ndefend, and that the district court erred in considering extrinsic\n\nevidence relating to notice.\n\n          Grounded in policy considerations, the so-called \"eight\n\ncorners rule\" is appropriately invoked in the context of occurrence\n\npolicies because the complaint in describing the incident will\n\nusually provide adequate information to determine whether--at least\n\nas alleged--the incident is within the scope of the insurance\n\npolicy. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Graham, 473 F.3d 596, 599-600\n\n(5th Cir. 2006).    However, the rule cannot be rigidly applied in\n\nthe context of claims-made policies where the determinative event\n\nis the timing of the claim, a fact that likely will be--and in this\n\n\n\n     5\n      Me. State Acad. of Hair Design, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins.\nCo., 699 A.2d 1153, 1156 (Me. 1997) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted) (alteration in original); see also Anderson v.\nVa. Sur. Co., 985 F. Supp. 182, 188 (D. Me. 1998).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcase was--irrelevant to the merits of the underlying tort suit, and\n\ntherefore absent from the pleadings.6   The district court thus did\n\nnot err in finding that Edwards failed to show a wrongful refusal\n\nto defend, given that the uncontradicted evidence established that\n\ntheir claim was not timely made.\n\n          Turning to the insurance contract itself, Edwards argues\n\nthat the claims-made policy is ambiguous.   He does not say that the\n\nlanguage of the policy is ambiguous; in fact, the policy states in\n\ncapital letters, \"CLAIMS-MADE POLICY.       READ THE ENTIRE POLICY\n\nCAREFULLY\" and \"CLAIMS-MADE COVERAGE.   PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE FORM\n\nCAREFULLY.\"   Further, the policy states clearly: \"This insurance\n\napplies to 'bodily injury' and 'property damage' only if . . . [a]\n\nclaim for damages . . . is first made against any insured . . .\n\nduring the policy period or any Extended Reporting Period.\"      In\n\nthis case the policy did extend the reporting period for 60 days\n\nbut only until June 2003.\n\n          Instead Edwards argues that because the policy did not\n\nprovide retroactive coverage--i.e., coverage for incidents that\n\noccurred before the policy effective date, notice of which was\n\nreceived during the policy period--as is fairly standard with\n\n\n     6\n      See Patrons Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Garcia, 707 A.2d 384, 386\n(Me. 1998) (noting exception to \"eight corners\" rule where insurer\ndenies duty to defend based on lack of timely notice); see also\nHasbrouck v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 511 N.W.2d 364 (Iowa\n1993) (upholding grant of summary judgment to insurer based on\nevidence outside the scope of the pleadings where coverage was\ndenied based on tardy notice under a claims-made policy).\n\n                               -9-\n\fclaims-made policies, the policy is unclear as to whether it is a\n\nclaims-made policy or an occurrence policy.                But a claims-made\n\ninsurance policy is not rendered ambiguous simply because it does\n\nnot resemble all policies in its class; and Edwards has not\n\nidentified any language in the policy that would muddy the claims-\n\nmade requirement just quoted.         See Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St.\n\nPaul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 267 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Edwards'      ambiguity   argument   blends    into   his   further\n\ncontention that Game Tracker's claims-made policy offended public\n\npolicy    by   offering     neither    the   prospective    benefits      of    an\n\noccurrence policy nor the retrospective benefits of a standard\n\nclaims-made policy.        This in turn might be best understood as an\n\nargument that the terms of the policy were unconscionable.                     See\n\nTruck Ins. Exch. v. Ashland Oil, Inc., 951 F.2d 787, 789-90 (7th\n\nCir. 1992).\n\n            Specifically, Edwards relies on Sparks v. St. Paul Ins.\n\nCo., 495 A.2d 406 (N.J. 1985), a case in which the New Jersey\n\nSupreme   Court    held    that   a   claims-made   professional    liability\n\ninsurance policy that \"affords no retroactive coverage whatsoever\n\nduring its initial year of issuance\" was void as against public\n\npolicy.    Id. at 415.       But even the Sparks court recognized that\n\n\"'[c]laims made' policies with no retroactive coverage might be\n\nappropriate in certain contexts.              For example . . . to the\n\nprofessional      who   changes   from   'occurrence'      to   'claims    made'\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fprotection.\"   Id. at 415 n.4.    As Judge Posner explained in Ashland\n\nOil,\n\n       [I]t is commonplace for issuers of claims-made policies\n       to limit retroactive coverage by specifying a cut-off\n       date, such as the date of the first claims-made policy\n       issued by the insurer to this insured, so that claims\n       based on occurrences before that date are excluded from\n       coverage.   For protection against old occurrences the\n       insured must look to his occurrence policies.\n\n951 F.2d at 790 (citation omitted).\n\n            That is just what happened here.          Game Tracker had\n\npurchased occurrence policies at least as early as April 1998. Any\n\nliability deriving from incidents that occurred during the four\n\nyears prior to the adoption of the claims-made policy would have\n\nbeen covered under the earlier occurrence policies.             There was\n\nsimply no reason for the claims-made policy to afford retroactive\n\ncoverage for incidents that were already covered by existing\n\noccurrence policies.\n\n            Finally,   Edwards   argues   that   Lexington    exacted   \"an\n\noutrageously high premium, and outrageously high self insured\n\nretention limit\" given the narrow scope of coverage.           Edwards has\n\nprovided no data to show that the premium and self-insurance\n\nretention rates were in fact \"outrageously high.\"            More broadly,\n\n\"we do not consider it our place to 'rewrite contracts freely\n\nentered into between sophisticated business entities.'\"           AccuSoft\n\nCorp. v. Palo, 237 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Mathewson\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fCorp. v. Allied Marine Indus., Inc., 827 F.2d 850, 855 (1st Cir.\n\n1987)).\n\n          Edwards claims that \"Lexington had virtually no risk\n\ndespite a $525,000 premium,\" but if Edwards had provided timely\n\nnotice to Game Tracker, Lexington would have sustained a loss on\n\nthe policy. Lexington had in fact sustained substantial losses due\n\nto the high volume of claims against Game Tracker.      Based on that\n\nhistory, it is unsurprising that Lexington insisted upon high\n\npremium and self-insurance retention rates despite the narrow scope\n\nof coverage.\n\n          Occurrence   Policy--Policy   #1320657.      Alternatively,\n\nEdwards seeks coverage under Game Tracker's occurrence policy,\n\nwhich covered incidents occurring between April 2002 and April\n\n2003, regardless of when the claim was made.        Unfortunately for\n\nEdwards, that policy contains an exclusion--Endorsement #8--that\n\ndisclaims coverage for injuries arising out of the use of \"any\n\nproduct that is attached or used on a tree; including [but] not\n\nlimited to the following: . . . safety belts and harnesses.\"\n\n          Edwards argues that the effective date of the endorsement\n\nis ambiguous, raising a genuine factual dispute as to whether the\n\nexclusion was in effect at the time of his accident.         He also\n\nclaims ambiguity as to whether the endorsement includes products\n\nmanufactured by Game Tracker, as opposed to its affiliates; this in\n\nturn, he says, triggers canons that the insurer bears the burden of\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fproving    an       exclusion,    and   that    such    exclusions    are    narrowly\n\nconstrued.          See Brazas Sporting Arms, Inc. v. Am. Empire Surplus\n\nLines Ins. Co., 220 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n               Neither       argument   can    succeed.      While    there    is    no\n\neffective date written on the endorsement page itself, the policy\n\nincludes       a    forms    schedule   listing   the     effective   date    of    the\n\nendorsement as April 8, 2002. Further support for Lexington can be\n\nfound     in       another     endorsement--Endorsement        #9--which      amends\n\nEndorsement #8, and which has an effective date of April 8, 2002.\n\nEndorsement #9 can hardly predate the endorsement that it purports\n\nto modify.\n\n               Lexington also submitted an affidavit from the manager\n\nresponsible for Game Tracker's occurrence policy.                     The affidavit\n\nstated that Endorsement #8 was effective as of April 8, 2002, and\n\nexplained that the effective date was listed on the forms schedule\n\nrather than on the endorsement itself because the form used for\n\nthat endorsement (and another endorsement not at issue in this\n\ncase) did not contain a blank space for the effective date.\n\n               Edwards also argues that the schedule for the policy\n\nlists under the classification description, \"treesteps, harnesses\n\nand archery accessories,\" suggesting that the harness he used was\n\ninitially a covered product.            Lexington's affidavit explained that\n\nthe classification was an error corrected by Endorsement #11, which\n\nredefines          the   description    as     \"archery,    arrows    and     hunting\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\faccessories.\"    Edwards may be right that Endorsements #8 and #11\n\nwere contemporaneous, but Endorsement #11 was effective April 8,\n\n2002, six months before Edwards' accident.\n\n            Determining the insured to which the exclusion applies is\n\nslightly more complex, although not less clear.           See Peerless Ins.\n\nCo. v. Brennon, 564 A.2d 383, 386 (Me. 1989).               The endorsement\n\nexcludes    coverage    for   injuries   \"arising   out   of    any   of   'your\n\nproducts' shown in this Schedule.\"          The term \"your products\" in\n\nturn is defined as \"Any goods or products . . . manufactured . . .\n\nby You.\"    \"You\" is then defined as \"the Named Insured shown in the\n\nDeclarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a\n\nNamed Insured under this policy.\"        Finally, the \"Named Insured\" is\n\ndefined as including six entities, including Game Tracker.\n\n            Thus any injury caused by a defect in Game Tracker's\n\nharness is excluded from coverage by the terms of Endorsement #8,\n\nand   its    various    cross-references     through      the    definitional\n\nprovisions of the policy.        There is no ambiguity.         Edwards' last\n\nargument, like his others, fails, and summary judgment against him\n\nwas properly entered.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f",

On July 9, 2004, Edwards filed suit in the federal district court in Maine against the safety harness's manufacturer, Game Tracker, Inc. (Edwards' wife was also a plaintiff in the action but nothing turns on her participation.) On February 8, 2006, Edwards obtained a $1,964,931.23 default judgment against Game Tracker, which by then had filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>\n<p>Unable to execute on the judgment against Game Tracker, Edwards (and his wife) sued in the same federal court under Maine's reach and apply statute, 24-A M.R.S.A. ยง 2904 (2000), seeking to collect from Lexington Insurance Company, Game Tracker's insurer.<sup>[1]</sup> Lexington had previously received notice of Edwards' suit against Game Tracker and had disclaimed coverage under all three policies that Lexington had issued to Game Tracker and its affiliates.</p>\n<p>In due course, Lexington moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted, finding that none of the three policies at issue covered Edwards' claim against Game Tracker: a \"claims-made policy\"<sup>[2]</sup> because Edwards had failed to provide notice of the claim to Game Tracker or Lexington within the required period; an \"occurrence policy\" because the policy contained an endorsement excluding injuries caused by safety belts and harnesses; and a third policy both because notice was not timely made and because the insured was Gorilla, Inc., not Game Tracker. Edwards now appeals the rulings as to the first two policies.</p>\n<p>We review a district court's entry of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and indulging reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Iverson v. City Of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment if the record demonstrates \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>see also </i><i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p><i>Claims-Made Policy ย Policy # 6478065.</i> Edwards first seeks satisfaction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> of the judgment against Game Tracker under a claims-made policy issued by Lexington to Game Tracker. The policy would have covered an incident such as the one suffered by Edwards, but only if notice of a claim was provided to either Game Tracker or Lexington during the claim period, which ran from April 2002 to June 2003.</p>\n<p>During discovery, Lexington sought proof that Edwards had provided notice within the claim period. Although asked the question three different ways, Edwards could not state that he had provided notice to Game Tracker, its affiliates, or Lexington during the notice period. Instead, he said that attempts to locate and contact Game Tracker were made in the winter of 2003, that his attorney at some unspecified point had telephone conversations with one or more Game Tracker representatives, and that formal notice was provided to Game Tracker in January 2004 ย after the required cut-off date.</p>\n<p>Based on Edwards' failure to provide evidence establishing timely notice ย evidence that one would expect to be available to a plaintiff or his attorney if timely notice was given ย the district court found that there was no genuine dispute of material fact and that for lack of timely notice, the claims-made insurance policy did not cover Edwards' claim. Edwards does not now argue that notice was timely provided but instead offers reasons why the policy's unambiguous notice requirement should not preclude coverage.</p>\n<p>Edwards first argues that Lexington breached its duty to defend Game Tracker in Edwards' initial action against Game Tracker. On this premise, he argues that Lexington is estopped from disclaiming coverage now; alternatively, Edwards says that under Maine law Lexington at least bore the burden of proving non-coverage as a result of that earlier alleged dereliction in failing to provide a defense.</p>\n<p>Edwards was not a party to the insurance contract, or a third party beneficiary, or the insured's assignee. Maine's reach and apply statute places Edwards in Game Tracker's shoes to the extent he seeks whatever indemnification might have been owed to Game Tracker under its insurance policies. Less clear is Edwards' ability to claim benefits or advantage based on <i>other</i> contractual duties owed by the insurer to the insured, such as the duty to defend.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, the extent to which an injured third party steps into the shoes of the insured when proceeding against the insurer is a question that arises in diverse contexts, affecting the claims available to the injured party and the defenses available to the insurer. Case law varies among the states.<sup>[4]</sup> The answer may also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> vary depending on the nature of the insurance contract, the language of the statute under which the injured third party is proceeding, and the balancing of competing policy concerns.</p>\n<p>The Maine SJC has not yet clearly determined whether an injured third party may generally seek the collateral benefits of a breach of the duty to defend which would otherwise belong to the insured. <i>Compare </i><i>Elliott v. Hanover Ins. Co.,</i> 711 A.2d 1310, 1311 (Me.1998) (allowing claim by an injured third party who was an assignee of the insured), <i>with </i><i>Smith v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 483 A.2d 344, 346 (Me. 1984) (injured third party \"has no judicially protectible interest in whether [the insurer] or independent counsel secured by [insured] provides [the insured's] defense in [a] negligence action against him\").</p>\n<p>However, Edwards' estoppel argument was expressly rejected in <i>Elliott,</i> which said that \"[a]n insurer that breaches its duty to defend . . . is not estopped from asserting noncoverage as a defense in a subsequent action brought by the insured or the insured's assignee.\" 711 A.2d at 1313; <i>see also </i><i>Bucci v. Essex Ins. Co.,</i> 393 F.3d 285, 295 (1st Cir.2005). <i>Elliott</i> does say that an insurer that breached its duty to defend may be bound in an indemnity action by \"any factual issues that might have been litigated in the underlying negligence action,\" 711 A.2d at 1314, but here the timing of the claim was not among the facts necessary to prove the <i>insured's</i> liability. <i>See </i><i>Bucci,</i> 393 F.3d at 296.</p>\n<p>Nor has Edwards established that the duty to defend was breached, which under Maine law might have triggered a shift in the burden of proof as to coverage for the purpose of indemnification. <i>Elliott,</i> 711 A.2d at 1313-14. The problem for Edwards is that in order to shift the burden of proof with regard to indemnification, he first had to show that there was a breach of the duty to defend. And to do so, he had to prove that a claim was timely made; otherwise, there was neither a duty to defend nor to indemnify the insured.</p>\n<p>The evidence as to notice is clearly inadequate to prove timely notice was given. Lexington, in an affidavit and in response to an interrogatory from Edwards, said that it did not receive notice of Edwards' claim from Edwards, Game Tracker, or anyone else, until July 9, 2004, over a year after the expiration of the claim period. And, as already explained, Edwards offered evidence only that \"`formal written' Notice of Claim,\" was provided to Game Tracker in January of 2004, that is, after the close of the claim period.</p>\n<p>Edwards counters with the \"eight corners rule,\" according to which the duty to defend is determined \"by comparing the allegations in the underlying complaint with the provisions of the insurance policy. If a complaint reveals a potential . . . that the facts ultimately proved may come within the coverage, a duty to defend exists.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Edwards argues that therefore the district court should have compared the complaint in the underlying action with the insurance policy to determine whether there was a duty to defend, and that the district court erred in considering extrinsic evidence relating to notice.</p>\n<p>Grounded in policy considerations, the so-called \"eight corners rule\" is appropriately invoked in the context of occurrence policies because the complaint in describing the incident will usually provide adequate information to determine whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> ย at least as alleged ย the incident is within the scope of the insurance policy. <i>See </i><i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Graham,</i> 473 F.3d 596, 599-600 (5th Cir.2006). However, the rule cannot be rigidly applied in the context of claims-made policies where the determinative event is the timing of the claim, a fact that likely will be ย and in this case was ย irrelevant to the merits of the underlying tort suit, and therefore absent from the pleadings.<sup>[6]</sup> The district court thus did not err in finding that Edwards failed to show a wrongful refusal to defend, given that the uncontradicted evidence established that their claim was not timely made.</p>\n<p>Turning to the insurance contract itself, Edwards argues that the claims-made policy is ambiguous. He does not say that the language of the policy is ambiguous; in fact, the policy states in capital letters, \"CLAIMS-MADE POLICY. READ THE ENTIRE POLICY CAREFULLY\" and \"CLAIMS-MADE COVERAGE. PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE FORM CAREFULLY.\" Further, the policy states clearly: \"This insurance applies to `bodily injury' and `property damage' only if . . . [a] claim for damages . . . is first made against any insured . . . during the policy period or any Extended Reporting Period.\" In this case the policy did extend the reporting period for 60 days but only until June 2003.</p>\n<p>Instead Edwards argues that because the policy did not provide retroactive coverage ย <i>i.e.,</i> coverage for incidents that occurred before the policy effective date, notice of which was received during the policy period ย as is fairly standard with claims-made policies, the policy is unclear as to whether it is a claims-made policy or an occurrence policy. But a claims-made insurance policy is not rendered ambiguous simply because it does not resemble all policies in its class; and Edwards has not identified any language in the policy that would muddy the claims-made requirement just quoted. <i>See </i><i>Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 267 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Edwards' ambiguity argument blends into his further contention that Game Tracker's claims-made policy offended public policy by offering neither the prospective benefits of an occurrence policy nor the retrospective benefits of a standard claims-made policy. This in turn might be best understood as an argument that the terms of the policy were unconscionable. <i>See </i><i>Truck Ins. Exch. v. Ashland Oil, Inc.,</i> 951 F.2d 787, 789-90 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>Specifically, Edwards relies on <i>Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co.,</i> 100 N.J. 325, 495 A.2d 406 (N.J.1985), a case in which the New Jersey Supreme Court held that a claims-made professional liability insurance policy that \"affords no retroactive coverage whatsoever during its initial year of issuance\" was void as against public policy. <i>Id.</i> at 415. But even the <i>Sparks</i> court recognized that \"`[c]laims made' policies with no retroactive coverage might be appropriate in certain contexts. For example . . . to the professional who changes from `occurrence' to `claims made' protection.\" <i>Id.</i> at 415 n. 4. As Judge Posner explained in <i>Ashland Oil,</i></p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> [I]t is commonplace for issuers of claims-made policies to limit retroactive coverage by specifying a cut-off date, such as the date of the first claims-made policy issued by the insurer to this insured, so that claims based on occurrences before that date are excluded from coverage. For protection against old occurrences the insured must look to his occurrence policies.</blockquote>\n<p>951 F.2d at 790 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>That is just what happened here. Game Tracker had purchased occurrence policies at least as early as April 1998. Any liability deriving from incidents that occurred during the four years prior to the adoption of the claims-made policy would have been covered under the earlier occurrence policies. There was simply no reason for the claims-made policy to afford retroactive coverage for incidents that were already covered by existing occurrence policies.</p>\n<p>Finally, Edwards argues that Lexington exacted \"an outrageously high premium, and outrageously high self insured retention limit\" given the narrow scope of coverage. Edwards has provided no data to show that the premium and self insurance retention rates were in fact \"outrageously high.\" More broadly, \"we do not consider it our place to `rewrite contracts freely entered into between sophisticated business entities.'\" <i>AccuSoft Corp. v. Palo,</i> 237 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., Inc.,</i> 827 F.2d 850, 855 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p>Edwards claims that \"Lexington had virtually no risk despite a $525,000 premium,\" but if Edwards <i>had</i> provided timely notice to Game Tracker, Lexington would have sustained a loss on the policy. Lexington had in fact sustained substantial losses due to the high volume of claims against Game Tracker. Based on that history, it is unsurprising that Lexington insisted upon high premium and self-insurance retention rates despite the narrow scope of coverage.</p>\n<p><i>Occurrence Policy ย Policy # 1320657.</i> Alternatively, Edwards seeks coverage under Game Tracker's occurrence policy, which covered incidents occurring between April 2002 and April 2003, regardless of when the claim was made. Unfortunately for Edwards, that policy contains an exclusion ย Endorsement # 8 ย that disclaims coverage for injuries arising out of the use of \"any product that is attached or used on a tree; including [but] not limited to the following: . . . safety belts and harnesses.\"</p>\n<p>Edwards argues that the effective date of the endorsement is ambiguous, raising a genuine factual dispute as to whether the exclusion was in effect at the time of his accident. He also claims ambiguity as to whether the endorsement includes products manufactured by Game Tracker, as opposed to its affiliates; this in turn, he says, triggers canons that the insurer bears the burden of proving an exclusion, and that such exclusions are narrowly construed. <i>See </i><i>Brazas Sporting Arms, Inc. v. Am. Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.,</i> 220 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>Neither argument can succeed. While there is no effective date written on the endorsement page itself, the policy includes a forms schedule listing the effective date of the endorsement as April 8, 2002. Further support for Lexington can be found in another endorsement ย Endorsement # 9 ย which amends Endorsement # 8, and which has an effective date of April 8, 2002. Endorsement # 9 can hardly predate the endorsement that it purports to modify.</p>\n<p>Lexington also submitted an affidavit from the manager responsible for Game Tracker's occurrence policy. The affidavit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> stated that Endorsement # 8 was effective as of April 8, 2002, and explained that the effective date was listed on the forms schedule rather than on the endorsement itself because the form used for that endorsement (and another endorsement not at issue in this case) did not contain a blank space for the effective date.</p>\n<p>Edwards also argues that the schedule for the policy lists under the classification description, \"treesteps, harnesses and archery accessories,\" suggesting that the harness he used was initially a covered product. Lexington's affidavit explained that the classification was an error corrected by Endorsement # 11, which redefines the description as \"archery, arrows and hunting accessories.\" Edwards may be right that Endorsements # 8 and # 11 were contemporaneous, but Endorsement # 11 was effective April 8, 2002, six months before Edwards' accident.</p>\n<p>Determining the insured to which the exclusion applies is slightly more complex, although not less clear. <i>See </i><i>Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon,</i> 564 A.2d 383, 386 (Me.1989). The endorsement excludes coverage for injuries \"arising out of any of `your products' shown in this Schedule.\" The term \"your products\" in turn is defined as \"Any goods or products . . . manufactured . . . by You.\" \"You\" is then defined as \"the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.\" Finally, the \"Named Insured\" is defined as including six entities, including Game Tracker.</p>\n<p>Thus any injury caused by a defect in Game Tracker's harness is excluded from coverage by the terms of Endorsement # 8, and its various cross-references through the definitional provisions of the policy. There is no ambiguity. Edwards' last argument, like his others, fails, and summary judgment against him was properly entered.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Maine's reach and apply statute allows an injured party who has obtained a final judgment against an insured tortfeasor to institute a separate civil action against the insurer to satisfy the judgment if, among other things, the tortfeasor \"was insured against such liability.\" 24-A M.R.S.A. ยง 2904; <i>see also </i><i>Ashe v.

Instead, he said that attempts to locate and contact Game Tracker were made in the winter of 2003, that his attorney at some unspecified point had telephone conversations with one or more Game Tracker representatives, and that formal notice was provided to Game Tracker in January 2004 ย after the required cut-off date.</p>\n<p>Based on Edwards' failure to provide evidence establishing timely notice ย evidence that one would expect to be available to a plaintiff or his attorney if timely notice was given ย the district court found that there was no genuine dispute of material fact and that for lack of timely notice, the claims-made insurance policy did not cover Edwards' claim. Edwards does not now argue that notice was timely provided but instead offers reasons why the policy's unambiguous notice requirement should not preclude coverage.</p>\n<p>Edwards first argues that Lexington breached its duty to defend Game Tracker in Edwards' initial action against Game Tracker. On this premise, he argues that Lexington is estopped from disclaiming coverage now; alternatively, Edwards says that under Maine law Lexington at least bore the burden of proving non-coverage as a result of that earlier alleged dereliction in failing to provide a defense.</p>\n<p>Edwards was not a party to the insurance contract, or a third party beneficiary, or the insured's assignee. Maine's reach and apply statute places Edwards in Game Tracker's shoes to the extent he seeks whatever indemnification might have been owed to Game Tracker under its insurance policies. Less clear is Edwards' ability to claim benefits or advantage based on <i>other</i> contractual duties owed by the insurer to the insured, such as the duty to defend.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, the extent to which an injured third party steps into the shoes of the insured when proceeding against the insurer is a question that arises in diverse contexts, affecting the claims available to the injured party and the defenses available to the insurer. Case law varies among the states.<sup>[4]</sup> The answer may also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> vary depending on the nature of the insurance contract, the language of the statute under which the injured third party is proceeding, and the balancing of competing policy concerns.</p>\n<p>The Maine SJC has not yet clearly determined whether an injured third party may generally seek the collateral benefits of a breach of the duty to defend which would otherwise belong to the insured. <i>Compare </i><i>Elliott v. Hanover Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1310</span></span>, 1311 (Me.1998) (allowing claim by an injured third party who was an assignee of the insured), <i>with </i><i>Smith v.

Essex Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></span>, 295 (1st Cir.2005). <i>Elliott</i> does say that an insurer that breached its duty to defend may be bound in an indemnity action by \"any factual issues that might have been litigated in the underlying negligence action,\" 711 A.2d at 1314, but here the timing of the claim was not among the facts necessary to prove the <i>insured's</i> liability. <i>See </i><i>Bucci,</i> 393 F.3d at 296.</p>\n<p>Nor has Edwards established that the duty to defend was breached, which under Maine law might have triggered a shift in the burden of proof as to coverage for the purpose of indemnification. <i>Elliott,</i> 711 A.2d at 1313-14. The problem for Edwards is that in order to shift the burden of proof with regard to indemnification, he first had to show that there was a breach of the duty to defend. And to do so, he had to prove that a claim was timely made; otherwise, there was neither a duty to defend nor to indemnify the insured.</p>\n<p>The evidence as to notice is clearly inadequate to prove timely notice was given. Lexington, in an affidavit and in response to an interrogatory from Edwards, said that it did not receive notice of Edwards' claim from Edwards, Game Tracker, or anyone else, until July 9, 2004, over a year after the expiration of the claim period. And, as already explained, Edwards offered evidence only that \"`formal written' Notice of Claim,\" was provided to Game Tracker in January of 2004, that is, after the close of the claim period.</p>\n<p>Edwards counters with the \"eight corners rule,\" according to which the duty to defend is determined \"by comparing the allegations in the underlying complaint with the provisions of the insurance policy. If a complaint reveals a potential . . . that the facts ultimately proved may come within the coverage, a duty to defend exists.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Edwards argues that therefore the district court should have compared the complaint in the underlying action with the insurance policy to determine whether there was a duty to defend, and that the district court erred in considering extrinsic evidence relating to notice.</p>\n<p>Grounded in policy considerations, the so-called \"eight corners rule\" is appropriately invoked in the context of occurrence policies because the complaint in describing the incident will usually provide adequate information to determine whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> ย at least as alleged ย the incident is within the scope of the insurance policy. <i>See </i><i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Graham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"47618\"><a href=\"/opinion/47618/liberty-mutual-ins-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 599-600 (5th Cir.2006). However, the rule cannot be rigidly applied in the context of claims-made policies where the determinative event is the timing of the claim, a fact that likely will be ย and in this case was ย irrelevant to the merits of the underlying tort suit, and therefore absent from the pleadings.<sup>[6]</sup> The district court thus did not err in finding that Edwards failed to show a wrongful refusal to defend, given that the uncontradicted evidence established that their claim was not timely made.</p>\n<p>Turning to the insurance contract itself, Edwards argues that the claims-made policy is ambiguous. He does not say that the language of the policy is ambiguous; in fact, the policy states in capital letters, \"CLAIMS-MADE POLICY. READ THE ENTIRE POLICY CAREFULLY\" and \"CLAIMS-MADE COVERAGE. PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE FORM CAREFULLY.\" Further, the policy states clearly: \"This insurance applies to `bodily injury' and `property damage' only if . . . [a] claim for damages . . . is first made against any insured . . . during the policy period or any Extended Reporting Period.\" In this case the policy did extend the reporting period for 60 days but only until June 2003.</p>\n<p>Instead Edwards argues that because the policy did not provide retroactive coverage ย <i>i.e.,</i> coverage for incidents that occurred before the policy effective date, notice of which was received during the policy period ย as is fairly standard with claims-made policies, the policy is unclear as to whether it is a claims-made policy or an occurrence policy. But a claims-made insurance policy is not rendered ambiguous simply because it does not resemble all policies in its class; and Edwards has not identified any language in the policy that would muddy the claims-made requirement just quoted. <i>See </i><i>Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199631\"><a href=\"/opinion/199631/alternative-energy-v-st-paul-fire-and-ma/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Edwards' ambiguity argument blends into his further contention that Game Tracker's claims-made policy offended public policy by offering neither the prospective benefits of an occurrence policy nor the retrospective benefits of a standard claims-made policy. This in turn might be best understood as an argument that the terms of the policy were unconscionable. <i>See </i><i>Truck Ins. Exch. v. Ashland Oil, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573927\"><a href=\"/opinion/573927/truck-insurance-exchange-v-ashland-oil-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span>, 789-90 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>Specifically, Edwards relies on <i>Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2349331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2349331/sparks-v-st-paul-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2349331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2349331/sparks-v-st-paul-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span> (N.J.1985), a case in which the New Jersey Supreme Court held that a claims-made professional liability insurance policy that \"affords no retroactive coverage whatsoever during its initial year of issuance\" was void as against public policy. <i>Id.</i> at 415. But even the <i>Sparks</i> court recognized that \"`[c]laims made' policies with no retroactive coverage might be appropriate in certain contexts. For example . . . to the professional who changes from `occurrence' to `claims made' protection.\" <i>Id.</i> at 415 n. 4. As Judge Posner explained in <i>Ashland Oil,</i></p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> [I]t is commonplace for issuers of claims-made policies to limit retroactive coverage by specifying a cut-off date, such as the date of the first claims-made policy issued by the insurer to this insured, so that claims based on occurrences before that date are excluded from coverage. For protection against old occurrences the insured must look to his occurrence policies.</blockquote>\n<p>951 F.2d at 790 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>That is just what happened here. Game Tracker had purchased occurrence policies at least as early as April 1998. Any liability deriving from incidents that occurred during the four years prior to the adoption of the claims-made policy would have been covered under the earlier occurrence policies. There was simply no reason for the claims-made policy to afford retroactive coverage for incidents that were already covered by existing occurrence policies.</p>\n<p>Finally, Edwards argues that Lexington exacted \"an outrageously high premium, and outrageously high self insured retention limit\" given the narrow scope of coverage. Edwards has provided no data to show that the premium and self insurance retention rates were in fact \"outrageously high.\" More broadly, \"we do not consider it our place to `rewrite contracts freely entered into between sophisticated business entities.'\" <i>AccuSoft Corp. v. Palo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771700\"><a href=\"/opinion/771700/accusoft-corporation-appellantcross-appellee-v-james-l-palo-simon/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493607\"><a href=\"/opinion/493607/mathewson-corporation-v-allied-marine-industries-inc-brad-foote-gear/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span>, 855 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p>Edwards claims that \"Lexington had virtually no risk despite a $525,000 premium,\" but if Edwards <i>had</i> provided timely notice to Game Tracker, Lexington would have sustained a loss on the policy. Lexington had in fact sustained substantial losses due to the high volume of claims against Game Tracker. Based on that history, it is unsurprising that Lexington insisted upon high premium and self-insurance retention rates despite the narrow scope of coverage.</p>\n<p><i>Occurrence Policy ย Policy # 1320657.</i> Alternatively, Edwards seeks coverage under Game Tracker's occurrence policy, which covered incidents occurring between April 2002 and April 2003, regardless of when the claim was made. Unfortunately for Edwards, that policy contains an exclusion ย Endorsement # 8 ย that disclaims coverage for injuries arising out of the use of \"any product that is attached or used on a tree; including [but] not limited to the following: . . . safety belts and harnesses.\"</p>\n<p>Edwards argues that the effective date of the endorsement is ambiguous, raising a genuine factual dispute as to whether the exclusion was in effect at the time of his accident. He also claims ambiguity as to whether the endorsement includes products manufactured by Game Tracker, as opposed to its affiliates; this in turn, he says, triggers canons that the insurer bears the burden of proving an exclusion, and that such exclusions are narrowly construed. <i>See </i><i>Brazas Sporting Arms, Inc. v. Am. Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199002\"><a href=\"/opinion/199002/brazas-v-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>Neither argument can succeed. While there is no effective date written on the endorsement page itself, the policy includes a forms schedule listing the effective date of the endorsement as April 8, 2002. Further support for Lexington can be found in another endorsement ย Endorsement # 9 ย which amends Endorsement # 8, and which has an effective date of April 8, 2002. Endorsement # 9 can hardly predate the endorsement that it purports to modify.</p>\n<p>Lexington also submitted an affidavit from the manager responsible for Game Tracker's occurrence policy. The affidavit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> stated that Endorsement # 8 was effective as of April 8, 2002, and explained that the effective date was listed on the forms schedule rather than on the endorsement itself because the form used for that endorsement (and another endorsement not at issue in this case) did not contain a blank space for the effective date.</p>\n<p>Edwards also argues that the schedule for the policy lists under the classification description, \"treesteps, harnesses and archery accessories,\" suggesting that the harness he used was initially a covered product. Lexington's affidavit explained that the classification was an error corrected by Endorsement # 11, which redefines the description as \"archery, arrows and hunting accessories.\" Edwards may be right that Endorsements # 8 and # 11 were contemporaneous, but Endorsement # 11 was effective April 8, 2002, six months before Edwards' accident.</p>\n<p>Determining the insured to which the exclusion applies is slightly more complex, although not less clear. <i>See </i><i>Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span>, 386 (Me.1989). The endorsement excludes coverage for injuries \"arising out of any of `your products' shown in this Schedule.\" The term \"your products\" in turn is defined as \"Any goods or products . . . manufactured . . . by You.\" \"You\" is then defined as \"the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.\" Finally, the \"Named Insured\" is defined as including six entities, including Game Tracker.</p>\n<p>Thus any injury caused by a defect in Game Tracker's harness is excluded from coverage by the terms of Endorsement # 8, and its various cross-references through the definitional provisions of the policy. There is no ambiguity. Edwards' last argument, like his others, fails, and summary judgment against him was properly entered.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Maine's reach and apply statute allows an injured party who has obtained a final judgment against an insured tortfeasor to institute a separate civil action against the insurer to satisfy the judgment if, among other things, the tortfeasor \"was insured against such liability.\" 24-A M.R.S.A. ยง 2904; <i>see also </i><i>Ashe v.
