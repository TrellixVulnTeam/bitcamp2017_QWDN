During the period in question the vessel was used in whiting fishing, a type of fishing which is done in daylight hours.  At about 3:00 a.m. on July 3, 1954, the Eleanor set out from a pier at Gloucester to commence a fishing trip within the limits of the geographical coverage in the policy and, after fishing all morning, the vessel sank from undetermined causes early in the afternoon and was a total loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's defense was that the policy had been forfeited by breach of the aforesaid warranty prior to the sinking of the vessel.  This defense was based upon evidence that occasionally after fishing all day the vessel would not put back to Gloucester harbor, but would drop anchor within the shelter of a harbor, such as Provincetown or Rockport, nearer to the area proposed to be fished the next day.  The argument was that there had been a breach of warranty, forfeiting the policy, when the Eleanor stayed overnight at any harbor other than Gloucester.  We agree with the district court that there was 'much convincing evidence' that the warranty, properly interpreted, imposed no such requirement, and that the aforesaid fishing procedure 'conformed to the usage attached to the term 'day fishing' in the whiting industry in Gloucester.'  Finding that there was no breach of warranty, it is unnecessary to rely on Mass.
