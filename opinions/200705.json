Burke on brief\nfor appellees Thomas R. Zona, Francis E. Moore and Charles Murray.\n\n                            October 27, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam.      Pro se plaintiff-appellant Edwin Colon\n\n(\"Colon\") appeals from two district court orders granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of federal and state officials in his civil\n\nrights damages suit. We review summary judgment decisions de novo,\n\nexamining   the   record    independently       and   drawing   any   factual\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n\nRosenberg v. City of Everett, 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).            We\n\nhave reviewed the parties' submissions and the record on appeal.\n\nWe affirm, substantially for the reasons stated in the magistrate\n\njudge's 10/30/01 and 1/31/03 reports and recommendations, which the\n\ndistrict court accepted on 11/27/01 and 3/19/03, respectively.            We\n\nadd only the following comments.\n\n            Colon's   argument   that     the   district   court   improperly\n\nrelied on the magistrate's reports because two of them contradicted\n\neach other has no merit.         Specifically, Colon asserts that the\n\nmagistrate's 8/9/99 report concluded that Colon's complaint was not\n\nvague, whereas the magistrate's 10/30/01 report concluded that his\n\ncomplaint was vague.       A review of these reports reveals that the\n\npurported contradiction has been manufactured, for in his 8/9/99\n\nreport, the magistrate merely noted Colon's contention that prior\n\ncourt rulings suggested that his complaint was not vague.\n\n            Colon's next argument that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion and violated his due process rights by adopting the\n\nmagistrate's reports without issuing its own opinions also has no\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmerit.    While the district court was required to review the\n\nmagistrate judge's decisions de novo, see 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(C),\n\nthis did not - contrary to Colon's contention - compel the district\n\ncourt to make separate findings of fact or issue opinions setting\n\nforth its own reasoning, see Jonco, LLC v. Ali, Inc., 157 F.3d 33,\n\n35 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              Finally, Colon's argument that he stated viable damages\n\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of\n\nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), has no merit.\n\nThe lower court correctly held that Colon's damages claims were not\n\ncognizable under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994) because the\n\npresent suit would necessarily imply the invalidity of Colon's\n\nunderlying sentence.       We add that Colon may pursue his damages\n\nclaims   if    his   conviction   and    sentence   are   ever   invalidated.\n\nGuzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 29 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              The judgment of the district court is summarily affirmed.\n\nSee 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f",
