Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Selya, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\f     Jorge Martínez-Luciano with whom William O'Connor was on brief\nfor defendants, appellants.\n     Efraín Maceira-Ortiz for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          May 21, 2008\n\f             BOUDIN, Chief Judge.          Samuel Lopez-Quinones--a former\n\nofficial of the Puerto Rico National Guard--claims he was terminated\n\nfrom that position on account of his political affiliation.         He sued\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico National Guard, and\n\nvarious officials, seeking relief primarily under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n(2000). This interlocutory appeal presents only the question whether\n\nthe individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from\n\nLopez' damage claims.\n\n             Lopez was hired as director of the general services\n\nsection of the Puerto Rico National Guard in 1997.             In the 2000\n\nelections, the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") defeated the New\n\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\").        Lopez--a known supporter of the NPP--\n\nclaims that after the election, he was gradually stripped of his\n\nprofessional duties.     In July 2004, disciplinary proceedings were\n\ninstituted against him within the National Guard.\n\n             Lopez then filed suit in federal district court in Puerto\n\nRico, seeking injunctive and monetary relief.          In July 2005, while\n\nhis suit was pending, Lopez was terminated.          He sought preliminary\n\ninjunctive    relief   ordering    his   reinstatement   and   amended   his\n\ncomplaint to reflect the fact of his termination.         In October 2006,\n\nthe district court denied Lopez' request for preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n             Shortly thereafter, the individual defendants moved for a\n\nruling on their previously asserted defense of qualified immunity.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fThey urged that Lopez' position was not protected from political\n\npatronage firings under the Elrod/Branti line of cases, see Elrod v.\n\nBurns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976); Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980),\n\nand that in any event, defendants were entitled to qualified immunity\n\nbecause any such protection was not clearly established at the time\n\nof Lopez' termination.\n\n            The district court denied the motion, and defendants filed\n\nthis interlocutory appeal.    Although the district court's order is\n\nnot a final disposition of the case, we have jurisdiction to the\n\nextent defendants seek review of the district court's denial of their\n\nqualified immunity defense,   Torres v. Puerto Rico, 485 F.3d 5, 8-9\n\n(1st Cir. 2007), but only so far as it rests on a legal ruling rather\n\nthan a factual dispute.   Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d\n\n55, 60 (1st Cir. 2004).   As to the legal questions, our review is de\n\nnovo.   Galloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            The qualified immunity defense depends on whether the\n\nnature of Lopez' position was such that defendants were entitled to\n\nconsider his political affiliation as a job qualification and, even\n\nif they were not, whether a reasonable officer at the time would have\n\nunderstood patronage dismissal to be barred.    See Limone v. Condon,\n\n372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2004).    Analytically, the second question\n\nmay often be answered without resolving the first, but in accordance\n\nwith Saucier's preferred approach, we generally--although not always-\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f-answer the questions in sequence.         Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194,\n\n201 (2001).\n\n             In Elrod, the Supreme Court announced a new rule rendering\n\npatronage firings a violation of the First Amendment save where\n\npolitical    affiliation   is   an   appropriate   qualification   for   the\n\nparticular position.    Elrod, 427 U.S. at 367-68; Branti, 445 U.S. at\n\n518.     Yet, as we said in Flynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 44\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 961 (1998), doctrine in this area\n\nremains\n\n             largely a porridge of general statements and\n             variables: positions are less likely to be\n             protected to the extent that they are\n             \"higher,\"     more     \"political,\"       more\n             \"confidential,\" and so on; duties prevail over\n             titles; everything depends on circumstances.\n\n             Our decisions have asked whether a position's functions\n\nare those of \"a policymaker, a privy to confidential information, a\n\ncommunicator, or some other office holder whose function is such that\n\nparty affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.\"          Jimenez\n\nFuentes v. Torres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 242 (1st Cir. 1986) (en\n\nbanc), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1014 (1987); see also Flynn, 140 F.3d\n\nat 45.     \"Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, and an\n\nofficial description of job functions is a presumptively reliable\n\nbasis for determining those functions.\"         Olmeda v. Ortiz-Quinonez,\n\n434 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).\n\n             We also consider the position's \"relative pay\" and whether\n\nit entails \"technical competence, power to control others, authority\n\n                                     -5-\n\fto speak in the name of policymakers, public perception, contact with\n\nelected    officials   and   responsiveness            to    partisan        politics     and\n\npolitical leaders.\"        Mendez-Palou v. Rohena-Betancourt, 813 F.2d\n\n1255, 1259 (1st Cir. 1987).         Under the case law, the classification\n\nof a position as \"career\" (rather than \"trust\") under Puerto Rico law\n\nis relevant, although not dispositive.                  Roldan-Plumey v. Cerezo-\n\nSuarez, 115 F.3d 58, 64-65 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n             As director of the general services section, Lopez headed\n\nthe unit of the Guard responsible for inventory (not including\n\nmilitary equipment), utilities, property maintenance and related\n\nfunctions. He supervised approximately thirty other employees. Both\n\nare   factors    tending   to     indicate      that    one's           position    involves\n\ndiscretionary judgments, which in turn often entail policymaking.\n\nSee Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127, 132 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).      He   earned    just    over    $30,000          per    year     and    his   job\n\nclassification form said that review of his work was \"superficial\"\n\n(as opposed to \"thorough\").\n\n             On the other hand, Lopez' position was classified as a\n\n\"career\" position under Puerto Rico law and a closer look at his\n\ndetailed   job    description     suggests      that    he        had    modest,    if   any,\n\ninvolvement in policymaking.         True, the first listed responsibility\n\nis spacious (\"Plans, coordinates and supervises the activities of the\n\ngeneral    services    section      relating      to        maintenance,           property,\n\npurchasing,      transportation,      reproduction,           inventory,           receiving\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fequipment, leasing of establishments and general services\"), but\n\nalmost all of the specifics are routine and fairly pedestrian.   They\n\ninclude (merely as examples) responsibility for:\n\n                  hiring  air-conditioning   and  radio\n           maintenance services, radios, fumigation,\n           cleaning and others, whether with federal or\n           state funds;\n\n                  matters relating to the telephone\n           service (switchboard) and state transportation\n           (regulations, use, etc.);\n\n                  seeing that the agency is provided with\n           [utility] service of water, electricity and\n           telephone;\n\n                   supervis[ing] the work of employees\n           working    in  the   state warehouse, their\n           purchasing, inventories, etc.;\n\n                  oversee[ing] proper filling in of\n           purchasing logs and controls and control of\n           existing property;\n\n                  revis[ing] and coordinat[ing] matters\n           relating to the maintenance and cleaning of\n           the agency; and\n\n                  [supervising] employee training in the\n           computer and programming system.\n\n           In addition, a number of the functions involve reporting\n\nand other paperwork matters; most look mechanical (e.g., \"responsible\n\nfor seeing that all contracts are filed with the P.R. Comptroller's\n\nOffice pursuant to provisions\"), although a few       could--but not\n\nnecessarily would--involve policy judgments depending on the precise\n\nrole Lopez actually played in the process (e.g., \"supervises bids\n\ncarried out in the section's purchasing area\").\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f               So far as appears, Lopez' job did not involve advising any\n\nsenior officials on policy matters.               He did not operate            as a\n\nspokesperson or otherwise liaise with the public or other government\n\nagencies, except in ways largely ministerial.                    His job does not\n\nappear    to   have   entailed    discretionary    judgments        involving      the\n\nimplementation of policy, broadly understood. As to bid supervision,\n\nthe district court found that Puerto Rico law largely divested Lopez\n\nof discretion in handling bids of significant size.\n\n               Lopez did supervise approximately thirty other employees,\n\nbut they were mostly janitors and other lower-level employees. It is\n\nhard to see how Lopez' position implicates significant policy issues,\n\nlet   alone    \"partisan   political   interests    .    .   .     [or]   concerns,\"\n\nBranti, 445 U.S. at 519, nor does he appear to be one of those mid-\n\nor    upper-level     officials   or   employees   who       are    \"significantly\n\nconnected to policy-making.\"        Flynn, 140 F.3d at 45.\n\n               Although Lopez reported directly to a political appointee,\n\ndefendants have failed to identify policy decisions in which Lopez\n\nwas directly involved or over which he had influence.                     Their main\n\nargument is that the Puerto Rico National Guard is involved in\n\noperations--such as law enforcement and natural disaster relief--that\n\ninvolve   policymaking     and    implicate   partisan       concerns;      that   as\n\ndirector of general services Lopez was involved in procuring and\n\nmaintaining the Guard's inventory and property; and that because a\n\nproper supply chain is critical to any successful operation, Lopez\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwas well positioned to frustrate any programs or operations with\n\nwhich he disagreed.\n\n             This argument proves too much. Any malfunctioning cog can\n\njam   the   gears.    An   ability   to    undermine   operations   through\n\nincompetence or malfeasance does not mean the actor engaged in\n\npolicymaking or was a confidante or spokesman for policymakers.\n\nHadfield v. McDonough, 407 F.3d 11, 18 n.4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n546 U.S. 961 (2005).       On \"the spectrum between policymaker and\n\nclerk,\" Mendez-Palou, 813 F.2d at 1259, Lopez was closer to the\n\nlatter and is, at least on the present record, protected under Elrod.\n\nWhether his termination was in fact politically motivated is a quite\n\ndifferent question.\n\n             Still remaining is the question whether his status was\n\nclearly established at the time of his termination.        Of course, the\n\nabstract right of a non-policy-related employee to be free from\n\npolitically motivated termination dates from Elrod and Branti; but\n\nthis is not enough to defeat qualified immunity.           The purpose of\n\nqualified immunity is to protect reasonable, if mistaken, decision\n\nmaking by government officials, Jordan v. Carter, 428 F.3d 67, 71\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), and it does not matter whether the mistake is\n\nrelated to broad principle or specific application.\n\n             The crucial question here is whether a reasonable official\n\nacting at the time of Lopez' termination should have known on what\n\nside of the Elrod/Branti line Lopez' own position fell. Mendez-Palou,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f813 F.2d at 1259.   Largely for prudential reasons, the test is not\n\nsubjective but asks what a reasonable official would have thought.\n\nPagan v. Calderon, 448 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2006).   On the present\n\nfacts, this is a close call but the issue is treated as one of law,\n\nRuiz-Casillas, 415 F.3d at 131; and, in disagreement with the able\n\ndistrict judge, we believe that as the law stood when the decision\n\nwas made a reasonable official could (albeit mistakenly) have deemed\n\nLopez outside Elrod/Branti's protection.\n\n           As already explained, a few features of Lopez' position in\n\ncombination might have led reasonable superiors of Lopez involved in\n\nthe termination decision to believe he was subject to patronage\n\ndismissal: for example, that he headed the unit in question, that\n\nsome of his duties were broadly phrased (even if      seemingly less\n\nimpressive in practice), that he was fairly well paid and his\n\nposition lightly supervised, that he reported directly to a political\n\nappointee and that he supervised thirty other employees.\n\n           Defendants also point to two prior First Circuit opinions\n\nin which we held that the Personnel and General Services Officer in\n\nthe Ombudsman's Office and the Regional Director of the Puerto Rico\n\nGeneral Services Administration were subject to political dismissal.\n\nSee Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves, 274 F.3d 4 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nRoman Melendez v. Inclan, 826 F.2d 130 (1st Cir. 1987).    Both cases\n\nare distinguishable because the jobs were classified as \"trust\"\n\npositions, and involved supervision of large numbers of employees,\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fdiscretionary provision of government services, and/or representation\n\nof the agency before the public and other agencies.\n\n            But, weighing in defendants' favor, the job titles are\n\nsimilar,   and    in   Roman   Melendez    we   noted   that   \"in   every    case\n\nconcerning regional directors of government agencies in Puerto Rico,\n\nwe have concluded, at least for purposes of qualified immunity, that\n\na regional director was, in fact, a policymaker.\"              826 F.2d at 134.\n\nThose   reading    our    past   decisions      like    Duriex-Gauthier      could\n\nreasonably have believed that in general, middle managers with\n\nimpressive sounding titles and duties were generally outside the\n\nprotected category.\n\n            The    district      court's    own   contrary     decision      rests\n\nsignificantly on a possible ambiguity in our own case law, which we\n\nnow repair.      Some of our precedents may suggest that even if an\n\nofficial has significant policymaking responsibility, he is still\n\nprotected unless it is also established that the policy judgments are\n\nthose for which \"partisan\" political motivations or judgments are\n\nappropriate, e.g., Jimenez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 241-42; by contrast,\n\nother language from our case law indicates that involvement in policy\n\nor matters implicating political disagreement is sufficient.                 E.g.,\n\nFlynn, 140 F.3d at 46; see also Tomczak v. City of Chicago, 765 F.2d\n\n633, 641 (7th Cir. 1985).\n\n            It is conceivable that there are rare cases where the\n\ndistinction might matter--say, a high official whose duties were\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fnonetheless entirely technical.          Jimenez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 240.\n\nBut for the most part policymaking is in the nature of things the\n\nbasis for preserving the right of the democratic political process to\n\noperate; civil service protections can be afforded by statute but the\n\nConstitution does not require them.             The reference to \"partisan\"\n\npolitics comes from Branti but it is far from clear that it comprised\n\na separate test.    445 U.S. at 519.\n\n             And for his part, plaintiff has not cited any analogous\n\nFirst Circuit cases that would have put defendants on notice of\n\njeopardy.      Given past precedent, we cannot say it was clearly\n\nestablished that Lopez, a director of a significant unit within the\n\nPuerto Rico National Guard, was insulated from political dismissal.\n\nAccordingly,    while     Lopez   may    seek   injunctive   relief   for   his\n\ntermination, he may not obtain monetary relief from the individual\n\ndefendants in their personal capacities.\n\n             The order denying qualified immunity is vacated and the\n\nmatter   remanded   for    further      proceedings   consistent   with     this\n\ndecision.    The damage claims against the individual defendants in\n\ntheir personal capacities are barred but the suit may otherwise\n\nproceed.    All parties will bear their own costs.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n             --Concurring and Dissenting Opinion Follows--\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part, Dissenting\n\nin part).    Since 1976, the United States Supreme Court has held that\n\nthe First Amendment forbids the discharge of \"public employees solely\n\nfor not being supporters of the political party in power, unless\n\nparty affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position\n\ninvolved.\"    Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 64 (1990)\n\n(citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976) and Branti v. Finkel, 445\n\nU.S. 507 (1980)).       That inquiry -- whether political affiliation is\n\na valid requirement of the job in question -- is the necessary\n\nstarting point for political discharge cases.                 Limone v. Condon, 372\n\nF.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             This circuit leads the nation as one of the most prolific\n\ngenerators    of     political     discrimination      cases;    in    this   area   of\n\nlitigation, the District of Puerto Rico has the dubious distinction\n\nof being the most fecund district in the circuit.                       See Morales-\n\nSantiago v. Hernández-Pérez, 488 F.3d 465, 466 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"[I]n\n\nPuerto Rico, a change between the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) and\n\nthe New Progressive Party (NPP) [gives rise to] overly zealous\n\npolitical     operatives      of    the    prevailing     party       terminat[ing],\n\ndemot[ing], or reduc[ing] the salaries of employees affiliated with\n\nthe outgoing opposition party.\").             As a result of the proliferation\n\nof   these   cases    and   their    public      notoriety,    the    legal   precepts\n\nestablished by them are widely known in Puerto Rico, particularly by\n\nthose in public administration.            It is, therefore, inconceivable in\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fthis day and age that a reasonable public official would by-pass an\n\ninquest into whether a position in a government agency requires\n\npolitical affiliation before taking the drastic action of firing an\n\nemployee based on party affiliation.    Considering the state of the\n\nlaw, one who fails to do so can hardly be classified as a reasonable\n\npublic official.\n\n            Any reasonable public official conducting such an inquiry\n\nwould have concluded that López-Quiñones's position was not one\n\nrequiring political affiliation.     Indeed, by following the long-\n\nestablished case law in this circuit, the majority properly reaches\n\nthe conclusion that López-Quiñones's non-policy related position was\n\nprotected from political patronage dismissal.   Slip op. at 9 (\"On the\n\nspectrum between policymaker and clerk, López[-Quiñones] was closer\n\nto the latter and is, at least on the present record, protected under\n\nElrod.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n            In reaching this conclusion, the majority begins its\n\nanalysis with López-Quiñones's detailed job description.     See slip\n\nop. at 5.   Based on the job description, the majority finds that: (1)\n\nLópez-Quiñones was holding a \"career\" position under Puerto Rico law,\n\nid. at 6; (2) \"almost all of the specific[] [tasks were] routine and\n\nfairly pedestrian,\" id. at 7; (3) his reporting and paperwork duties\n\n\"most[ly] look mechanical,\" id.; (4) he was \"not involve[d in]\n\nadvising any senior officials in policy matters,\" id. at 8; (5) he\n\n\"did not operate as a spokesperson or otherwise liaise with the\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fpublic    or    other   government    agencies,     except    in   ways   largely\n\nministerial,\" id.; (6) he did not have \"discretionary judgment[]\n\ninvolving the implementation of policy, broadly speaking,\" id.; and\n\n(7) he supervised \"mostly janitors and other low-level employees.\"\n\nId.   Significantly, citing to both Branti, 445 U.S. at 519, and to\n\nFlynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 1998), the\n\nmajority states that \"[i]t is hard to see how López[-Quiñones's]\n\nposition implicates significant policy issues, let alone 'partisan\n\npolitical interests . . . [or] concerns,' . . .              nor does he appear\n\nto be one of those mid- or upper-level officials or employees who are\n\n'significantly connected to policy-making.'\"             Slip op. at 8.        On\n\nthese facts, the majority concludes that López-Quiñones's position\n\nwas not subject to patronage dismissal.           I am in full agreement.\n\n                It is in the granting of immunity that I part company with\n\nmy learned colleagues.         Under our qualified immunity law, after\n\nfinding that a constitutional right was violated, we turn to whether\n\nthe law was clearly established at the time of the violation and\n\nwhether a reasonable public officer would have understood that he was\n\nviolating that right.        See Sueiro Vázquez v. Torregrosa de la Rosa,\n\n494 F.3d 227, 234 (1st Cir. 2007).           I disagree with the majority's\n\nconclusion that \"as the law stood . . . a reasonable official could\n\n(albeit        mistakenly)    have     deemed     López[-Quiñones]        outside\n\nElrod/Branti's protection.\"          Slip op. 10.     As made evident by the\n\nmajority's own application of our clearly established law, López-\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fQuiñones's position was not subject to patronage dismissal.                      In\n\ndeciding to terminate López-Quiñones from his position, the officials\n\nin this case recklessly ignored the established law of this circuit.\n\nSuch behavior should lead to the dispossession of the mantle of\n\nqualified immunity, rather than the extension of this privilege to\n\nthem.\n\n               The majority is able to conclude that the appellants are\n\nentitled to immunity because it gives undue weight to the fact that\n\nLópez-Quiñones's       \"job   title     [is]    similar\"   to   two   prior    cases\n\n\"concerning regional directors of government agencies in Puerto\n\nRico.\"      Id. at 11 (citing Duriex-Gauthier v. López-Nieves, 274 F.3d\n\n4 (1st Cir. 2001) and Román Meléndez v. Inclán, 826 F.2d 130 (1st\n\nCir.    1987)).     In   so   doing,     the    majority   violates    those   very\n\nprinciples to which it claims adherence only a few pages earlier.                 As\n\nwe   have    warned,   the    inquiry    into    the   legitimacy     of   political\n\npatronage requires an inquiry that goes beneath the mere title of the\n\nposition.      See, e.g., Olmeda v. Ortiz-Quiñonez, 434 F.3d 62, 66 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (\"Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, and an\n\nofficial description of job functions is a presumptively reliable\n\nbasis    for    determining     those     functions.\"      (internal       citations\n\nomitted)); Flynn, 140 F.3d at 44 (noting that \"duties prevail over\n\ntitles\").      Unfortunately, it appears that the majority's invocation\n\nof this principle was mere lip service; in its grant of immunity, the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fmajority inexplicably applies an entirely different and contradictory\n\nstandard.\n\n                Even if the job titles in Duriex-Gauthier and Román\n\nMeléndez are similar to that of López-Quiñones, the employees' actual\n\nresponsibilities are substantially different.                      The employees in\n\nDuriex-Gauthier and Román Meléndez held \"trust positions;\" exercised\n\nmeaningful      supervision of a large number of employees; enjoyed\n\ndiscretion over the particular government services under their aegis;\n\nand represented their respective agencies before the public and other\n\ngovernment entities.           Duriex-Gauthier, 274 F.3d at 7-8, 10; Román\n\nMeléndez,       826   F.2d     at   134-35.      In    contrast,     none    of   those\n\nprerogatives or powers are present here.\n\n                Most importantly, unlike the employees in Duriex-Gauthier\n\nand Román Meléndez, López-Quiñones was not involved in making or\n\nrecommending any agency policy.               There is nothing in the record to\n\nsupport    a    finding      that   López-Quiñones      was   a   policymaker.         The\n\nmajority opinion describes him as having only \"modest, if any,\n\ninvolvement in policymaking,\" slip op. at 6, and even the appellants\n\n\"failed to identify policy decisions in which López[-Quiñones] was\n\ndirectly       involved   or    over   which    he    had   influence.\"     Id.   at    8.\n\nPolicymaking is the key function in requiring that the employee be\n\nrequired to belong to the political party in power.                   See Elrod, 427\n\nU.S. at 367 (holding that under the First Amendment \"patronage\n\ndismissals\" must be restricted to \"policymaking positions\").\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f             As stated by the majority at the outset of its opinion:\n\n\"Our decisions . . . ask[] whether a position's functions are those\n\nof   'a   policymaker,   a   privy    to    confidential   information,   a\n\ncommunicator, or some other office holder whose function is such that\n\nparty affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.\"         Slip op.\n\nat 5 (quoting Jiménez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 242\n\n(1st Cir. 1986) (en banc)).     López-Quiñones's job functions do not\n\nfall into any of those categories.      He was essentially a foreman over\n\na group of janitors and similar employees; membership in a particular\n\npolitical party was not a requirement of his job.             It is truly\n\ndifficult to believe that this was not known or easily discoverable\n\nby the appellants after applying our established jurisprudence in\n\nthis area.    After professing to apply our clear and established\n\nprecedent regarding patronage dismissals, the majority makes an\n\nabout-face and inexplicably relies on López-Quiñones's job title\n\nrather than on his responsibilities or functions.          See id. at 11.\n\nFar from clarifying the law, the majority muddles it and, in the\n\nprocess, gives a free ride to government officials who are not\n\nentitled to or deserving of such exceptional treatment.\n\n             I dissent to the granting of qualified immunity to these\n\nofficials.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f",

He sued the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico National Guard, and various officials, seeking relief primarily under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000). This interlocutory appeal presents only the question whether the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from Lopez' damage claims.</p>\n<p>Lopez was hired as director of the general services section of the Puerto Rico National Guard in 1997. In the 2000 elections, the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") defeated the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"). Lopez  a known supporter of the NPP  claims that after the election, he was gradually stripped of his professional duties. In July 2004, disciplinary proceedings were instituted against him within the National Guard.</p>\n<p>Lopez then filed suit in federal district court in Puerto Rico, seeking injunctive and monetary relief. In July 2005, while his suit was pending, Lopez was terminated. He sought preliminary injunctive relief ordering his reinstatement and amended his complaint to reflect the fact of his termination. In October 2006, the district court denied Lopez' request for preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the individual defendants moved for a ruling on their previously asserted defense of qualified immunity. They urged that Lopez' position was not protected from political patronage firings under the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> line of cases, <i>see </i><i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), and that in any event, defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because any such protection was not clearly established at the time of Lopez' termination.</p>\n<p>The district court denied the motion, and defendants filed this interlocutory appeal. Although the district court's order is not a final disposition of the case, we have jurisdiction to the extent defendants seek review of the district court's denial of their qualified immunity defense, <i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> 485 F.3d 5, 8-9 (1st Cir.2007), but only so far as it rests on a legal ruling rather than a factual dispute. <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir.2004). As to the legal questions, our review is <i>de novo. </i><i>Galloza v. Foy,</i> 389 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The qualified immunity defense depends on whether the nature of Lopez' position was such that defendants were entitled to consider his political affiliation as a job qualification and, even if they were not, whether a reasonable officer at the time would have understood patronage dismissal to be barred. <i>See </i><i>Limone v. Condon,</i> 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.2004). Analytically, the second question may often be answered without resolving the first, but in accordance with <i>Saucier</i>'s preferred approach, we generally  although not always  answer the questions in sequence. <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).</p>\n<p>In <i>Elrod,</i> the Supreme Court announced a new rule rendering patronage firings a violation of the First Amendment save where political affiliation is an appropriate qualification for the particular position. <i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 367-68, 96 S.Ct. 2673; <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287. Yet, as we said in <i>Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> 140 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 525 U.S. 961, 119 S.Ct. 403, 142 L.Ed.2d 327 (1998), doctrine in this area remains</p>\n<blockquote>largely a porridge of general statements and variables: positions are less likely to be protected to the extent that they are \"higher,\" more \"political,\" more \"confidential,\" and so on; duties prevail over <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> titles; everything depends on circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p>Our decisions have asked whether a position's functions are those of \"a policymaker, a privy to confidential information, a communicator, or some other office holder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.\" <i>Jimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> 807 F.2d 236, 242 (1st Cir. 1986) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> 481 U.S. 1014, 107 S.Ct. 1888, 95 L.Ed.2d 496 (1987); <i>see also </i><i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 45. \"Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions.\" <i>Olmeda v. Ortiz-Quinonez,</i> 434 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>We also consider the position's \"relative pay\" and whether it entails \"technical competence, power to control others, authority to speak in the name of policymakers, public perception, contact with elected officials and responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders.\" <i>Mendez-Palou v. Rohena-Betancourt,</i> 813 F.2d 1255, 1259 (1st Cir.1987). Under the case law, the classification of a position as \"career\" (rather than \"trust\") under Puerto Rico law is relevant, although not dispositive. <i>Roldan-Plumey v. Cerezo-Suarez,</i> 115 F.3d 58, 64-65 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>As director of the general services section, Lopez headed the unit of the Guard responsible for inventory (not including military equipment), utilities, property maintenance and related functions. He supervised approximately thirty other employees. Both are factors tending to indicate that one's position involves discretionary judgments, which in turn often entail policymaking. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales,</i> 415 F.3d 127, 132 (1st Cir.2005). He earned just over $30,000 per year and his job classification form said that review of his work was \"superficial\" (as opposed to \"thorough\").</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Lopez' position was classified as a \"career\" position under Puerto Rico law and a closer look at his detailed job description suggests that he had modest, if any, involvement in policymaking. True, the first listed responsibility is spacious (\"Plans, coordinates and supervises the activities of the general services section relating to maintenance, property, purchasing, transportation, reproduction, inventory, receiving equipment, leasing of establishments and general services\"), but almost all of the specifics are routine and fairly pedestrian. They include (merely as examples) responsibility for:</p>\n<blockquote>hiring air-conditioning and radio maintenance services, radios, fumigation, cleaning and others, whether with federal or state funds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>matters relating to the telephone service (switchboard) and state transportation (regulations, use, etc.);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>seeing that the agency is provided with [utility] service of water, electricity and telephone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>supervis[ing] the work of employees working in the state warehouse, their purchasing, inventories, etc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>oversee[ing] proper filling in of purchasing logs and controls and control of existing property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>revis[ing] and coordinat[ing] matters relating to the maintenance and cleaning of the agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[supervising] employee training in the computer and programming system.</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, a number of the functions involve reporting and other paperwork matters; most look mechanical (<i>e.g.,</i> \"responsible for seeing that all contracts are filed with the P.R. Comptroller's Office pursuant to provisions\"), although a few <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> could  but not necessarily would  involve policy judgments depending on the precise role Lopez actually played in the process (<i>e.g.,</i> \"supervises bids carried out in the section's purchasing area\").</p>\n<p>So far as appears, Lopez' job did not involve advising any senior officials on policy matters. He did not operate as a spokesperson or otherwise liaise with the public or other government agencies, except in ways largely ministerial. His job does not appear to have entailed discretionary judgments involving the implementation of policy, broadly understood. As to bid supervision, the district court found that Puerto Rico law largely divested Lopez of discretion in handling bids of significant size.</p>\n<p>Lopez did supervise approximately thirty other employees, but they were mostly janitors and other lower-level employees. It is hard to see how Lopez' position implicates significant policy issues, let alone \"partisan political interests ... [or] concerns,\" <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 519, 100 S.Ct. 1287, nor does he appear to be one of those mid-or upper-level officials or employees who are \"significantly connected to policy-making.\" <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 45.</p>\n<p>Although Lopez reported directly to a political appointee, defendants have failed to identify policy decisions in which Lopez was directly involved or over which he had influence. Their main argument is that the Puerto Rico National Guard is involved in operations  such as law enforcement and natural disaster relief  that involve policymaking and implicate partisan concerns; that as director of general services Lopez was involved in procuring and maintaining the Guard's inventory and property; and that because a proper supply chain is critical to any successful operation, Lopez was well positioned to frustrate any programs or operations with which he disagreed.</p>\n<p>This argument proves too much. Any malfunctioning cog can jam the gears. An ability to undermine operations through incompetence or malfeasance does not mean the actor engaged in policymaking or was a confidante or spokesman for policymakers. <i>Hadfield v. McDonough,</i> 407 F.3d 11, 18 n. 4 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 546 U.S. 961, 126 S.Ct. 480, 163 L.Ed.2d 363 (2005). On \"the spectrum between policymaker and clerk,\" <i>Mendez-Palou,</i> 813 F.2d at 1259, Lopez was closer to the latter and is, at least on the present record, protected under <i>Elrod.</i> Whether his termination was in fact politically motivated is a quite different question.</p>\n<p>Still remaining is the question whether his status was clearly established at the time of his termination. Of course, the abstract right of a non-policy-related employee to be free from politically motivated termination dates from <i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti;</i> but this is not enough to defeat qualified immunity. The purpose of qualified immunity is to protect reasonable, if mistaken, decision making by government officials, <i>Jordan v. Carter,</i> 428 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir.2005), and it does not matter whether the mistake is related to broad principle or specific application.</p>\n<p>The crucial question here is whether a reasonable official acting at the time of Lopez' termination should have known on what side of the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> line <i>Lopez' own position</i> fell. <i>Mendez-Palou,</i> 813 F.2d at 1259. Largely for prudential reasons, the test is not subjective but asks what a reasonable official would have thought. <i>Pagan v. Calderon,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir.2006). On the present facts, this is a close call but the issue is treated as one of law, <i>Ruiz-Casillas,</i> 415 F.3d at 131; and, in disagreement with the able district judge, we believe that as the law stood when the decision was made a reasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> official could (albeit mistakenly) have deemed Lopez outside <i>Elrod/Branti</i>'s protection.</p>\n<p>As already explained, a few features of Lopez' position in combination might have led reasonable superiors of Lopez involved in the termination decision to believe he was subject to patronage dismissal: for example, that he headed the unit in question, that some of his duties were broadly phrased (even if seemingly less impressive in practice), that he was fairly well paid and his position lightly supervised, that he reported directly to a political appointee and that he supervised thirty other employees.</p>\n<p>Defendants also point to two prior First Circuit opinions in which we held that the Personnel and General Services Officer in the Ombudsman's Office and the Regional Director of the Puerto Rico General Services Administration were subject to political dismissal. <i>See </i><i>Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves,</i> 274 F.3d 4 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Roman Melendez v. Inclan,</i> 826 F.2d 130 (1st Cir.1987). Both cases are distinguishable because the jobs were classified as \"trust\" positions, and involved supervision of large numbers of employees, discretionary provision of government services, and/or representation of the agency before the public and other agencies.</p>\n<p>But, weighing in defendants' favor, the job titles are similar, and in <i>Roman Melendez</i> we noted that \"in every case concerning regional directors of government agencies in Puerto Rico, we have concluded, at least for purposes of qualified immunity, that a regional director was, in fact, a policymaker.\" 826 F.2d at 134. Those reading our past decisions like <i>Duriex-Gauthier</i> could reasonably have believed that in general, middle managers with impressive sounding titles and duties were generally outside the protected category.</p>\n<p>The district court's own contrary decision rests significantly on a possible ambiguity in our own case law, which we now repair. Some of our precedents may suggest that even if an official has significant policymaking responsibility, he is still protected unless it is <i>also</i> established that the policy judgments are those for which \"partisan\" political motivations or judgments are appropriate, <i>e.g., </i><i>Jimenez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 241-42; by contrast, other language from our case law indicates that involvement in policy or matters implicating political disagreement is sufficient. <i>E.g., </i><i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 46; <i>see also </i><i>Tomczak v. City of Chicago,</i> 765 F.2d 633, 641 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p>It is conceivable that there are rare cases where the distinction might matter  say, a high official whose duties were nonetheless entirely technical. <i>Jimenez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 240. But for the most part policymaking is in the nature of things the basis for preserving the right of the democratic political process to operate; civil service protections can be afforded by statute but the Constitution does not require them. The reference to \"partisan\" politics comes from <i>Branti</i> but it is far from clear that it comprised a separate test. 445 U.S. at 519, 100 S.Ct. 1287.</p>\n<p>And for his part, plaintiff has not cited any analogous First Circuit cases that would have put defendants on notice of jeopardy. Given past precedent, we cannot say it was clearly established that Lopez, a director of a significant unit within the Puerto Rico National Guard, was insulated from political dismissal. Accordingly, while Lopez may seek injunctive relief for his termination, he may not obtain monetary relief from the individual defendants in their personal capacities.</p>\n<p>The order denying qualified immunity is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> decision. The damage claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacities are barred but the suit may otherwise proceed. All parties will bear their own costs.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part, Dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Since 1976, the United States Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment forbids the discharge of \"public employees solely for not being supporters of the political party in power, unless party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position involved.\" <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 64, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990) (citing <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) and <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980)). That inquiry  whether political affiliation is a valid requirement of the job in question  is the necessary starting point for political discharge cases. <i>Limone v. Condon,</i> 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>This circuit leads the nation as one of the most prolific generators of political discrimination cases; in this area of litigation, the District of Puerto Rico has the dubious distinction of being the most fecund district in the circuit. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Santiago v. Hernández-Pérez,</i> 488 F.3d 465, 466 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[I]n Puerto Rico, a change between the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) and the New Progressive Party (NPP) [gives rise to] overly zealous political operatives of the prevailing party terminat[ing], demot[ing], or reduc[ing] the salaries of employees affiliated with the outgoing opposition party.\"). As a result of the proliferation of these cases and their public notoriety, the legal precepts established by them are widely known in Puerto Rico, particularly by those in public administration. It is, therefore, inconceivable in this day and age that a reasonable public official would by-pass an inquest into whether a position in a government agency requires political affiliation before taking the drastic action of firing an employee based on party affiliation. Considering the state of the law, one who fails to do so can hardly be classified as a <i>reasonable</i> public official.</p>\n<p>Any reasonable public official conducting such an inquiry would have concluded that López-Quiñones's position was not one requiring political affiliation. Indeed, by following the long-established case law in this circuit, the majority properly reaches the conclusion that López-Quiñones's non-policy related position was protected from political patronage dismissal. Op. at 27 (\"On the spectrum between policymaker and clerk, López[-Quiñones] was closer to the latter and is, at least on the present record, protected under <i>Elrod.</i>\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>In reaching this conclusion, the majority begins its analysis with López-Quiñones's detailed job description. <i>See</i> Op. at 25-26. Based on the job description, the majority finds that: (1) López-Quiñones was holding a \"career\" position under Puerto Rico law, <i>id.</i> at 26; (2) \"almost all of the specific[] [tasks were] routine and fairly pedestrian,\" <i>id.</i> at 26-27; (3) his reporting and paperwork duties \"most[ly] look mechanical,\" <i>id.;</i> (4) he was \"not involve[d in] advising any senior officials in policy matters,\" <i>id.</i> at 27; (5) he \"did not operate as a spokesperson or otherwise liaise with the public or other government agencies, except in ways largely ministerial,\" <i>id.;</i> (6) he did not have \"discretionary judgment[ ] involving the implementation of policy, broadly speaking,\" <i>id.;</i> and (7) he supervised \"mostly janitors and other low-level employees.\" <i>Id.</i> Significantly, citing to both <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 519, 100 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> 1287, and to <i>Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> 140 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir.1998), the majority states that \"[i]t is hard to see how López[-Quiñones's] position implicates significant policy issues, let alone `partisan political interests ... [or] concerns,' ... nor does he appear to be one of those mid- or upper-level officials or employees who are `significantly connected to policy-making.'\" Op. at 27. On these facts, the majority concludes that López-Quiñones's position was not subject to patronage dismissal. I am in full agreement.</p>\n<p>It is in the granting of immunity that I part company with my learned colleagues. Under our qualified immunity law, after finding that a constitutional right was violated, we turn to whether the law was clearly established at the time of the violation and whether a reasonable public officer would have understood that he was violating that right. <i>See </i><i>Sueiro Vázquez v. Torregrosa de la Rosa,</i> 494 F.3d 227, 234 (1st Cir.2007). I disagree with the majority's conclusion that \"as the law stood ... a reasonable official could (albeit mistakenly) have deemed López[-Quiñones] outside <i>Elrod/Branti</i>'s protection.\" Op. at 27-28. As made evident by the majority's own application of our clearly established law, López-Quiñones's position was not subject to patronage dismissal. In deciding to terminate López-Quiñones from his position, the officials in this case recklessly ignored the established law of this circuit. Such behavior should lead to the dispossession of the mantle of qualified immunity, rather than the extension of this privilege to them.</p>\n<p>The majority is able to conclude that the appellants are entitled to immunity because it gives undue weight to the fact that López-Quiñones's \"job title [is] similar\" to two prior cases \"concerning regional directors of government agencies in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Id.</i> at 28 (citing <i>Duriex-Gauthier v. López-Nieves,</i> 274 F.3d 4 (1st Cir.2001) and <i>Román Meléndez v. Inclán,</i> 826 F.2d 130 (1st Cir.1987)). In so doing, the majority violates those very principles to which it claims adherence only a few pages earlier. As we have warned, the inquiry into the legitimacy of political patronage requires an inquiry that goes beneath the mere title of the position. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Olmeda v. Ortiz-Quiñonez,</i> 434 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions.\" (internal citations omitted)); <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 44 (noting that \"duties prevail over titles\"). Unfortunately, it appears that the majority's invocation of this principle was mere lip service; in its grant of immunity, the majority inexplicably applies an entirely different and contradictory standard.</p>\n<p>Even if the job titles in <i>Duriex-Gauthier</i> and <i>Román Meléndez</i> are similar to that of López-Quiñones, the employees' actual responsibilities are substantially different. The employees in <i>Duriex-Gauthier</i> and <i>Román Meléndez</i> held \"trust positions;\" exercised meaningful supervision of a large number of employees; enjoyed discretion over the particular government services under their aegis; and represented their respective agencies before the public and other government entities. <i>Duriex-Gauthier,</i> 274 F.3d at 7-8, 10; <i>Román Meléndez,</i> 826 F.2d at 134-35. In contrast, none of those prerogatives or powers are present here.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, unlike the employees in <i>Duriex-Gauthier</i> and <i>Román Meléndez,</i> López-Quiñones was not involved in making or recommending any agency policy. There is nothing in the record to support a finding that López-Quiñones was a policymaker. The majority opinion describes him as having only \"modest, if any, involvement in policymaking,\" Op. at 26, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> even the appellants \"failed to identify policy decisions in which López[-Quiñones] was directly involved or over which he had influence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. Policymaking is the key function in requiring that the employee be required to belong to the political party in power. <i>See </i><i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. 2673 (holding that under the First Amendment \"patronage dismissals\" must be restricted to \"policymaking positions\").</p>\n<p>As stated by the majority at the outset of its opinion: \"Our decisions . . . ask[ ] whether a position's functions are those of `a policymaker, a privy to confidential information, a communicator, or some other office holder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.'\" Op. at 26 (quoting <i>Jiménez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> 807 F.2d 236, 242 (1st Cir.1986) (en banc)). López-Quiñones's job functions do not fall into any of those categories. He was essentially a foreman over a group of janitors and similar employees; membership in a particular political party was not a requirement of his job. It is truly difficult to believe that this was not known or easily discoverable by the appellants after applying our established jurisprudence in this area. After professing to apply our clear and established precedent regarding patronage dismissals, the majority makes an about-face and inexplicably relies on López-Quiñones's job title rather than on his responsibilities or functions. <i>See id.</i> at 28. Far from clarifying the law, the majority muddles it and, in the process, gives a free ride to government officials who are not entitled to or deserving of such exceptional treatment.</p>\n<p>I dissent to the granting of qualified immunity to these officials.</p>\n</div>",

He sued the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico National Guard, and various officials, seeking relief primarily under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000). This interlocutory appeal presents only the question whether the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from Lopez' damage claims.</p>\n<p>Lopez was hired as director of the general services section of the Puerto Rico National Guard in 1997. In the 2000 elections, the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") defeated the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"). Lopez  a known supporter of the NPP  claims that after the election, he was gradually stripped of his professional duties. In July 2004, disciplinary proceedings were instituted against him within the National Guard.</p>\n<p>Lopez then filed suit in federal district court in Puerto Rico, seeking injunctive and monetary relief. In July 2005, while his suit was pending, Lopez was terminated. He sought preliminary injunctive relief ordering his reinstatement and amended his complaint to reflect the fact of his termination. In October 2006, the district court denied Lopez' request for preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the individual defendants moved for a ruling on their previously asserted defense of qualified immunity.

Under the case law, the classification of a position as \"career\" (rather than \"trust\") under Puerto Rico law is relevant, although not dispositive. <i>Roldan-Plumey v.

He supervised approximately thirty other employees. Both are factors tending to indicate that one's position involves discretionary judgments, which in turn often entail policymaking. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201665\"><a href=\"/opinion/201665/ruiz-casillas-v-camacho-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir.2005). He earned just over $30,000 per year and his job classification form said that review of his work was \"superficial\" (as opposed to \"thorough\").</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Lopez' position was classified as a \"career\" position under Puerto Rico law and a closer look at his detailed job description suggests that he had modest, if any, involvement in policymaking. True, the first listed responsibility is spacious (\"Plans, coordinates and supervises the activities of the general services section relating to maintenance, property, purchasing, transportation, reproduction, inventory, receiving equipment, leasing of establishments and general services\"), but almost all of the specifics are routine and fairly pedestrian. They include (merely as examples) responsibility for:</p>\n<blockquote>hiring air-conditioning and radio maintenance services, radios, fumigation, cleaning and others, whether with federal or state funds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>matters relating to the telephone service (switchboard) and state transportation (regulations, use, etc.);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>seeing that the agency is provided with [utility] service of water, electricity and telephone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>supervis[ing] the work of employees working in the state warehouse, their purchasing, inventories, etc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>oversee[ing] proper filling in of purchasing logs and controls and control of existing property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>revis[ing] and coordinat[ing] matters relating to the maintenance and cleaning of the agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[supervising] employee training in the computer and programming system.</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, a number of the functions involve reporting and other paperwork matters; most look mechanical (<i>e.g.,</i> \"responsible for seeing that all contracts are filed with the P.R. Comptroller's Office pursuant to provisions\"), although a few <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> could  but not necessarily would  involve policy judgments depending on the precise role Lopez actually played in the process (<i>e.g.,</i> \"supervises bids carried out in the section's purchasing area\").</p>\n<p>So far as appears, Lopez' job did not involve advising any senior officials on policy matters. He did not operate as a spokesperson or otherwise liaise with the public or other government agencies, except in ways largely ministerial. His job does not appear to have entailed discretionary judgments involving the implementation of policy, broadly understood. As to bid supervision, the district court found that Puerto Rico law largely divested Lopez of discretion in handling bids of significant size.</p>\n<p>Lopez did supervise approximately thirty other employees, but they were mostly janitors and other lower-level employees. It is hard to see how Lopez' position implicates significant policy issues, let alone \"partisan political interests ... [or] concerns,\" <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 519, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Their main argument is that the Puerto Rico National Guard is involved in operations  such as law enforcement and natural disaster relief  that involve policymaking and implicate partisan concerns; that as director of general services Lopez was involved in procuring and maintaining the Guard's inventory and property; and that because a proper supply chain is critical to any successful operation, Lopez was well positioned to frustrate any programs or operations with which he disagreed.</p>\n<p>This argument proves too much. Any malfunctioning cog can jam the gears. An ability to undermine operations through incompetence or malfeasance does not mean the actor engaged in policymaking or was a confidante or spokesman for policymakers. <i>Hadfield v.

Of course, the abstract right of a non-policy-related employee to be free from politically motivated termination dates from <i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti;</i> but this is not enough to defeat qualified immunity.

On the present facts, this is a close call but the issue is treated as one of law, <i>Ruiz-Casillas,</i> 415 F.3d at 131; and, in disagreement with the able district judge, we believe that as the law stood when the decision was made a reasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> official could (albeit mistakenly) have deemed Lopez outside <i>Elrod/Branti</i>'s protection.</p>\n<p>As already explained, a few features of Lopez' position in combination might have led reasonable superiors of Lopez involved in the termination decision to believe he was subject to patronage dismissal: for example, that he headed the unit in question, that some of his duties were broadly phrased (even if seemingly less impressive in practice), that he was fairly well paid and his position lightly supervised, that he reported directly to a political appointee and that he supervised thirty other employees.</p>\n<p>Defendants also point to two prior First Circuit opinions in which we held that the Personnel and General Services Officer in the Ombudsman's Office and the Regional Director of the Puerto Rico General Services Administration were subject to political dismissal. <i>See </i><i>Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199731\"><a href=\"/opinion/199731/duriex-gauthier-v-lopez-nieves/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001); <i>Roman Melendez v. Inclan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492624\"><a href=\"/opinion/492624/pedro-roman-melendez-v-roberto-inclan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1987). Both cases are distinguishable because the jobs were classified as \"trust\" positions, and involved supervision of large numbers of employees, discretionary provision of government services, and/or representation of the agency before the public and other agencies.</p>\n<p>But, weighing in defendants' favor, the job titles are similar, and in <i>Roman Melendez</i> we noted that \"in every case concerning regional directors of government agencies in Puerto Rico, we have concluded, at least for purposes of qualified immunity, that a regional director was, in fact, a policymaker.\" 826 F.2d at 134. Those reading our past decisions like <i>Duriex-Gauthier</i> could reasonably have believed that in general, middle managers with impressive sounding titles and duties were generally outside the protected category.</p>\n<p>The district court's own contrary decision rests significantly on a possible ambiguity in our own case law, which we now repair. Some of our precedents may suggest that even if an official has significant policymaking responsibility, he is still protected unless it is <i>also</i> established that the policy judgments are those for which \"partisan\" political motivations or judgments are appropriate, <i>e.g., </i><i>Jimenez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 241-42; by contrast, other language from our case law indicates that involvement in policy or matters implicating political disagreement is sufficient. <i>E.g., </i><i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 46; <i>see also </i><i>Tomczak v. City of Chicago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454321\"><a href=\"/opinion/454321/donald-c-tomczak-v-the-city-of-chicago-an-illinois-municipal-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span>, 641 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p>It is conceivable that there are rare cases where the distinction might matter  say, a high official whose duties were nonetheless entirely technical. <i>Jimenez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 240. But for the most part policymaking is in the nature of things the basis for preserving the right of the democratic political process to operate; civil service protections can be afforded by statute but the Constitution does not require them. The reference to \"partisan\" politics comes from <i>Branti</i> but it is far from clear that it comprised a separate test. 445 U.S. at 519, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>And for his part, plaintiff has not cited any analogous First Circuit cases that would have put defendants on notice of jeopardy. Given past precedent, we cannot say it was clearly established that Lopez, a director of a significant unit within the Puerto Rico National Guard, was insulated from political dismissal. Accordingly, while Lopez may seek injunctive relief for his termination, he may not obtain monetary relief from the individual defendants in their personal capacities.</p>\n<p>The order denying qualified immunity is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> decision. The damage claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacities are barred but the suit may otherwise proceed. All parties will bear their own costs.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part, Dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Since 1976, the United States Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment forbids the discharge of \"public employees solely for not being supporters of the political party in power, unless party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position involved.\" <i>Rutan v.

That inquiry  whether political affiliation is a valid requirement of the job in question  is the necessary starting point for political discharge cases. <i>Limone v. Condon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201063\"><a href=\"/opinion/201063/limone-v-condon/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>This circuit leads the nation as one of the most prolific generators of political discrimination cases; in this area of litigation, the District of Puerto Rico has the dubious distinction of being the most fecund district in the circuit. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Santiago v. Hernández-Pérez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202752\"><a href=\"/opinion/202752/morales-santiago-v-hernandez-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 466 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[I]n Puerto Rico, a change between the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) and the New Progressive Party (NPP) [gives rise to] overly zealous political operatives of the prevailing party terminat[ing], demot[ing], or reduc[ing] the salaries of employees affiliated with the outgoing opposition party.\"). As a result of the proliferation of these cases and their public notoriety, the legal precepts established by them are widely known in Puerto Rico, particularly by those in public administration. It is, therefore, inconceivable in this day and age that a reasonable public official would by-pass an inquest into whether a position in a government agency requires political affiliation before taking the drastic action of firing an employee based on party affiliation. Considering the state of the law, one who fails to do so can hardly be classified as a <i>reasonable</i> public official.</p>\n<p>Any reasonable public official conducting such an inquiry would have concluded that López-Quiñones's position was not one requiring political affiliation. Indeed, by following the long-established case law in this circuit, the majority properly reaches the conclusion that López-Quiñones's non-policy related position was protected from political patronage dismissal. Op. at 27 (\"On the spectrum between policymaker and clerk, López[-Quiñones] was closer to the latter and is, at least on the present record, protected under <i>Elrod.</i>\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>In reaching this conclusion, the majority begins its analysis with López-Quiñones's detailed job description. <i>See</i> Op. at 25-26. Based on the job description, the majority finds that: (1) López-Quiñones was holding a \"career\" position under Puerto Rico law, <i>id.</i> at 26; (2) \"almost all of the specific[] [tasks were] routine and fairly pedestrian,\" <i>id.</i> at 26-27; (3) his reporting and paperwork duties \"most[ly] look mechanical,\" <i>id.;</i> (4) he was \"not involve[d in] advising any senior officials in policy matters,\" <i>id.</i> at 27; (5) he \"did not operate as a spokesperson or otherwise liaise with the public or other government agencies, except in ways largely ministerial,\" <i>id.;</i> (6) he did not have \"discretionary judgment[ ] involving the implementation of policy, broadly speaking,\" <i>id.;</i> and (7) he supervised \"mostly janitors and other low-level employees.\" <i>Id.</i> Significantly, citing to both <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 519, 100 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> 1287, and to <i>Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197945\"><a href=\"/opinion/197945/flynn-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.1998), the majority states that \"[i]t is hard to see how López[-Quiñones's] position implicates significant policy issues, let alone `partisan political interests ... [or] concerns,' ... nor does he appear to be one of those mid- or upper-level officials or employees who are `significantly connected to policy-making.'\" Op. at 27. On these facts, the majority concludes that López-Quiñones's position was not subject to patronage dismissal. I am in full agreement.</p>\n<p>It is in the granting of immunity that I part company with my learned colleagues. Under our qualified immunity law, after finding that a constitutional right was violated, we turn to whether the law was clearly established at the time of the violation and whether a reasonable public officer would have understood that he was violating that right. <i>See </i><i>Sueiro Vázquez v. Torregrosa de la Rosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202853\"><a href=\"/opinion/202853/sueiro-vazquez-v-torregrosa-de-la-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 234 (1st Cir.2007). I disagree with the majority's conclusion that \"as the law stood ... a reasonable official could (albeit mistakenly) have deemed López[-Quiñones] outside <i>Elrod/Branti</i>'s protection.\" Op. at 27-28. As made evident by the majority's own application of our clearly established law, López-Quiñones's position was not subject to patronage dismissal. In deciding to terminate López-Quiñones from his position, the officials in this case recklessly ignored the established law of this circuit. Such behavior should lead to the dispossession of the mantle of qualified immunity, rather than the extension of this privilege to them.</p>\n<p>The majority is able to conclude that the appellants are entitled to immunity because it gives undue weight to the fact that López-Quiñones's \"job title [is] similar\" to two prior cases \"concerning regional directors of government agencies in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Id.</i> at 28 (citing <i>Duriex-Gauthier v. López-Nieves,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199731\"><a href=\"/opinion/199731/duriex-gauthier-v-lopez-nieves/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001) and <i>Román Meléndez v. Inclán,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492624\"><a href=\"/opinion/492624/pedro-roman-melendez-v-roberto-inclan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1987)). In so doing, the majority violates those very principles to which it claims adherence only a few pages earlier. As we have warned, the inquiry into the legitimacy of political patronage requires an inquiry that goes beneath the mere title of the position. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Olmeda v. Ortiz-Quiñonez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202014\"><a href=\"/opinion/202014/olmeda-v-ortiz-quinones/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions.\" (internal citations omitted)); <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 44 (noting that \"duties prevail over titles\"). Unfortunately, it appears that the majority's invocation of this principle was mere lip service; in its grant of immunity, the majority inexplicably applies an entirely different and contradictory standard.</p>\n<p>Even if the job titles in <i>Duriex-Gauthier</i> and <i>Román Meléndez</i> are similar to that of López-Quiñones, the employees' actual responsibilities are substantially different. The employees in <i>Duriex-Gauthier</i> and <i>Román Meléndez</i> held \"trust positions;\" exercised meaningful supervision of a large number of employees; enjoyed discretion over the particular government services under their aegis; and represented their respective agencies before the public and other government entities. <i>Duriex-Gauthier,</i> 274 F.3d at 7-8, 10; <i>Román Meléndez,</i> 826 F.2d at 134-35. In contrast, none of those prerogatives or powers are present here.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, unlike the employees in <i>Duriex-Gauthier</i> and <i>Román Meléndez,</i> López-Quiñones was not involved in making or recommending any agency policy. There is nothing in the record to support a finding that López-Quiñones was a policymaker. The majority opinion describes him as having only \"modest, if any, involvement in policymaking,\" Op. at 26, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> even the appellants \"failed to identify policy decisions in which López[-Quiñones] was directly involved or over which he had influence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. Policymaking is the key function in requiring that the employee be required to belong to the political party in power. <i>See </i><i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 367, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2673</span></a></span> (holding that under the First Amendment \"patronage dismissals\" must be restricted to \"policymaking positions\").</p>\n<p>As stated by the majority at the outset of its opinion: \"Our decisions . . . ask[ ] whether a position's functions are those of `a policymaker, a privy to confidential information, a communicator, or some other office holder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.'\" Op. at 26 (quoting <i>Jiménez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480539\"><a href=\"/opinion/480539/arnaldo-jimenez-fuentes-v-honorable-jaime-torres-gaztambide/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 242 (1st Cir.1986) (en banc)). López-Quiñones's job functions do not fall into any of those categories. He was essentially a foreman over a group of janitors and similar employees; membership in a particular political party was not a requirement of his job. It is truly difficult to believe that this was not known or easily discoverable by the appellants after applying our established jurisprudence in this area. After professing to apply our clear and established precedent regarding patronage dismissals, the majority makes an about-face and inexplicably relies on López-Quiñones's job title rather than on his responsibilities or functions. <i>See id.</i> at 28. Far from clarifying the law, the majority muddles it and, in the process, gives a free ride to government officials who are not entitled to or deserving of such exceptional treatment.</p>\n<p>I dissent to the granting of qualified immunity to these officials.</p>\n</div>",
