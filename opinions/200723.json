Saia was on brief for appellants.\n          Joshua M. Davis, with whom James A. Aloisi, Jr. and\nPeter N.

Peter A. Doran and\n\nWendy E. Saunders brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nagainst the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, its chairman and\n\nmembers of its board (collectively, “MTA”).                  Plaintiffs complain\n\nthat   the    FAST   LANE   Discount      Program     (“FLDP”       or    “program”)\n\nestablished by MTA violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the\n\nUnited States Constitution.           U.S. CONST . art. I, § 8, cl. 3.            That\n\nprogram permits drivers of automobiles equipped with a transponder\n\nsold by MTA to pass through certain toll plazas and tunnels in the\n\nBoston    area   for    a   discounted        toll   which    is    electronically\n\ncollected.       Plaintiffs contend that the program discriminates\n\nagainst   nonresidents      of   Massachusetts        and    does    not       serve   a\n\nlegitimate local interest.             The district court dismissed the\n\ncomplaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for\n\nfailure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.                       It held\n\nthat the FLDP did not discriminate against out-of-state residents\n\nand did not excessively burden interstate commerce.                      The district\n\ncourt had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, and we\n\nhave   jurisdiction     under    28   U.S.C.     §   1291.     For       the   reasons\n\ndiscussed below, we affirm.\n\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n             In March 1997 Massachusetts Governor William Weld signed\n\nthe Metropolitan Highway Systems bill authorizing MTA to increase\n\ntolls at the Allston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas from $.50\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fto $1.00, and at the Ted Williams Tunnel and the Sumner Tunnel from\n\n$2.00 to $3.00.        The revenue from these toll increases would help\n\nfinance     Boston’s    Central     Artery/Third       Harbor     Tunnel     Project,\n\ncommonly known as the “Big Dig.”                  That project aims to bury\n\nstretches of Interstate 93 beneath the city and extend Interstate\n\n90    to   Logan    International    Airport.          MTA   is   responsible      for\n\ngenerating through tolls approximately $1.5 billion of the nearly\n\n$6 billion needed to complete work on the Interstate 90 segment.\n\n             The toll increase was scheduled to go into effect on\n\nJanuary 1, 2002.       In response to public opposition, MTA postponed\n\nthe increase and proposed to implement a Resident Only Discount\n\nProgram, under which state residents who drove automobiles equipped\n\nwith FAST LANE transponders would receive toll discounts of $.25 at\n\nthe Allston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas and $.50 at the\n\ntunnels.\n\n             The FAST LANE system allows vehicles equipped with a\n\ntransponder to pass through toll plazas without having to stop and\n\npay. Participants must purchase a transponder from MTA for $27.50.\n\nThe    transponder     is    a   small   plastic       device     attached    to   the\n\nwindshield. It signals the car’s identity to an MTA facility which\n\nautomatically charges the toll to the driver’s account.                      Drivers\n\ngenerally assign their account to their credit card which is billed\n\n$20   at   the     outset;   thereafter,       tolls   are   deducted      until   $10\n\nremains, at which point an additional $10 is billed to replenish\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthe account.         Cars equipped with transponders used in other cities\n\nthat—like the E-Z Pass system—are interoperable, may drive through\n\nFAST       LANE    toll   gates   without   stopping,   but   do   not   receive\n\ndiscounts.1\n\n                  Before the Resident Only Discount Program went into\n\neffect, a newspaper article questioned whether it violated the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause of the Constitution.                  In response, MTA\n\nmodified the program to apply to all drivers of automobiles,\n\nresident or not, equipped with FAST LANE transponders.                     MTA’s\n\nchairman noted that as a result a few thousand out-of-state FAST\n\nLANE subscribers, most of whom commute from Connecticut, would\n\nbecome eligible for discounts.\n\n                  On July 4, 2002, plaintiff Doran drove through the\n\nAllston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas.               Doran is a Vermont\n\nresident who did not subscribe to the FLDP, so he paid the full\n\ntolls.       On July 5, plaintiff Saunders drove through the same toll\n\nplazas.      She is a New York resident who had an E-Z Pass but no FAST\n\nLANE transponder, so she also paid the full tolls.\n\n                  Doran and Saunders then filed this action alleging that\n\nMTA’s discount system violates the dormant Commerce Clause, and\n\nmoved for a preliminary injunction.             Finding that the complaint\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      E-Z Pass is the equivalent electronic toll payment system\nused by the State of New York.\n\n                                        -4-\n\ffailed to state a claim, the district court granted MTA’s motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\nI.          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            We review “the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,\n\ntaking the allegations in the complaint as true and making all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff.”        Rockwell v. Cape Cod\n\nHosp., 26 F.3d 254, 255 (1st Cir. 1994).            However, we are not\n\nrequired    to   accept   legal   conclusions.     New   England   Cleaning\n\nServs. v. American Arbitration Ass’n, 199 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).     A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(6) should succeed only when “it is clear that no relief could\n\nbe granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent\n\nwith the allegation.”      Gorski v. New Hampshire Dep’t of Corr., 290\n\nF.3d 466, 473 (1st. Cir. 2002) (citing Hishon v. King & Spalding,\n\n467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984)).\n\nII.         THE MERITS\n\n            The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution\n\ngrants Congress the power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the\n\nseveral States.”      U.S. CONST . art. I, § 8, cl. 3.        The Commerce\n\nClause “not only grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce\n\namong the States, but also directly limits the power of the States\n\nto discriminate against interstate commerce.”            New Energy Co. v.\n\nLimbach, 486 U.S. 269, 273 (1988).         This “dormant” Commerce Clause\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f“prohibits    economic    protectionism—that   is,   regulatory   measures\n\ndesigned to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-\n\nstate competitors.”       Id.   We must decide whether plaintiffs have\n\nstated a claim that the FLDP offends the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\n             Plaintiffs advance four contentions in support of their\n\nclaim:\n\n             1) That the FLDP imposes a nonuniform and noncompensatory\n\nuser fee unrelated to actual highway usage;\n\n             2) That it is discriminatory on its face or in practical\n\neffect;\n\n             3) That it does not serve a legitimate local interest\n\nunrelated to economic protectionism; and\n\n             4) That its cumulative effects on commerce, by shifting\n\nhighway costs to nonresidents, are excessive.           Appellants’ Br. at\n\n9.\n\n             We address each of these contentions in turn.2\n\n             A.     The FLDP Does Not Impose a\n                    Nonuniform and Noncompensatory\n                    User Fee\n\n             Plaintiffs argue that the FLDP violates the Commerce\n\nClause because it does not charge every user the same amount for\n\nidentical     use   and     because    the   discount     is   nonuniform,\n\n\n     2\n      Because we find other arguments to fully support MTA’s\nposition, we do not address the market participant issue.      MTA\ncontends that the dormant Commerce Clause does not even apply to\nthis case because of the market participant exception. See Reeves,\nInc. v. Stake, 449 U.S. 429 (1980).\n\n                                      -6-\n\fnoncompensatory and unrelated to actual highway usage or to specific\n\nservices provided by MTA.   To begin with, the argument is factually\n\nflawed. The FLDP is available on identical terms to drivers without\n\nregard to their residence; the program incorporates no distinctions\n\nor classifications based on residence and participation is open to\n\nanyone.   The benefits of the discount program accrue simply on\n\naccount of a driver’s frequency of use.    The frequent driver will\n\nreceive a greater amount of discounts than the infrequent driver,\n\nbut he or she will, of course, also pay a correspondingly greater\n\namount in tolls.\n\n          It is true that to participate in the FLDP, a driver must\n\npurchase a transponder for $27.50.     The right to purchase is not\n\nrestricted to residents, but is open to all.   The decision whether\n\nto do so turns on one’s anticipated frequency of use.   The distance\n\na driver lives from Boston will be a factor, but not the only\n\nfactor, affecting the frequency with which he or she is likely to\n\ndrive through the toll plazas or the tunnels.     But the frequency\n\ncalculus creates no resident versus nonresident classification. The\n\ngeographical reality is that a commuter from Providence, RI or\n\nManchester, NH is no more distant from       Boston than one from\n\nWorcester, MA; a commuter from Hartford, CN or Portland, ME is no\n\nfurther from Boston than one from Springfield, MA; and residents of\n\ncities in Western Massachusetts such as Pittsfield are further than\n\nresidents of any of these major out-of-state population centers.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fThus,   plaintiffs’    claim   that   MTA   “charg[es]    millions    of    non-\n\nresidents a higher cost per mile for traveling the exact same\n\ndistance,” Appellants’ Br. at 10, is pure fiction.               The toll is\n\nhigher for nonparticipants than for participants, regardless of\n\nwhere they live.       Thus, many infrequent nonparticipating drivers\n\nliving in and around Boston will pay a higher toll for whatever\n\ndistances they may drive than commuters from, say, Manchester,\n\nProvidence or Portland who have chosen to participate.\n\n           Plaintiffs rely principally on American Trucking Ass’n v.\n\nScheiner, 483 U.S. 266 (1987), to support their argument. That case\n\ninvolved the validity of flat taxes imposed on trucks. Pennsylvania\n\nfirst required owners of trucks operating on its roads to purchase\n\nan   identification     marker.       For   vehicles     not   registered     in\n\nPennsylvania the fee was $25, while owners of vehicles registered\n\nin   Pennsylvania     were   not   required   to   pay   the   fee.    Later,\n\nPennsylvania reduced the marker fee to $5 and instituted an axle tax\n\non all trucks above a certain weight.         At the same time, it reduced\n\nthe registration fee for in-state trucks in an amount identical to\n\nthe new axle tax, thereby eliminating the effect of the axle tax on\n\nin-state vehicles.     These flat taxes were assessed annually without\n\nregard to the number of miles traveled on Pennsylvania roads.                Id.\n\nat 274-75, 281-82.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           The Court stated that the issue was whether the methods\n\nby which the flat taxes are assessed discriminate against some\n\nparticipants in interstate commerce and held:\n\n           We find dispositive those of our precedents\n           which make clear that the Commerce Clause\n           prohibits a State from imposing a heavier tax\n           burden on out-of-state businesses that compete\n           in an interstate market than it imposes on its\n           own residents who also engage in commerce among\n           States.\n\nId. at 282.      Although the Court’s discussion in Scheiner largely\n\nfocuses on the validity of an unapportioned flat tax on trucks, the\n\ndecision   rests     on    the   premise    that   the   imposition   of   the\n\nPennsylvania tax did not treat interstate and intrastate interests\n\nevenhandedly.      Thus, the case is not apposite.        The FLDP does not\n\nimpose a heavier burden—toll or otherwise—on out-of-state residents.\n\nPlaintiffs’ discussion of the Court’s analysis of potential defenses\n\nof the Pennsylvania scheme and, in particular, the user fee defense,\n\nis   therefore    not     relevant.    The    Court’s    rejection    of   that\n\ndefense—based on the fact that Pennsylvania’s taxes discriminate\n\nagainst out-of-state vehicles—affords no support to plaintiffs’\n\nclaim that MTA’s nondiscriminating program violates the Commerce\n\nClause.\n\n           Moreover, the FLDP bears no resemblance to Pennsylvania’s\n\nflat tax. As plaintiffs argue, the Pennsylvania tax imposed for the\n\nprivilege of using Pennsylvania roads discriminated because that\n\nprivilege was more valuable to residents than nonresidents. The\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ftolls in issue here, in contrast, are imposed on a per-use basis.\n\nThey are imposed only when the driver actually uses the toll plazas\n\nor tunnels and are directly proportional to that use.                             As the\n\nScheiner court put it, “[s]o long as a State bases its tax on a\n\nrelevant measure of actual road use, obviously both interstate and\n\nintrastate      [drivers]     pay     according      to    the     facilities   in   fact\n\nprovided by the State,” and the program places no undue burden on\n\ninterstate commerce.          See id. at 291 (quoting Capitol Greyhound\n\nLines    v.    Brice,   339    U.S.     542,    557       (1950)    (Frankfurter,     J.,\n\ndissenting)).\n\n               Even if we were to treat these highway tolls as analogous\n\nto a flat tax, as plaintiffs appear to argue, MTA “treat[s] [in-\n\nstate and out-of-state] vehicles with an even hand.”                          See id. at\n\n282.     Tolls are the same for both kinds of vehicles and each is\n\neligible to participate in the discount program. That the incentive\n\nto participate varies across drivers does not make the program\n\ndiscriminatory.         That incentive “affects local and out-of-state\n\nvehicles in precisely the same way, and thus does not implicate the\n\nCommerce Clause.”        Id. at 283 n.15.         Thus, contrary to plaintiffs’\n\ncontention,       the   program       does     not    fail       Scheiner’s     internal\n\nconsistency test.        Appellants’ Br. at 22.             As the Court put it, if\n\nmore than one state adopted a similar discount program, the Commerce\n\nClause    is    satisfied     where    the     programs      would    “maintain      state\n\nboundaries as a neutral factor in economic decision making.”                           Id.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fat   282-83;     see   also     id.    at   284   (“To   pass      the    ‘internal\n\ninconsistency’ test, a state tax must be of a kind that, ‘if applied\n\nby every jurisdiction, there would be no impermissible interference\n\nwith free trade.’”);          American Trucking Ass’n, Inc. v. Sec’y of\n\nAdmin., 613 N.E.2d 95, 102 (Mass. 1993) (stating that “[a] valid\n\nuser fee will pass the internal consistency test because the full\n\nmeasure of the fee is not imposed for merely crossing the taxing\n\nState’s border, but is directly related in purpose and amount, to\n\nthe use of a service or privilege.”)\n\n            We   think   that    the    case   before    us   is   more    akin   to\n\nEvansville-Vanderburgh Airport Auth. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405\n\nU.S. 707 (1972), which upheld the validity of a flat charge of $1.00\n\nper passenger enplaning on a commercial airliner operating from the\n\nEvansville airport. The Court held that because both interstate and\n\nintrastate flights are subject to the same charge, the fee did not\n\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce, even though the vast\n\nmajority of passengers boarding aircraft traveled in interstate\n\ncommerce.    It stated that\n\n            so long as the toll is based on some fair\n            approximation of use or privilege for use, as\n            was that before us in Capitol Greyhound [Lines\n            v. Brice, 339 U.S. 542 (1950)], and is neither\n            discriminatory against interstate commerce nor\n            excessive in comparison with the governmental\n            benefit conferred, it will pass constitutional\n            muster, even though some other formula might\n            reflect more exactly the relative use of the\n            state facilities by individual users.\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fId. at 716-17. In Capitol Greyhound, cited by the Court, it had\n\nupheld the validity of Maryland’s excise tax of 2% of the value of\n\na vehicle imposed as a condition precedent to operation of the\n\nvehicle in the State of Maryland, in part because the tax “applie[d]\n\nto interstate and intrastate commerce without discrimination.”           339\n\nU.S. at 544.\n\n           Here,   the   tolls     are   assessed   uniformly     in   direct\n\nproportion to use of the toll facilities and have not been shown to\n\nbe excessive, either standing alone or by reason of the unrestricted\n\navailability of the frequent traveler discount.\n\n           B.      The FLDP Is Not Discriminatory\n                   On Its Face Or In Its Practical\n                   Effect\n\n           Plaintiffs offer three arguments in support of their\n\nsecond contention.       First, they say that the FLDP “invariably\n\nresult[s] in a significant degree of permanent cost exporting onto\n\nthe   interstate   traveler,     non-resident   and/or   non-participant.”\n\nAppellants’ Br. at 29.         As we have explained above, interstate\n\ntravelers pay the same tolls as resident travelers.             Any traveler\n\ncan qualify for a discount but the decision whether to do so turns\n\nprincipally on anticipated frequency of travel.          While a New York\n\nresident is likely to make infrequent trips through the toll plazas\n\nand tunnels, so is the resident of a “wealthy suburb of Boston” who\n\nprefers using public transportation to driving his or her car into\n\nthe city. Appellants’ Br. at 32. But the incremental burden of the\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fundiscounted toll for the infrequent traveler is by necessity de\n\nminimus.      Plaintiffs’ inflammatory assertion that “[e]ach year\n\nmillions   of   non-FASTLANE      participants    pay   a   significant     toll\n\npremium, a tariff of 20% or 33% greater than participants (i.e.\n\nMassachusetts residents), for using the same stretch of road,”\n\nAppellants’     Br.   at   14,   proves    nothing;   it    is   expected   that\n\nnonparticipants will pay higher tolls but it does not follow that\n\ninterstate commerce will be burdened, much less that it will suffer\n\ndiscrimination.       Unlike flat taxes imposed on interstate truck\n\noperators, the collection of undiscounted tolls from the occasional\n\ntraveler—resident or non-resident—results in no discernable “cost\n\nexporting.”\n\n           Second, they argue that the FLDP has a discriminatory\n\nintent and purpose.        Plaintiffs point out that the FLDP was adopted\n\nin response to political pressure to benefit commuters, surely a\n\nconstitutionally valid purpose.           Appellants’ Br. at 31.     They go on\n\nto argue that when MTA sought to quell constitutional concerns by\n\noffering discounted tolls to nonresidents who participate in the\n\nFLDP, it merely “sought to mask the discriminatory impact on non-\n\nresidents by offering a hollow option that few non-residents will\n\nchoose.”   Appellants’ Br. at 32.\n\n           However, plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint contains no\n\nallegation of discriminatory purpose; on the contrary, plaintiffs\n\nallege that\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f            to head off concerns that the Resident Only\n            Fast Lane Discount Program may violate the\n            interstate Commerce Clause . . . defendants\n            modified the Resident Only Discount Program to\n            apply to all travelers, residents and non-\n            residents,    equipped    with    FAST    LANE\n            transponders.\n\nFirst Am. Compl. at ¶ 27.     We think that plaintiffs’ argument falls\n\nof its own weight.       See Grant’s Dairy v. Comm’r of Me. Dep’t of\n\nAgric., 232 F.3d 8, 23 (1st Cir. 2000) (innocuous expressions of\n\nconcern insufficient to raise inference of protectionist intent).\n\n            Finally,    plaintiffs    contend     that    the      FLDP   is\n\ndiscriminatory on its face\n\n            because it regulates the toll that one pays\n            based on one’s participation in the state\n            sponsored FASTLANE electronic toll collection\n            program to the exclusion of all other competing\n            electronic toll collection systems like E-Z\n            Pass offered by other states or that do not\n            participate in any electronic toll collection\n            system.\n\nAppellants’ Br. at 33.        The logic underlying the argument is\n\nelusive. Participation in FAST LANE does not preclude participation\n\nin other electronic toll collection systems; nothing in the record\n\nindicates that automobiles cannot carry more than one transponder.\n\nMoreover, it can hardly be said that FAST LANE, which operates on\n\nthree Massachusetts toll collection points, competes with systems\n\nthat operate on toll collection points in New York, New Jersey and\n\nDelaware.     Participants    in   systems   in   those   states    are   not\n\n“penalized,” as plaintiffs argue, for their decision to choose a\n\ndifferent system.      Appellants’ Br. at 33.     Their participation in\n\n                                   -14-\n\fsuch systems has no impact on their right to participate in the\n\nFLDP.\n\n             C.       The FLDP Does Not Shift Highway\n                      Costs   To   Non-Residents   and\n                      Serves   A    Legitimate   Local\n                      Interest Unrelated To Economic\n                      Protectionism\n\n             We    address   plaintiffs’       third    and   fourth   contentions\n\ntogether.       Arguing from the premise that the FLDP redistributes the\n\nincreased toll burden from Boston commuters to nonresidents and\n\nforces nonresidents “with little or no incentive to participate to\n\npay    a   disproportionate     share    of    the     state’s   highway   costs,”\n\nplaintiffs contend that the FLDP serves no legitimate local interest\n\nunrelated to economic protectionism.             Appellants’ Br. at 38.        For\n\nthe reasons discussed at length above, the premise is flawed. There\n\nis nothing to show that one who drives from New York to Boston and\n\npays the $1.00 toll pays a “disproportionate share of the state’s\n\nhighway costs” compared to the suburban commuter who, driving over\n\na much shorter distance on the state’s highways, pays the discounted\n\ntoll of $.75.       Thus, the program does not implicate the balancing\n\ntest    under     Pike v.    Bruce   Church,    397    U.S.   137   (1970).     See\n\nAppellants’ Br. at 40.\n\n             Even if it did, however, the plan passes muster.                 Under\n\nthe Pike balancing test, “[w]here the statute regulates even-\n\nhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its\n\neffects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fupheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly\n\nexcessive in relation to the putative local benefits.”   Id. at 142.\n\nHere, the effect on nonresident drivers—just as on resident drivers\n\n—is that to qualify for the discounts, they must invest $27.50 to\n\nacquire a transponder and maintain an account balance of $10-$20.\n\nThat burden is de minimis in relation to the public benefits of\n\nachieving a more equitable sharing of toll burdens among commuters,\n\nsome of whom pay no tolls on their routes, and facilitating the\n\nimplementation of an essential funding scheme for major highway\n\nimprovements.\n\n          We have considered other arguments advanced by plaintiffs\n\nand found them to be without merit.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n          We conclude that the FLDP treats Massachusetts-based and\n\nother vehicles with an even hand and that the program does not\n\ninterfere with commerce between the states.       Accordingly, the\n\njudgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Doran and Wendy E. Saunders brought this action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, its chairman and members of its board (collectively, \"MTA\"). Plaintiffs complain that the FAST LANE Discount Program (\"FLDP\" or \"program\") established by MTA violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. U.S. CONST. art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 3. That program permits drivers of automobiles equipped with a transponder sold by MTA to pass through certain toll plazas and tunnels in the Boston area for a discounted toll which is electronically collected. Plaintiffs contend that the program discriminates against nonresidents of Massachusetts and does not serve a legitimate local interest. The district court dismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. It held that the FLDP did not discriminate against out-of-state residents and did not excessively burden interstate commerce. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331 and 1343, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n      <p class=\"center\">\n        <i>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1997 Massachusetts Governor William Weld signed the Metropolitan Highway Systems bill authorizing MTA to increase tolls at the Allston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas from $.50 to $1.00, and at the Ted Williams Tunnel and the Sumner Tunnel from $2.00 to $3.00. The revenue from these toll increases would help finance Boston's Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project, commonly known as the \"Big Dig.\" That project aims to bury stretches of Interstate 93 beneath the city and extend Interstate 90 to Logan International Airport. MTA is responsible for generating through tolls approximately $1.5 billion of the nearly $6 billion needed to complete work on the Interstate 90 segment.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The toll increase was scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2002. In response to public opposition, MTA postponed the increase and proposed to implement a Resident Only Discount Program, under which state residents who drove automobiles equipped with FAST LANE transponders would receive toll discounts of $.25 at the Allston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas and $.50 at the tunnels.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAST LANE system allows vehicles equipped with a transponder to pass through toll plazas without having to stop and pay. Participants must purchase a transponder from MTA for $27.50. The transponder is a small plastic device attached to the windshield. It signals the car's identity to an MTA facility which automatically charges the toll to the driver's account. Drivers generally assign their account to their credit card which is billed $20 at the outset; thereafter, tolls are deducted until $10 remains, at which point an additional $10 is billed to replenish the account. Cars equipped with transponders used in other cities that &#8212; like the E-Z Pass system &#8212; are interoperable, may drive through FAST LANE toll gates without stopping, but do not receive discounts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Resident Only Discount Program went into effect, a newspaper article questioned whether it violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the Constitution. In response, MTA modified the program to apply to all drivers of automobiles, resident or not, equipped with FAST LANE transponders. MTA's chairman noted that as a result a few thousand out-of-state FAST LANE subscribers, most of whom commute from Connecticut, would become eligible for discounts.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 4, 2002, plaintiff Doran drove through the Allston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas. Doran is a Vermont resident who did not subscribe to the FLDP, so he paid the full tolls. On July 5, plaintiff Saunders drove through the same toll plazas. She is a New York resident who had an E-Z Pass but no FAST LANE transponder, so she also paid the full tolls.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doran and Saunders then filed this action alleging that MTA's discount system violates the dormant Commerce Clause, and moved for a preliminary injunction. Finding that the complaint failed to state a claim, the district court granted MTA's motion to dismiss.</p>\n      <p class=\"center\">\n        <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review \"the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, taking the allegations in the complaint as true and making all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff.\" <i>Rockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp.,</i> 26 F.3d 254, 255 (1st Cir.1994). However, we are not required to accept legal conclusions. <i>New England Cleaning Servs. v. American Arbitration Ass'n,</i> 199 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir.1999). A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) should succeed only when \"it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegation.\" <i>Gorski v. New Hampshire Dep't of Corr.,</i> 290 F.3d 466, 473 (1st. Cir.2002) (citing <i>Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding,</i> 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984)).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. THE MERITS</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to \"regulate Commerce... among the several States.\" U.S. CONST. art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 3. The Commerce Clause \"not only grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce among the States, but also directly limits the power of the States to discriminate against interstate commerce.\" <i>New Energy Co. v. Limbach,</i> 486 U.S. 269, 273, 108 S.Ct. 1803, 100 L.Ed.2d 302 (1988). This \"dormant\" Commerce Clause \"prohibits economic protectionism &#8212; that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\" <i>Id.</i> We must decide whether plaintiffs have stated a claim that the FLDP offends the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs advance four contentions in support of their claim:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) That the FLDP imposes a nonuniform and noncompensatory user fee unrelated to actual highway usage;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) That it is discriminatory on its face or in practical effect;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3) That it does not serve a legitimate local interest unrelated to economic protectionism; and</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4) That its cumulative effects on commerce, by shifting highway costs to nonresidents, are excessive. Appellants' Br. at 9.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address each of these contentions in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The FLDP Does Not Impose a Nonuniform and Noncompensatory User Fee</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the FLDP violates the Commerce Clause because it does not charge every user the same amount for identical use and because the discount is nonuniform, noncompensatory and unrelated to actual highway usage or to specific services provided by MTA. To begin with, the argument is factually flawed. The FLDP is available on identical terms to drivers without regard to their residence; the program incorporates no distinctions or classifications based on residence and participation is open to anyone. The benefits of the discount program accrue simply on account of a driver's frequency of use. The frequent driver will receive a greater amount of discounts than the infrequent driver, but he or she will, of course, also pay a correspondingly greater amount in tolls.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that to participate in the FLDP, a driver must purchase a transponder for $27.50. The right to purchase is not restricted to residents, but is open to all. The decision whether to do so turns on one's anticipated frequency of use. The distance a driver lives from Boston will be a factor, but not the only factor, affecting the frequency with which he or she is likely to drive through the toll plazas or the tunnels. But the frequency calculus creates no resident versus nonresident classification. The geographical reality is that a commuter from Providence, RI or Manchester, NH is no more distant from Boston than one from Worcester, MA; a commuter from Hartford, CN or Portland, ME is no further from Boston than one from Springfield, MA; and residents of cities in Western Massachusetts such as Pittsfield are further than residents of any of these major out-of-state population centers. Thus, plaintiffs' claim that MTA \"charg[es] millions of non-residents a higher cost per mile for traveling the exact same distance,\" Appellants' Br. at 10, is pure fiction. The toll is higher for nonparticipants than for participants, regardless of where they live. Thus, many infrequent nonparticipating drivers living in and around Boston will pay a higher toll for whatever distances they may drive than commuters from, say, Manchester, Providence or Portland who have chosen to participate.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs rely principally on <i>American Trucking Ass'n v. Scheiner,</i> 483 U.S. 266, 107 S.Ct. 2829, 97 L.Ed.2d 226 (1987), to support their argument. That case involved the validity of flat taxes imposed on trucks. Pennsylvania first required owners of trucks operating on its roads to purchase an identification marker. For vehicles not registered in Pennsylvania the fee was $25, while owners of vehicles registered in Pennsylvania were not required to pay the fee. Later, Pennsylvania reduced the marker fee to $5 and instituted an axle tax on all trucks above a certain weight. At the same time, it reduced the registration fee for in-state trucks in an amount identical to the new axle tax, thereby eliminating the effect of the axle tax on in-state vehicles. These flat taxes were assessed annually without regard to the number of miles traveled on Pennsylvania roads. <i>Id.</i> at 274-75, 281-82, 107 S.Ct. 2829.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court stated that the issue was whether the methods by which the flat taxes are assessed discriminate against some participants in interstate commerce and held:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find dispositive those of our precedents which make clear that the Commerce Clause prohibits a State from imposing a heavier tax burden on out-of-state businesses that compete in an interstate market than it imposes on its own residents who also engage in commerce among States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 282, 107 S.Ct. 2829. Although the Court's discussion in <i>Scheiner</i> largely focuses on the validity of an unapportioned flat tax on trucks, the decision rests on the premise that the imposition of the Pennsylvania tax did not treat interstate and intrastate interests evenhandedly. Thus, the case is not apposite. The FLDP does not impose a heavier burden &#8212; toll or otherwise &#8212; on out-of-state residents. Plaintiffs' discussion of the Court's analysis of potential defenses of the Pennsylvania scheme and, in particular, the user fee defense, is therefore not relevant. The Court's rejection of that defense &#8212; based on the fact that Pennsylvania's taxes discriminate against out-of-state vehicles &#8212; affords no support to plaintiffs' claim that MTA's nondiscriminating program violates the Commerce Clause.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the FLDP bears no resemblance to Pennsylvania's flat tax. As plaintiffs argue, the Pennsylvania tax imposed for the privilege of using Pennsylvania roads discriminated because that privilege was more valuable to residents than nonresidents. The tolls in issue here, in contrast, are imposed on a per-use basis. They are imposed only when the driver actually uses the toll plazas or tunnels and are directly proportional to that use. As the <i>Scheiner</i> court put it, \"[s]o long as a State bases its tax on a relevant measure of actual road use, obviously both interstate and intrastate [drivers] pay according to the facilities in fact provided by the State,\" and the program places no undue burden on interstate commerce. <i>See id.</i> at 291, 107 S.Ct. 2829 (quoting <i>Capitol Greyhound Lines v. Brice,</i> 339 U.S. 542, 557, 70 S.Ct. 806, 94 L.Ed. 1053 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to treat these highway tolls as analogous to a flat tax, as plaintiffs appear to argue, MTA \"treat[s] [in-state and out-of-state] vehicles with an even hand.\" <i>See id.</i> at 282, 107 S.Ct. 2829. Tolls are the same for both kinds of vehicles and each is eligible to participate in the discount program. That the incentive to participate varies across drivers does not make the program discriminatory. That incentive \"affects local and out-of-state vehicles in precisely the same way, and thus does not implicate the Commerce Clause.\" <i>Id.</i> at 283 n. 15, 107 S.Ct. 2829. Thus, contrary to plaintiffs' contention, the program does not fail <i>Scheiner's</i> internal consistency test. Appellants' Br. at 22. As the Court put it, if more than one state adopted a similar discount program, the Commerce Clause is satisfied where the programs would \"maintain state boundaries as a neutral factor in economic decision making.\" <i>Id.</i> at 282-83, 107 S.Ct. 2829; <i>see also id.</i> at 284, 107 S.Ct. 2829 (\"To pass the `internal inconsistency' test, a state tax must be of a kind that, `if applied by every jurisdiction, there would be no impermissible interference with free trade.'\"); <i>American Trucking Ass'n, Inc. v. Sec'y of Admin.,</i> 415 Mass. 337, 613 N.E.2d 95, 102 (Mass.1993) (stating that \"[a] valid user fee will pass the internal consistency test because the full measure of the fee is not imposed for merely crossing the taxing State's border, but is directly related in purpose and amount, to the use of a service or privilege.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the case before us is more akin to <i>Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Auth. v.

The Court held that because both interstate and intrastate flights are subject to the same charge, the fee did not discriminate against interstate commerce, even though the vast majority of passengers boarding aircraft traveled in interstate commerce.

The FLDP Is Not Discriminatory On Its Face Or In Its Practical Effect</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs offer three arguments in support of their second contention. First, they say that the FLDP \"invariably result[s] in a significant degree of permanent cost exporting onto the interstate traveler, non-resident and/or non-participant.\" Appellants' Br. at 29. As we have explained above, interstate travelers pay the same tolls as resident travelers. Any traveler can qualify for a discount but the decision whether to do so turns principally on anticipated frequency of travel. While a New York resident is likely to make infrequent trips through the toll plazas and tunnels, so is the resident of a \"wealthy suburb of Boston\" who prefers using public transportation to driving his or her car into the city. Appellants' Br. at 32. But the incremental burden of the undiscounted toll for the infrequent traveler is by necessity de minimus. Plaintiffs' inflammatory assertion that \"[e]ach year millions of non-FASTLANE participants pay a significant toll premium, a tariff of 20% or 33% greater than participants (i.e. Massachusetts residents), for using the same stretch of road,\" Appellants' Br. at 14, proves nothing; it is expected that nonparticipants will pay higher tolls but it does not follow that interstate commerce will be burdened, much less that it will suffer discrimination. Unlike flat taxes imposed on interstate truck operators, the collection of undiscounted tolls from the occasional traveler &#8212; resident or non-resident &#8212; results in no discernable \"cost exporting.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, they argue that the FLDP has a discriminatory intent and purpose. Plaintiffs point out that the FLDP was adopted in response to political pressure to benefit commuters, surely a constitutionally valid purpose. Appellants' Br. at 31. They go on to argue that when MTA sought to quell constitutional concerns by offering discounted tolls to nonresidents who participate in the FLDP, it merely \"sought to mask the discriminatory impact on non-residents by offering a hollow option that few non-residents will choose.\" Appellants' Br. at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint contains no allegation of discriminatory purpose; on the contrary, plaintiffs allege that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to head off concerns that the Resident Only Fast Lane Discount Program may violate the interstate Commerce Clause... defendants modified the Resident Only Discount Program to apply to all travelers, residents and non-residents, equipped with FAST LANE transponders.

The logic underlying the argument is elusive. Participation in FAST LANE does not preclude participation in other electronic toll collection systems; nothing in the record indicates that automobiles cannot carry more than one transponder. Moreover, it can hardly be said that FAST LANE, which operates on three Massachusetts toll collection points, competes with systems that operate on toll collection points in New York, New Jersey and Delaware. Participants in systems in those states are not \"penalized,\" as plaintiffs argue, for their decision to choose a different system. Appellants' Br. at 33.

Arguing from the premise that the FLDP redistributes the increased toll burden from Boston commuters to nonresidents and forces nonresidents \"with little or no incentive to participate to pay a disproportionate share of the state's highway costs,\" plaintiffs contend that the FLDP serves no legitimate local interest unrelated to economic protectionism. Appellants' Br. at 38. For the reasons discussed at length above, the premise is flawed. There is nothing to show that one who drives from New York to Boston and pays the $1.00 toll pays a \"disproportionate share of the state's highway costs\" compared to the suburban commuter who, driving over a much shorter distance on the state's highways, pays the discounted toll of $.75. Thus, the program does not implicate the balancing test under <i>Pike v. Bruce Church,</i> 397 U.S. 137, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970). <i>See</i> Appellants' Br. at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if it did, however, the plan passes muster.

Here, the effect on nonresident drivers &#8212; just as on resident drivers &#8212; is that to qualify for the discounts, they must invest $27.50 to acquire a transponder and maintain an account balance of $10-$20. That burden is de minimis in relation to the public benefits of achieving a more equitable sharing of toll burdens among commuters, some of whom pay no tolls on their routes, and facilitating the implementation of an essential funding scheme for major highway improvements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered other arguments advanced by plaintiffs and found them to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the FLDP treats Massachusetts-based and other vehicles with an even hand and that the program does not interfere with commerce between the states.

Doran and Wendy E. Saunders brought this action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, its chairman and members of its board (collectively, \"MTA\"). Plaintiffs complain that the FAST LANE Discount Program (\"FLDP\" or \"program\") established by MTA violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. U.S. CONST. art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 3. That program permits drivers of automobiles equipped with a transponder sold by MTA to pass through certain toll plazas and tunnels in the Boston area for a discounted toll which is electronically collected. Plaintiffs contend that the program discriminates against nonresidents of Massachusetts and does not serve a legitimate local interest. The district court dismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. It held that the FLDP did not discriminate against out-of-state residents and did not excessively burden interstate commerce. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331 and 1343, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n      <p class=\"center\">\n        <i>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1997 Massachusetts Governor William Weld signed the Metropolitan Highway Systems bill authorizing MTA to increase tolls at the Allston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas from $.50 to $1.00, and at the Ted Williams Tunnel and the Sumner Tunnel from $2.00 to $3.00. The revenue from these toll increases would help finance Boston's Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project, commonly known as the \"Big Dig.\" That project aims to bury stretches of Interstate 93 beneath the city and extend Interstate 90 to Logan International Airport. MTA is responsible for generating through tolls approximately $1.5 billion of the nearly $6 billion needed to complete work on the Interstate 90 segment.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The toll increase was scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2002. In response to public opposition, MTA postponed the increase and proposed to implement a Resident Only Discount Program, under which state residents who drove automobiles equipped with FAST LANE transponders would receive toll discounts of $.25 at the Allston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas and $.50 at the tunnels.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAST LANE system allows vehicles equipped with a transponder to pass through toll plazas without having to stop and pay. Participants must purchase a transponder from MTA for $27.50. The transponder is a small plastic device attached to the windshield. It signals the car's identity to an MTA facility which automatically charges the toll to the driver's account. Drivers generally assign their account to their credit card which is billed $20 at the outset; thereafter, tolls are deducted until $10 remains, at which point an additional $10 is billed to replenish the account. Cars equipped with transponders used in other cities that &#8212; like the E-Z Pass system &#8212; are interoperable, may drive through FAST LANE toll gates without stopping, but do not receive discounts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Resident Only Discount Program went into effect, a newspaper article questioned whether it violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the Constitution. In response, MTA modified the program to apply to all drivers of automobiles, resident or not, equipped with FAST LANE transponders. MTA's chairman noted that as a result a few thousand out-of-state FAST LANE subscribers, most of whom commute from Connecticut, would become eligible for discounts.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 4, 2002, plaintiff Doran drove through the Allston-Brighton and Route 128 toll plazas. Doran is a Vermont resident who did not subscribe to the FLDP, so he paid the full tolls. On July 5, plaintiff Saunders drove through the same toll plazas. She is a New York resident who had an E-Z Pass but no FAST LANE transponder, so she also paid the full tolls.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doran and Saunders then filed this action alleging that MTA's discount system violates the dormant Commerce Clause, and moved for a preliminary injunction. Finding that the complaint failed to state a claim, the district court granted MTA's motion to dismiss.</p>\n      <p class=\"center\">\n        <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I.

Appellants' Br. at 9.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address each of these contentions in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The FLDP Does Not Impose a Nonuniform and Noncompensatory User Fee</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the FLDP violates the Commerce Clause because it does not charge every user the same amount for identical use and because the discount is nonuniform, noncompensatory and unrelated to actual highway usage or to specific services provided by MTA. To begin with, the argument is factually flawed. The FLDP is available on identical terms to drivers without regard to their residence; the program incorporates no distinctions or classifications based on residence and participation is open to anyone. The benefits of the discount program accrue simply on account of a driver's frequency of use. The frequent driver will receive a greater amount of discounts than the infrequent driver, but he or she will, of course, also pay a correspondingly greater amount in tolls.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that to participate in the FLDP, a driver must purchase a transponder for $27.50. The right to purchase is not restricted to residents, but is open to all. The decision whether to do so turns on one's anticipated frequency of use. The distance a driver lives from Boston will be a factor, but not the only factor, affecting the frequency with which he or she is likely to drive through the toll plazas or the tunnels. But the frequency calculus creates no resident versus nonresident classification. The geographical reality is that a commuter from Providence, RI or Manchester, NH is no more distant from Boston than one from Worcester, MA; a commuter from Hartford, CN or Portland, ME is no further from Boston than one from Springfield, MA; and residents of cities in Western Massachusetts such as Pittsfield are further than residents of any of these major out-of-state population centers. Thus, plaintiffs' claim that MTA \"charg[es] millions of non-residents a higher cost per mile for traveling the exact same distance,\" Appellants' Br. at 10, is pure fiction. The toll is higher for nonparticipants than for participants, regardless of where they live. Thus, many infrequent nonparticipating drivers living in and around Boston will pay a higher toll for whatever distances they may drive than commuters from, say, Manchester, Providence or Portland who have chosen to participate.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs rely principally on <i>American Trucking Ass'n v. Scheiner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111942\"><a href=\"/opinion/111942/american-trucking-assns-inc-v-scheiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111942\"><a href=\"/opinion/111942/american-trucking-assns-inc-v-scheiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span> (1987), to support their argument. That case involved the validity of flat taxes imposed on trucks. Pennsylvania first required owners of trucks operating on its roads to purchase an identification marker. For vehicles not registered in Pennsylvania the fee was $25, while owners of vehicles registered in Pennsylvania were not required to pay the fee. Later, Pennsylvania reduced the marker fee to $5 and instituted an axle tax on all trucks above a certain weight. At the same time, it reduced the registration fee for in-state trucks in an amount identical to the new axle tax, thereby eliminating the effect of the axle tax on in-state vehicles. These flat taxes were assessed annually without regard to the number of miles traveled on Pennsylvania roads. <i>Id.</i> at 274-75, 281-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111942\"><a href=\"/opinion/111942/american-trucking-assns-inc-v-scheiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2829</span></a></span>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court stated that the issue was whether the methods by which the flat taxes are assessed discriminate against some participants in interstate commerce and held:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find dispositive those of our precedents which make clear that the Commerce Clause prohibits a State from imposing a heavier tax burden on out-of-state businesses that compete in an interstate market than it imposes on its own residents who also engage in commerce among States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 282, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111942\"><a href=\"/opinion/111942/american-trucking-assns-inc-v-scheiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2829</span></a></span>. Although the Court's discussion in <i>Scheiner</i> largely focuses on the validity of an unapportioned flat tax on trucks, the decision rests on the premise that the imposition of the Pennsylvania tax did not treat interstate and intrastate interests evenhandedly. Thus, the case is not apposite. The FLDP does not impose a heavier burden &#8212; toll or otherwise &#8212; on out-of-state residents. Plaintiffs' discussion of the Court's analysis of potential defenses of the Pennsylvania scheme and, in particular, the user fee defense, is therefore not relevant. The Court's rejection of that defense &#8212; based on the fact that Pennsylvania's taxes discriminate against out-of-state vehicles &#8212; affords no support to plaintiffs' claim that MTA's nondiscriminating program violates the Commerce Clause.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the FLDP bears no resemblance to Pennsylvania's flat tax. As plaintiffs argue, the Pennsylvania tax imposed for the privilege of using Pennsylvania roads discriminated because that privilege was more valuable to residents than nonresidents. The tolls in issue here, in contrast, are imposed on a per-use basis. They are imposed only when the driver actually uses the toll plazas or tunnels and are directly proportional to that use. As the <i>Scheiner</i> court put it, \"[s]o long as a State bases its tax on a relevant measure of actual road use, obviously both interstate and intrastate [drivers] pay according to the facilities in fact provided by the State,\" and the program places no undue burden on interstate commerce. <i>See id.</i> at 291, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111942\"><a href=\"/opinion/111942/american-trucking-assns-inc-v-scheiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The FLDP Is Not Discriminatory On Its Face Or In Its Practical Effect</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs offer three arguments in support of their second contention. First, they say that the FLDP \"invariably result[s] in a significant degree of permanent cost exporting onto the interstate traveler, non-resident and/or non-participant.\" Appellants' Br. at 29. As we have explained above, interstate travelers pay the same tolls as resident travelers. Any traveler can qualify for a discount but the decision whether to do so turns principally on anticipated frequency of travel. While a New York resident is likely to make infrequent trips through the toll plazas and tunnels, so is the resident of a \"wealthy suburb of Boston\" who prefers using public transportation to driving his or her car into the city. Appellants' Br. at 32. But the incremental burden of the undiscounted toll for the infrequent traveler is by necessity de minimus. Plaintiffs' inflammatory assertion that \"[e]ach year millions of non-FASTLANE participants pay a significant toll premium, a tariff of 20% or 33% greater than participants (i.e. Massachusetts residents), for using the same stretch of road,\" Appellants' Br. at 14, proves nothing; it is expected that nonparticipants will pay higher tolls but it does not follow that interstate commerce will be burdened, much less that it will suffer discrimination. Unlike flat taxes imposed on interstate truck operators, the collection of undiscounted tolls from the occasional traveler &#8212; resident or non-resident &#8212; results in no discernable \"cost exporting.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, they argue that the FLDP has a discriminatory intent and purpose. Plaintiffs point out that the FLDP was adopted in response to political pressure to benefit commuters, surely a constitutionally valid purpose. Appellants' Br. at 31. They go on to argue that when MTA sought to quell constitutional concerns by offering discounted tolls to nonresidents who participate in the FLDP, it merely \"sought to mask the discriminatory impact on non-residents by offering a hollow option that few non-residents will choose.\" Appellants' Br. at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint contains no allegation of discriminatory purpose; on the contrary, plaintiffs allege that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to head off concerns that the Resident Only Fast Lane Discount Program may violate the interstate Commerce Clause... defendants modified the Resident Only Discount Program to apply to all travelers, residents and non-residents, equipped with FAST LANE transponders. First Am. Compl. at &#182; 27. We think that plaintiffs' argument falls of its own weight. <i>See Grant's Dairy v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199150\"><a href=\"/opinion/199150/grants-dairy-maine-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2000) (innocuous expressions of concern insufficient to raise inference of protectionist intent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs contend that the FLDP is discriminatory on its face</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">because it regulates the toll that one pays based on one's participation in the state sponsored FASTLANE electronic toll collection program to the exclusion of all other competing electronic toll collection systems like E-Z Pass offered by other states or that do not participate in any electronic toll collection system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Br. at 33. The logic underlying the argument is elusive. Participation in FAST LANE does not preclude participation in other electronic toll collection systems; nothing in the record indicates that automobiles cannot carry more than one transponder. Moreover, it can hardly be said that FAST LANE, which operates on three Massachusetts toll collection points, competes with systems that operate on toll collection points in New York, New Jersey and Delaware. Participants in systems in those states are not \"penalized,\" as plaintiffs argue, for their decision to choose a different system. Appellants' Br. at 33. Their participation in such systems has no impact on their right to participate in the FLDP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The FLDP Does Not Shift Highway Costs To Non-Residents and Serves A Legitimate Local Interest Unrelated To Economic Protectionism</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address plaintiffs' third and fourth contentions together. Arguing from the premise that the FLDP redistributes the increased toll burden from Boston commuters to nonresidents and forces nonresidents \"with little or no incentive to participate to pay a disproportionate share of the state's highway costs,\" plaintiffs contend that the FLDP serves no legitimate local interest unrelated to economic protectionism. Appellants' Br. at 38. For the reasons discussed at length above, the premise is flawed. There is nothing to show that one who drives from New York to Boston and pays the $1.00 toll pays a \"disproportionate share of the state's highway costs\" compared to the suburban commuter who, driving over a much shorter distance on the state's highways, pays the discounted toll of $.75. Thus, the program does not implicate the balancing test under <i>Pike v. Bruce Church,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under the <i>Pike</i> balancing test, \"[w]here the statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> at 142, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>. Here, the effect on nonresident drivers &#8212; just as on resident drivers &#8212; is that to qualify for the discounts, they must invest $27.50 to acquire a transponder and maintain an account balance of $10-$20. That burden is de minimis in relation to the public benefits of achieving a more equitable sharing of toll burdens among commuters, some of whom pay no tolls on their routes, and facilitating the implementation of an essential funding scheme for major highway improvements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered other arguments advanced by plaintiffs and found them to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the FLDP treats Massachusetts-based and other vehicles with an even hand and that the program does not interfere with commerce between the states.
