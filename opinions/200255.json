A group of convicted sex offenders\n\nbrought      this    action   against     the   New   Hampshire   Department           of\n\nCorrections (\"DOC\"), claiming that the DOC violated their Fifth\n\nAmendment right against self-incrimination by requiring them to\n\ndisclose their histories of sexual misconduct to participate in the\n\nDOC's Sex Offenders Program (\"SOP\").\n\n              The district court granted the DOC's motion to dismiss in\n\nMay 2000, see Ainsworth v. Cantor, No. Civ. 99-447-M, 2000 WL\n\n1499495 (D.N.H. May 18, 2000).            An appeal followed.     In April 2001,\n\nwe issued an opinion affirming the district court, see Ainsworth v.\n\nRisley, 244 F.3d 209 (1st Cir. 2001), and in July 2001 appellants\n\npetitioned      the     United     States   Supreme    Court    for     a       writ   of\n\ncertiorari.         The Court did not immediately act on the petition.\n\n              In June 2002 the Supreme Court decided McKune v. Lile,\n\n536   U.S.    ____,     122   S.   Ct.   2017   (2002),     involving       a    similar\n\nchallenge to Kansas's sex offender treatment program.                       By a five-\n\nto-four vote, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Kansas\n\nprogram.      There was, however, no majority opinion.            A plurality of\n\nfour justices found that the Kansas program \"does not compel\n\nprisoners      to     incriminate        themselves    in    violation          of     the\n\nConstitution.\" Id. at 2026 (plurality opinion). Justice O'Connor,\n\nwriting a separate concurrence, agreed with the result reached by\n\nthe plurality, but expressly disagreed with its reasoning. See id.\n\nat 2032–33 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment).                               Four\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fdissenting      justices        would     have       held        the    Kansas       program\n\nunconstitutional.        See id. at 2035 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\n             Shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in McKune, the\n\nCourt granted the Ainsworth plaintiffs' petition for certiorari\n\nand summarily vacated our earlier decision, remanding the case for\n\nfurther consideration           in   light     of    McKune.           See   Ainsworth    v.\n\nStanley, 536 U.S. ____, 122 S. Ct. 2652 (2002) (mem.).                               We then\n\ngave   the    parties    an    opportunity          to    file    supplemental        briefs\n\naddressing the effect of McKune on our prior opinion.                            Now, upon\n\ndue consideration of McKune and the parties' submissions, we once\n\nagain affirm the decision of the district court.\n\n\n\n                                          I.\n\n             Kansas's Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (\"SATP\") and New\n\nHampshire's SOP share many attributes.                    For example, both programs\n\nrequire participants to accept responsibility for their crimes as\n\nwell as      divulge    their    sexual      histories       and       any   other    sexual\n\noffenses they may have committed.                   In addition, neither program\n\noffers    immunity      from    prosecution         for    any    statements      made    in\n\nconnection with the program. Compare McKune, 122 S. Ct. at 2022-25\n\n(describing Kansas program), with Ainsworth, 244 F.3d at 210–212\n\n(describing New Hampshire program). The two states' programs,\n\nhowever, differ in a number of respects.                     For example, in McKune\n\nthe plaintiffs were ordered to participate in the program, see\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fMcKune, 122 S. Ct. at 2023, whereas in New Hampshire, the program\n\nis voluntary,1 see Ainsworth, 244 F.3d at 211.        More importantly,\n\nthe   programs   differ   with   respect   to   the   consequences    for\n\nnonparticipation.    In Kansas, nonparticipation results in the\n\nautomatic curtailment of several privileges (including visitation\n\nrights, earnings, work opportunities, ability to send money to\n\nfamily, canteen expenditures, and access to a personal television),\n\nas well as an automatic transfer to less desirable housing.           See\n\nMcKune, 122 S. Ct. at 2023. In New Hampshire, nonparticipation can\n\nsimilarly result in a transfer to less desirable housing.            More\n\nsignificantly, however, nonparticipation in the SOP almost always\n\nresults in an inmate being denied parole.       See Ainsworth, 244 F.3d\n\nat 212 (\"At the preliminary injunction hearing, an official from\n\nthe New Hampshire Adult Parole Board testified that to date 97 to\n\n98 percent of the sex offenders who received parole had completed\n\nthe SOP.\").\n\n          The plurality opinion in McKune concluded that Kansas's\n\nSATP and the consequences for nonparticipation in it did not\n\ncombine to create a compulsion that impermissibly encumbers the\n\nconstitutional right not to incriminate oneself. In coming to this\n\n\n\n      1\n      As we noted before, the Ainsworth appellants' brief asserted\nthat \"some of the plaintiffs apply for the SOP 'because their\nsentence specifically requires completion' . . . . However, the\nplaintiffs in no way develop this argument in their brief,\nprecluding our consideration of the implications of any such\nsentencing requirements.\" Ainsworth, 244 F.3d at 216 n.9.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fconclusion, the plurality relied on Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472\n\n(1995), a due process challenge to prison conditions.                         While\n\nacknowledging    that   a   due   process    claim    differs    from    a    Fifth\n\nAmendment claim, the plurality looked to Sandin in evaluating the\n\nlatter. McKune, 122 S. Ct. at 2026 (plurality opinion).                 The Court\n\nin Sandin held that adverse prison conditions cannot give rise to\n\na due process violation unless they constitute \"atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship[s] on [inmates] in relation to the ordinary\n\nincidents of prison life.\"         Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484.            Relying on\n\nthis   \"useful   instruction,\"      the    plurality       concluded    that    the\n\npenalties imposed on the McKune plaintiff were significantly less\n\nthan the potential penalties inmates faced in selected other cases\n\nin which the Supreme Court had determined that there was no Fifth\n\nAmendment violation.        McKune, 122 S. Ct. at 2027–29 (plurality\n\nopinion).   Therefore, according to the plurality, the SATP was not\n\nconstitutionally impermissible.\n\n            In concurring in the judgment on much narrower grounds,\n\nJustice O'Connor rejected the idea that Sandin's due process\n\nanalysis should be imported into a Fifth Amendment compulsion\n\nanalysis.    Indeed, she indicated that she \"agree[d] with Justice\n\nSTEVENS [in dissent] that the Fifth Amendment compulsion standard\n\nis broader than [the Sandin test].\"           McKune, 122 S. Ct. at 2032\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment).                   On the facts of\n\nMcKune,   however,   Justice      O'Connor   did     not    believe    that    \"the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fpenalties assessed against respondent in response to his failure to\n\nincriminate himself [were] compulsive on any reasonable test.\" Id.\n\nat 2035 (emphasis added).    Curtailment of certain privileges and a\n\ntransfer to less hospitable housing were simply not consequences\n\n\"serious enough to compel [plaintiff] to be a witness against\n\nhimself,\" id. at 2033–34, regardless of the theory used to evaluate\n\nthe claim. Thus, without subscribing to the plurality's reasoning,\n\nJustice O'Connor concurred in the plurality's judgment.          Id. at\n\n2035.\n\n\n\n                                 II.\n\n            When no single rationale explains the result of a divided\n\nSupreme Court, we interpret the holding to be the \"position taken\n\nby those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest\n\ngrounds.\"     Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977)\n\n(quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 169 (1976)).         Hence the\n\nTenth Circuit held on remand in McKune that the inmates' claims\n\n\"[did] not rise to the level of compulsion contemplated by Justice\n\nO'Connor's concurring opinion\" and dismissed them on that ground.\n\nLile v. McKune, 299 F.3d 1229, 1230 (10th Cir. 2002).          See also\n\nSearcy v. Simmons, 299 F.3d 1220, 1225 (10th Cir. 2002) (\"[W]e view\n\n[Justice O'Connor's] concurrence as the holding of the Court in\n\nMcKune.\"); Reed v. McKune, 298 F.3d 946, 952 (10th Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"Justice    O'Connor's   narrower     position   in   her   concurrence\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\frepresents the holding of the plurality decision.\"). We agree with\n\nthis approach.     Justice O'Connor's concurrence is \"arguably more\n\nnarrow than the plurality's and therefore constitutes the holding\n\nof the Court.\"    Lurie v. Wittner, 228 F.3d 113, 130 (2d Cir. 2000);\n\nsee also Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc., 199 F.3d 572, 580\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (\"[I]nferior courts should give effect to the\n\nnarrowest ground upon which a majority of the Justices supporting\n\nthe judgment would agree.\").\n\n           The difficulty presented by this interpretive precept is\n\nthat Justice O'Connor does not purport to lay out any abstract\n\nanalysis   or    unifying   theory   that   would   prefigure   her   views\n\nregarding the constitutionality of New Hampshire's program.2 Taken\n\ntogether, the O'Connor and plurality opinions do not clearly\n\nforeshadow how the court would decide our case.         For example, the\n\nplurality opinion notes in passing that nonparticipation in the\n\nKansas program \"[does] not extend [the] term of incarceration,\" nor\n\ndoes it \"affect [] eligibility for good-time credits or parole.\"\n\nMcKune, 122 S. Ct. at 2027 (plurality opinion).             Later in the\n\nopinion, however, the plurality notes that in Minnesota v. Murphy,\n\n465 U.S. 420 (1984), the Court found no compulsion to speak when\n\n\"the defendant feared the possibility of additional jail time as a\n\n\n     2\n       Since both the plurality and Justice O'Connor reject the\nargument   that  a  transfer   to  less  desirable  housing  is\nconstitutionally impermissible, appellants have withdrawn their\n\"punitive housing transfer\" claim.   See Appellants' Suppl. Br.\nat 5.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fresult of his decision to remain silent.\"   McKune, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2029 (plurality opinion).   Thus, while the plurality apparently\n\nfelt it noteworthy that a loss of parole was not at stake in\n\nKansas, whereas it is in this case, it is far from clear that the\n\nplurality would regard such a consequence as constitutionally\n\nimpermissible.   Under these circumstances, in considering our\n\nearlier opinion in light of McKune as the remand requires, we have\n\nno clear guideposts.   Instead, we must resort to our own sound\n\njudgment, so long as it does not conflict with existing precedent.\n\n\n\n                               III.\n\n          Our prior decision in this case examined a long line of\n\nSupreme Court precedents in which compulsion under the Fifth\n\nAmendment was at issue.     We recognized that historically the\n\nSupreme Court had described compulsion in relatively broad terms.\n\nHowever, we also noted that in more recent decisions the Court had\n\nheld that the analysis is more circumscribed in the prison context.\n\nCiting the \"watershed case\" of Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78\n\n(1987), we reaffirmed our prior observation that when \"burdens are\n\nlaid upon the exercise of constitutional rights by prisons, the\n\nSupreme Court's current approach is to give very substantial\n\nlatitude to the state's judgment.\"     Ainsworth, 244 F.3d at 213\n\n(quoting Beauchamp v. Murphy, 37 F.3d 700, 704 (1st Cir. 1994),\n\ncert. denied, 514 U.S. 1019 (1995)).   Only \"unreasonable\" burdens\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fare proscribed.    In determining whether a burden is unreasonable,\n\nwe will look to:\n\n          whether the state's policy serves a valid\n          governmental interest; the extent to which the\n          prisoner   is  foreclosed   or   burdened   in\n          exercising his rights; and the presence or\n          absence of reasonable alternatives for the\n          government to achieve the same ends by other\n          means without significant cost or impairment\n          of the governmental interest at stake.\n\nId. at 214 (quoting Beauchamp, 37 F.3d at 705 (citing Turner, 482\n\nU.S. at 89–91) (internal quotations omitted)).\n\n          Without    recapitulating    our    prior   decision    in   its\n\nentirety, suffice it to say that we determined that the burden\n\nplaced on appellants is not an unreasonable one.            We began by\n\nciting criminological studies and social science research, noting\n\nthat the admission of crimes is \"widely believed to be a necessary\n\nprerequisite for successful treatment\" of sex offenders.                We\n\ndetermined that \"New Hampshire unmistakably has a valid government\n\ninterest in establishing the SOP, and in requiring sex offenders to\n\nadmit past conduct to participate in it.\"        Id. at 215.\n\n          Next, we examined the extent of the burden.          We began by\n\nnoting that \"inmates do not have a 'liberty right' to parole\" under\n\neither federal or New Hampshire law.         Id. at 216.   We recognized\n\nthat there was some burden placed on appellants' exercise of their\n\nFifth Amendment rights, but that the extent of that burden was\n\nmitigated by three factors.    First, appellants were not suffering\n\na new or additional penalty by being denied parole.         Since parole\n\n                                 -9-\n\finvolves relief from a penalty that has already been imposed — the\n\nfull period of incarceration to which appellants were sentenced —\n\nparole can be considered a \"benefit that the state may condition on\n\ncompletion of the program.\"                  Id. at 216.          Given the \"crucial\n\ndistinction between being deprived of a liberty one has . . . and\n\nbeing denied a conditional liberty that one desires,\" Greenholtz v.\n\nInmates of Neb. Penal & Corr. Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 9 (1979), we\n\nconcluded that this aspect of the burden mitigated its extent.\n\nSecond, we noted that the extent of the burden was also mitigated\n\nby   the       voluntary     nature    of   the    program   (notwithstanding     the\n\nconsequences of nonparticipation).                  Third, we observed that the\n\ndenial of parole was not entirely automatic.                         While the vast\n\nmajority of parolees had completed the SOP prior to release, a few\n\ninmates are paroled each year despite having not completed the SOP.\n\n                Finally, we considered \"whether reasonable alternatives\n\nexist for the government to achieve its ends without significant\n\ncost    or      impairment     to     the   governmental     interest    at    stake.\"\n\nAinsworth, 244 F.3d at 220.                 We recognized that the state could\n\noffer      a    grant   of    limited-use      immunity      to   appellants    before\n\nrequiring them to disclose past misconduct.                        Any impermissible\n\nFifth Amendment compulsion would thus be obviated.                       However, we\n\nconcluded that \"the decision about whether to grant immunity to sex\n\noffenders is a policy choice that lies in the state's hands.\"                      Id.\n\nat 221.\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\f          Our ultimate conclusion under the Turner framework, in\n\nlight of the three factors outlined above, was as follows:\n\n          Weighing these factors, and drawing upon the\n          meaning   of   compulsion   under  the   Fifth\n          Amendment developed by the precedents we have\n          cited, we conclude that the reduced likelihood\n          of parole for refusing to participate in the\n          SOP does not constitute a penalty sufficient\n          to compel incriminating speech in violation of\n          the Fifth Amendment.\n\nAinsworth, 244 F.3d at 221. Having duly considered our decision in\n\nlight of McKune, we now adhere to our earlier judgment.       The\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n          SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

For example, both programs require participants to accept responsibility for their crimes as well as divulge their sexual histories and any other sexual offenses they may have committed. In addition, neither program offers immunity from prosecution for any statements made in connection with the program. <i>Compare McKune,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2022-25 (describing Kansas program), <i>with Ainsworth,</i> 244 F.3d at 210-212 (describing New Hampshire program).

In New Hampshire, nonparticipation can similarly result in a transfer to less desirable housing. More significantly, however, nonparticipation in the SOP almost always results in an inmate being denied parole. <i>See Ainsworth,</i> 244 F.3d at 212 (\"At the preliminary injunction hearing, an official from the New Hampshire Adult Parole Board testified that to date 97 to 98 percent of the sex offenders who received parole had completed the SOP.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plurality opinion in <i>McKune</i> concluded that Kansas's SATP and the consequences for nonparticipation in it did not combine to create a compulsion that impermissibly encumbers the constitutional right not to incriminate oneself. In coming to this conclusion, the plurality relied on <i>Sandin v. Conner,</i> 515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), a due process challenge to prison conditions.

The Court in <i>Sandin</i> held that adverse prison conditions cannot give rise to a due process violation unless they constitute \"atypical and significant hardship[s] on [inmates] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" <i>Sandin,</i> 515 U.S. at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Relying on this \"useful instruction,\" the plurality concluded that the penalties imposed on the <i>McKune</i> plaintiff were significantly less than the potential penalties inmates faced in selected other cases in which the Supreme Court had determined that there was no Fifth Amendment violation. <i>McKune,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2027-29 (plurality opinion).

On the facts of <i>McKune,</i> however, Justice O'Connor did not believe that \"the penalties assessed against respondent in response to his failure to incriminate himself [were] compulsive on <i>any</i> reasonable test.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2035 (emphasis added). Curtailment of certain privileges and a transfer to less hospitable housing were simply not consequences \"serious enough to compel [plaintiff] to be a witness against himself,\" <i>id.</i> at 2033-34, regardless of the theory used to evaluate the claim. Thus, without subscribing to the plurality's reasoning, Justice O'Connor concurred in the plurality's judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 2035.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When no single rationale explains the result of a divided Supreme Court, we interpret the holding to be the \"position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\" <i>Marks v. United States,</i> 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (quoting <i>Gregg v. Georgia,</i> 428 U.S. 153, 169, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976)). Hence the Tenth Circuit held on remand in <i>McKune</i> that the inmates' claims \"[did] not rise to the level of compulsion contemplated by Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion\" and dismissed them on that ground. <i>Lile v. McKune,</i> 299 F.3d 1229, 1230 (10th Cir.2002). <i>See also Searcy v. Simmons,</i> 299 F.3d 1220, 1225 (10th Cir. 2002) (\"[W]e view [Justice O'Connor's] concurrence as the holding of the Court in <i>McKune.</i>\"); <i>Reed v. McKune,</i> 298 F.3d 946, 952 (10th Cir.2002) (\"Justice O'Connor's narrower position in her concurrence represents the holding of the plurality decision.\"). We agree with this approach. Justice O'Connor's concurrence is \"arguably more narrow than the plurality's and therefore constitutes the holding of the Court.\" <i>Lurie v. Wittner,</i> 228 F.3d 113, 130 (2d Cir.2000); <i>see also Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc.,</i> 199 F.3d 572, 580 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[I]nferior courts should give effect to the narrowest ground upon which a majority of the Justices supporting the judgment would agree.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty presented by this interpretive precept is that Justice O'Connor does not purport to lay out any abstract analysis or unifying theory that would prefigure her views regarding the constitutionality of New Hampshire's program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Taken together, the O'Connor and plurality opinions do not clearly foreshadow how the court would decide our case. For example, the plurality opinion notes in passing that nonparticipation in the Kansas program \"[does] not extend [the] term of incarceration,\" nor does it \"affect [ ] eligibility for good-time credits or parole.\" <i>McKune,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2027 (plurality opinion). Later in the opinion, however, the plurality notes that in <i>Minnesota v. Murphy,</i> 465 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984), the Court found no compulsion to speak when \"the defendant feared the possibility of additional jail time as a result of his decision to remain silent.\" <i>McKune,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2029 (plurality opinion). Thus, while the plurality apparently felt it noteworthy that a loss of parole was not at stake in Kansas, whereas it is in this case, it is far from clear that the plurality would regard such a consequence as constitutionally impermissible. Under these circumstances, in considering our earlier opinion in light of <i>McKune</i> as the remand requires, we have no clear guideposts. Instead, we must resort to our own sound judgment, so long as it does not conflict with existing precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our prior decision in this case examined a long line of Supreme Court precedents in which compulsion under the Fifth Amendment was at issue. We recognized that historically the Supreme Court had described compulsion in relatively broad terms. However, we also noted that in more recent decisions the Court had held that the analysis is more circumscribed in the prison context. Citing the \"watershed case\" of <i>Turner v. Safley,</i> 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), we reaffirmed our prior observation that when \"burdens are laid upon the exercise of constitutional rights by prisons, the Supreme Court's current approach is to give very substantial latitude to the state's judgment.\" <i>Ainsworth,</i> 244 F.3d at 213 (quoting <i>Beauchamp v. Murphy,</i> 37 F.3d 700, 704 (1st Cir.1994), <i>cert. denied,</i> 514 U.S. 1019, 115 S.Ct. 1365, 131 L.Ed.2d 221 (1995)). Only \"unreasonable\" burdens are proscribed. In determining whether a burden is unreasonable, we will look to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">whether the state's policy serves a valid governmental interest; the extent to which the prisoner is foreclosed or burdened in exercising his rights; and the presence or absence of reasonable alternatives for the government to achieve the same ends by other means without significant cost or impairment of the governmental interest at stake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 214 (quoting <i>Beauchamp,</i> 37 F.3d at 705 (citing <i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 89-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254) (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without recapitulating our prior decision in its entirety, suffice it to say that we determined that the burden placed on appellants is not an unreasonable one. We began by citing criminological studies and social science research, noting that the admission of crimes is \"widely believed to be a necessary prerequisite for successful treatment\" of sex offenders. We determined that \"New Hampshire unmistakably has a valid government interest in establishing the SOP, and in requiring sex offenders to admit past conduct to participate in it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 215.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we examined the extent of the burden. We began by noting that \"inmates do not have a `liberty right' to parole\" under either federal or New Hampshire law. <i>Id.</i> at 216. We recognized that there was some burden placed on appellants' exercise of their Fifth Amendment rights, but that the extent of that burden was mitigated by three factors. First, appellants were not suffering a new or additional penalty by being denied parole. Since parole involves relief from a penalty that has already been imposed &#8212; the full period of incarceration to which appellants were sentenced &#8212; parole can be considered a \"benefit that the state may condition on completion of the program.\" <i>Id.</i> at 216. Given the \"crucial distinction between being deprived of a liberty one has ... and being denied a conditional liberty that one desires,\" <i>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal &amp; Corr. Complex,</i> 442 U.S. 1, 9, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979), we concluded that this aspect of the burden mitigated its extent. Second, we noted that the extent of the burden was also mitigated by the voluntary nature of the program (notwithstanding the consequences of nonparticipation). Third, we observed that the denial of parole was not entirely automatic. While the vast majority of parolees had completed the SOP prior to release, a few inmates are paroled each year despite having not completed the SOP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we considered \"whether reasonable alternatives exist for the government to achieve its ends without significant cost or impairment to the governmental interest at stake.\" <i>Ainsworth,</i> 244 F.3d at 220. We recognized that the state could offer a grant of limited-use immunity to appellants before requiring them to disclose past misconduct. Any impermissible Fifth Amendment compulsion would thus be obviated. However, we concluded that \"the decision about whether to grant immunity to sex offenders is a policy choice that lies in the state's hands.\" <i>Id.</i> at 221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our ultimate conclusion under the <i>Turner</i> framework, in light of the three factors outlined above, was as follows: Weighing these factors, and drawing upon the meaning of compulsion under the Fifth Amendment developed by the precedents we have cited, we conclude that the reduced likelihood of parole for refusing to participate in the SOP does not constitute a penalty sufficient to compel incriminating speech in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ainsworth,</i> 244 F.3d at 221.

For example, the plurality opinion notes in passing that nonparticipation in the Kansas program \"[does] not extend [the] term of incarceration,\" nor does it \"affect [ ] eligibility for good-time credits or parole.\" <i>McKune,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2027 (plurality opinion). Later in the opinion, however, the plurality notes that in <i>Minnesota v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, while the plurality apparently felt it noteworthy that a loss of parole was not at stake in Kansas, whereas it is in this case, it is far from clear that the plurality would regard such a consequence as constitutionally impermissible. Under these circumstances, in considering our earlier opinion in light of <i>McKune</i> as the remand requires, we have no clear guideposts. Instead, we must resort to our own sound judgment, so long as it does not conflict with existing precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our prior decision in this case examined a long line of Supreme Court precedents in which compulsion under the Fifth Amendment was at issue. We recognized that historically the Supreme Court had described compulsion in relatively broad terms. However, we also noted that in more recent decisions the Court had held that the analysis is more circumscribed in the prison context. Citing the \"watershed case\" of <i>Turner v.

We began by citing criminological studies and social science research, noting that the admission of crimes is \"widely believed to be a necessary prerequisite for successful treatment\" of sex offenders. We determined that \"New Hampshire unmistakably has a valid government interest in establishing the SOP, and in requiring sex offenders to admit past conduct to participate in it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 215.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we examined the extent of the burden. We began by noting that \"inmates do not have a `liberty right' to parole\" under either federal or New Hampshire law. <i>Id.</i> at 216. We recognized that there was some burden placed on appellants' exercise of their Fifth Amendment rights, but that the extent of that burden was mitigated by three factors. First, appellants were not suffering a new or additional penalty by being denied parole. Since parole involves relief from a penalty that has already been imposed &#8212; the full period of incarceration to which appellants were sentenced &#8212; parole can be considered a \"benefit that the state may condition on completion of the program.\" <i>Id.</i> at 216. Given the \"crucial distinction between being deprived of a liberty one has ... and being denied a conditional liberty that one desires,\" <i>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal &amp; Corr. Complex,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110085\"><a href=\"/opinion/110085/greenholtz-v-inmates-of-neb-penal-and-correctional-complex/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110085\"><a href=\"/opinion/110085/greenholtz-v-inmates-of-neb-penal-and-correctional-complex/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1979), we concluded that this aspect of the burden mitigated its extent. Second, we noted that the extent of the burden was also mitigated by the voluntary nature of the program (notwithstanding the consequences of nonparticipation). Third, we observed that the denial of parole was not entirely automatic. While the vast majority of parolees had completed the SOP prior to release, a few inmates are paroled each year despite having not completed the SOP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we considered \"whether reasonable alternatives exist for the government to achieve its ends without significant cost or impairment to the governmental interest at stake.\" <i>Ainsworth,</i> 244 F.3d at 220. We recognized that the state could offer a grant of limited-use immunity to appellants before requiring them to disclose past misconduct. Any impermissible Fifth Amendment compulsion would thus be obviated. However, we concluded that \"the decision about whether to grant immunity to sex offenders is a policy choice that lies in the state's hands.\" <i>Id.</i> at 221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our ultimate conclusion under the <i>Turner</i> framework, in light of the three factors outlined above, was as follows: Weighing these factors, and drawing upon the meaning of compulsion under the Fifth Amendment developed by the precedents we have cited, we conclude that the reduced likelihood of parole for refusing to participate in the SOP does not constitute a penalty sufficient to compel incriminating speech in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ainsworth,</i> 244 F.3d at 221.
