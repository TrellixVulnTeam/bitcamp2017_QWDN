William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge\n                 and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Mark B. Laroche, by appointment of the court, was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, with whom\nDonald C. Lockhart and Zechariah Chafee, Assistant United States\nAttorneys, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 13, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam. Appellant Manuel Ramon Vargas pleaded guilty\n\nto one count of illegal reentry following a prior deportation in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a).       The district court sentenced him\n\nto thirty months' imprisonment.        Vargas appeals, contending that\n\nthe   underlying   deportation     order    failed   to   comport    with   due\n\nprocess.\n\n            The elements of illegal reentry are that the defendant\n\n\"(1) is an alien, (2) was previously deported, and (3) thereafter\n\nentered,    or   attempted   to    enter,    the   United   States    without\n\npermission.\"     United States v. Contreras Palacios, 492 F.3d 39, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).       An alien may negate the second element via\n\ncollateral attack of the underlying deportation order by satisfying\n\ncertain criteria enumerated in 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d).             Here, Vargas\n\nattempted to obtain relief pursuant to § 1326(d) by filing a motion\n\nto dismiss before the district court. See United States v. Vargas,\n\n479 F. Supp. 2d 252 (D.R.I. 2007) (rejecting Vargas's motion to\n\ndismiss).   Now, on appeal, Vargas suggests that the district court\n\nerred by denying his motion to dismiss.\n\n            At the plea hearing, Vargas initially expressed a desire\n\nto continue to pursue on appeal his collateral attack against the\n\nprior deportation order.          The district court, however, plainly\n\ninstructed Vargas that, by pleading guilty, he would waive his\n\nright to appeal his conviction for the crime of illegal reentry.\n\nBecause Vargas pleaded guilty following the district court's clear\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fand unequivocal admonition, his challenge is foreclosed by Tollett\n\nv. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258 (1973).     Under the Tollett doctrine,\n\nsubject to narrowly construed exceptions, \"a defendant who pleads\n\nguilty unconditionally waives all 'independent claims relating to\n\nthe deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the\n\nentry of the guilty plea.'\"    United States v. Gaffney, 469 F.3d\n\n211, 214 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Tollett, 411 U.S. at 267).\n\nVargas does not argue that his plea was involuntary, see United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 298 (1st Cir. 2005), or\n\nthat the court lacked jurisdiction, see United States v. Cordero,\n\n42 F.3d 697, 698-99 (1st Cir. 1994).   Consequently, Vargas may not\n\nnow renew his pre-plea collateral attack against the deportation\n\norder upon which the instant conviction is predicated.   See United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez, 85 F. App'x 881, 882 (4th Cir. 2004) (per\n\ncuriam) (unpublished); United States v. Ortega-Guzman, 76 F. App'x\n\n846, 847-48 (10th Cir. 2003) (unpublished); United States v. Lemus-\n\nBarragan, 5 F. App'x 737, 737-38 (9th Cir. 2001) (per curiam)\n\n(unpublished).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
