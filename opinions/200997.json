This appeal was taken from a refusal of the\n\ndistrict court to stay discovery pending its decision on certain\n\ndispositive motions.     The district court decided those motions on\n\nMarch 31, 2004.   This appeal is, therefore, moot.1    See CMM Cable\n\nRep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc., 48 F.3d 618, 621 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (explaining that \"an appeal, although live when taken, may be\n\nrendered moot by subsequent developments\").\n\n           In addition, the defendants have filed a motion to stay\n\ndiscovery in the district court pending the determination of the\n\nappeals that they have taken from the district court's March 31\n\norders.   That motion is not properly filed in this proceeding.   In\n\nall events, the record does not reflect that similar relief was\n\nrequested and denied in the lower court.     Consequently, even were\n\nthe motion properly before us, we would reject it.    See Beaulieu v.\n\nIRS, 865 F.2d 1351, 1352 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"[I]t is a party's first\n\nobligation to seek any relief that might fairly have been though\n\navailable in the district court before seeking it on appeal.\").\n\n           We need go no further.   This appeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n           The appeal is dismissed as moot and the motion to stay is\n\ndenied without prejudice.      Costs will be taxed in favor of the\n\nappellees.\n\n     1\n      Because the appeal is dismissed as moot, we need not decide\n— and take no view on — the appealability vel non of the initial\nstay order.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f",
