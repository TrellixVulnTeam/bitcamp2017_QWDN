Ivette     Rivera\n\nRodríguez and her daughter, Glenda Neris Rivera, appeal the summary\n\njudgment dismissing their Bivens action against Gregory Beninato\n\n(FBI), Edwin López (FBI), and Miguel Falcón (Puerto Rico Police\n\nDepartment) for alleged violations of their Fourth Amendment rights\n\nin the execution of a search warrant.                See Bivens v. Six Unknown\n\nFed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).                   The district court\n\nheld    that    defendants    were    entitled    to    qualified    immunity     on\n\nplaintiffs’ constitutional claims and dismissed plaintiffs’ related\n\nclaims. On appeal plaintiffs raise four contentions of error: the\n\ninvalidity of the search warrant; the insufficient showing of\n\nprobable cause in the affidavit; the failure of the officers to\n\nshow the warrant to Ms. Rodríguez before commencing the search; and\n\nthe unconstitutional timing of the execution of the warrant.\n\nHaving carefully considered plaintiffs’ arguments, we find no error\n\nin the district court’s disposition and affirm.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n               On May 22, 2003, at approximately 5:50 a.m., FBI and\n\nother    government     agents     searched    the     home   of   Ivette     Rivera\n\nRodríguez (Ms. Rodríguez) at Calle Eugenio Maria de Hostos #31 in\n\nconnection       with   a    May     19th   robbery     of    an    armored     car.\n\nMs. Rodríguez and her daughter, both barefoot and in nightclothes,\n\nwere handcuffed and taken outside during the search.                  In addition\n\nto searching the home, the agents, pursuant to another warrant,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fseized a white 1998 Mitsubishi Mirage Technica (plate number DBW-\n\n680), which had been parked in front of Ms. Rodríguez’s residence.\n\n            Gregory Beninato (Beninato), who was present at the time\n\nof the search, prepared and signed the affidavit which supported\n\nthe issuance of the warrant to search the Rodríguez home. The\n\naffidavit contained, among other things, information from three\n\nanonymous sources.    A magistrate judge reviewed the affidavit and\n\nsigned the warrant.     The warrant contained no description of the\n\nproperty to be searched for or seized but referred to the “attached\n\naffidavit.”    Ms. Rodríguez requested a copy of the warrant at the\n\noutset of the search but the agents declined to give it to her.\n\nThe district court found that the agents gave her the warrant with\n\nan attached list of the items sought following the search.\n\n                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            Summary judgment may be granted if “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nWe   draw   all   reasonable   inferences   from    the   record   in   the\n\nnonmovant’s favor and may base our decision on any rationale,\n\nregardless of whether the lower court used the same.               Cox v.\n\nHainey, 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            We review the lower court’s probable cause determination\n\nde novo, with any factual findings reviewed for clear error.\n\nUnited States v. Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 n.6 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fIf   presented    with   a    marginal    case,       we   defer   to    the   issuing\n\nmagistrate's determination of probable cause.                  Illinois v. Gates,\n\n462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983).\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n           Plaintiffs contend that the search of the house pursuant\n\nto an invalid warrant issued on an insufficient affidavit violated\n\ntheir Fourth Amendment rights.            The district court held that the\n\ndefendant officers were entitled to qualified immunity because\n\nunder the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, it was not\n\nunreasonable for them to conclude that one or more of the robbers\n\nmight be in the Rodríguez residence and that plaintiffs had failed\n\nto cast any real doubt on the validity of the warrant.\n\nI.         QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n\n           The parameters of qualified immunity are well settled and\n\nwe need plow no new ground. Qualified immunity protects government\n\nofficials performing discretionary functions from liability and the\n\nburdens of litigation.         Hainey, 391 F.3d at 29.1             In determining\n\nwhether a government official has qualified immunity, this court\n\nconducts   a     three-part    inquiry:        “(i)    whether     the   plaintiff's\n\nallegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation; (ii)\n\n\n      1\n      Ms. Rodríguez brought this suit under Bivens, but for\npurposes of a qualified immunity analysis courts treat Bivens\nactions and § 1983 actions as being the same. Wilson v. Layne,\n526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999). Thus, when conducting the analysis, we\ncite cases discussing qualified immunity regardless of the basis\nfor plaintiff’s claim.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fwhether the constitutional right at issue was clearly established\n\nat    the    time   of    the   putative     violation;   and     (iii)   whether   a\n\nreasonable officer, situated similarly to the defendant, would have\n\nunderstood      the      challenged    act   or   omission   to    contravene    the\n\ndiscerned constitutional right.” Limone v. Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 44\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).          Qualified immunity protects “all but the plainly\n\nincompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”                      Malley v.\n\nBriggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).                 A court should conduct the\n\nanalysis in this sequence and at the earliest possible stage in the\n\ncase.       Hainey, 391 F.3d at 29-30.\n\nII.            THE WARRANT\n\n               We begin our discussion with the warrant because the\n\npresence of a valid warrant is essential to the lawfulness of the\n\nsearch (in the absence of exigent circumstances).                     It was clearly\n\nestablished law at the time of the search that a warrant must\n\ndescribe the things to be seized with particularity.                      The Fourth\n\nAmendment states that “no Warrant shall issue, but upon probable\n\ncause,       supported     by   Oath    or    affirmation,      and     particularly\n\ndescribing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be\n\nseized.”        U.S. Const. amend. IV (emphasis added); see In re\n\nLafayette Acad., 610 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1979)(holding warrant\n\ninvalid for lack of particularity).               In United States v. Morris,\n\n977 F.2d 677, 681 (1st Cir. 1993), we stated:\n\n               In requiring a particular description of\n               articles to be seized, the Fourth Amendment\n\n                                           -5-\n\f             “‘makes general searches . . . impossible and\n             prevents the seizure of one thing under a\n             warrant describing another. As to what is to\n             be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of\n             the officer executing the warrant.’” United\n             States v. Fuccillo, 808 F.2d 173, 175 (1st\n             Cir. 1987) (quoting Stanford v. Texas,\n             379 U.S. 476, 485 (1965)).           Unfettered\n             discretion by the executing officer is one of\n             the principal evils against which the Fourth\n             Amendment    provides   protection,  and   thus\n             warrants    which    lack   particularity   are\n             prohibited.\n\n             The warrant supporting the search of Ms. Rodríguez’s home\n\ncontained no description of the property to be seized.         In the\n\nspace on the form calling for the magistrate to “describe the\n\nperson or property” believed to be on the premises to be searched,\n\nthe warrant simply restated the description of the premises to be\n\nsearched.2    Considering only the face of the warrant, no reasonable\n\nofficer could believe it described the items to be seized with\n\nparticularity.\n\n\n     2\n             One residence located at #31 Eugenio Maria de\n             Hostos Street, Caguas, Puerto Rico, described\n             as a rust colored two story residence, with a\n             patio located on the roof.     A stairwell is\n             located on the right side of the structure\n             which leads up to a small room. A concrete\n             wall, approximately 6 ft. in height, brown in\n             color, with square holes, and a black wrought\n             iron gate, approximately 6 ft. in height are\n             located at the front of the residence.     The\n             gate slides manually from left to right. Two\n             doors, white in color, can be distinguished in\n             the front of the residence. A wall separates\n             the residence from the street behind the\n             residence.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            Defendants contend, however, that a warrant that does not\n\ncontain a description of the property to be seized may nevertheless\n\nbe valid under the Fourth Amendment if it cross-references and is\n\naccompanied by supporting documents which contain the required\n\ndescription.    In Lafayette Academy we said, “‘The traditional rule\n\nis that the generality of a warrant cannot be cured by the\n\nspecificity of the affidavit which supports it . . . . Specificity\n\nis required in the warrant itself in order to limit the discretion\n\nof the executing officer as well as to give notice to the party\n\nsearched.’”     610 F.2d at 4 (quoting United States v. Johnson,\n\n541 F.2d 1311, 1325 (8th Cir. 1976)). We recognized, however, that\n\nunder some circumstances an affidavit may cure deficiencies which\n\nwould exist were the warrant to stand alone. We said in United\n\nStates v. Klein, 565 F.2d 183, 186 n.3 (1st Cir. 1977), “An\n\naffidavit     may   be    referred    to    for   purposes     of    providing\n\nparticularity if the affidavit accompanies the warrant and the\n\nwarrant uses suitable words of reference which incorporate the\n\naffidavit.” See also, Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 557-58 (2004)\n\n(listing cases from multiple circuits which have allowed warrants\n\nto be construed with reference to an incorporated affidavit).\n\n            Here,   the   warrant    stated,   “See   attached      affidavit,”\n\nlanguage    which   suffices   to    incorporate      the   affidavit.      See\n\nMassachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U.S. 981, 990 n.7 (1984).                     A\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\freasonable officer standing in defendants’ shoes could believe the\n\nwarrant to be sufficient to authorize the search.3\n\nIII.       THE AFFIDAVIT\n\n           We next consider whether a reasonable officer could have\n\nbelieved that probable cause existed to search the Rodríguez\n\nresidence.   Malley, 475 U.S. at 344-45.   Probable cause existed if\n\nthe “totality of the circumstances” disclosed in the Beninato\n\naffidavit demonstrates “a fair probability that contraband or\n\nevidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.”    Gates,\n\n462 U.S. at 238.   For purposes of qualified immunity, the test is\n\nwhether the unlawfulness of the search would have been apparent to\n\nan objectively reasonable officer standing in defendants’ shoes.\n\nHainey, 391 F.3d at 31.    Qualified immunity will be lost only if\n\nthe affidavit is “so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to\n\nrender official belief in its existence unreasonable.”      Malley,\n\n475 U.S. at 345.\n\n           The Beninato affidavit, on the basis of which the warrant\n\nissued, relates the facts of an armored car robbery carried out by\n\nunidentified persons on May 19, 2003. With reference to the search\n\n\n       3\n      Plaintiffs, who bear the burden of establishing the\ninvalidity of the search, have not shown that the affidavit did not\naccompany the warrant to the search. See Kirkland v. St. Vrain\nValley Sch. Dist. No. Re-1J, 464 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006)\n(“After a defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, the\nburden shifts to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff must first\nestablish that the defendant's actions violated a constitutional or\nstatutory right.”).\n\n                                -8-\n\fof   Ms.   Rodríguez’s   residence,    it   contains   the   following\n\ninformation:\n\n           1.   An anonymous source reported that on the morning of\n\nMay 19, 2003, the source observed individuals transferring bags\n\nfrom a minivan in which the robbers had escaped to other vehicles,\n\nincluding a white Mitsubishi Mirage Technica.\n\n           2. Another anonymous source reported on October 2, 2002,\n\nthat the two individuals who robbed a bank on October 1, 2002,\n\ndrove a white Mitsubishi Mirage Technica, plate DBW-680, and that\n\none of the individuals lived at Calle Eugenio Maria de Hostos #31\n\nwith his mother.\n\n           3.   In an interview with police, Alfredo Neris Rivera\n\nadvised that his mother resides at Eugenio Maria de Hostos.4\n\n           4.   Witnesses (in addition to anonymous sources) also\n\nplaced the white Mitsubishi Mirage Technica, plate DBW-680, at the\n\nscene of three bank robberies during June, July, and October 2002.\n\n           5. On May 21, 2003, law enforcement officers located the\n\nwhite Mitsubishi Mirage Technica, plate DBW-680, “at Calle Eugenio\n\nMaria de Hostos.”\n\n           When an affidavit relies on the statements of anonymous\n\nsources, it must provide some information upon which the magistrate\n\njudge may assess the credibility of the sources’ information.\n\n     4\n      The affidavit disclosed that the white Mitsubishi Mirage\nTechnica was registered to Arodi Rolon Alvarado but did not\ndisclose that, as the court found, Arodi was Alfredo’s wife.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fUnited States v. Barnard, 299 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 2002).                               A\n\nnonexhaustive list of factors that a reviewing court will consider\n\nin a probable cause determination from an informant includes:\n\nwhether an affidavit supports the probable veracity or basis of\n\nknowledge     of    persons    supplying          hearsay      information;      whether\n\ninformant     statements      are    self-authenticating;              whether    a    law\n\nenforcement affiant included a professional assessment of the\n\nprobable significance of the facts related by the informant based\n\non experience or expertise; and, whether some or all of the\n\ninformant's        factual    statements          were      corroborated         wherever\n\nreasonable and practicable.           Id.\n\n            The affidavit relied on three anonymous sources.5                         It is\n\nsilent with respect to the veracity or basis of knowledge of the\n\nsources, the sources’ reliability, and how the sources obtained the\n\ninformation.        It does not contain a law enforcement officer’s\n\nprofessional assessment of the probable significance of the facts\n\nrelated by the informants based on his experience or expertise.\n\nAnd   the   informants’       statements      were       not   self-authenticating.\n\n            None of the factors, however, is indispensable. Stronger\n\nevidence on one may compensate for a weaker or deficient showing on\n\nanother.      Zayas-Diaz,      95    F.3d    at     111.       Here,    the   affidavit\n\ncontained      information          that      provided         substantial         cross-\n\n\n\n      5\n      As the information from the other sources is sufficient, we\nneed not consider that from a third anonymous source.\n\n                                           -10-\n\fcorroboration.      Several informants and witnesses known to the\n\npolice saw the white Mitsubishi Mirage Technica at the scene of\n\nthree 2002 bank robberies and an informant saw it again on the day\n\nof the 2003 armored car robbery receiving bags being unloaded from\n\nthe robbers’ van.     Two days after the 2003 robbery, police located\n\nthe white Mitsubishi Mirage Technica, plate DBW-680, at Calle\n\nEugenio Maria de Hostos.        One informant saw two individuals who\n\nrobbed a bank on October 2, 2002, driving a white Mitsubishi Mirage\n\nTechnica and advised that one of them lived at Calle Eugenio Maria\n\nde Hostos #31 with his mother.      Alfredo Rodríguez told police that\n\nhis mother resides at Calle Eugenio Maria de Hostos #31.\n\n           Considering    the    totality   of   the    circumstances,     a\n\nreasonable officer could infer that the white Mitsubishi Mirage\n\nTechnica was being used in connection with robberies, that one of\n\nthe persons implicated in the robberies lived at Calle Eugenio\n\nMaria de Hostos #31 where the car was spotted, and that therefore\n\ncontraband might be found at that location.\n\nIV.        THE REMAINING ISSUES\n\n           Plaintiffs’ remaining contentions are readily disposed\n\nof.   Plaintiffs concede that the Constitution does not require the\n\nsearching officer to serve the search warrant before commencing the\n\nsearch.   See Groh, 540 U.S. at 562 n.5.\n\n           Finally,    plaintiffs     contend    that   the   search     was\n\nunreasonable as a nighttime search in violation of the Fourth\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fAmendment and of the 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. time frame specified\n\nin the warrant.6         The district court did not make a finding of the\n\ntime       at   which   the   search     commenced      but    it   did    find   that   a\n\ncommanding        officer     “ordered    the    FBI    SWAT    team      to   enter   the\n\nresidence at approximately 5:50 a.m.”                   Thus, the execution must\n\nhave       occurred     sometime   after    5:50       a.m.—close      enough     to   the\n\n6:00 a.m. hour to make any deviation from the warrant de minimis.\n\nSee United States v. Twenty-Two Thousand, Two Hundred Eighty Seven\n\nDollars, 709 F.2d 442, 448-49 (6th Cir. 1983).\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n                We conclude that on the record before us, defendants were\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.

The district court\n\nheld    that    defendants    were    entitled    to    qualified    immunity     on\n\nplaintiffs’ constitutional claims and dismissed plaintiffs’ related\n\nclaims. On appeal plaintiffs raise four contentions of error: the\n\ninvalidity of the search warrant; the insufficient showing of\n\nprobable cause in the affidavit; the failure of the officers to\n\nshow the warrant to Ms. Rodríguez before commencing the search; and\n\nthe unconstitutional timing of the execution of the warrant.\n\nHaving carefully considered plaintiffs’ arguments, we find no error\n\nin the district court’s disposition and affirm.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n               On May 22, 2003, at approximately 5:50 a.m., FBI and\n\nother    government     agents     searched    the     home   of   Ivette     Rivera\n\nRodríguez (Ms. Rodríguez) at Calle Eugenio Maria de Hostos #31 in\n\nconnection       with   a    May     19th   robbery     of    an    armored     car.\n\nMs. Rodríguez and her daughter, both barefoot and in nightclothes,\n\nwere handcuffed and taken outside during the search.                  In addition\n\nto searching the home, the agents, pursuant to another warrant,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fseized a white 1998 Mitsubishi Mirage Technica (plate number DBW-\n\n680), which had been parked in front of Ms. Rodríguez’s residence.\n\n            Gregory Beninato (Beninato), who was present at the time\n\nof the search, prepared and signed the affidavit which supported\n\nthe issuance of the warrant to search the Rodríguez home. The\n\naffidavit contained, among other things, information from three\n\nanonymous sources.    A magistrate judge reviewed the affidavit and\n\nsigned the warrant.     The warrant contained no description of the\n\nproperty to be searched for or seized but referred to the “attached\n\naffidavit.”    Ms. Rodríguez requested a copy of the warrant at the\n\noutset of the search but the agents declined to give it to her.\n\nThe district court found that the agents gave her the warrant with\n\nan attached list of the items sought following the search.\n\n                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            Summary judgment may be granted if “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”        Fed.

The district court held that the\n\ndefendant officers were entitled to qualified immunity because\n\nunder the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, it was not\n\nunreasonable for them to conclude that one or more of the robbers\n\nmight be in the Rodríguez residence and that plaintiffs had failed\n\nto cast any real doubt on the validity of the warrant.\n\nI.         QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n\n           The parameters of qualified immunity are well settled and\n\nwe need plow no new ground. Qualified immunity protects government\n\nofficials performing discretionary functions from liability and the\n\nburdens of litigation.         Hainey, 391 F.3d at 29.1             In determining\n\nwhether a government official has qualified immunity, this court\n\nconducts   a     three-part    inquiry:        “(i)    whether     the   plaintiff's\n\nallegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation; (ii)\n\n\n      1\n      Ms. Rodríguez brought this suit under Bivens, but for\npurposes of a qualified immunity analysis courts treat Bivens\nactions and § 1983 actions as being the same.

Thus, when conducting the analysis, we\ncite cases discussing qualified immunity regardless of the basis\nfor plaintiff’s claim.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fwhether the constitutional right at issue was clearly established\n\nat    the    time   of    the   putative     violation;   and     (iii)   whether   a\n\nreasonable officer, situated similarly to the defendant, would have\n\nunderstood      the      challenged    act   or   omission   to    contravene    the\n\ndiscerned constitutional right.” Limone v.

THE WARRANT\n\n               We begin our discussion with the warrant because the\n\npresence of a valid warrant is essential to the lawfulness of the\n\nsearch (in the absence of exigent circumstances).                     It was clearly\n\nestablished law at the time of the search that a warrant must\n\ndescribe the things to be seized with particularity.                      The Fourth\n\nAmendment states that “no Warrant shall issue, but upon probable\n\ncause,       supported     by   Oath    or    affirmation,      and     particularly\n\ndescribing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be\n\nseized.”        U.S. Const. amend.

Unfettered\n             discretion by the executing officer is one of\n             the principal evils against which the Fourth\n             Amendment    provides   protection,  and   thus\n             warrants    which    lack   particularity   are\n             prohibited.\n\n             The warrant supporting the search of Ms. Rodríguez’s home\n\ncontained no description of the property to be seized.         In the\n\nspace on the form calling for the magistrate to “describe the\n\nperson or property” believed to be on the premises to be searched,\n\nthe warrant simply restated the description of the premises to be\n\nsearched.2    Considering only the face of the warrant, no reasonable\n\nofficer could believe it described the items to be seized with\n\nparticularity.\n\n\n     2\n             One residence located at #31 Eugenio Maria de\n             Hostos Street, Caguas, Puerto Rico, described\n             as a rust colored two story residence, with a\n             patio located on the roof.     A stairwell is\n             located on the right side of the structure\n             which leads up to a small room. A concrete\n             wall, approximately 6 ft. in height, brown in\n             color, with square holes, and a black wrought\n             iron gate, approximately 6 ft. in height are\n             located at the front of the residence.     The\n             gate slides manually from left to right. Two\n             doors, white in color, can be distinguished in\n             the front of the residence. A wall separates\n             the residence from the street behind the\n             residence.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            Defendants contend, however, that a warrant that does not\n\ncontain a description of the property to be seized may nevertheless\n\nbe valid under the Fourth Amendment if it cross-references and is\n\naccompanied by supporting documents which contain the required\n\ndescription.    In Lafayette Academy we said, “‘The traditional rule\n\nis that the generality of a warrant cannot be cured by the\n\nspecificity of the affidavit which supports it . . . . Specificity\n\nis required in the warrant itself in order to limit the discretion\n\nof the executing officer as well as to give notice to the party\n\nsearched.’”     610 F.2d at 4 (quoting United States v.

THE AFFIDAVIT\n\n           We next consider whether a reasonable officer could have\n\nbelieved that probable cause existed to search the Rodríguez\n\nresidence.   Malley, 475 U.S. at 344-45.   Probable cause existed if\n\nthe “totality of the circumstances” disclosed in the Beninato\n\naffidavit demonstrates “a fair probability that contraband or\n\nevidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.”    Gates,\n\n462 U.S. at 238.   For purposes of qualified immunity, the test is\n\nwhether the unlawfulness of the search would have been apparent to\n\nan objectively reasonable officer standing in defendants’ shoes.\n\nHainey, 391 F.3d at 31.    Qualified immunity will be lost only if\n\nthe affidavit is “so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to\n\nrender official belief in its existence unreasonable.”      Malley,\n\n475 U.S. at 345.\n\n           The Beninato affidavit, on the basis of which the warrant\n\nissued, relates the facts of an armored car robbery carried out by\n\nunidentified persons on May 19, 2003. With reference to the search\n\n\n       3\n      Plaintiffs, who bear the burden of establishing the\ninvalidity of the search, have not shown that the affidavit did not\naccompany the warrant to the search.

Here,    the   affidavit\n\ncontained      information          that      provided         substantial         cross-\n\n\n\n      5\n      As the information from the other sources is sufficient, we\nneed not consider that from a third anonymous source.\n\n                                           -10-\n\fcorroboration.      Several informants and witnesses known to the\n\npolice saw the white Mitsubishi Mirage Technica at the scene of\n\nthree 2002 bank robberies and an informant saw it again on the day\n\nof the 2003 armored car robbery receiving bags being unloaded from\n\nthe robbers’ van.     Two days after the 2003 robbery, police located\n\nthe white Mitsubishi Mirage Technica, plate DBW-680, at Calle\n\nEugenio Maria de Hostos.        One informant saw two individuals who\n\nrobbed a bank on October 2, 2002, driving a white Mitsubishi Mirage\n\nTechnica and advised that one of them lived at Calle Eugenio Maria\n\nde Hostos #31 with his mother.      Alfredo Rodríguez told police that\n\nhis mother resides at Calle Eugenio Maria de Hostos #31.\n\n           Considering    the    totality   of   the    circumstances,     a\n\nreasonable officer could infer that the white Mitsubishi Mirage\n\nTechnica was being used in connection with robberies, that one of\n\nthe persons implicated in the robberies lived at Calle Eugenio\n\nMaria de Hostos #31 where the car was spotted, and that therefore\n\ncontraband might be found at that location.\n\nIV.        THE REMAINING ISSUES\n\n           Plaintiffs’ remaining contentions are readily disposed\n\nof.   Plaintiffs concede that the Constitution does not require the\n\nsearching officer to serve the search warrant before commencing the\n\nsearch.   See Groh, 540 U.S. at 562 n.5.\n\n           Finally,    plaintiffs     contend    that   the   search     was\n\nunreasonable as a nighttime search in violation of the Fourth\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fAmendment and of the 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. time frame specified\n\nin the warrant.6         The district court did not make a finding of the\n\ntime       at   which   the   search     commenced      but    it   did    find   that   a\n\ncommanding        officer     “ordered    the    FBI    SWAT    team      to   enter   the\n\nresidence at approximately 5:50 a.m.”                   Thus, the execution must\n\nhave       occurred     sometime   after    5:50       a.m.—close      enough     to   the\n\n6:00 a.m. hour to make any deviation from the warrant de minimis.\n\nSee United States v.

The judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\n                Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      This was no nighttime search.
