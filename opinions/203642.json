The question before us is whether\n\na dispute over the validity of an arbitration agreement should be\n\ndecided by a court or by an arbitrator.               Appellant is Coverall\n\nNorth   America,      Inc.,    itself    the   subsidiary        of    still   larger\n\nenterprises.    Coverall contracts to provide commercial janitorial\n\ncleaning services to building owners or operators throughout the\n\nUnited States.     It \"franchises\" other companies or individuals to\n\ndo the actual cleaning of the premises and has more than 5,000 such\n\nfranchises in place in the United States.\n\n            The franchise agreements promise to supply the franchisee\n\nwith equipment, training, a quality control program, and billing\n\nand collection services, as well as a set amount of initial\n\ncleaning business per month for buildings whose owners or operators\n\nhave contracted with Coverall. In exchange, Coverall receives from\n\nthe franchisee up-front fees in the range of $12,000 to $21,500,\n\nand additional payment for each cleaning job a franchisee performs.\n\n            Disputes have arisen between Coverall and a number of its\n\nfranchisees over whether Coverall made misrepresentations, kept its\n\ncontractual promises, wrongly classified franchisees as independent\n\ncontractors, and over other aspects of the relationship.                           On\n\nFebruary 15, 2007, a dozen or so franchisees filed a class action\n\nagainst    Coverall    in     federal    district   court    in       Massachusetts,\n\nalleging    fraud,     misrepresentation,        breach     of    contract,     lost\n\nbenefits,    improper       deductions    of   earnings,    and       violations   of\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fminimum wage, overtime, and consumer protection laws.   It appears\n\nfrom the record that the plaintiffs in many cases are recent\n\nimmigrants and persons with limited education.\n\n              Among the nearly dozen named plaintiffs, three had\n\nfranchise agreements containing arbitration clauses--Pius Awuah,\n\nDenisse Pineda, and Richard Barrientos, who are the appellees in\n\nthis court.     Apparently Coverall only recently introduced such\n\nprovisions into its standard franchise contract.    For two of the\n\nthree appellees, the franchise agreement states that if required\n\nmediation processes are not successful,\n\n          all controversies, disputes or claims between\n          Coverall, its officers, directors, agents\n          and/or   employees    (in   their   respective\n          capacities) and Franchisee . . . arising out\n          of or related to the relationship of the\n          parties, this Agreement, any related agreement\n          between the parties, and/or any specification,\n          standard or operating procedure of Coverall,\n          including those set forth in the Coverall\n          Policy and Procedure Manual . . . shall be\n          submitted promptly for arbitration.\n\n          The third contract has a similar provision but also\n\nstates that parties agree to submit to arbitration disputes about\n\nthe validity of the franchise agreement or related agreements.\n\nHowever, the agreements signed by all three appellees also provide\n\nthat \"unless otherwise provided or the parties agree otherwise,\n\narbitration shall be in accordance with the then current Rules of\n\nthe American Arbitration Association.\"    Rule 7(a) of those rules\n\nprovides that \"[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his\n\n\n                                -3-\n\for her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to\n\nthe existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.\"\n\n           Citing these provisions, Coverall filed motions to stay\n\nthe district court proceedings as to these three franchisees\n\npending arbitration.       The three franchisees responded that the\n\narbitration      agreements   were    unconscionable,        citing      various\n\nprovisions of the agreements which they said made arbitration\n\ncostly or unfair.1      Coverall responded in turn that, by the terms\n\nof Rule 7(a), a challenge to the validity of the arbitration\n\nprovision was itself a matter for the arbitrator to determine.\n\n           In a decision dated July 1, 2008, the district court held\n\nthat the franchise agreements did not clearly and unmistakably\n\nreflect   such    an   intention,    and   the    district   judge    referred\n\nplaintiffs' claims of unconscionability to a magistrate judge.\n\nAwuah v. Coverall N. Am., Inc., 563 F. Supp. 2d 312 (D. Mass.\n\n2008).    Coverall     then   appealed     to    this   court,   which    stayed\n\nproceedings before the magistrate judge pending this appeal.\n\n           Coverall's interlocutory appeal to this court is pursuant\n\nto the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. ยง 16(a)(1)(A)\n\n\n\n     1\n      These included the agreement's cost-sharing provisions,\nprohibition of punitive and exemplary damages, bar on class action\narbitration, \"no-modification clause,\" a requirement that the\nlosing party pay the prevailing party's attorney costs, a\nprohibition on a claimant using the results of another arbitration\nproceeding in his own proceeding, and a provision allowing Coverall\nalone to initiate suit in court in certain circumstances.       See\nArticles 21(A)(11), 22.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f(2000), which entitles a party to appeal a refusal to stay court\n\nproceedings pending arbitration.           Fit Tech, Inc. v. Bally Total\n\nFitness Holding Corp., 374 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).2              Although\n\nthe district court has not yet definitively rejected arbitration on\n\nthe   merits   of   the   three   appellees'   claims,   it   has   rejected\n\narbitration on the issue--which Coverall claims to be committed to\n\nthe arbitrator--as to whether the arbitration clause itself is so\n\nunconscionable that an interlocutory appeal is permitted. Madol v.\n\nDan Nelson Automotive Group, 372 F.3d 997, 998-99 (8th Cir. 2004).\n\n           The FAA provides that where \"the making of the agreement\n\nfor arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in\n\nissue,\" arbitration should be ordered.          9 U.S.C. ยง 4.       Based on\n\nthis language, the Supreme Court has determined that whether an\n\nissue is subject to arbitration under an agreement containing an\n\narbitration clause is itself presumptively a matter for the court\n\nto decide before ordering arbitration.          First Options v. Kaplan,\n\n514 U.S. 938, 943-44 (1995).         However, this general rule can be\n\nqualified by agreement of the parties.\n\n           Thus, where the parties have themselves \"clearly and\n\nunmistakably agreed\" that the arbitrator should decide whether an\n\nissue is arbitrable, the Supreme Court has held that this issue is\n\n\n      2\n      The franchise agreements provide that they are subject to the\nFAA but are otherwise governed by the substantive law of the state\nin which the franchisee is located: here, the three appellees are\nrespectively residents of Massachusetts (Awuah), New Jersey\n(Pineda), and Pennsylvania (Barrientos).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fto be decided by the arbitrator.       E.g., Howsam v. Dean Witter\n\nReynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 83 (2002).   Additionally, a challenge\n\nto the validity of the contract itself is subject to arbitration\n\nand that allocation of authority to the arbitrator will also be\n\nrespected by the court.    Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna, 546\n\nU.S. 440, 443-45 (2006).\n\n           Yet where the parties merely agree that the validity of\n\nthe contract should be subject to arbitration, this does not commit\n\nto the arbitrator a dispute about whether the arbitration clause is\n\nvalid.   Id. at 445-46; Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg.\n\nCo., 388 U.S. 395, 404 (1967).    Unfortunately, the Supreme Court\n\nhas not said definitively whether the arbitrator gets to decide the\n\nlatter question where, as here, arbitration rules incorporated in\n\nthe contract say that the arbitrator should decide whether the\n\narbitration clause is valid.\n\n           How the Court would decide such a case is not entirely\n\nclear.   On the one hand, one might think that Howsam's principle of\n\nparty autonomy might extend to such a case.   On the other, Buckeye\n\ndid not cite Howsam and conceivably the Court might regard the\n\nvalidity of the arbitration clause as a special case in which\n\nchallenges should be decided by the judge, either as a matter of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpolicy or because of statutory language.3                 If the matter were\n\ncompletely open in this circuit, we are not certain of the outcome.\n\n                 However, this court has said expressly that the validity\n\nof an arbitration clause is itself a matter for the arbitrator\n\nwhere the agreement so provides.           In Apollo Computer v. Berg, 886\n\nF.2d       469    (1st   Cir.   1989),    the   parties   had   consented   to\n\nInternational Chamber of Commerce rules, which stipulate that\n\nchallenges to the \"validity of the arbitration agreement\" shall be\n\ndecided by an arbitrator.          Apollo said:\n\n                 These provisions clearly and unmistakably\n                 allow the arbitrator to determine her own\n                 jurisdiction when, as here, there exists a\n                 prima facie agreement to arbitrate whose\n                 continued existence and validity is being\n                 questioned. The arbitrator should decide\n                 whether a valid arbitration agreement exists.\n                 . . .\n\nId. at 473-74.\n\n                 Apollo accords with the views of at least one other\n\ncircuit, see Terminix Int'l Co. LP v. Palmer Ranch Ltd., 432 F.3d\n\n1327, 1332-33 (11th Cir. 2005), and has been taken at face value by\n\n\n\n       3\n      In a number of cases, including ones where AAA rules were\ncross-referenced in the contract, courts have examined arbitration\nclauses for unconscionability, but without any indication that\nanyone argued that the issue should have gone to arbitration based\non the cross-reference. See Davis v. O'Melveny & Myers, 485 F.3d\n1066 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. dismissed, 128 S.Ct. 1117 (2008);\nNagrampa v. Mailcoups, Inc., 469 F.3d 1257 (9th Cir. 2006); Gemini\nErnst & Young v. Nackel, 346 F.3d 360, 365 (2d Cir. 2003);\nAlexander v. Anthony Int'l, L.P., 341 F.3d 256 (3d Cir. 2003);\nBurden v. Check Into Cash of Kentucky, LLC, 267 F.3d 483 (6th Cir.\n2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 970 (2002).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fa district court within our own circuit.        Morris v. Regis Corp.,\n\nNo. 08-68-P-H, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56612, at *3 (D. Me., July 25,\n\n2008).   Morris held that district court should adjudicate the\n\nvalidity of the arbitration clause only because the contract at\n\nissue contained ambiguous language with respect to whether a court\n\nor arbitrator should decide this gateway dispute.          Morris, 2008\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 56612, at *6, *9-10.\n\n          Admittedly, the precise controversy in Apollo involved\n\nthe question whether one party had authority to bind the other to\n\narbitrate rather than (as here) a question of unconscionability.\n\nStill, the language quoted above, although perhaps broader than\n\nnecessary to resolve the controversy, did constitute the rationale\n\nfor the decision.   Given that the Supreme Court has not clearly\n\nspoken, the interests of predictability are served by respecting\n\nour own prior language unless either the Supreme Court or an en\n\nbanc panel say otherwise. United States v. Holloway, 499 F.3d 114,\n\n118 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          The   district   court   did   not   disagree   with   Apollo's\n\npremise--that the parties can contract for the arbitrator to decide\n\nchallenges to his own authority--but the court held that the\n\nparties in this case had not clearly and unmistakably committed to\n\nthe arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause itself\n\nwas valid.   This would be a hard position to defend if one looked\n\nonly to the language of Rule 7(a), since it appears explicitly to\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\faffirm the arbitrator's authority to decide challenges to the\n\n\"validity of the arbitration agreement.\"\n\n             The   district   court's       answer     was    that   allowing    the\n\narbitrator to decide the validity of the arbitration clause would\n\nentail     his   striking   the    clause    if   it   were    invalid;    yet   the\n\narbitration clause provides that \"the arbitrator . . . shall not\n\nalter or otherwise reform the terms of this agreement\" and other\n\nlanguage to the same effect.          By contrast, the agreements have a\n\nseverability clause allowing other provisions to survive if \"a\n\ncourt of competent jurisdiction\" invalidates a provision.\n\n             With respect, this is too thin a basis for concluding\n\nthat the agreements' language \"evinces an intent to allow questions\n\nof arbitrability to be decided by a court.\"              Awuah, 563 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 315.     Rule 7(a) says plainly that the arbitrator may \"rule on\n\nhis   or   her   own   jurisdiction\"    including       any    objection    to   the\n\n\"existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.\"                     This\n\nis about as \"clear and unmistakable\" as language can get, meeting\n\nthe standard we have followed.           E.g., Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch\n\nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 170 F.3d 1, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nSkirchak v. Dynamic Research Corp., 508 F.3d 49, 60-61 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n             Of course, a larger question, or perhaps several, lie\n\nbehind this controversy.          It is doubtful that many people read the\n\nsmall print in form contracts, let alone the small print in\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\farbitration rules that are cross-referenced by such contracts,\n\nhowever explicit the cross-reference.    While one might expect more\n\nin a commercial setting, Coverall franchisees are (it is alleged)\n\noften far from sophisticated business men and women. In all events\n\nwhether \"knowledge\" is the real issue may be doubtful.\n\n           Franchise agreements are often contracts of adhesion\n\noffered to those with little bargaining power; probably few would\n\ngo unsigned even if Rule 7(a) were printed in bold type on the\n\nfront page.4     Further, courts have no general power to relieve\n\nparties of bad bargains except in extreme cases, i.e., where the\n\ncontract is unconscionable. The question here is simply who should\n\ndecide the unconscionability issue, and the arbitration clause said\n\nin effect that this was for the arbitrator.\n\n           What is the most potent concern is an argument embedded,\n\nalthough   not   stressed,   in   appellees'   brief,   namely,   that\n\narbitration in this case may itself be an illusory remedy.         In\n\nprinciple, having the arbitrator decide questions of validity may\n\nbe fine if the parties so agreed; but if the terms for getting an\n\narbitrator to decide the issue are impossibly burdensome, that\n\noutcome would indeed raise public policy concerns. If arbitration\n\n\n     4\n      Although pertinent on certain issues, the fact that an\nagreement is a contract of adhesion or includes documents by cross-\nreferences does not alone make the document invalid or nullify the\ncross reference. E.g., Am. Bankers Mortgage Corp. v. Fed. Home\nLoan Mortgage Corp., 75 F.3d 1401 (9th Cir. 1996); Level Export\nCorp. v. Wolz, Aiken & Co., 305 N.Y. 82, 87 (1953); Farnsworth, ยง\n4.28 n.33; Williston on Contracts, ยง 49:22 (4th ed. 2008).\n\n                                  -10-\n\fprevents plaintiffs from vindicating their rights, it is no longer\n\na \"valid alternative to traditional litigation.\"               Kristian v.\n\nComcast Corp., 446 F.3d 25, 37 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n          In this instance, appellees' allegations do raise claims\n\nthat the arbitral forum is illusory.        In particular, they assert\n\nthat the amounts likely to be recovered by each of the individual\n\nfranchisees may be modest and that the costs of arbitration itself-\n\n-independent of counsel fees, which can be contingent--would be\n\noverwhelming.    Of course, court litigation can also be expensive,\n\nbut at least one does not need to pay the judge.                 Appellees\n\nasserted in the district court that franchisees\n\n          could be liable for substantial administrative\n          fees payable up front to the American\n          Arbitration Association, half of all the\n          arbitration fees to the neutral arbitrator\n          (who, at a reduced hourly rate of $300.00 per\n          hour, would still cost $2,400 per day for both\n          hearings and writing) and in addition would\n          have to pay the whole fee for an additional\n          arbitrator.\n\n          They   also   submitted    the   report   of   a   franchise   law\n\nattorney, which states that he has been involved in arbitrations\n\nthat have cost $100,000 and $150,000 (for one arbitrator) and\n\n$300,000 and $400,000 (for a three-person arbitration panel). This\n\nconcern about fees is the most prominent but not necessarily the\n\nonly basis for appellees' claim that in practical effect they have\n\nno real opportunity to get issues, including unconscionability,\n\nresolved in arbitration.\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f           In Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Randolph, the Supreme Court\n\nobserved: \"It may well be that the existence of large arbitration\n\ncosts could preclude a litigant . . . from effectively vindicating\n\nher federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.\"                 531 U.S. 79,\n\n90 (2000).     Several circuits have agreed that where a plaintiff\n\nasserts that excessive arbitration costs deprive the plaintiff of\n\nan arbitral forum, a threshold issue is presented for consideration\n\nby the court.        See, e.g., Faber v. Menard, Inc., 367 F.3d 1048,\n\n1052-55 (8th Cir. 2004); Musnick v. King Motor Co., 325 F.3d 1255,\n\n1259 (11th Cir. 2003).\n\n           Yet, despite the failure of Coverall's brief to respond\n\nto these contentions, how burdensome arbitration would be is\n\nuncertain.     Given the franchise fees, the individuals may have\n\nsubstantial      but    not   excessively     large      claims--the    complaint\n\nspecifies amounts of $4,740, $8,500 and $46,064, respectively, but\n\nsays   these   are     bare   minimums.      And   the    American     Arbitration\n\nAssociation rules have provisions for expedited treatment and\n\nlesser procedures in cases where the amount in controversy is\n\n$75,000 or less.         Whether access to the arbitrator is really a\n\ncolorable defense is not clear on this record.\n\n           Our     concern     here   is     not   with     unconscionability--\n\nessentially a fairness issue, Farnsworth, supra, ยง 4.28, at 584-\n\n88,--but more narrowly with whether the arbitration regime here is\n\nstructured so as to prevent a litigant from having access to the\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\farbitrator to resolve claims, including unconscionability defenses.\n\nThe standard for such a showing of illusoriness would also be high-\n\n-all formal dispute resolution involves costs and inconvenience.\n\nBut if the remedy is truly illusory, a court should not order\n\narbitration at all but decide the entire dispute itself.\n\n            Accordingly, although our view of the district court's\n\ninitial role is narrower, we agree that the appellees are entitled\n\nto a ruling by that court as to whether the arbitration remedy in\n\nthis case is illusory.

Appellant is Coverall North America, Inc., itself the subsidiary of still larger enterprises. Coverall contracts to provide commercial janitorial cleaning services to building owners or operators throughout the United States. It \"franchises\" other companies or individuals to do the actual cleaning of the premises and has more than 5,000 such franchises in place in the United States.</p>\n<p>The franchise agreements promise to supply the franchisee with equipment, training, a quality control program, and billing and collection services, as well as a set amount of initial cleaning business per month for buildings whose owners or operators have contracted with Coverall. In exchange, Coverall receives from the franchisee up-front fees in the range of $12,000 to $21,500, and additional payment for each cleaning job a franchisee performs.</p>\n<p>Disputes have arisen between Coverall and a number of its franchisees over whether Coverall made misrepresentations, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> kept its contractual promises, wrongly classified franchisees as independent contractors, and over other aspects of the relationship. On February 15, 2007, a dozen or so franchisees filed a class action against Coverall in federal district court in Massachusetts, alleging fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, lost benefits, improper deductions of earnings, and violations of minimum wage, overtime, and consumer protection laws. It appears from the record that the plaintiffs in many cases are recent immigrants and persons with limited education.</p>\n<p>Among the nearly dozen named plaintiffs, three had franchise agreements containing arbitration clausesยPius Awuah, Denisse Pineda, and Richard Barrientos, who are the appellees in this court. Apparently Coverall only recently introduced such provisions into its standard franchise contract. For two of the three appellees, the franchise agreement states that if required mediation processes are not successful,</p>\n<blockquote>all controversies, disputes or claims between Coverall, its officers, directors, agents and/or employees (in their respective capacities) and Franchisee ... arising out of or related to the relationship of the parties, this Agreement, any related agreement between the parties, and/or any specification, standard or operating procedure of Coverall, including those set forth in the Coverall Policy and Procedure Manual ... shall be submitted promptly for arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p>The third contract has a similar provision but also states that parties agree to submit to arbitration disputes about the validity of the franchise agreement or related agreements. However, the agreements signed by all three appellees also provide that \"unless otherwise provided or the parties agree otherwise, arbitration shall be in accordance with the then current Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\" Rule 7(a) of those rules provides that \"[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.\"</p>\n<p>Citing these provisions, Coverall filed motions to stay the district court proceedings as to these three franchisees pending arbitration. The three franchisees responded that the arbitration agreements were unconscionable, citing various provisions of the agreements which they said made arbitration costly or unfair.<sup>[1]</sup> Coverall responded in turn that, by the terms of Rule 7(a), a challenge to the validity of the arbitration provision was itself a matter for the arbitrator to determine.</p>\n<p>In a decision dated July 1, 2008, the district court held that the franchise agreements did not clearly and unmistakably reflect such an intention, and the district judge referred plaintiffs' claims of unconscionability to a magistrate judge. <i>Awuah v. Coverall N. Am., Inc.,</i> 563 F.Supp.2d 312 (D.Mass.2008). Coverall then appealed to this court, which stayed proceedings before the magistrate judge pending this appeal.</p>\n<p>Coverall's interlocutory appeal to this court is pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. ยง 16(a)(1)(A) (2000), which entitles a party to appeal a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> refusal to stay court proceedings pending arbitration. <i>Fit Tech, Inc. v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> 374 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004).<sup>[2]</sup> Although the district court has not yet definitively rejected arbitration on the merits of the three appellees' claims, it has rejected arbitration on the issueยwhich Coverall claims to be committed to the arbitratorยas to whether the arbitration clause itself is so unconscionable that an interlocutory appeal is permitted. <i>Madol v. Dan Nelson Automotive Group,</i> 372 F.3d 997, 998-99 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The FAA provides that where \"the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,\" arbitration should be ordered. 9 U.S.C. ยง 4. Based on this language, the Supreme Court has determined that whether an issue is subject to arbitration under an agreement containing an arbitration clause is itself presumptively a matter for the court to decide before ordering arbitration. <i>First Options v. Kaplan,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 943-44, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). However, this general rule can be qualified by agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p>Thus, where the parties have themselves \"clearly and unmistakably agreed\" that the arbitrator should decide whether an issue is arbitrable, the Supreme Court has held that this issue is to be decided by the arbitrator. <i>E.g., </i><i>Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S. 79, 83, 123 S.Ct. 588, 154 L.Ed.2d 491 (2002). Additionally, a challenge to the validity of the contract itself is subject to arbitration and that allocation of authority to the arbitrator will also be respected by the court. <i>Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna,</i> 546 U.S. 440, 443-45, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038 (2006).</p>\n<p>Yet where the parties merely agree that the validity of the <i>contract</i> should be subject to arbitration, this does not commit to the arbitrator a dispute about whether the arbitration <i>clause</i> is valid. <i>Id.</i> at 445-46, 126 S.Ct. 1204; <i>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</i> 388 U.S. 395, 404, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967). Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has not said definitively whether the arbitrator gets to decide the latter question where, as here, arbitration rules incorporated in the contract say that the arbitrator should decide whether the arbitration clause is valid.</p>\n<p>How the Court would decide such a case is not entirely clear. On the one hand, one might think that <i>Howsam</i>'s principle of party autonomy might extend to such a case. On the other, <i>Buckeye</i> did not cite <i>Howsam</i> and conceivably the Court might regard the validity of the arbitration clause as a special case in which challenges should be decided by the judge, either as a matter of policy or because of statutory language.<sup>[3]</sup> If the matter were completely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> open in this circuit, we are not certain of the outcome.</p>\n<p>However, this court has said expressly that the validity of an arbitration clause is itself a matter for the arbitrator where the agreement so provides. In <i>Apollo Computer v. Berg,</i> 886 F.2d 469 (1st Cir.1989), the parties had consented to International Chamber of Commerce rules, which stipulate that challenges to the \"validity of the arbitration agreement\" shall be decided by an arbitrator. <i>Apollo</i> said:</p>\n<blockquote>These provisions clearly and unmistakably allow the arbitrator to determine her own jurisdiction when, as here, there exists a <i>prima facie</i> agreement to arbitrate whose continued existence and validity is being questioned. The arbitrator should decide whether a valid arbitration agreement exists....</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 473-74.</p>\n<p><i>Apollo</i> accords with the views of at least one other circuit, <i>see </i><i>Terminix Int'l Co. LP v. Palmer Ranch Ltd.,</i> 432 F.3d 1327, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2005), and has been taken at face value by a district court within our own circuit. <i>Morris v. Regis Corp.,</i> No. 08-68-P-H, 2008 WL 2945431, *1-2, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56612, at *3 (D.Me., July 25, 2008). <i>Morris</i> held that district court should adjudicate the validity of the arbitration clause only because the contract at issue contained ambiguous language with respect to whether a court or arbitrator should decide this gateway dispute. <i>Morris,</i> 2008 WL 2945431, at *2-3, *3-4, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56612, at *6, *9-10.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the precise controversy in <i>Apollo</i> involved the question whether one party had authority to bind the other to arbitrate rather than (as here) a question of unconscionability. Still, the language quoted above, although perhaps broader than necessary to resolve the controversy, did constitute the rationale for the decision. Given that the Supreme Court has not clearly spoken, the interests of predictability are served by respecting our own prior language unless either the Supreme Court or an <i>en banc</i> panel say otherwise. <i>United States v. Holloway,</i> 499 F.3d 114, 118 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The district court did not disagree with <i>Apollo</i>'s premiseยthat the parties can contract for the arbitrator to decide challenges to his own authorityยbut the court held that the parties in this case had not clearly and unmistakably committed to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause itself was valid. This would be a hard position to defend if one looked only to the language of Rule 7(a), since it appears explicitly to affirm the arbitrator's authority to decide challenges to the \"validity of the arbitration agreement.\"</p>\n<p>The district court's answer was that allowing the arbitrator to decide the validity of the arbitration clause would entail his striking the clause if it were invalid; yet the arbitration clause provides that \"the arbitrator ... shall not alter or otherwise reform the terms of this agreement\" and other language to the same effect. By contrast, the agreements have a severability clause allowing other provisions to survive if \"a court of competent jurisdiction\" invalidates a provision.</p>\n<p>With respect, this is too thin a basis for concluding that the agreements' language \"evinces an intent to allow questions of arbitrability to be decided by a court.\" <i>Awuah,</i> 563 F.Supp.2d at 315. Rule 7(a) says plainly that the arbitrator may \"rule on his or her own jurisdiction\" including any objection to the \"existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.\" This is about as \"clear and unmistakable\" as language can get, meeting the standard we have followed. <i>E.g., </i><i>Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> 170 F.3d 1, 20-21 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Skirchak v. Dynamics Research Corp.,</i> 508 F.3d 49, 60-61 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Of course, a larger question, or perhaps several, lie behind this controversy. It is doubtful that many people read the small print in form contracts, let alone the small print in arbitration rules that are cross-referenced by such contracts, however explicit the cross-reference. While one might expect more in a commercial setting, Coverall franchisees are (it is alleged) often far from sophisticated business men and women. In all events whether \"knowledge\" is the real issue may be doubtful.</p>\n<p>Franchise agreements are often contracts of adhesion offered to those with little bargaining power; probably few would go unsigned even if Rule 7(a) were printed in bold type on the front page.<sup>[4]</sup> Further, courts have no general power to relieve parties of bad bargains except in extreme cases, <i>i.e.,</i> where the contract is unconscionable. The question here is simply who should decide the unconscionability issue, and the arbitration clause said in effect that this was for the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>What is the most potent concern is an argument embedded, although not stressed, in appellees' brief, namely, that arbitration in this case may itself be an illusory remedy. In principle, having the arbitrator decide questions of validity may be fine if the parties so agreed; but if the terms for getting an arbitrator to decide the issue are impossibly burdensome, that outcome would indeed raise public policy concerns. If arbitration prevents plaintiffs from vindicating their rights, it is no longer a \"valid alternative to traditional litigation.\" <i>Kristian v. Comcast Corp.,</i> 446 F.3d 25, 37 (1st Cir.2006)</p>\n<p>In this instance, appellees' allegations do raise claims that the arbitral forum is illusory. In particular, they assert that the amounts likely to be recovered by each of the individual franchisees may be modest and that the costs of arbitration itselfย independent of counsel fees, which can be contingentยwould be overwhelming. Of course, court litigation can also be expensive, but at least one does not need to pay the judge. Appellees asserted in the district court that franchisees</p>\n<blockquote>could be liable for substantial administrative fees payable up front to the American Arbitration Association, half of all the arbitration fees to the neutral arbitrator (who, at a reduced hourly rate of $300.00 per hour, would still cost $2,400 per day for both hearings and writing) and in addition would have to pay the whole fee for an additional arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<p>They also submitted the report of a franchise law attorney, which states that he has been involved in arbitrations that have cost $100,000 and $150,000 (for one arbitrator) and $300,000 and $400,000 (for a three-person arbitration panel). This concern about fees is the most prominent but not necessarily the only basis for appellees' claim that in practical effect they have no real opportunity to get issues, including unconscionability, resolved in arbitration.</p>\n<p>In <i>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Randolph,</i> the Supreme Court observed: \"It may well <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant ... from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.\" 531 U.S. 79, 90, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000). Several circuits have agreed that where a plaintiff asserts that excessive arbitration costs deprive the plaintiff of an arbitral forum, a threshold issue is presented for consideration by the court. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Faber v. Menard, Inc.,</i> 367 F.3d 1048, 1052-55 (8th Cir.2004); <i>Musnick v. King Motor Co.,</i> 325 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the failure of Coverall's brief to respond to these contentions, how burdensome arbitration would be is uncertain. Given the franchise fees, the individuals may have substantial but not excessively large claimsยthe complaint specifies amounts of $4,740, $8,500 and $46,064, respectively, but says these are bare minimums. And the American Arbitration Association rules have provisions for expedited treatment and lesser procedures in cases where the amount in controversy is $75,000 or less. Whether access to the arbitrator is really a colorable defense is not clear on this record.</p>\n<p>Our concern here is not with unconscionabilityยessentially a fairness issue, Farnsworth, <i>supra,</i> ยง 4.28, at 584-88,ยbut more narrowly with whether the arbitration regime here is structured so as to <i>prevent</i> a litigant from having access to the arbitrator to resolve claims, including unconscionability defenses. The standard for such a showing of illusoriness would also be highยall formal dispute resolution involves costs and inconvenience. But if the remedy is truly illusory, a court should not order arbitration at all but decide the entire dispute itself.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, although our view of the district court's initial role is narrower, we agree that the appellees are entitled to a ruling by that court as to whether the arbitration remedy in this case is illusory. Our current stay will terminate when the mandate issues in the case. Subject to the district court's wishes, we see no reason why the magistrate judge cannot proceed with the inquiry, refocused in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p>The district court's refusal to order arbitration at this time is <i>affirmed</i> on the grounds set forth above, and the matter is <i>remanded</i> to the district court for proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These included the agreement's cost-sharing provisions, prohibition of punitive and exemplary damages, bar on class action arbitration, \"no-modification clause,\" a requirement that the losing party pay the prevailing party's attorney costs, a prohibition on a claimant using the results of another arbitration proceeding in his own proceeding, and a provision allowing Coverall alone to initiate suit in court in certain circumstances. <i>See</i> Articles 21(A)(11), 22.</p>\n<p>[2]  The franchise agreements provide that they are subject to the FAA but are otherwise governed by the substantive law of the state in which the franchisee is located: here, the three appellees are respectively residents of Massachusetts (Awuah), New Jersey (Pineda), and Pennsylvania (Barrientos).</p>\n<p>[3]  In a number of cases, including ones where AAA rules were cross-referenced in the contract, courts have examined arbitration clauses for unconscionability, but without any indication that anyone argued that the issue should have gone to arbitration based on the cross-reference. <i>See </i><i>Davis v. O'Melveny &amp; Myers,</i> 485 F.3d 1066 (9th Cir.2007), <i>cert. dismissed,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1117, 169 L.Ed.2d 845 (2008); <i>Nagrampa v. Mailcoups, Inc.,</i> 469 F.3d 1257 (9th Cir.2006); <i>Gemini Ernst &amp; Young v. Nackel,</i> 346 F.3d 360, 365 (2d Cir.2003); <i>Alexander v.

Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122248\"><a href=\"/opinion/122248/howsam-v-dean-witter-reynolds-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 83, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122248\"><a href=\"/opinion/122248/howsam-v-dean-witter-reynolds-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span> (2002). Additionally, a challenge to the validity of the contract itself is subject to arbitration and that allocation of authority to the arbitrator will also be respected by the court. <i>Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145683\"><a href=\"/opinion/145683/buckeye-check-cashing-inc-v-cardegna/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 443-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145683\"><a href=\"/opinion/145683/buckeye-check-cashing-inc-v-cardegna/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1270</span></a></span> (1967). Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has not said definitively whether the arbitrator gets to decide the latter question where, as here, arbitration rules incorporated in the contract say that the arbitrator should decide whether the arbitration clause is valid.</p>\n<p>How the Court would decide such a case is not entirely clear. On the one hand, one might think that <i>Howsam</i>'s principle of party autonomy might extend to such a case. On the other, <i>Buckeye</i> did not cite <i>Howsam</i> and conceivably the Court might regard the validity of the arbitration clause as a special case in which challenges should be decided by the judge, either as a matter of policy or because of statutory language.<sup>[3]</sup> If the matter were completely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> open in this circuit, we are not certain of the outcome.</p>\n<p>However, this court has said expressly that the validity of an arbitration clause is itself a matter for the arbitrator where the agreement so provides. In <i>Apollo Computer v. Berg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529938\"><a href=\"/opinion/529938/apollo-computer-inc-v-helge-berg/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989), the parties had consented to International Chamber of Commerce rules, which stipulate that challenges to the \"validity of the arbitration agreement\" shall be decided by an arbitrator. <i>Apollo</i> said:</p>\n<blockquote>These provisions clearly and unmistakably allow the arbitrator to determine her own jurisdiction when, as here, there exists a <i>prima facie</i> agreement to arbitrate whose continued existence and validity is being questioned. The arbitrator should decide whether a valid arbitration agreement exists....</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 473-74.</p>\n<p><i>Apollo</i> accords with the views of at least one other circuit, <i>see </i><i>Terminix Int'l Co. LP v. Palmer Ranch Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77170\"><a href=\"/opinion/77170/terminix-international-v-palmer-ranch-limited/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1327</span></a></span>, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2005), and has been taken at face value by a district court within our own circuit. <i>Morris v. Regis Corp.,</i> No. 08-68-P-H, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2945431</span></span>, *1-2, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">56612</span></span>, at *3 (D.Me., July 25, 2008). <i>Morris</i> held that district court should adjudicate the validity of the arbitration clause only because the contract at issue contained ambiguous language with respect to whether a court or arbitrator should decide this gateway dispute. <i>Morris,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2945431</span></span>, at *2-3, *3-4, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">56612</span></span>, at *6, *9-10.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the precise controversy in <i>Apollo</i> involved the question whether one party had authority to bind the other to arbitrate rather than (as here) a question of unconscionability. Still, the language quoted above, although perhaps broader than necessary to resolve the controversy, did constitute the rationale for the decision. Given that the Supreme Court has not clearly spoken, the interests of predictability are served by respecting our own prior language unless either the Supreme Court or an <i>en banc</i> panel say otherwise. <i>United States v. Holloway,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202916\"><a href=\"/opinion/202916/united-states-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 118 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The district court did not disagree with <i>Apollo</i>'s premiseยthat the parties can contract for the arbitrator to decide challenges to his own authorityยbut the court held that the parties in this case had not clearly and unmistakably committed to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause itself was valid. This would be a hard position to defend if one looked only to the language of Rule 7(a), since it appears explicitly to affirm the arbitrator's authority to decide challenges to the \"validity of the arbitration agreement.\"</p>\n<p>The district court's answer was that allowing the arbitrator to decide the validity of the arbitration clause would entail his striking the clause if it were invalid; yet the arbitration clause provides that \"the arbitrator ... shall not alter or otherwise reform the terms of this agreement\" and other language to the same effect. By contrast, the agreements have a severability clause allowing other provisions to survive if \"a court of competent jurisdiction\" invalidates a provision.</p>\n<p>With respect, this is too thin a basis for concluding that the agreements' language \"evinces an intent to allow questions of arbitrability to be decided by a court.\" <i>Awuah,</i> 563 F.Supp.2d at 315. Rule 7(a) says plainly that the arbitrator may \"rule on his or her own jurisdiction\" including any objection to the \"existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.\" This is about as \"clear and unmistakable\" as language can get, meeting the standard we have followed. <i>E.g., </i><i>Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762261\"><a href=\"/opinion/762261/75-empl-prac-dec-p-45823-22-employee-benefits-cas-2980-susan-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 20-21 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Skirchak v. Dynamics Research Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203024\"><a href=\"/opinion/203024/skirchak-v-dynamics-research-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 60-61 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Of course, a larger question, or perhaps several, lie behind this controversy. It is doubtful that many people read the small print in form contracts, let alone the small print in arbitration rules that are cross-referenced by such contracts, however explicit the cross-reference. While one might expect more in a commercial setting, Coverall franchisees are (it is alleged) often far from sophisticated business men and women. In all events whether \"knowledge\" is the real issue may be doubtful.</p>\n<p>Franchise agreements are often contracts of adhesion offered to those with little bargaining power; probably few would go unsigned even if Rule 7(a) were printed in bold type on the front page.<sup>[4]</sup> Further, courts have no general power to relieve parties of bad bargains except in extreme cases, <i>i.e.,</i> where the contract is unconscionable. The question here is simply who should decide the unconscionability issue, and the arbitration clause said in effect that this was for the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>What is the most potent concern is an argument embedded, although not stressed, in appellees' brief, namely, that arbitration in this case may itself be an illusory remedy. In principle, having the arbitrator decide questions of validity may be fine if the parties so agreed; but if the terms for getting an arbitrator to decide the issue are impossibly burdensome, that outcome would indeed raise public policy concerns. If arbitration prevents plaintiffs from vindicating their rights, it is no longer a \"valid alternative to traditional litigation.\" <i>Kristian v. Comcast Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794138\"><a href=\"/opinion/794138/martha-kristian-and-james-d-masterman-v-comcast-corporation-comcast-mo/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2006)</p>\n<p>In this instance, appellees' allegations do raise claims that the arbitral forum is illusory. In particular, they assert that the amounts likely to be recovered by each of the individual franchisees may be modest and that the costs of arbitration itselfย independent of counsel fees, which can be contingentยwould be overwhelming. Of course, court litigation can also be expensive, but at least one does not need to pay the judge. Appellees asserted in the district court that franchisees</p>\n<blockquote>could be liable for substantial administrative fees payable up front to the American Arbitration Association, half of all the arbitration fees to the neutral arbitrator (who, at a reduced hourly rate of $300.00 per hour, would still cost $2,400 per day for both hearings and writing) and in addition would have to pay the whole fee for an additional arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<p>They also submitted the report of a franchise law attorney, which states that he has been involved in arbitrations that have cost $100,000 and $150,000 (for one arbitrator) and $300,000 and $400,000 (for a three-person arbitration panel). This concern about fees is the most prominent but not necessarily the only basis for appellees' claim that in practical effect they have no real opportunity to get issues, including unconscionability, resolved in arbitration.</p>\n<p>In <i>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Randolph,</i> the Supreme Court observed: \"It may well <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant ... from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118394\"><a href=\"/opinion/118394/green-tree-financial-corp-ala-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118394\"><a href=\"/opinion/118394/green-tree-financial-corp-ala-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span> (2000). Several circuits have agreed that where a plaintiff asserts that excessive arbitration costs deprive the plaintiff of an arbitral forum, a threshold issue is presented for consideration by the court. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Faber v. Menard, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786139\"><a href=\"/opinion/786139/steve-r-faber-v-menard-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span>, 1052-55 (8th Cir.2004); <i>Musnick v. King Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76103\"><a href=\"/opinion/76103/russell-musnick-v-king-motor-company-of-fort-lauderdale-dba-king-auto/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span>, 1259 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the failure of Coverall's brief to respond to these contentions, how burdensome arbitration would be is uncertain. Given the franchise fees, the individuals may have substantial but not excessively large claimsยthe complaint specifies amounts of $4,740, $8,500 and $46,064, respectively, but says these are bare minimums. And the American Arbitration Association rules have provisions for expedited treatment and lesser procedures in cases where the amount in controversy is $75,000 or less. Whether access to the arbitrator is really a colorable defense is not clear on this record.</p>\n<p>Our concern here is not with unconscionabilityยessentially a fairness issue, Farnsworth, <i>supra,</i> ยง 4.28, at 584-88,ยbut more narrowly with whether the arbitration regime here is structured so as to <i>prevent</i> a litigant from having access to the arbitrator to resolve claims, including unconscionability defenses. The standard for such a showing of illusoriness would also be highยall formal dispute resolution involves costs and inconvenience. But if the remedy is truly illusory, a court should not order arbitration at all but decide the entire dispute itself.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, although our view of the district court's initial role is narrower, we agree that the appellees are entitled to a ruling by that court as to whether the arbitration remedy in this case is illusory. Our current stay will terminate when the mandate issues in the case. Subject to the district court's wishes, we see no reason why the magistrate judge cannot proceed with the inquiry, refocused in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p>The district court's refusal to order arbitration at this time is <i>affirmed</i> on the grounds set forth above, and the matter is <i>remanded</i> to the district court for proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These included the agreement's cost-sharing provisions, prohibition of punitive and exemplary damages, bar on class action arbitration, \"no-modification clause,\" a requirement that the losing party pay the prevailing party's attorney costs, a prohibition on a claimant using the results of another arbitration proceeding in his own proceeding, and a provision allowing Coverall alone to initiate suit in court in certain circumstances. <i>See</i> Articles 21(A)(11), 22.</p>\n<p>[2]  The franchise agreements provide that they are subject to the FAA but are otherwise governed by the substantive law of the state in which the franchisee is located: here, the three appellees are respectively residents of Massachusetts (Awuah), New Jersey (Pineda), and Pennsylvania (Barrientos).</p>\n<p>[3]  In a number of cases, including ones where AAA rules were cross-referenced in the contract, courts have examined arbitration clauses for unconscionability, but without any indication that anyone argued that the issue should have gone to arbitration based on the cross-reference. <i>See </i><i>Davis v.
