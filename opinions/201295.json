Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Torruella, Howard, Circuit Judges,\n\n                 and DiClerico,* U.S. District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Edward C. Roy, Jr., with whom Office of the Federal Public\nDefender was on brief, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney with whom\nCraig N. Moore, United States Attorney and Kenneth P. Madden,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 20, 2004\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.     Eddie Reyes pleaded guilty to two counts of\n\ndistributing heroin and one count of possessing heroin with intent\n\nto   distribute.     See    21   U.S.C.      §§   841(a)(1),    841(b)(1)(B)     &\n\n841(b)(1)(C).       He     appeals     the    sentences      imposed    for    his\n\nconvictions, arguing that the district court improperly took into\n\naccount   in    calculating      his   criminal      history    score    a    1994\n\nMassachusetts state court \"continued without finding\" (\"CWOF\")\n\ndisposition of two state-law drug charges.             Inclusion of the CWOF\n\ndisposition raised Reyes's criminal history score from I to II and\n\nconcomitantly rendered him ineligible for application of the safety\n\nvalve provision in U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(1).\n\n           Before   the     district      court,     Reyes     maintained     that\n\ninclusion of the CWOF disposition would be improper because, in the\n\nMassachusetts proceeding, he neither admitted to sufficient facts\n\nto make the disposition the equivalent of a guilty plea nor was he\n\nprovided with an interpreter.             Reyes argued that, accordingly,\n\nthere was no actual finding or admission of guilt -- a prerequisite\n\nto the inclusion of the disposition in the federal criminal history\n\ncalculation. See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(f). The district court rejected\n\nthese   arguments   and     applied    circuit      precedent     holding     that\n\nMassachusetts CWOF dispositions are to be included in criminal\n\nhistory calculations under the federal sentencing guidelines.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Dubovsky, 279 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Morillo, 178 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1999).              The court also\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\frebuffed   Reyes's   attempt   to    attack   the     legitimacy   of     the\n\nMassachusetts proceeding on grounds other than absence of counsel.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Wall, 349 F.3d 18, 27 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(barring   collateral   challenges    to   prior    state   convictions    in\n\nfederal sentencing proceedings for any reason other than lack of\n\ncounsel, and thus applying in the guidelines context the rule of\n\nCustis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485 (1994)), cert. denied, 124 S.\n\nCt. 1727 (2004); United States v. Delgado, 288 F.3d 49, 52 n.4 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (similar); Brackett v. United States, 270 F.3d 60, 65\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (similar).1\n\n           On appeal, Reyes argues that the district court erred in\n\nreading Dubovsky and Morillo as precluding an argument that he\n\nneither admitted guilt nor legitimately was found guilty in the\n\n1994 Massachusetts proceeding.2       In pressing this argument, Reyes\n\n\n\n     1\n      Reyes admits that he was counseled in the Massachusetts\nproceeding.\n     2\n      Reyes also raises the following two arguments not raised\nbefore the district court: (1) the CWOF disposition should not be\ncounted because the underlying charge was ultimately dismissed; and\n(2) the CWOF disposition should not be counted because the\nproceeding that was continued without a finding did not comply with\nMassachusetts procedural requirements.      Neither argument comes\nclose to establishing plain error within the meaning of Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 52(b). As to Reyes's first argument, we have held that an\neventual dismissal is a normal outcome in a CWOF case and in no way\nresults in an expungement which would preclude the disposition from\nbeing counted. See Dubovsky, 279 F.3d at 8-9; Morillo, 178 F.3d at\n20.    And as to Reyes's second argument, we have held that\nprocedural irregularities in the state court proceeding cannot be\nchallenged during the federal sentencing. See Delgado, 288 F.3d at\n52 n.4.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fpoints out that Dubovsky and Morillo (as well as two earlier cases\n\nin which we considered whether a Massachusetts CWOF disposition\n\nshould be included in a guidelines criminal history calculation,\n\nUnited States v. Nicholas, 133 F.3d 133 (1st Cir. 1998) and United\n\nStates v. Roberts, 39 F.3d 10 (1st Cir. 1994)) did not mention\n\nCustis   and    explicitly      analyzed        the   procedures       used   by    the\n\nMassachusetts courts during the proceedings that were continued\n\nwithout a finding.      See Dubovsky, 279 F.3d at 5; Morillo, 178 F.3d\n\nat 18; Nicholas, 133 F.3d at 134-37; Roberts, 39 F.3d at 13-14.\n\nReyes sees within the methodology of Dubovsky, Morillo, Nicholas,\n\nand Roberts an implicit recognition that the rule applied in Wall,\n\nDelgado, and Brackett does not bar an individualized assessment\n\nwhether the defendant admitted guilt or was found guilty in the\n\nproceeding in which his prior CWOF judgment was rendered.                            We\n\nreject Reyes's argument.\n\n              We are as bound by the holdings of Dubovsky and Morillo\n\nas was the district court.            See Charlesbank Equity Fund II v.\n\nBlinds   to    Go,   Inc.,    370   F.3d    151,      160   n.4   (1st   Cir.      2004)\n\n(observing that, in a multipanel circuit, a new panel is bound by\n\nprior panel decisions directly on point absent intervening and\n\nbinding authority which undermines or calls into question the prior\n\npanel's judgment).           Accordingly, we are obliged to uphold the\n\ncourt's inclusion of the CWOF disposition in Reyes's criminal\n\nhistory calculation.           In   any    event,     we    see   no   inconsistency\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fbetween, on the one hand, Dubovsky, Morillo, and the earlier cases\n\nanalyzing how Massachusetts CWOF dispositions should be treated for\n\npurposes of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(f), and, on the other, Wall, Delgado,\n\nBrackett, and similar cases.     In the Dubovsky line of cases, we\n\nmerely analyzed whether the proceedings with Massachusetts CWOF\n\nfindings are by their nature proceedings in which the federal\n\ndefendant can be said to have been found guilty or to have admitted\n\nguilt.    Repeated    analyses   were   made   necessary   because   the\n\nMassachusetts legislature has more than once amended the relevant\n\nprocedural framework.    See Roberts, 39 F.3d at 11.       But we in no\n\nway suggested that the rule articulated in Wall would not apply\n\nonce we had determined that Massachusetts CWOF dispositions are to\n\nbe counted under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(f).     Reyes has not presented us\n\nwith any basis for disregarding the Wall rule in this context, and\n\nwe can see no reason for doing so.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",

Nicholas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750076\"><a href=\"/opinion/750076/united-states-v-christian-modest-nicholas/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998) and <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195701\"><a href=\"/opinion/195701/united-states-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994)) did not mention <i>Custis</i> and explicitly analyzed the procedures used by the Massachusetts courts during the proceedings that were continued without a finding. <i>See Dubovsky,</i> 279 F.3d at 5; <i>Morillo,</i> 178 F.3d at 18; <i>Nicholas,</i> 133 F.3d at 134-37; <i>Roberts,</i> 39 F.3d at 13-14. Reyes sees within the methodology of <i>Dubovsky, Morillo, Nicholas,</i> and <i>Roberts</i> an implicit recognition that the rule applied in <i>Wall, Delgado,</i> and <i>Brackett</i> does not bar an individualized assessment whether the defendant admitted guilt or was found guilty in the proceeding in which his prior CWOF judgment was rendered. We reject Reyes's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are as bound by the holdings of <i>Dubovsky</i> and <i>Morillo</i> as was the district court. <i>See Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds to Go, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201049\"><a href=\"/opinion/201049/charlesbank-v-blinds-to-go-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 160 n. 4 (1st Cir.2004) (observing that, in a multipanel circuit, a new panel is bound by prior panel decisions directly on point absent intervening and binding authority which undermines or calls into question the prior panel's judgment). Accordingly, we are obliged to uphold the court's inclusion of the CWOF disposition in Reyes's criminal history calculation. In any event, we see no inconsistency between, on the one hand, <i>Dubovsky, Morillo,</i> and the earlier cases analyzing how Massachusetts CWOF dispositions should be treated for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(f), and, on the other, <i>Wall, Delgado, Brackett,</i> and similar cases. In the <i>Dubovsky</i> line of cases, we merely analyzed whether the proceedings with Massachusetts CWOF findings are by their nature proceedings in which the federal defendant can be said to have been found guilty or to have admitted guilt. Repeated analyses were made necessary because the Massachusetts legislature has more than once amended the relevant procedural framework. <i>See Roberts,</i> 39 F.3d at 11. But we in no way suggested that the rule articulated in <i>Wall</i> would not apply once we had determined that Massachusetts CWOF dispositions are to be counted under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(f). Reyes has not presented us with any basis for disregarding the <i>Wall</i> rule in this context, and we can see no reason for doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Reyes admits that he was counseled in the Massachusetts proceeding</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Reyes also raises the following two arguments not raised before the district court: (1) the CWOF disposition should not be counted because the underlying charge was ultimately dismissed; and (2) the CWOF disposition should not be counted because the proceeding that was continued without a finding did not comply with Massachusetts procedural requirements. Neither argument comes close to establishing plain error within the meaning of Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). As to Reyes's first argument, we have held that an eventual dismissal is a normal outcome in a CWOF case and in no way results in an expungement which would preclude the disposition from being counted<i>See Dubovsky,</i> 279 F.3d at 8-9; <i>Morillo,</i> 178 F.3d at 20. And as to Reyes's second argument, we have held that procedural irregularities in the state court proceeding cannot be challenged during the federal sentencing. <i>See Delgado,</i> 288 F.3d at 52 n. 4.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
