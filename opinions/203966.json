Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                  Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                    and DiClerico, District Judge.*\n\n\n     Hector L. Ramos-Vega, Assistant Federal Public Defender, with\nwhom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                             July 31, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. José Padilla-Colón (\"Padilla\") was\n\ncharged with one count of possession with intent to distribute 7.1\n\ngrams of cocaine base, or \"crack,\" in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(iii).        Pursuant to a plea agreement, Padilla\n\npled guilty and waived his right to appeal.                 At sentencing the\n\ndistrict court determined that Padilla did not qualify for the\n\n\"safety valve\" provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), and thus was subject\n\nto a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.             On appeal, Padilla\n\nargues that the district court erred in finding that he did not\n\nmeet the requirements of the safety valve, and that, despite the\n\nwaiver, the plea agreement does not bar his appeal.              Applying the\n\ntest established in United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 24-26\n\n(1st Cir. 2001), we find that the waiver of appeal is invalid.\n\nHowever, because the district court did not err in denying Padilla\n\nthe benefit of the safety valve, we affirm the sentence.\n\n                                        I\n\n             Where an appeal follows a guilty plea, we draw the facts\n\nfrom   the    plea   colloquy,    the       unchallenged    portions    of   the\n\npresentence    investigation      report,     and   the    transcript   of   the\n\nsentencing hearing.     United States v. Mercedes Mercedes, 428 F.3d\n\n355, 357 (1st Cir. 2005).        In this case we also rely on the signed\n\nstatement of facts accompanying the appellant's plea agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fSee United States v. Laguna-Estela, 394 F.3d 54, 55 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n                After receiving a telephone call from a source claiming\n\nthat Padilla was armed and stored weapons for another individual,\n\nPuerto Rico police surveilled his property on January 20 and 24,\n\n2006.        On both occasions, they observed Padilla carrying a weapon\n\nin his waistband.1       On the second occasion, they saw him holding a\n\nbag from which the barrel of a rifle was protruding.           He was also\n\nobserved getting into and out of his car, a white Suzuki Vitara.\n\nOn February 3, police executed a search warrant for Padilla's home\n\nand car.        While searching the vehicle, officers discovered a gym\n\nbag containing 160 vials of crack and 121 rounds of .40 caliber\n\nammunition.\n\n                On May 24, 2006, a federal grand jury returned a two-\n\ncount indictment against Padilla, charging him with possession with\n\nintent        to   distribute   several    controlled   substances.     At\n\narraignment, Padilla pled not guilty and then moved to suppress the\n\nevidence recovered in the search of his car.            After the district\n\ncourt denied the motion, Padilla and the government executed a plea\n\nagreement on November 30. Under its terms, the government promised\n\nto move to dismiss the indictment. Padilla would then plead guilty\n\nto an information charging him with one count of possession with\n\n\n\n        1\n            The visual display of a firearm is a crime under Puerto Rico\nlaw.        See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, § 456a(d)(1).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fintent to distribute 7.1 grams of crack.             Padilla also agreed not\n\nto appeal his sentence, as long as the district court \"accept[ed]\n\n[the plea] agreement and sentence[d] him according to its terms and\n\nconditions.\"\n\n            Based on the quantity and kind of drugs recovered, the\n\nplea agreement calculated Padilla's base offense level under the\n\nSentencing     Guidelines   as    26,    but     identified    reductions    for\n\nacceptance of responsibility and compliance with the safety valve,\n\nresulting in an adjusted base offense level of 21.                 The agreement\n\nthen stated,\n\n            A total base offense level of 21 and a\n            Criminal History Category I results in a\n            guideline sentencing range of 37-46 months.\n            In the event the defendant fails to comply\n            with all of the provisions of the safety\n            valve, the adjusted base offense level remains\n            at 23 which has a corresponding imprisonment\n            range of 46-57 months.     As the parties are\n            aware, however, for possession of five (5)\n            grams or more of cocaine base the statutory\n            penalty   is   not   less   than  five   years\n            imprisonment.\n\nShortly   thereafter,   the      agreement      specified    the   safety   valve\n\nrequirements and noted, \"Should defendant meet all the requirements\n\nof the 'safety valve' provisions . . . , defendant's Base Offense\n\nLevel shall be reduced by two (2) levels.\"\n\n            A change-of-plea hearing was held on November 30. At the\n\nhearing, the magistrate judge inquired into Padilla's understanding\n\nof the sentencing recommendation.             At the magistrate's request, an\n\nAssistant    United   States      Attorney       explained     the    sentencing\n\n                                        -4-\n\fguidelines calculation and the maximum penalties possible for the\n\noffense, including the mandatory minimum sentence of five years.\n\nHe discussed the safety valve reduction, explaining,\n\n           should [Padilla] comply with all of the\n           provisions of the safety valve, he is also\n           looking at an additional two (2) point\n           reduction . . . . The Defendant understands\n           that should he fail to meet safety valve, then\n           of course he is looking at a base offense\n           level of 23 . . . .             All of that\n           notwithstanding Judge, there is a five (5)\n           years [sic] mandatory minimum . . . .\n\nThe   magistrate   judge   confirmed    that   Padilla    understood    the\n\nexplanation, asking,\n\n           Do you understand that in order to be entitled\n           to the two (2) level reduction under the safet\n           [sic] valve, you shall comply with five (5)\n           requirements, as stated in paragraph nine (9)\n           of your plea agreement, [including the\n           requirement that you] must have provided\n           truthful information to the Government prior\n           to sentencing?\n\nPadilla answered affirmatively.\n\n           The     magistrate   judge     inquired       into      Padilla's\n\nunderstanding of his waiver of appellate rights. After identifying\n\nthe waiver and reading its terms to Padilla, she asked, \"Are you\n\naware that depending on the facts the court finds and the sentence\n\nit eventually imposes, both you and the Government may appeal the\n\nsentence in this case subject to that waver [sic]?\"             Padilla said\n\nhe was so aware, and then entered his guilty plea.         The magistrate\n\njudge found that Padilla knew the terms of the plea agreement and\n\nhad entered it \"in an intelligent and voluntary manner.\"            See Fed.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fR. Crim. P. 11(b).        She filed her Report and Recommendation on\n\nDecember 11, 2006, recommending that the district court accept\n\nPadilla's guilty plea. On December 21, the district court accepted\n\nthe plea.\n\n            In April 2007, two DEA agents and an Assistant United\n\nStates Attorney interviewed Padilla as part of the safety valve\n\nprocess. During the interview, Padilla told the agents that he did\n\nnot own the gym bag seized from his car in the February 3, 2006\n\nsearch.   He had stolen it the night before, he said, from the trunk\n\nof an abandoned car, where it had been stored by local drug dealers\n\nwho owed him money.       Padilla had previously observed the dealers\n\nplace drugs and money in a bag and hide the bag in the car trunk.\n\nBelieving that the bag would contain money, he retrieved it from\n\nthe   trunk;   instead,   it    contained   only   drugs   and   ammunition.\n\nPadilla did not know what to do with the contraband, and the next\n\nmorning it was seized by police.       Before the interview ended, the\n\nAssistant United States Attorney expressed some skepticism to\n\nPadilla about his story.\n\n            In a sealed motion filed with the district court soon\n\nafter, the government indicated that it found Padilla's testimony\n\n\"not totally truthful.\"        Several of Padilla's claims, prosecutors\n\nsaid, lacked credibility: that he stole the gym bag from drug\n\ndealers, that he had never possessed it before being arrested by\n\nPuerto Rico police, and that he had never sold drugs or possessed\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fa weapon.    The claims conflicted with the sworn affidavit of a\n\nPuerto Rico police officer, Agent Héctor Figueroa-Velázquez (\"Agent\n\nFigueroa\"), who had surveilled Padilla in January 2006.     Because\n\nPadilla had not been totally truthful, the government said, he did\n\nnot qualify for the safety valve reduction.       In his response,\n\nPadilla emphasized that he had provided extensive detail to the\n\ngovernment agents about how he knew where the bag was, what it\n\nmight contain, and who owned it.   He pointed out that his story was\n\nconsistent with other facts in the record and was corroborated in\n\npart by the DEA agents present at the safety valve interview.    In\n\ncontrast, Padilla claimed, the government had produced no evidence\n\nproving that he had been untruthful.   Prosecutors simply found his\n\nstory hard to believe.\n\n            On June 22, 2007, the district court issued a sealed\n\norder finding Padilla ineligible for safety valve benefits.     The\n\ncourt observed that Padilla had \"had trouble with his version [of\n\nthe facts] since his interview with the U.S. Probation Officer,\"\n\none month before the safety valve debriefing.   Padilla had changed\n\nseveral parts of his story in response to questions raised by the\n\nProbation Officer.   Padilla repeated the changed story to the DEA\n\nagents and the Assistant United States Attorney during his safety\n\nvalve interview.     Moreover, the story contradicted the sworn\n\naffidavit of Agent Figueroa.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f           At his sentencing hearing on August 2, 2007, Padilla\n\nmoved the district court to reconsider its order denying him the\n\nbenefit of the safety valve.      In response to the court's concern\n\nthat Padilla's story contradicted the sworn testimony of a police\n\nofficer, Padilla emphasized that he had long maintained that Agent\n\nFigueroa lied in the affidavit, having moved on those grounds to\n\nsuppress   the   evidence   obtained    from   the   search   of   his   car.\n\nMoreover, Padilla insisted that he had only clarified his story in\n\nresponse to doubts from the Probation Officer, not changed it.             As\n\nearly as February 3, 2006, after he was arrested, and May 12, 2006,\n\nin his preliminary hearing, Padilla had stated that he stole the\n\nbag containing the drugs -- the same testimony he provided in the\n\nsafety valve interview.     Finding nothing new in Padilla's request,\n\nthe court denied the motion.\n\n           Before sentencing Padilla, the court returned to his\n\nwaiver of appeal.    It noted,\n\n           Mr. Padilla, although you pled guilty and\n           pursuant to the terms of your plea agreement\n           you waived your right to appeal the judgment\n           and the sentence imposed in this case, the\n           Court advises you that you can appeal your\n           conviction if you believe that your plea of\n           guilty was unlawful or involuntary, or if\n           there is some other fundamental defect in the\n           proceedings that was not waived by your plea\n           agreement.\n\nThe court then sentenced Padilla to the statutory mandatory minimum\n\nof five years' imprisonment.     See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii).\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f                                 II\n\n            Padilla appeals his sentence.   Recognizing the potential\n\nobstacle posed by the waiver of appeal in his plea agreement, he\n\nasks that we not honor it because his claim falls outside its scope\n\nand the waiver is invalid. As a substantive matter, he argues that\n\nthe district court erred in denying him the benefits of the safety\n\nvalve.   The government contests both claims.      Because Padilla's\n\nright to seek relief from his sentence in this court turns on the\n\nvalidity of the waiver of appeal, we determine the waiver's effect\n\nbefore considering the substantive claim.       See United States v.\n\nEdelen, 539 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nA. Waiver of Appeal\n\n            We enforce a waiver of appeal if it is valid and the\n\ndefendant's claim lies within its scope.       See United States v.\n\nAcosta-Roman, 549 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v.\n\nMcCoy, 508 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Even a knowing and\n\nvoluntary appeal waiver only precludes appeals that fall within its\n\nscope.\").     In this case, because we find that the waiver is\n\ninvalid, we need not reach the question of whether the defendant's\n\nappeal falls within its scope.\n\n            A waiver of appellate rights is valid if the defendant\n\nentered into it knowingly and voluntarily.     United States v. Gil-\n\nQuezada, 445 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 2006).     We determine whether a\n\nwaiver was knowing and voluntary by applying the three-prong test\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fannounced in Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24.            Under this test, an appellate\n\nwaiver is valid as long as: (1) the written plea agreement contains\n\na clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope;\n\n(2) at the plea hearing the district court inquired specifically\n\nabout any waiver of appellate rights, and its interrogation of the\n\ndefendant sufficed to ensure that the waiver was knowing and\n\nvoluntary; and (3) the denial of the right to appeal would not\n\nconstitute a miscarriage of justice.             See Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24-\n\n25.\n\n             The written plea agreement satisfies the first prong of\n\nthe Teeter test.         The language of the waiver itself elucidates the\n\nright being waived by the defendant, namely, the \"right to appeal\n\nthe judgment and sentence.\"           The scope of the waiver is limited to\n\n\"this   case\"      and    to   any   sentence    consistent    with   the   plea\n\nagreement's terms and conditions. We have previously held that the\n\nsame language satisfied the first Teeter prong.               Gil-Quezada, 445\n\nF.3d at 36; United States v. De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d 5, 10 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).       Padilla does not contend otherwise.\n\n             The second prong of Teeter requires us to examine the\n\ntranscript of the colloquy between the court and the defendant at\n\nthe change-of-plea hearing.           Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24.     Our focus in\n\ndoing   so   is    \"to    ascertain    whether   the   court's   interrogation\n\nsuffices to ensure that the defendant freely and intelligently\n\nagreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming sentence.\"\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fId.; see also De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d at 10.                         As Federal Rule\n\nof Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(N) requires, the colloquy must\n\ninclude a specific inquiry \"into any waiver of appellate rights.\"\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 24.            In explaining the extent of the waiver and\n\nwhat   right    of       appeal    remains,    if       any,   the     court    \"should    be\n\nespecially careful in its choice of words, taking pains to explain\n\nto the defendant that her right to appeal is circumscribed by her\n\npreexisting waiver.\"              Teeter, 257 F.3d at 25.               Context is also\n\nimportant      in    determining      whether       a    statement      is     sufficiently\n\nmisleading to nullify a waiver.                See United States v. Soto-Cruz,\n\n449 F.3d 258, 261 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"The context in which such a\n\nstatement is made is important to our determination . . . .\"); De-\n\nLa-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d at 11-12 (\"Context is important . . . .\");\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 24-25.\n\n             Padilla argues that statements by the court during his\n\nchange-of-plea and sentencing hearings were so misleading that they\n\nabrogated his waiver of appeal. During the change-of-plea hearing,\n\nthe magistrate judge asked Padilla whether he understood that\n\n\"depending on the facts the court finds and the sentence it\n\neventually imposes, both you and the government may appeal the\n\nsentence in this case subject to that waver [sic]?\" Padilla points\n\nout that the court posed this question shortly after explaining\n\nthat   the     guidelines         sentencing     range         would     depend    on     his\n\nsatisfaction        of    the     safety-valve      requirements,         including       the\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\finterview. In this context, he says, his affirmative answer to the\n\njudge's question meant that he understood that he would retain the\n\nright to appeal if the district court found that he was ineligible\n\nfor the safety valve.       Padilla suggests that his misunderstanding\n\nwas subsequently \"compounded\" by the district court at sentencing,\n\nwhen it stated that Padilla could appeal if he believed his guilty\n\nplea \"was unlawful or involuntary,\" or there was \"some other\n\nfundamental defect in the proceedings that was not waived by [the]\n\nplea agreement.\"\n\n           We agree that, taken in context, the court's statement at\n\nthe change-of-plea hearing was so misleading that it nullified\n\nPadilla's waiver of appeal. The court's choice of language -- that\n\nPadilla could appeal \"depending on the facts this court finds\" --\n\nreasonably suggested to Padilla that he retained a right to appeal\n\nadverse factual findings.      The context of the statement reinforced\n\nthis view.     Because the statement closely followed the court's\n\nexplanation of the safety-valve, the phrase \"the facts this court\n\nfinds\" could reasonably have been understood by Padilla to refer to\n\nsafety-valve eligibility, and, in particular, to a finding that he\n\nhad failed to provide truthful information to the government.              In\n\nsuch a context, the magistrate judge's statement that Padilla could\n\nappeal \"depending on the facts this court finds\" suggested that he\n\nretained   a   right   to   appeal   an     adverse   determination   of   his\n\neligibility for safety-valve relief.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f                This suggestion by the court, rather than illuminating\n\nthe meaning of the written waiver of appeal, contradicted its\n\nterms, which are not similarly limited in language or effect.                  By\n\nits terms, Padilla's waiver covers appeals of his judgment and\n\nsentence, and applies as long as the district court sentences him\n\naccording to the terms and conditions of the plea agreement.                  The\n\nterms of the plea agreement do not guarantee Padilla that he will\n\nbe found eligible for safety-valve relief.                Thus, Padilla waived\n\nhis right to appeal his sentence regardless of whether the court\n\nfound him eligible for the safety valve.                 See Acosta-Roman, 549\n\nF.3d       at   4   (discussing   the   terms   of   a   similar   waiver).    By\n\nsuggesting that Padilla retained appellate rights in the event of\n\nan adverse finding of safety-valve eligibility, the plea colloquy\n\nwas so misleading that we cannot regard Padilla's waiver as knowing\n\nand voluntary.2\n\n                We therefore decline to enforce Padilla's waiver of\n\nappeal.         Because there is no need to reach the third prong of\n\nTeeter, we now turn to the substantive claim on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       Because we conclude that the statement made at the change-\nof-plea hearing \"mudd[ied] the waters,\" see Teeter, 257 F.3d at 25,\nwe need not reach the issue of the court's statement at sentencing.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fB. Safety Valve Eligibility\n\n           1. General principles\n\n           The standard of review applicable in safety-valve appeals\n\n\"varies according to the foundation upon which [the safety-valve]\n\ndetermination is based.\"      United States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).    We review de novo safety-valve determinations to\n\nthe extent they rest on conclusions of law.         Id.    We review for\n\nclear error safety-valve determinations to the extent they depend\n\non findings of fact.    Id.   The clear error standard is \"extremely\n\ndeferential.\"    United States v. Bermúdez, 407 F.3d 536, 542 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (citing United States v. Marquez, 280 F.3d 19, 26 (1st\n\nCir. 2002)).     Under it, \"an appellate court ought not to disturb\n\neither findings of fact or conclusions drawn from the record unless\n\nthe whole of the record compels a strong, unyielding belief that a\n\nmistake has been made.\"        Bermúdez, 407 F.3d at 542 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).           Evaluation of witness\n\ntestimony is reviewed for clear error, since it involves \"fact-\n\nsensitive judgments and credibility calls.\" Matos, 328 F.3d at 40.\n\n           The   \"safety   valve\"    provision   exempts   certain   drug\n\noffenders from mandatory minimum sentences.           See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(f); U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2.       Congress's purpose in enacting the\n\nprovision was to \"mitigate the harsh effect of mandatory minimum\n\nsentences\" on first-time, low-level offenders in drug trafficking\n\nschemes.   United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 150 (1st\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fCir. 2000).3       To qualify for relief under the safety valve, a\n\ndefendant must meet five requirements. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)-\n\n(5).       Only the last requirement is at issue here.4     Under it, the\n\ndefendant      must   \"truthfully   provide[]   to   the   Government   all\n\ninformation and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense\n\nor offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a\n\ncommon scheme or plan.\"       See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(5).     \"'[N]othing\n\nshort of truthful and complete disclosure will suffice.'\"          United\n\n\n       3\n       According to a House Report on the matter, while sentence\nreductions for mitigating factors were available to the most\nculpable, they did not operate to the benefit of the least\nculpable, whose guideline sentences already fell below the\napplicable mandatory minimums. See H.R. Rep. No. 103-460 (1994),\ncited in United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 527 n.22\n(1st Cir. 1996). In response, the House sought to exempt a \"narrow\nclass\" of drug defendants -- those least culpable -- from the\nmandatory-minimum sentencing scheme. Id.\n       4\n           The first four requirements are:\n\n       (1) the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal\n       history point, as determined under the sentencing\n       guidelines;\n       (2) the defendant did not use violence or credible\n       threats of violence or possess a firearm or other\n       dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so)\n       in connection with the offense;\n       (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily\n       injury to any person;\n       (4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager,\n       or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined\n       under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a\n       continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in section 408\n       of the Controlled Substances Act . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)-(4).\n     The appellant asserts in his brief that the government does\nnot contest his satisfaction of the first four safety-valve\nrequirements. The government appears to agree.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fStates v. Rodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting\n\nMatos, 328 F.3d at 38).         The defendant bears the burden of proving,\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence, that he has satisfied this\n\nrequirement. See Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 529 n.25 (discussing\n\nall five requirements under § 3553(f)).                       We now turn to the\n\nspecific claims of error, both of law and fact, raised by Padilla.\n\n             2. Legal claims\n\n                      a. Burden of proof\n\n             Padilla argues that the defendant's burden of proof \"does\n\nnot arise until the government has made some preliminary showing,\n\nbased   on   something       more    than    opinion     or   disbelief,   that   the\n\n[safety-valve] proffer is incomplete or untruthful.\" Here, Padilla\n\nsays, the government simply asserted to the district court that it\n\nfound Padilla's story implausible. Taken alone, he argues, such an\n\nassertion is insufficient to support a finding that Padilla was\n\nuntruthful.\n\n             There is no support in our law for the proposition that\n\nthe   government      must    make    a     \"preliminary      showing\"   before   the\n\ndefendant's burden of proof arises.                    The cases cited by the\n\ndefendant establish only that \"when the record, taken as a whole,\n\nwill not support a finding that the defendant has failed to provide\n\na   truthful    and    complete       proffer,     the     government's    lack   of\n\nconfidence in the proffer is insufficient, in and of itself, to\n\njustify a denial of access to the safety valve.\"                 Marquez, 280 F.3d\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fat 24; see United States v. White, 119 F.3d 70, 73-74 (1st Cir.\n\n1997); Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 529.            Where the record does\n\nprovide some support, \"a sentencing court may reject a safety valve\n\nproffer   based   on   its   reasoned    assessment   of    the    defendant's\n\ncredibility in light of the facts.\"               Marquez, 280 F.3d at 24\n\n(citing White, 119 F.3d at 74).      It need not base its determination\n\non \"independent rebuttal evidence\" introduced by the government.\n\nId.\n\n           Within this framework, a defendant's insistence that he\n\nhas provided truthful and complete information does not necessarily\n\novercome an unfriendly record.          See id. at 24-25 (observing that\n\notherwise, \"district courts would be bound to accept even the most\n\narrant nonsense from a defendant's mouth so long as the government\n\ncould not directly contradict it by independent proof,\" in effect\n\n\"turn[ing] the burden of persuasion inside out\").                 Rather, when\n\nfaced with a defendant who insists that he proffered truthful\n\ninformation,   the     sentencing   court   may    make    its    own   reasoned\n\ndetermination, in light of the facts on record, whether to credit\n\nthe defendant's assertion. See United States v. Bravo, 489 F.3d 1,\n\n12 (1st Cir. 2007) (upholding rejection of admittedly \"consistent\"\n\nstory in light of agent's testimony that it was \"illogical\");\n\nRodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d at 25 (upholding denial of safety valve\n\nwhere district court did not credit defendant, who \"simply den[ied]\n\nthe charges against him,\" in light of his contradiction by record\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fevidence); Marquez, 280 F.3d at 24-25.           In the present case, the\n\nsentencing court followed precisely this method, identifying in its\n\norder specific facts on the record, see supra section I, in light\n\nof which the court refused to credit Padilla's assertion that he\n\nprovided truthful information.\n\n                   b. Proper basis for safety-valve determination\n\n           Padilla argues that the sentencing court erred in basing\n\nits   determination     on   information    other   than   the   safety-valve\n\nproffer itself, namely, an earlier interview conducted by the case\n\nProbation Officer.      That interview, he says, was conducted \"only\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility purposes.\"            As such, it was \"more\n\nlimited\"   than   the    safety-valve      interview    and   should   not   be\n\nconsidered.\n\n           Once again Padilla fails to adduce any legal authorities\n\nin support of his position.       In fact, sentencing courts assessing\n\neligibility for the safety valve routinely rely on a variety of\n\nrecord materials in determining whether a defendant has provided\n\ntruthful and complete information.          See Bermúdez, 407 F.3d at 542\n\n(upholding determination based on comparison between safety-valve\n\nproffer and testimony at trial of co-defendant); Marquez, 280 F.3d\n\nat 24 (noting \"internal inconsistencies between the proffer and\n\nother statements that the [defendant] himself had made\"); Matos,\n\n328 F.3d at 40 (upholding district court's determination in light\n\nof \"other evidence that can be gleaned from the record\").              There is\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fno sensible reason to limit the assessment of truthfulness to the\n\nsafety-valve proffer itself.         Inconsistencies between statements\n\nmade during the proffer and statements made to the authorities on\n\nother occasions are not necessarily disqualifying.            But the court\n\nmay legitimately consider such inconsistencies in deciding on the\n\ntruthfulness of the proffer.\n\n             3. Factual claims\n\n             Padilla argues that the district court committed clear\n\nerror   in   finding   that   his   safety-valve   proffer    had    not   been\n\ntruthful.     He makes several discrete challenges.\n\n                      a. The change in Padilla's story\n\n             Padilla argues that the district court clearly erred in\n\nconcluding that he had changed his account of the offense.                  We\n\ndisagree.      Even    assuming,    arguendo,   that   the   two    interviews\n\ndiffered in purpose, as Padilla argues, that difference cannot\n\naccount for the material alterations Padilla made to his story on\n\nretelling.     According to Padilla's initial account, he stole the\n\nbag containing the contraband when he was \"visiting a friend [and]\n\nobserved a man hiding a gym bag in the trunk of a vehicle.\"                 He\n\nstole it \"thinking that maybe it was full of cash.\"                 After the\n\nProbation Officer expressed concern that Padilla had not provided\n\nher with \"complete, accurate and truthful information,\" Padilla\n\ntold a different story.       He stated that he knew the owners of the\n\nbag, that they owed him $5,000, and that they had failed to pay him\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fback.   During his safety-valve interview, he also stated that he\n\nhad previously purchased drugs from the owners of the bag and that\n\nhe expected the bag to contain drugs when he stole it.   Even if the\n\nrough outlines of the two stories are consistent, the details and\n\ntheir implications differ markedly, and it cannot be clear error\n\nfor a sentencing court to take note of such differences and find in\n\nthose differences a lack of truthfulness.\n\n                 b. Agent Figueroa's affidavit\n\n          Padilla argues that the sentencing court committed clear\n\nerror by crediting Agent Figueroa's affidavit. Again, we disagree.\n\nTo be sure, Padilla has long insisted that Agent Figueroa falsified\n\nhis affidavit.   On the basis of this allegation and the required\n\npreliminary showing, Padilla obtained a hearing under Franks v.\n\nDelaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), to determine the validity of the\n\nFebruary 3, 2006 search warrant, which was based on the affidavit.\n\nIn her Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge who presided\n\nover the Franks hearing identified several reasons to question the\n\nveracity of Agent Figueroa's affidavit.   Yet the magistrate judge\n\nalso credited Agent Figueroa's testimony during the hearing, noting\n\nthat he was \"forthright in demeanor\" and that \"some evidence . . .\n\ncorroborated Figueroa's version of events.\"   She ultimately upheld\n\nthe validity of the search warrant, and submitted Proposed Findings\n\nof Fact based on Agent's Figueroa's testimony.    In light of this\n\noutcome and the substance of the magistrate judge's report, we\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fcannot conclude that the district court committed clear error in\n\ngiving the affidavit the weight that it did.              See Matos, 328 F.3d\n\nat 40-41 (\"[W]hen more than one sensible interpretation . . . can\n\nsupportably be drawn, a sentencing court's decision to credit one\n\nalternative     and     reject     another   cannot    be    deemed      clearly\n\nerroneous.\").     Taking the measure of a sworn statement in view of\n\nits attempted impeachment is typical fact-finding, and the record\n\nsimply does not compel a \"strong, unyielding belief that a mistake\n\nhas been made.\"       See Bermúdez, 407 F.3d at 542 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n                      c. The bag\n\n          Lastly,       Padilla     argues   that   the     sentencing     court\n\ncommitted clear error by determining that the bag seized from his\n\ncar during the February 3, 2006 search was the same bag Agent\n\nFigueroa observed Padilla using to carry a rifle on January 24,\n\n2006.   It is true that the bag described in Agent Figueroa's\n\naffidavit was \"blue and grey,\" while the bag discovered in the\n\nsearch of Padilla's automobile is described as being simply blue.\n\nHowever, the colors and features of the bags are not so dissimilar\n\nthat it amounts to clear error to conclude that they were the same.\n\nThe court might have discounted Agent Figueroa's testimony that the\n\nbag observed on January 24 was blue and grey, and not entirely\n\nblue, on the basis of his line of sight -- a matter thoroughly\n\ndiscussed during the Franks hearing.                Agent Figueroa himself\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\ftestified that the bags were similar, although he was unsure\n\nwhether they were the same.        In light of the descriptions of the\n\nbags, the court's determination that they were the same was not\n\nclear error.\n\n                    d. Summary\n\n           As the record reveals, the story Padilla told at his\n\nsafety-valve debriefing differed in material respects from Agent\n\nFigueroa's affidavit.      Padilla denied ever possessing a weapon,\n\nwhile Agent Figueroa stated that he observed Padilla with three\n\nweapons.    Moreover, Padilla altered his own account of how he\n\nacquired the bag of drugs and ammunition seized from his car during\n\nthe February 3, 2006 search.         There were no clear errors in the\n\ndistrict court's specific factual findings, as set forth in its\n\norder   rejecting   Padilla's      eligibility   for   the   safety    valve.\n\nDistrict   courts   may   reject    safety-valve   proffers    based    on   a\n\n\"reasoned assessment of the defendant's credibility in light of the\n\nfacts\" on record.      Marquez, 280 F.3d at 24.        Such was the case\n\nhere.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f",

On both occasions, they observed Padilla carrying a weapon\n\nin his waistband.1       On the second occasion, they saw him holding a\n\nbag from which the barrel of a rifle was protruding.           He was also\n\nobserved getting into and out of his car, a white Suzuki Vitara.\n\nOn February 3, police executed a search warrant for Padilla's home\n\nand car.        While searching the vehicle, officers discovered a gym\n\nbag containing 160 vials of crack and 121 rounds of .40 caliber\n\nammunition.\n\n                On May 24, 2006, a federal grand jury returned a two-\n\ncount indictment against Padilla, charging him with possession with\n\nintent        to   distribute   several    controlled   substances.     At\n\narraignment, Padilla pled not guilty and then moved to suppress the\n\nevidence recovered in the search of his car.            After the district\n\ncourt denied the motion, Padilla and the government executed a plea\n\nagreement on November 30. Under its terms, the government promised\n\nto move to dismiss the indictment. Padilla would then plead guilty\n\nto an information charging him with one count of possession with\n\n\n\n        1\n            The visual display of a firearm is a crime under Puerto Rico\nlaw.

Padilla also agreed not\n\nto appeal his sentence, as long as the district court \"accept[ed]\n\n[the plea] agreement and sentence[d] him according to its terms and\n\nconditions.\"\n\n            Based on the quantity and kind of drugs recovered, the\n\nplea agreement calculated Padilla's base offense level under the\n\nSentencing     Guidelines   as    26,    but     identified    reductions    for\n\nacceptance of responsibility and compliance with the safety valve,\n\nresulting in an adjusted base offense level of 21.                 The agreement\n\nthen stated,\n\n            A total base offense level of 21 and a\n            Criminal History Category I results in a\n            guideline sentencing range of 37-46 months.\n            In the event the defendant fails to comply\n            with all of the provisions of the safety\n            valve, the adjusted base offense level remains\n            at 23 which has a corresponding imprisonment\n            range of 46-57 months.     As the parties are\n            aware, however, for possession of five (5)\n            grams or more of cocaine base the statutory\n            penalty   is   not   less   than  five   years\n            imprisonment.\n\nShortly   thereafter,   the      agreement      specified    the   safety   valve\n\nrequirements and noted, \"Should defendant meet all the requirements\n\nof the 'safety valve' provisions . . . , defendant's Base Offense\n\nLevel shall be reduced by two (2) levels.\"\n\n            A change-of-plea hearing was held on November 30. At the\n\nhearing, the magistrate judge inquired into Padilla's understanding\n\nof the sentencing recommendation.             At the magistrate's request, an\n\nAssistant    United   States      Attorney       explained     the    sentencing\n\n                                        -4-\n\fguidelines calculation and the maximum penalties possible for the\n\noffense, including the mandatory minimum sentence of five years.\n\nHe discussed the safety valve reduction, explaining,\n\n           should [Padilla] comply with all of the\n           provisions of the safety valve, he is also\n           looking at an additional two (2) point\n           reduction . . . . The Defendant understands\n           that should he fail to meet safety valve, then\n           of course he is looking at a base offense\n           level of 23 . . . .             All of that\n           notwithstanding Judge, there is a five (5)\n           years [sic] mandatory minimum . . . .\n\nThe   magistrate   judge   confirmed    that   Padilla    understood    the\n\nexplanation, asking,\n\n           Do you understand that in order to be entitled\n           to the two (2) level reduction under the safet\n           [sic] valve, you shall comply with five (5)\n           requirements, as stated in paragraph nine (9)\n           of your plea agreement, [including the\n           requirement that you] must have provided\n           truthful information to the Government prior\n           to sentencing?\n\nPadilla answered affirmatively.\n\n           The     magistrate   judge     inquired       into      Padilla's\n\nunderstanding of his waiver of appellate rights. After identifying\n\nthe waiver and reading its terms to Padilla, she asked, \"Are you\n\naware that depending on the facts the court finds and the sentence\n\nit eventually imposes, both you and the Government may appeal the\n\nsentence in this case subject to that waver [sic]?\"             Padilla said\n\nhe was so aware, and then entered his guilty plea.         The magistrate\n\njudge found that Padilla knew the terms of the plea agreement and\n\nhad entered it \"in an intelligent and voluntary manner.\"            See Fed.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fR. Crim. P. 11(b).        She filed her Report and Recommendation on\n\nDecember 11, 2006, recommending that the district court accept\n\nPadilla's guilty plea. On December 21, the district court accepted\n\nthe plea.\n\n            In April 2007, two DEA agents and an Assistant United\n\nStates Attorney interviewed Padilla as part of the safety valve\n\nprocess. During the interview, Padilla told the agents that he did\n\nnot own the gym bag seized from his car in the February 3, 2006\n\nsearch.   He had stolen it the night before, he said, from the trunk\n\nof an abandoned car, where it had been stored by local drug dealers\n\nwho owed him money.       Padilla had previously observed the dealers\n\nplace drugs and money in a bag and hide the bag in the car trunk.\n\nBelieving that the bag would contain money, he retrieved it from\n\nthe   trunk;   instead,   it    contained   only   drugs   and   ammunition.\n\nPadilla did not know what to do with the contraband, and the next\n\nmorning it was seized by police.       Before the interview ended, the\n\nAssistant United States Attorney expressed some skepticism to\n\nPadilla about his story.\n\n            In a sealed motion filed with the district court soon\n\nafter, the government indicated that it found Padilla's testimony\n\n\"not totally truthful.\"        Several of Padilla's claims, prosecutors\n\nsaid, lacked credibility: that he stole the gym bag from drug\n\ndealers, that he had never possessed it before being arrested by\n\nPuerto Rico police, and that he had never sold drugs or possessed\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fa weapon.    The claims conflicted with the sworn affidavit of a\n\nPuerto Rico police officer, Agent Héctor Figueroa-Velázquez (\"Agent\n\nFigueroa\"), who had surveilled Padilla in January 2006.     Because\n\nPadilla had not been totally truthful, the government said, he did\n\nnot qualify for the safety valve reduction.       In his response,\n\nPadilla emphasized that he had provided extensive detail to the\n\ngovernment agents about how he knew where the bag was, what it\n\nmight contain, and who owned it.   He pointed out that his story was\n\nconsistent with other facts in the record and was corroborated in\n\npart by the DEA agents present at the safety valve interview.    In\n\ncontrast, Padilla claimed, the government had produced no evidence\n\nproving that he had been untruthful.   Prosecutors simply found his\n\nstory hard to believe.\n\n            On June 22, 2007, the district court issued a sealed\n\norder finding Padilla ineligible for safety valve benefits.     The\n\ncourt observed that Padilla had \"had trouble with his version [of\n\nthe facts] since his interview with the U.S. Probation Officer,\"\n\none month before the safety valve debriefing.   Padilla had changed\n\nseveral parts of his story in response to questions raised by the\n\nProbation Officer.   Padilla repeated the changed story to the DEA\n\nagents and the Assistant United States Attorney during his safety\n\nvalve interview.     Moreover, the story contradicted the sworn\n\naffidavit of Agent Figueroa.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f           At his sentencing hearing on August 2, 2007, Padilla\n\nmoved the district court to reconsider its order denying him the\n\nbenefit of the safety valve.      In response to the court's concern\n\nthat Padilla's story contradicted the sworn testimony of a police\n\nofficer, Padilla emphasized that he had long maintained that Agent\n\nFigueroa lied in the affidavit, having moved on those grounds to\n\nsuppress   the   evidence   obtained    from   the   search   of   his   car.\n\nMoreover, Padilla insisted that he had only clarified his story in\n\nresponse to doubts from the Probation Officer, not changed it.             As\n\nearly as February 3, 2006, after he was arrested, and May 12, 2006,\n\nin his preliminary hearing, Padilla had stated that he stole the\n\nbag containing the drugs -- the same testimony he provided in the\n\nsafety valve interview.     Finding nothing new in Padilla's request,\n\nthe court denied the motion.\n\n           Before sentencing Padilla, the court returned to his\n\nwaiver of appeal.    It noted,\n\n           Mr. Padilla, although you pled guilty and\n           pursuant to the terms of your plea agreement\n           you waived your right to appeal the judgment\n           and the sentence imposed in this case, the\n           Court advises you that you can appeal your\n           conviction if you believe that your plea of\n           guilty was unlawful or involuntary, or if\n           there is some other fundamental defect in the\n           proceedings that was not waived by your plea\n           agreement.\n\nThe court then sentenced Padilla to the statutory mandatory minimum\n\nof five years' imprisonment.     See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii).\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f                                 II\n\n            Padilla appeals his sentence.   Recognizing the potential\n\nobstacle posed by the waiver of appeal in his plea agreement, he\n\nasks that we not honor it because his claim falls outside its scope\n\nand the waiver is invalid. As a substantive matter, he argues that\n\nthe district court erred in denying him the benefits of the safety\n\nvalve.   The government contests both claims.      Because Padilla's\n\nright to seek relief from his sentence in this court turns on the\n\nvalidity of the waiver of appeal, we determine the waiver's effect\n\nbefore considering the substantive claim.

In this case, because we find that the waiver is\n\ninvalid, we need not reach the question of whether the defendant's\n\nappeal falls within its scope.\n\n            A waiver of appellate rights is valid if the defendant\n\nentered into it knowingly and voluntarily.     United States v. Gil-\n\nQuezada, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794028\"><a href=\"/opinion/794028/united-states-v-francisco-antonio-gil-quezada/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36 (1st Cir. 2006).     We determine whether a\n\nwaiver was knowing and voluntary by applying the three-prong test\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fannounced in Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24.            Under this test, an appellate\n\nwaiver is valid as long as: (1) the written plea agreement contains\n\na clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope;\n\n(2) at the plea hearing the district court inquired specifically\n\nabout any waiver of appellate rights, and its interrogation of the\n\ndefendant sufficed to ensure that the waiver was knowing and\n\nvoluntary; and (3) the denial of the right to appeal would not\n\nconstitute a miscarriage of justice.             See Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24-\n\n25.\n\n             The written plea agreement satisfies the first prong of\n\nthe Teeter test.         The language of the waiver itself elucidates the\n\nright being waived by the defendant, namely, the \"right to appeal\n\nthe judgment and sentence.\"           The scope of the waiver is limited to\n\n\"this   case\"      and    to   any   sentence    consistent    with   the   plea\n\nagreement's terms and conditions. We have previously held that the\n\nsame language satisfied the first Teeter prong.               Gil-Quezada, 445\n\nF.3d at 36; United States v. De-La-Cruz Castro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200058\"><a href=\"/opinion/200058/united-states-v-de-la-cruz-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).       Padilla does not contend otherwise.\n\n             The second prong of Teeter requires us to examine the\n\ntranscript of the colloquy between the court and the defendant at\n\nthe change-of-plea hearing.           Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24.     Our focus in\n\ndoing   so   is    \"to    ascertain    whether   the   court's   interrogation\n\nsuffices to ensure that the defendant freely and intelligently\n\nagreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming sentence.\"\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fId.; see also De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d at 10.                         As Federal Rule\n\nof Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(N) requires, the colloquy must\n\ninclude a specific inquiry \"into any waiver of appellate rights.\"\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 24.            In explaining the extent of the waiver and\n\nwhat   right    of       appeal    remains,    if       any,   the     court    \"should    be\n\nespecially careful in its choice of words, taking pains to explain\n\nto the defendant that her right to appeal is circumscribed by her\n\npreexisting waiver.\"              Teeter, 257 F.3d at 25.               Context is also\n\nimportant      in    determining      whether       a    statement      is     sufficiently\n\nmisleading to nullify a waiver.                See United States v. Soto-Cruz,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202249\"><a href=\"/opinion/202249/united-states-v-soto-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"The context in which such a\n\nstatement is made is important to our determination . . . .\"); De-\n\nLa-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d at 11-12 (\"Context is important . . . .\");\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 24-25.\n\n             Padilla argues that statements by the court during his\n\nchange-of-plea and sentencing hearings were so misleading that they\n\nabrogated his waiver of appeal. During the change-of-plea hearing,\n\nthe magistrate judge asked Padilla whether he understood that\n\n\"depending on the facts the court finds and the sentence it\n\neventually imposes, both you and the government may appeal the\n\nsentence in this case subject to that waver [sic]?\" Padilla points\n\nout that the court posed this question shortly after explaining\n\nthat   the     guidelines         sentencing     range         would     depend    on     his\n\nsatisfaction        of    the     safety-valve      requirements,         including       the\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\finterview. In this context, he says, his affirmative answer to the\n\njudge's question meant that he understood that he would retain the\n\nright to appeal if the district court found that he was ineligible\n\nfor the safety valve.       Padilla suggests that his misunderstanding\n\nwas subsequently \"compounded\" by the district court at sentencing,\n\nwhen it stated that Padilla could appeal if he believed his guilty\n\nplea \"was unlawful or involuntary,\" or there was \"some other\n\nfundamental defect in the proceedings that was not waived by [the]\n\nplea agreement.\"\n\n           We agree that, taken in context, the court's statement at\n\nthe change-of-plea hearing was so misleading that it nullified\n\nPadilla's waiver of appeal. The court's choice of language -- that\n\nPadilla could appeal \"depending on the facts this court finds\" --\n\nreasonably suggested to Padilla that he retained a right to appeal\n\nadverse factual findings.      The context of the statement reinforced\n\nthis view.     Because the statement closely followed the court's\n\nexplanation of the safety-valve, the phrase \"the facts this court\n\nfinds\" could reasonably have been understood by Padilla to refer to\n\nsafety-valve eligibility, and, in particular, to a finding that he\n\nhad failed to provide truthful information to the government.              In\n\nsuch a context, the magistrate judge's statement that Padilla could\n\nappeal \"depending on the facts this court finds\" suggested that he\n\nretained   a   right   to   appeal   an     adverse   determination   of   his\n\neligibility for safety-valve relief.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f                This suggestion by the court, rather than illuminating\n\nthe meaning of the written waiver of appeal, contradicted its\n\nterms, which are not similarly limited in language or effect.                  By\n\nits terms, Padilla's waiver covers appeals of his judgment and\n\nsentence, and applies as long as the district court sentences him\n\naccording to the terms and conditions of the plea agreement.                  The\n\nterms of the plea agreement do not guarantee Padilla that he will\n\nbe found eligible for safety-valve relief.                Thus, Padilla waived\n\nhis right to appeal his sentence regardless of whether the court\n\nfound him eligible for the safety valve.                 See Acosta-Roman, 549\n\nF.3d       at   4   (discussing   the   terms   of   a   similar   waiver).    By\n\nsuggesting that Padilla retained appellate rights in the event of\n\nan adverse finding of safety-valve eligibility, the plea colloquy\n\nwas so misleading that we cannot regard Padilla's waiver as knowing\n\nand voluntary.2\n\n                We therefore decline to enforce Padilla's waiver of\n\nappeal.         Because there is no need to reach the third prong of\n\nTeeter, we now turn to the substantive claim on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       Because we conclude that the statement made at the change-\nof-plea hearing \"mudd[ied] the waters,\" see Teeter, 257 F.3d at 25,\nwe need not reach the issue of the court's statement at sentencing.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fB.

Id.\n       4\n           The first four requirements are:\n\n       (1) the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal\n       history point, as determined under the sentencing\n       guidelines;\n       (2) the defendant did not use violence or credible\n       threats of violence or possess a firearm or other\n       dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so)\n       in connection with the offense;\n       (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily\n       injury to any person;\n       (4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager,\n       or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined\n       under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a\n       continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in section 408\n       of the Controlled Substances Act . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)-(4).\n     The appellant asserts in his brief that the government does\nnot contest his satisfaction of the first four safety-valve\nrequirements. The government appears to agree.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fStates v. Rodriguez-Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795065\"><a href=\"/opinion/795065/united-states-v-arsenio-rodriguez-ortiz-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting\n\nMatos, 328 F.3d at 38).         The defendant bears the burden of proving,\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence, that he has satisfied this\n\nrequirement. See Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 529 n.25 (discussing\n\nall five requirements under § 3553(f)).                       We now turn to the\n\nspecific claims of error, both of law and fact, raised by Padilla.\n\n             2. Legal claims\n\n                      a. Burden of proof\n\n             Padilla argues that the defendant's burden of proof \"does\n\nnot arise until the government has made some preliminary showing,\n\nbased   on   something       more    than    opinion     or   disbelief,   that   the\n\n[safety-valve] proffer is incomplete or untruthful.\" Here, Padilla\n\nsays, the government simply asserted to the district court that it\n\nfound Padilla's story implausible. Taken alone, he argues, such an\n\nassertion is insufficient to support a finding that Padilla was\n\nuntruthful.\n\n             There is no support in our law for the proposition that\n\nthe   government      must    make    a     \"preliminary      showing\"   before   the\n\ndefendant's burden of proof arises.                    The cases cited by the\n\ndefendant establish only that \"when the record, taken as a whole,\n\nwill not support a finding that the defendant has failed to provide\n\na   truthful    and    complete       proffer,     the     government's    lack   of\n\nconfidence in the proffer is insufficient, in and of itself, to\n\njustify a denial of access to the safety valve.\"                 Marquez, 280 F.3d\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fat 24; see United States v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197478\"><a href=\"/opinion/197478/united-states-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73-74 (1st Cir.\n\n1997); Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 529.            Where the record does\n\nprovide some support, \"a sentencing court may reject a safety valve\n\nproffer   based   on   its   reasoned    assessment   of    the    defendant's\n\ncredibility in light of the facts.\"               Marquez, 280 F.3d at 24\n\n(citing White, 119 F.3d at 74).      It need not base its determination\n\non \"independent rebuttal evidence\" introduced by the government.\n\nId.\n\n           Within this framework, a defendant's insistence that he\n\nhas provided truthful and complete information does not necessarily\n\novercome an unfriendly record.          See id. at 24-25 (observing that\n\notherwise, \"district courts would be bound to accept even the most\n\narrant nonsense from a defendant's mouth so long as the government\n\ncould not directly contradict it by independent proof,\" in effect\n\n\"turn[ing] the burden of persuasion inside out\").                 Rather, when\n\nfaced with a defendant who insists that he proffered truthful\n\ninformation,   the     sentencing   court   may    make    its    own   reasoned\n\ndetermination, in light of the facts on record, whether to credit\n\nthe defendant's assertion. See United States v. Bravo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797988\"><a href=\"/opinion/797988/united-states-v-alfre-luis-bravo-and-jesus-antonio-martinez-rosado-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n12 (1st Cir. 2007) (upholding rejection of admittedly \"consistent\"\n\nstory in light of agent's testimony that it was \"illogical\");\n\nRodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d at 25 (upholding denial of safety valve\n\nwhere district court did not credit defendant, who \"simply den[ied]\n\nthe charges against him,\" in light of his contradiction by record\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fevidence); Marquez, 280 F.3d at 24-25.           In the present case, the\n\nsentencing court followed precisely this method, identifying in its\n\norder specific facts on the record, see supra section I, in light\n\nof which the court refused to credit Padilla's assertion that he\n\nprovided truthful information.\n\n                   b. Proper basis for safety-valve determination\n\n           Padilla argues that the sentencing court erred in basing\n\nits   determination     on   information    other   than   the   safety-valve\n\nproffer itself, namely, an earlier interview conducted by the case\n\nProbation Officer.      That interview, he says, was conducted \"only\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility purposes.\"            As such, it was \"more\n\nlimited\"   than   the    safety-valve      interview    and   should   not   be\n\nconsidered.\n\n           Once again Padilla fails to adduce any legal authorities\n\nin support of his position.       In fact, sentencing courts assessing\n\neligibility for the safety valve routinely rely on a variety of\n\nrecord materials in determining whether a defendant has provided\n\ntruthful and complete information.          See Bermúdez, 407 F.3d at 542\n\n(upholding determination based on comparison between safety-valve\n\nproffer and testimony at trial of co-defendant); Marquez, 280 F.3d\n\nat 24 (noting \"internal inconsistencies between the proffer and\n\nother statements that the [defendant] himself had made\"); Matos,\n\n328 F.3d at 40 (upholding district court's determination in light\n\nof \"other evidence that can be gleaned from the record\").              There is\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fno sensible reason to limit the assessment of truthfulness to the\n\nsafety-valve proffer itself.         Inconsistencies between statements\n\nmade during the proffer and statements made to the authorities on\n\nother occasions are not necessarily disqualifying.            But the court\n\nmay legitimately consider such inconsistencies in deciding on the\n\ntruthfulness of the proffer.\n\n             3. Factual claims\n\n             Padilla argues that the district court committed clear\n\nerror   in   finding   that   his   safety-valve   proffer    had    not   been\n\ntruthful.     He makes several discrete challenges.\n\n                      a. The change in Padilla's story\n\n             Padilla argues that the district court clearly erred in\n\nconcluding that he had changed his account of the offense.                  We\n\ndisagree.      Even    assuming,    arguendo,   that   the   two    interviews\n\ndiffered in purpose, as Padilla argues, that difference cannot\n\naccount for the material alterations Padilla made to his story on\n\nretelling.     According to Padilla's initial account, he stole the\n\nbag containing the contraband when he was \"visiting a friend [and]\n\nobserved a man hiding a gym bag in the trunk of a vehicle.\"                 He\n\nstole it \"thinking that maybe it was full of cash.\"                 After the\n\nProbation Officer expressed concern that Padilla had not provided\n\nher with \"complete, accurate and truthful information,\" Padilla\n\ntold a different story.       He stated that he knew the owners of the\n\nbag, that they owed him $5,000, and that they had failed to pay him\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fback.   During his safety-valve interview, he also stated that he\n\nhad previously purchased drugs from the owners of the bag and that\n\nhe expected the bag to contain drugs when he stole it.   Even if the\n\nrough outlines of the two stories are consistent, the details and\n\ntheir implications differ markedly, and it cannot be clear error\n\nfor a sentencing court to take note of such differences and find in\n\nthose differences a lack of truthfulness.\n\n                 b. Agent Figueroa's affidavit\n\n          Padilla argues that the sentencing court committed clear\n\nerror by crediting Agent Figueroa's affidavit. Again, we disagree.\n\nTo be sure, Padilla has long insisted that Agent Figueroa falsified\n\nhis affidavit.   On the basis of this allegation and the required\n\npreliminary showing, Padilla obtained a hearing under Franks v.\n\nDelaware, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), to determine the validity of the\n\nFebruary 3, 2006 search warrant, which was based on the affidavit.\n\nIn her Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge who presided\n\nover the Franks hearing identified several reasons to question the\n\nveracity of Agent Figueroa's affidavit.   Yet the magistrate judge\n\nalso credited Agent Figueroa's testimony during the hearing, noting\n\nthat he was \"forthright in demeanor\" and that \"some evidence . . .\n\ncorroborated Figueroa's version of events.\"   She ultimately upheld\n\nthe validity of the search warrant, and submitted Proposed Findings\n\nof Fact based on Agent's Figueroa's testimony.    In light of this\n\noutcome and the substance of the magistrate judge's report, we\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fcannot conclude that the district court committed clear error in\n\ngiving the affidavit the weight that it did.              See Matos, 328 F.3d\n\nat 40-41 (\"[W]hen more than one sensible interpretation . . . can\n\nsupportably be drawn, a sentencing court's decision to credit one\n\nalternative     and     reject     another   cannot    be    deemed      clearly\n\nerroneous.\").     Taking the measure of a sworn statement in view of\n\nits attempted impeachment is typical fact-finding, and the record\n\nsimply does not compel a \"strong, unyielding belief that a mistake\n\nhas been made.\"       See Bermúdez, 407 F.3d at 542 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n                      c. The bag\n\n          Lastly,       Padilla     argues   that   the     sentencing     court\n\ncommitted clear error by determining that the bag seized from his\n\ncar during the February 3, 2006 search was the same bag Agent\n\nFigueroa observed Padilla using to carry a rifle on January 24,\n\n2006.   It is true that the bag described in Agent Figueroa's\n\naffidavit was \"blue and grey,\" while the bag discovered in the\n\nsearch of Padilla's automobile is described as being simply blue.\n\nHowever, the colors and features of the bags are not so dissimilar\n\nthat it amounts to clear error to conclude that they were the same.\n\nThe court might have discounted Agent Figueroa's testimony that the\n\nbag observed on January 24 was blue and grey, and not entirely\n\nblue, on the basis of his line of sight -- a matter thoroughly\n\ndiscussed during the Franks hearing.                Agent Figueroa himself\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\ftestified that the bags were similar, although he was unsure\n\nwhether they were the same.        In light of the descriptions of the\n\nbags, the court's determination that they were the same was not\n\nclear error.\n\n                    d. Summary\n\n           As the record reveals, the story Padilla told at his\n\nsafety-valve debriefing differed in material respects from Agent\n\nFigueroa's affidavit.      Padilla denied ever possessing a weapon,\n\nwhile Agent Figueroa stated that he observed Padilla with three\n\nweapons.    Moreover, Padilla altered his own account of how he\n\nacquired the bag of drugs and ammunition seized from his car during\n\nthe February 3, 2006 search.         There were no clear errors in the\n\ndistrict court's specific factual findings, as set forth in its\n\norder   rejecting   Padilla's      eligibility   for   the   safety    valve.\n\nDistrict   courts   may   reject    safety-valve   proffers    based    on   a\n\n\"reasoned assessment of the defendant's credibility in light of the\n\nfacts\" on record.      Marquez, 280 F.3d at 24.        Such was the case\n\nhere.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f</pre>",
