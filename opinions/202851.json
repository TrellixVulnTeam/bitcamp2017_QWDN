Uribe-Londono on brief pro se.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Germán A.\nRieckhoff, Assistant United States Attorney, an Rosa Emilia\nRodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              July 18, 2007\n\f          Per Curiam.    Jesus Uribe-Londono, currently serving a\n\n120-month sentence for his conviction of sexual exploitation of\n\nchildren in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251, appeals the district\n\ncourt's denial of his post-conviction motion for the return of\n\nseized property, most of which appears to be documentary in nature,\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g).    In a prior appeal, we affirmed\n\nthe district court's denial of a Rule 41(g) motion appellant filed\n\nbefore the criminal proceedings had concluded, finding, inter alia,\n\nthat the district court reasonably could have concluded that the\n\nproperty retained was related to the case, that the government had\n\nadequately shown a need to retain the items as evidence until the\n\ncriminal proceedings had concluded, and that appellant's requests\n\nwere premature.   See United States v. Uribe-Londono, No. 05-2121\n\n(1st Cir. Apr. 12, 2006).\n\n          After the prior appeal was decided and the criminal\n\nproceedings had concluded, appellant renewed his motion, arguing\n\nthat he was entitled to the return of all property still in the\n\ngovernment's possession because the government had not brought a\n\nforfeiture proceeding.   Appellant attached to the motion copies of\n\nsome of the FBI inventory forms the government had previously\n\nsubmitted in response to an order directing it to identify property\n\nstill in its possession.    The property listed in the forms ranged\n\nfrom video camera equipment to items such as notebooks, calendars,\n\nbusiness cards, agendas,    computer disks and a copy of a computer\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fhard drive. Appellant argued that of the property seized, only the\n\nvideo camera and one videocassette tape were used in the underlying\n\noffense,     and that much of the property in issue was work-related,\n\nvital to his ability to obtain employment in the future, and bore\n\nno connection to the offense of conviction. Appellant acknowledged\n\nthat computer hardware had been returned to his former employer,\n\nbut   he    alleged      that    the   government     retained       copies   of     the\n\ninformation contained therein and requested that the government\n\nprovide him with a copy of that material.                      Appellant further\n\nasserted that, as part of discovery in the criminal proceedings,\n\nthe government had already provided him with copies of many of the\n\ndocumentary materials he sought, but he maintained that the copies\n\nwere illegible.\n\n             The government opposed the motion, arguing that appellant\n\nwas   not    entitled     to    the    return   of   the    property       because    it\n\nconstituted derivative contraband either because it was used to\n\ncommit      the   offense       of    conviction     or    because    it    contained\n\npornographic images of minors or contact information for minors.\n\nHowever, the government did not submit affidavits or any other\n\nevidence to support its assertions concerning the contents or\n\nnature of the property in issue.              Further, although the government\n\nasserted that it had returned computer equipment to appellant's\n\nformer employer and suggested that appellant did not have standing\n\nto    request     that    material,      it   did    not    specifically      address\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fappellant's request for a copy of the information contained in the\n\nhard drive which, according to the inventory forms, the government\n\nstill had in its possession. The district court denied appellant's\n\nRule 41(g) request the day after the government's opposition was\n\nfiled, stating that it had \"reviewed the FBI's inventory list and\n\nnotes that all property listed therein which was not returned to\n\ndefendant is intrinsically intertwined to the instruments used to\n\nfacilitate his delictive activity[,]\" and that \"non-case related\n\nitems were already returned to defendant's representative.\"          This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n           We review the district court's interpretation of Rule\n\n41(g) de novo and its factual determinations for clear error.         See\n\nUnited States v. Pierre, 484 F.3d 75, 87, (1st Cir. 2007).           Rule\n\n41(g) provides that \"[a] person aggrieved . . . by the deprivation\n\nof property may move [the district court] for the property's\n\nreturn.\"   \"Once seized property is no longer needed as evidence, a\n\ncriminal defendant is presumed to have the right to its return.\n\nHowever, a Rule 41(g) motion is properly denied if the defendant is\n\nnot entitled to lawful possession of the seized property, the\n\nproperty   is    contraband   or   subject   to   forfeiture,   or    the\n\ngovernment's need for the property as evidence continues.\" Pierre,\n\n484 F.3d at 87 (internal citations, quotations and alterations\n\nomitted); see also United States v. Chambers, 192 F.3d 374, 377 (3d\n\nCir. 1999) (\"The burden shifts to the government when the criminal\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fproceedings have terminated.    At that point, the person from whom\n\nthe property was seized is presumed to have a right to its return,\n\nand the government must demonstrate that it has a legitimate reason\n\nto retain the property.\").\n\n          To the extent appellant contends that the government was\n\nrequired to establish that the property in question constituted\n\nderivative contraband or was otherwise subject to forfeiture by\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt, his argument does not find support\n\nin the case law.     See United States v. Maez, 915 F.2d 1466, 1468\n\n(10th Cir. 1990) (because Rule 41(g) proceedings are civil in\n\nnature, \"[t]he judge is not bound by the criminal proceeding's\n\nstandard of proof\" and the civil       preponderance-of-the-evidence\n\nstandard applies).    However, to the extent appellant contends that\n\nthe district court misallocated the burden of proof and improperly\n\ndecided disputed facts without sufficient evidence, his argument\n\nhas merit.\n\n          This court has not set forth in detail the procedure the\n\ndistrict court is to follow when presented with a post-conviction\n\nRule 41(g) motion, but we have stated that such motions are to be\n\ntreated as civil complaints for equitable relief, see United States\n\nv. Giraldo, 45 F.3d 509, 511 (1st Cir. 1995); accord Rufu v. United\n\nStates, 20 F.3d 63, 65 (2d Cir. 1994), and Rule 41(g) itself\n\nprovides that \"[t]he court shall receive evidence on any issue of\n\nfact necessary to the decision of the motion.\"      As noted above,\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fappellant conceded that one video and the camera used to produce\n\nthat video \"contained evidence that was the subject of [his]\n\nconviction,\" but asserted that the remainder of the documents still\n\nin the government's possession were work-related and contained no\n\ninformation    relating   to    minors    or   child    pornography.      The\n\ngovernment disputed that contention and argued that the documents\n\nwere found to contain information relating to minors, and as such,\n\nconstituted derivative contraband; however, the government did not\n\nsubmit affidavits or other evidence to substantiate its assertion,\n\nand the government's inventory forms did not describe the specific\n\nnature or contents of the materials seized.            Therefore, it was not\n\n\"apparent,\" as the government contends, that the property appellant\n\nsought constituted derivative contraband.              Cf. United States v.\n\nFelici, 208 F.3d 667, 670-71 (8th Cir. 2000) (district court\n\nproperly denied Rule 41(e) request for the return of firearms\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing because defendant's status as a\n\nconvicted felon made it illegal for him to possess firearms.\n\nHowever, district court erred in denying defendant's request for\n\nthe return of items the government asserted were \"drug-related\"\n\nwithout   an   evidentiary     hearing   where   it    was   not   immediately\n\napparent whether items were used or intended to be used in an\n\nunlawful manner).\n\n           The district court also failed to address appellant's\n\nrequest for the copy of information contained in the computer hard\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdrive. On appeal, the government takes the position that appellant\n\nhad no standing to request that material because the hard drive\n\nbelonged to appellant's former employer.   However, the government\n\ndid not develop that argument below, and the district court did not\n\nmake any findings of fact as to whether the government retained a\n\ncopy of the information contained in the hard drive, whether\n\nappellant had standing to request the copy, and if so, whether the\n\ndocument was properly withheld. Further, the district court failed\n\nto afford appellant an opportunity to respond to the government's\n\nopposition, having denied appellant's motion the day after the\n\ngovernment's opposition was filed.\n\n          In sum, we cannot sustain the district court's finding\n\nthat the property in dispute was so \"inextricably intertwined\" with\n\nthe underlying offense as to constitute derivative contraband\n\nbecause it appears to be based solely on the government's unsworn\n\nand unsubstantiated assertions concerning the nature and contents\n\nof the seized property, which is not self-evident and was disputed\n\nby appellant.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g); Rufu, 20 F.3d at 65\n\n(reversing denial of Rule 41(g) motion where numerous factual\n\ndisputes existed concerning, inter alia, what property was in the\n\ngovernment's possession and what property had been returned, and\n\ndistrict court's decision was based solely upon an unsworn letter\n\nfrom the government, without affidavits or DEA records); Mora v.\n\nUnited States, 955 F.2d 156, 158 (2nd Cir. 1992) (holding that\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fdistrict court erred in relying on government's unsubstantiated\n\nassertions concerning disposition of property sought in Rule 41(e)\n\nmotion).   Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of\n\nappellant's Rule 41(g) motion and remand the matter for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Further, the district court failed\n\nto afford appellant an opportunity to respond to the government's\n\nopposition, having denied appellant's motion the day after the\n\ngovernment's opposition was filed.\n\n          In sum, we cannot sustain the district court's finding\n\nthat the property in dispute was so \"inextricably intertwined\" with\n\nthe underlying offense as to constitute derivative contraband\n\nbecause it appears to be based solely on the government's unsworn\n\nand unsubstantiated assertions concerning the nature and contents\n\nof the seized property, which is not self-evident and was disputed\n\nby appellant.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g); Rufu, 20 F.3d at 65\n\n(reversing denial of Rule 41(g) motion where numerous factual\n\ndisputes existed concerning, inter alia, what property was in the\n\ngovernment's possession and what property had been returned, and\n\ndistrict court's decision was based solely upon an unsworn letter\n\nfrom the government, without affidavits or DEA records); Mora v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577015\"><a href=\"/opinion/577015/luis-mora-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (2nd Cir. 1992) (holding that\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fdistrict court erred in relying on government's unsubstantiated\n\nassertions concerning disposition of property sought in Rule 41(e)\n\nmotion).
