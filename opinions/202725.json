Castro Lang for appellant.\n     Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and Rosa Emilia\nRodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                  May 1, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f          DICLERICO, District Judge.      On Christmas Eve of 2004,\n\nRaúl Báez De Jesús was arrested with Christian Sánchez when they\n\nwere intercepted while navigating a boat carrying cocaine from St.\n\nThomas to Puerto Rico.    Báez and Sánchez were indicted for aiding\n\nand abetting each other to distribute 220 kilograms of cocaine and\n\nfor illegally importing cocaine into the United States.        Báez pled\n\nguilty on July 5, 2005.      He appeals from his sentence of 135\n\nmonths’ imprisonment on the ground that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his request for a downward departure.          For the following\n\nreasons, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n          On   appeal,    Báez   argues   that   the    District   Court\n\nerroneously failed to recognize that the government’s conduct in\n\nrevealing Báez as the source of certain statements against his co-\n\nconspirators, who are charged in a separate action, constituted\n\ngrounds for a downward departure under either U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 or\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553.1       Importantly, Báez does not challenge the\n\nreasonableness of his sentence under United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005).   Cf., e.g., United States v. Martínez-Vives, 475\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although Báez cites § 3553 in his appellate brief, he makes\nno developed argument under any provision of that statute, and\ninstead relies on § 5K2.0.     During the sentencing proceeding,\nhowever, Báez did not raise § 5K2.0 and instead relied on § 3553.\nGenerally, arguments not raised below are reviewed only for plain\nerror. United States v. Milkiewicz, 470 F.3d 390, 401 (1st Cir.\n2006). Because we conclude that jurisdiction is lacking to review\nBáez’s claim on appeal, the standard of review is not an issue in\nthis case.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fF.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir. 2007) (“Martínez challenges his 33-month\n\nsentence as unreasonable.”).\n\n              A sentencing court’s denial of a downward departure is\n\ndiscretionary and unreviewable unless the court refuses the request\n\nbased “on a view that it lacks legal authority to consider a\n\ndeparture or . . . base[d] . . . on an error of law.”                    United\n\nStates   v.    Meléndez-Torres,   420   F.3d   45,    50   (1st   Cir.   2005).\n\nNeither exception occurred in this case.\n\n              Báez contends that certain statements made during the\n\nsentencing      proceeding   demonstrate   that      the    sentencing   court\n\nbelieved it lacked authority to grant a downward departure based on\n\nthe government’s disclosure to Báez’s co-conspirators that he was\n\nthe source of statements made against them.2               Specifically, Báez\n\ncites the court’s response to defense counsel’s question during the\n\nfollowing exchange:\n\n              [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:      Your Honor, if they\n              weren’t using him as a witness, if they\n              weren’t giving him the benefit of cooperation,\n              then we can see no other reason why his\n              statement would be provided to defense counsel\n              [in the co-conspirators’ case] other than to\n              lead defense counsel in that case to induce\n              their clients to plead guilty because this\n              defendant would be available to testify\n              against them; when now the government says\n              that it won’t be using my client as a witness.\n\n              THE COURT: They don’t say it now. They have\n              always said it from day one. In my case, in\n\n\n     2\n      Defense counsel also argued a variety of other grounds for\ndownward departure that are not at issue on appeal.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          this case, they’ve said that they are not\n          going to use it in the other case.\n\n          [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then why was a statement,\n          Your Honor, provided in Criminal Case 05-302?\n\n          THE COURT:      You will have to ask the\n          government.    But that’s an issue that has\n          nothing to do with sentencing in this case.\n          Anything else?\n\nSentencing Hr’g Tr. 43-44, Apr. 26, 2006. When defense counsel\n\ncontinued to argue that the government was benefitting from the use\n\nof Báez’s statement in his co-conspirators’ case and that defense\n\ncounsel had not been told that Báez would not be a witness in that\n\ncase, the court responded:\n\n          I’m sure they have, because [Government\n          Counsel] are not going to come here as\n          officers of the court and state to me that\n          they are not going to be using it. And they\n          have been stating it since day one, since the\n          first time we asked them, and then go around\n          and go over to [the judge in the other case]\n          and defense counsel and tell them we’re going\n          to   use  [Báez]   as   a  witness,   because\n          [Government Counsel] would get into a lot of\n          trouble.\n\n          Counsel, I told you that was a good faith\n          mistake, that they turned it over.        And\n          [Government Counsel] explained it to you and\n          to me a long time ago, that it was a mistake,\n          they are sorry for it, that they should have\n          not done it.\n\nId. at 47. Government counsel agreed that the government had\n\ninformed the judge and defense counsel in the other case that Báez\n\nwould not be a witness in that case and also noted that none of the\n\ndefendants in the other case had entered guilty pleas.\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f          Taken in context, the sentencing court’s statements show\n\nit found that the government’s disclosure of Báez’s statement did\n\nnot constitute misconduct which could affect Báez’s sentencing.\n\nSee United States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d 42, 50 n.8 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(“[G]overnment misconduct may serve as a ground for departure, but\n\nonly if relevant in some particular way to sentencing.”).              We\n\nconclude from our review of the record in this case that the\n\nsentencing court was aware of its authority to depart based on\n\ngovernment misconduct, but in the exercise of its discretion, the\n\ncourt declined to do so under the circumstances as it found them to\n\nbe. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court’s\n\ndiscretionary   decision   denying   Báez’s   request   for   a   downward\n\ndeparture.   Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d at 51.\n\n          The appeal is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
