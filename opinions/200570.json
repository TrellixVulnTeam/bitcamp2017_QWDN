(\"Metropol\"), on Rivera's age discrimination\n\nclaim.    We find that Rivera has failed to demonstrate a trial\n\nworthy issue of discrimination under the Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., and affirm the\n\ndistrict court's decision.\n\n                        I.

Summary    judgment      is    appropriate     \"if   the   pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"             Fed.

Rosenberg, 328 F.3d at 17.\n\n                              II.   Background\n\n           Before Metropol opened on June 29, 1998, Rivera and\n\nAlberto Nogueras, a busboy at the restaurant, had an altercation,\n\nduring which Rivera threw or accidentally dropped a tray full of\n\ndrinking glasses on Nogueras.          Nogueras was cut by the glasses and\n\nreceived twelve stitches at the hospital.               The manager of the\n\nrestaurant interviewed employees regarding the incident; after\n\ndetermining that Rivera was the aggressor, the manager fired Rivera\n\nlater that day.\n\n           At the time of his discharge, Rivera was fifty-five years\n\nold and had been a waiter at Metropol for eight or nine years.\n\n           Rivera     filed     suit     in   June   1999,   alleging   age\n\ndiscrimination under the ADEA and similar Puerto Rican statutes.\n\nOn June 3, 2002, the district court granted summary judgment for\n\nMetropol   on   the   federal    ADEA    claim,   and   dismissed   Rivera's\n\ncommonwealth claims without prejudice.            This appeal of the ADEA\n\nclaim followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f                              III.   Discussion\n\n            The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to \"discharge\n\nany individual . . . because of such individual's age.\"                   29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 623(a)(1) (2003).         In an ADEA wrongful discharge case, the\n\nplaintiff must prove that he would not have been fired but for his\n\nage.     Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).       Where,    as   here,    there       is    no    evidence   of     direct\n\ndiscrimination, the familiar McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting\n\nframework governs.      Id.; see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792, 802-05 (1973).\n\n            A plaintiff makes a prima facie case of discrimination\n\nunder McDonnell Douglas by showing that (1) he was at least forty\n\nyears old; (2) he met the employer's legitimate job expectations;\n\n(3) he was fired; and (4) the employer did not treat age neutrally.\n\nPages-Cahue v. Iberia Líneas Aéreas de España, 82 F.3d 533, 536\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).       The fourth element requires the plaintiff to\n\nproduce    \"evidence    adequate     to     create      an    inference      that   an\n\nemployment    decision      was   based     on    an    illegal    discriminatory\n\ncriterion.\" O'Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308,\n\n312 (1996) (quotation omitted).\n\n            The initial prima facie case is not burdensome and raises\n\na rebuttable presumption of unlawful discrimination.                    Woodman v.\n\nHaemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1091 (1st Cir. 1995).                    The burden\n\nthen shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.          Mesnick\n\nv. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991).              If the\n\nemployer makes this showing, the presumption of discrimination\n\ndisappears, and the burden shifts back to the employee.           Id.   The\n\nplaintiff must then show, without resort to the presumption created\n\nby the prima facie case, that the employer's explanation is a\n\npretext for age discrimination.      Id.\n\n          A.    Legitimate, Non-discriminatory Reason\n\n          We assume arguendo that Rivera can establish a prima\n\nfacie case.      Metropol offers a legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nreason for discharging Rivera: Rivera assaulted and injured another\n\nemployee while at work.     Rivera had received a copy of Metropol's\n\nemployment     manual,   which   warns   that   an   employee's    attack,\n\naggression, assault, or threat of aggression against a supervisor\n\nor fellow employee justifies Metropol's immediate termination of\n\nthat employee.     Rivera's behavior violated Metropol's rules of\n\nconduct, and the restaurant took swift disciplinary action.             The\n\nrestaurant has met its burden of production and the ultimate burden\n\nnow rests with Rivera to prove his discharge was motivated by\n\ndiscriminatory animus.     See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.\n\n          B.    Evidence of Discrimination\n\n          Now that the burden has shifted back to Rivera, he must\n\ncome forward with sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable fact-\n\nfinder to conclude that his employer's stated reason for discharge\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwas a pretext for age discrimination.                      After considering his\n\narguments and reviewing the record, we find that he has not shown\n\nthat a genuine issue exists as to the reason for his termination.\n\n            First,      Rivera       asserts       that     the     pre-termination\n\ninvestigation was cursory -- evidenced by the fact that Rivera was\n\nnever allowed to explain his side of the story -- and therefore\n\nMetropol's reason for terminating him was pretextual.                      Metropol\n\nresponds that it determined, based on one interview and Nogueras'\n\nactual (and undisputed) injuries, that Rivera was the aggressor,\n\nand it sought to take swift action to deter further workplace\n\nviolence. Whether a termination decision was wise or done in haste\n\nis   irrelevant,       so   long    as   the    decision     was    not   made    with\n\ndiscriminatory animus.         Gray v. New Eng. Tel. & Tel. Co., 792 F.2d\n\n251, 255 (1st Cir. 1986).           Rivera's bare assertion that Metropol's\n\nreason    for   terminating        him   was    pretext    is     insufficient:   the\n\nrestaurant's reason was compelling, and our thorough review of the\n\nrecord reveals that Rivera lacks any evidence that the real reason\n\nfor his termination was age discrimination. See Ruiz v. Posadas de\n\nSan Juan Assocs., 124 F.3d 243, 248 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[Plaintiff]\n\nmust do more than cast doubt on the rationale proffered by the\n\nemployer, . . . the evidence must be of such strength and quality\n\nas   to   permit   a    reasonable       finding    that    the    termination     was\n\nobviously or manifestly unsupported.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f            Second, Rivera contends Metropol discriminated against\n\nolder workers, sometimes referring to employees as \"imbéciles\" or\n\n\"corpses.\"       Such   \"stray    workplace     remarks\"    are   generally\n\ninsufficient, standing on their own, to establish discriminatory\n\nanimus.    González v. El Día, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nRivera does not specify who made these comments, when they were\n\nmade, or to whom they were directed.              The lack of a direct\n\nconnection    between    the     words    and   the   employment     action\n\nsignificantly weakens their probative value.          Schuster v. Lucent\n\nTechs., Inc., 327 F.3d 569, 576 (7th Cir. 2003).           Given Metropol's\n\ncompelling stated reason for Rivera's termination, these stray\n\nremarks do not permit the inference that the real reason for\n\nRivera's termination was age discrimination.               See Williams v.\n\nRaytheon Co., 220 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Rivera also offers the affidavit of a former employee who\n\nworked at Metropol for three years, beginning at age sixty, then\n\nleft and later sought re-employment at age sixty-three or sixty-\n\nfour.   The owner told him \"we are too old for this,\" and he was not\n\nrehired.    We do not think this evidence reveals age-based animus.\n\nThe owner's statement uses \"we,\" which is different than saying\n\n\"you are too old for the job;\" such ambiguity weakens Rivera's\n\nclaim that the statement reveals age animus.           See González, 304\n\nF.3d at 70.    Also, the fact the employee was hired for the first\n\ntime at age sixty demonstrates Metropol's willingness to have older\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\femployees on its staff.            Metropol introduced evidence that more\n\nthan two-thirds of its male employees are over forty-five. This is\n\nnot the hallmark of an employer who discriminates against older\n\nworkers.\n\n              Finally,    Rivera     alleges   that    other     employees    were\n\ninvolved in altercations at work but not fired.                Metropol counters\n\nthat some of those incidents were unknown to supervisors, and none\n\nof the other incidents resulted in personal injuries requiring\n\nmedical treatment.        After reviewing the record, we agree that the\n\nincidents proffered by Rivera are of a significantly less severe\n\nnature (a few punches without injury exchanged in one incident,\n\nobscene words and shoving in another, and a piece of silverware\n\nthrown   in    a   third);   therefore,      these    examples    fail   to   show\n\ndisparate treatment.         See Rodríguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc., 181 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[A] claim of disparate\n\ntreatment based on comparative evidence must rest on proof that the\n\nproposed analogue is similarly situated in all material respects.\")\n\n(quotation omitted).\n\n                               IV.    Conclusion\n\n              After reviewing the record, we find that Rivera has\n\nfailed to demonstrate sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable\n\nfact-finder to conclude that his termination was a pretext for age\n\ndiscrimination.      The district court's decision is affirmed.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f",

If the\n\nemployer makes this showing, the presumption of discrimination\n\ndisappears, and the burden shifts back to the employee.           Id.   The\n\nplaintiff must then show, without resort to the presumption created\n\nby the prima facie case, that the employer's explanation is a\n\npretext for age discrimination.      Id.\n\n          A.    Legitimate, Non-discriminatory Reason\n\n          We assume arguendo that Rivera can establish a prima\n\nfacie case.      Metropol offers a legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nreason for discharging Rivera: Rivera assaulted and injured another\n\nemployee while at work.     Rivera had received a copy of Metropol's\n\nemployment     manual,   which   warns   that   an   employee's    attack,\n\naggression, assault, or threat of aggression against a supervisor\n\nor fellow employee justifies Metropol's immediate termination of\n\nthat employee.     Rivera's behavior violated Metropol's rules of\n\nconduct, and the restaurant took swift disciplinary action.             The\n\nrestaurant has met its burden of production and the ultimate burden\n\nnow rests with Rivera to prove his discharge was motivated by\n\ndiscriminatory animus.     See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.\n\n          B.    Evidence of Discrimination\n\n          Now that the burden has shifted back to Rivera, he must\n\ncome forward with sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable fact-\n\nfinder to conclude that his employer's stated reason for discharge\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwas a pretext for age discrimination.                      After considering his\n\narguments and reviewing the record, we find that he has not shown\n\nthat a genuine issue exists as to the reason for his termination.\n\n            First,      Rivera       asserts       that     the     pre-termination\n\ninvestigation was cursory -- evidenced by the fact that Rivera was\n\nnever allowed to explain his side of the story -- and therefore\n\nMetropol's reason for terminating him was pretextual.                      Metropol\n\nresponds that it determined, based on one interview and Nogueras'\n\nactual (and undisputed) injuries, that Rivera was the aggressor,\n\nand it sought to take swift action to deter further workplace\n\nviolence. Whether a termination decision was wise or done in haste\n\nis   irrelevant,       so   long    as   the    decision     was    not   made    with\n\ndiscriminatory animus.         Gray v. New Eng.

Rivera's bare assertion that Metropol's\n\nreason    for   terminating        him   was    pretext    is     insufficient:   the\n\nrestaurant's reason was compelling, and our thorough review of the\n\nrecord reveals that Rivera lacks any evidence that the real reason\n\nfor his termination was age discrimination.

Posadas de\n\nSan Juan Assocs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746213\"><a href=\"/opinion/746213/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-641-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45135-ivan-ruiz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[Plaintiff]\n\nmust do more than cast doubt on the rationale proffered by the\n\nemployer, . . . the evidence must be of such strength and quality\n\nas   to   permit   a    reasonable       finding    that    the    termination     was\n\nobviously or manifestly unsupported.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f            Second, Rivera contends Metropol discriminated against\n\nolder workers, sometimes referring to employees as \"imbéciles\" or\n\n\"corpses.\"       Such   \"stray    workplace     remarks\"    are   generally\n\ninsufficient, standing on their own, to establish discriminatory\n\nanimus.

The lack of a direct\n\nconnection    between    the     words    and   the   employment     action\n\nsignificantly weakens their probative value.          Schuster v.

Given Metropol's\n\ncompelling stated reason for Rivera's termination, these stray\n\nremarks do not permit the inference that the real reason for\n\nRivera's termination was age discrimination.               See Williams v.\n\nRaytheon Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199010\"><a href=\"/opinion/199010/williams-v-raytheon/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Rivera also offers the affidavit of a former employee who\n\nworked at Metropol for three years, beginning at age sixty, then\n\nleft and later sought re-employment at age sixty-three or sixty-\n\nfour.   The owner told him \"we are too old for this,\" and he was not\n\nrehired.    We do not think this evidence reveals age-based animus.\n\nThe owner's statement uses \"we,\" which is different than saying\n\n\"you are too old for the job;\" such ambiguity weakens Rivera's\n\nclaim that the statement reveals age animus.           See González, 304\n\nF.3d at 70.    Also, the fact the employee was hired for the first\n\ntime at age sixty demonstrates Metropol's willingness to have older\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\femployees on its staff.            Metropol introduced evidence that more\n\nthan two-thirds of its male employees are over forty-five. This is\n\nnot the hallmark of an employer who discriminates against older\n\nworkers.\n\n              Finally,    Rivera     alleges   that    other     employees    were\n\ninvolved in altercations at work but not fired.                Metropol counters\n\nthat some of those incidents were unknown to supervisors, and none\n\nof the other incidents resulted in personal injuries requiring\n\nmedical treatment.        After reviewing the record, we agree that the\n\nincidents proffered by Rivera are of a significantly less severe\n\nnature (a few punches without injury exchanged in one incident,\n\nobscene words and shoving in another, and a piece of silverware\n\nthrown   in    a   third);   therefore,      these    examples    fail   to   show\n\ndisparate treatment.         See Rodríguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198515\"><a href=\"/opinion/198515/rodriguez-cuervos-v-wal-mart/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[A] claim of disparate\n\ntreatment based on comparative evidence must rest on proof that the\n\nproposed analogue is similarly situated in all material respects.\")\n\n(quotation omitted).\n\n                               IV.    Conclusion\n\n              After reviewing the record, we find that Rivera has\n\nfailed to demonstrate sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable\n\nfact-finder to conclude that his termination was a pretext for age\n\ndiscrimination.      The district court's decision is affirmed.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f</pre>",
