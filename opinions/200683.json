Mary Ann Cohen, U.S. Tax Court Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Holly Ruocco on brief pro se.\n     Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney General, Laurie Snyder\nand Richard Farber, Attorneys, Tax Division, Department of Justice,\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 9, 2003\n\f     Per Curiam.      Petitioner Holly Ruocco appeals from a Tax Court\n\njudgment that dismissed her challenge to tax deficiencies for the\n\nyears 1996 and 1997.          Underlying the dispute is an income-tax-\n\navoidance scheme once exploited by a number of taxpayers, mostly in\n\nthe Arizona area.       This has given rise to a flurry of litigation,\n\nand the identical arguments now advanced by petitioner have been\n\nrepeatedly rejected--both by the Tax Court and, in a series of\n\nunpublished decisions, by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. See,\n\ne.g., Lehmann v. Commissioner, 2003 WL 21186558 (9th Cir. 2003)\n\n(mem.).    We affirm substantially for the reasons enumerated by the\n\nTax Court, adding only the following observations.\n\n     The    Tax    Court    dismissed     the   petition   here   for    lack    of\n\nprosecution, citing petitioner's refusal to engage in the fact-\n\nstipulation       process    and   her     failure   to    present      evidence.\n\nPetitioner's objections to this ruling prove unavailing.                        Her\n\nblanket claim of Fifth Amendment privilege did not justify her\n\ninaction.   See, e.g., Eicher v. United States, 774 F.2d 27, 29 (1st\n\nCir. 1985).       She is also mistaken in insisting that the burden of\n\nproof lay with respondent.         See, e.g., Delaney v. Commissioner, 99\n\nF.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1996).              \"The Commissioner's use of bank\n\ndeposits is an accepted methodology\" sufficient to \"support the\n\npresumption of correctness.\" Estate of Kanter v. Commissioner, 337\n\nF.3d 833, 859 (7th Cir.), petition for cert. filed, 72 U.S.L.W.\n\n3129 (U.S. Aug. 4, 2003) (No. 03-184); accord, e.g., Dodge v.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fCommissioner, 981 F.2d 350, 353-54 (8th Cir. 1992); Portillo v.\n\nCommissioner,      932     F.2d    1128,    1133-34       (5th    Cir.   1991).     And\n\npetitioner derives no benefit from Tax Court Rule 142(a)(1).                       See,\n\ne.g.,     Estate      of   Kanter,    337     F.3d    at    851-52.        Under    the\n\ncircumstances, the Tax Court acted well within its discretion in\n\ndismissing      for    want   of     prosecution.          See,    e.g.,   Larsen    v.\n\nCommissioner, 765 F.2d 939, 941 (9th Cir. 1985) (per curiam); Long\n\nv. Commissioner, 742 F.2d 1141, 1142-43 (8th Cir. 1984) (per\n\ncuriam); Miller v. Commissioner, 654 F.2d 519, 520-21 (8th Cir.\n\n1981) (per curiam); Tax Court Rules 123(b), 149(b).\n\n        There   was    similarly      no    abuse    of    discretion      in   denying\n\npetitioner's motion for recusal.                 See, e.g., Interex, Inc. v.\n\nCommissioner, 321 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n     We have considered petitioner's remaining arguments and find\n\nthem unpersuasive.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f",
