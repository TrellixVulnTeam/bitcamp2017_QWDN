Robert G.  Dellelo  challenges  the\n                     \n\ndismissal of  two related  petitions for  habeas corpus,  one\n\nbrought under 28 U.S.C.   2241, and the other under 28 U.S.C.\n\n  2254.1   The petitions were dismissed for  failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief  could be granted.  Petitioner also\n\nassigns  as error  the district  court's failure  to  hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing and denial of a motion for discovery.  We\n\naffirm the district court's judgments. \n\n          Most  of  the   relevant  procedural  history   was\n\nsummarized by the Massachusetts Appeals Court as follows:\n\n     The petitioner  is serving a  life sentence without\n     parole for first degree murder.  His conviction and\n\n     sentence have been  upheld by the Supreme  Judicial\n     Court.   Commonwealth  v. Dellelo,  349 Mass.  525,\n                                      \n\n     [209 N.E.2d 303]  (1965).  In 1974,  the petitioner\n     was also  sentenced by  the United States  District\n\n     Court in New Jersey to  a term of eighteen years in\n     Federal prison  for bank  robbery [committed  while\n\n     petitioner  was   an  escapee   from  Massachusetts\n     prison, which sentence  is] to  commence after  his\n\n     State   sentence   .   .  .   In   February,   1980\n     Massachusetts  prison  officials   transferred  the\n\n     petitioner  from  the   Massachusetts  Correctional\n\n                    \n\n1.  Petitioner is in a state prison serving a state sentence,\nbut he  alleges that due to a procedurally defective transfer\nto federal prison in 1980, the state lost jurisdiction of his\ncase, and he should be  viewed as currently serving a federal\nsentence.  See note 3 infra.  His claim arguably falls within\n                           \neither or both   2241 or   2254.  On petitioner's motion, the\ndistrict court  consolidated the petitions, a procedure which\nwe  think  makes  good  sense,  since  the  petitions  assert\nidentical facts and overlapping legal arguments.  \n\n                             -2-\n\n     Institution, Cedar Junction,  to the Federal bureau\n     of  prisons   in  Lewisburg,  Pennsylvania.     The\n\n     petitioner  was returned  to  the  custody  of  the\n     Massachusetts Department of Corrections on December\n\n     23, 1983.  On March  26, 1990, the petitioner filed\n     his initial habeas corpus petition [in state court]\n\n     which  was  dismissed  on  August  30,  1990.    On\n     November 15,  1990, he  filed a  second application\n\n     for a writ of habeas corpus [also  in state court].\n     In both proceedings,  the petitioner contended that\n\n     at the time  of his transfer to  the Federal prison\n     in Lewisburg,  in February, 1980,  there existed no\n\n     valid    contract    between    the   Massachusetts\n     Commissioner  of Correction  and the  United States\n\n     Attorney  General  authorizing   a  transfer.    He\n     therefore alleged  that under  18 U.S.C.    5003(a)\n\n     and  [M.] G.L.  c.  127,    97A,  his transfer  was\n     unlawful and the Commonwealth had lost jurisdiction\n\n     over  his  person  and  sentence.    He   requested\n     immediate  release   to  the  custody   of  Federal\n\n     authorities.  \n     . . .\n\n     The initial petition was  dismissed after a hearing\n     and  [the state  court judge  dismissed  the second\n\n     petition because]  there was  no  showing that  the\n     ends  of justice  required  another hearing  on the\n\n     same issue.   \nDellelo  v. Superintendent,  Old Colony  Correctional Center,\n                                                            \n\nNo. 91-P-524, slip. op. at 1-2 (Mass. App. Ct. Nov. 12, 1991)\n(footnote  omitted).2     The  Massachusetts   Appeals  Court\n\n                    \n\n2.  In addition to  the crimes mentioned in the  quoted text,\npetitioner has also been convicted in state court of unlawful\nescape on two  occasions, and the following  crimes committed\nduring   his  escapes:    unlawful  carrying  of  a  firearm;\n\n                             -3-\n\naffirmed  the  superior   court's  dismissal,  and  Dellelo's\n\napplication  for further  review was  denied  by the  Supreme\n\nJudicial  Court.    Dellelo  v.  Superintendent,  Old  Colony\n                                                             \n\nCorrectional  Ctr., 411  Mass.  1105,  1106,  586  N.E.2d  10\n                  \n\n(1991). \n\n          The  premise of the instant habeas petitions is the\n\nsame as that rejected by the state courts.  Petitioner argues\n\nthat  his  1980-83  transfer to  federal  prison  was invalid\n\nbecause the contract between the state and federal government\n\nauthorizing  such transfers was  not signed by  a person whom\n\npetitioner  considers  a  \"proper\"  state  official  under 18\n\nU.S.C.    5003(a).3    The  federal  statute  authorizes  the\n\nAttorney General  to contract  with \"proper  officials\" of  a\n\nstate for  the  custody  and  care of  persons  convicted  of\n\ncriminal  offenses  in  state   courts.    The  corresponding\n\n                    \n\nkidnapping; larceny from a person; and unlawful carrying of a\nfirearm.  Sentences for these crimes run \"from and after\" his\nlife  sentence.    In  federal  court,  petitioner  was  also\nconvicted  of  use  of  a  firearm during  the  bank  robbery\nmentioned in the text.  \n\n3.  From this premise, petitioner further reasons as follows:\nthe Commonwealth lost  jurisdiction over  petitioner when  it\ntransferred  him (illegally) to federal prison; he thus began\nto serve  his federal sentence  at the time of  the transfer;\nsince  a  federal  sentence cannot  be  served  piecemeal, he\ncontinued  to serve  that sentence  when he  was returned  to\nstate prison and, having now served 12 of the 18 years on his\nfederal sentence without a parole hearing, he is  entitled to\nimmediate release  from the  federal sentence.   We need  not\nreach each turn in petitioner's reasoning since we reject his\nstarting premise. \n\n                             -4-\n\nMassachusetts   statute   authorizes  the   commissioner   of\n\ncorrections to enter into such contracts with the approval of\n\nthe  governor.   M.G.L.  c.  127,     97A.   Petitioner  sees\n\nillegality in the fact that William Hogan, the person serving\n\nas  commissioner of corrections  on the date  of petitioner's\n\ntransfer, never signed such a contract.  Respondent prevailed\n\nin state court on a showing that petitioner's transfer was in\n\naccordance with a contract  authorizing such transfers signed\n\nby Commissioner Hogan's predecessor in 1973. \n\n          The contract's existence,  genuineness, scope, term\n\nand coverage, as  well as the parties'  contracting authority\n\nare largely questions of historical fact.  The state  court's\n\ndetermination  of these matters is entitled to a \"presumption\n\nof  correctness\" on  a  petition for  habeas corpus  under 28\n\nU.S.C.   2254(d).   See Marshall v. Lonberger,  459 U.S. 422,\n                                             \n\n432  (1983);   Sumner v.  Mata,  455 U.S.  591 (1982)  (state\n                              \n\ncourts' factual findings are  entitled to a \"high measure  of\n\ndeference\" unless  the findings  lack \"fair  support\" in  the\n\nrecord).  \n\n          Section  2254  provides  that  in  the  absence  of\n\nenumerated  circumstances  making  a  hearing mandatory,  the\n\nfederal  court is  bound  by the  state  court's findings  of\n\nhistorical fact,  unless  the  petitioner  offers  convincing\n\nevidence  that  the findings  are  erroneous.   This  rule is\n\nconsistent with Townsend v. Sain,  372 U.S. 293, 312  (1963).\n                                \n\n                             -5-\n\nSee Leavitt  v. Howard, 462  F.2d 992, 995 (1st  Cir.), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  409 U.S.  884 (1972).   We  have reviewed  the state\n      \n\ncourt record and  we agree with the district  court that none\n\nof  the enumerated  circumstances are  present.4   The  state\n\ncourt had  before it all  the facts, including copies  of all\n\nrelevant   contracts   and   their   terms,  petitioner   was\n\nrepresented there by counsel, and the court's  hearing was as\n\nfull as necessary, fair, and adequate to resolve these issues\n\nof contractual interpretation.   Petitioner  offered in  this\n\nproceeding  no reason to  suppose that he  could overcome, by\n\nconvincing evidence, the presumption imposed  by   2254.  See\n                                                             \n\nLeavitt, 462 F.2d at 995.      \n       \n\n          Insofar as this  contract issue may be  viewed as a\n\nmixed question  of fact and  law, petitioner offers  no legal\n\nauthority  nor reasoned argument  in support of  his unlikely\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  district  court's  dismissal,  styled  as   one  for\n\"failure to  state a claim\" was in  accordance with Rule 8 of\nthe Rules Governing    2254 cases, which states  that when an\nevidentiary  hearing is not  required, \"the judge  shall make\nsuch disposition of  the petition as justice  shall require.\"\nUnder Rule  11 the district  court has discretion to  use the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure in appropriate cases.  Under\nthe  latter  rules   the  dismissal  might  also   have  been\ncharacterized  as  a  summary judgment  since  the  court had\nbefore  it, in addition to the parties' pleadings, voluminous\nexhibits which  constituted virtually the entire  state court\nrecord.   See  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.  12(c), 56.    Whatever  the\n             \nnomenclature, however, we  are convinced that petitioner  was\nafforded a reasonable and  meaningful opportunity to  present\nall pertinent evidence  and the result, dismissal  without an\nevidentiary hearing, was correct. \n\n                             -6-\n\npremise.5   In  any event,  we  agree with  the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court's alternative  holding that \"even assuming  the\n\nabsence  of  a valid  contract  at the  time  of petitioner's\n\ntransfer . . . which we do not conclude, the petitioner['s] .\n\n. .  only remedy  for an  improper transfer  was a  return to\n\nstate prison, which has already been effected.\"  Dellelo, No.\n                                                        \n\n91-P-524, slip op. at 4.   This result is supported  by state\n\ncases  and   analogous  federal  case  law.    See  Blake  v.\n                                                         \n\nCommissioner  of Correction, 390  Mass. 537, 538,  457 N.E.2d\n                           \n\n281  (1983)  (prisoners  improperly  transferred  to  federal\n\ncorrectional facility were properly ordered returned to state\n\nfacilities); Ladetto v.

Although petitioner appears pro se, he was represented by\n                                      \ncounsel in  the state  court.  A  perusal of  counsel's state\ncourt  memoranda and all the  papers filed below also reveals\nno legal authority or other support for this unusual premise,\nand we know of none.\n\n                             -7-\n\n          There is  no merit to petitioner's  contention that\n\nthe state lost jurisdiction when it transferred petitioner to\n\na federal prison.   The statutes  under which petitioner  was\n\ntransferred expressly  presuppose the continuing  vitality of\n\nthe state  sentence.  M.G.L.  c. 127,   97A  (transferees are\n\nsubject to the  terms of their original sentences  and to the\n\nprovisions  of law  governing discharge);  see  also Howe  v.\n                                                         \n\nSmith, 452 U.S. 473, 484 (1981)  (purpose of 18 U.S.C.   5003\n     \n\nauthorizing   transfer arrangements  is to  help states  with\n\ninsufficient  correctional facilities  by providing  space in\n\nexchange  for  reimbursement  by state  for  care  of state's\n\nprisoners);  Schertz v.

Petitioner's reliance  on cases\n\nsuch  as Shields v. Beto, 370  F.2d 1003 (5th Cir. 1967), and\n                        \n\nThompson v.

The present case does not\n      \n\ninvolve   extradition,  a   waiver,   nor  any   circumstance\n\nsuggesting a relinquishment by the state of its authority  to\n\nexact the sentence imposed by its courts.  Cf., e.g., Venable\n                                                             \n\nv. Thornburgh,  766 F.  Supp. 1012 (D.

The district court did  not abuse its\n\ndiscretion  in denying  petitioner's motion for  discovery in\n\nlight of  the full state  court record  and the  lack of  any\n\nlegal basis for petitioner's claim.   And the district  court\n\ndid not  err in  dismissing petitioner's  claim  that he  was\n\ndenied due process  or equal  protection because  he was  not\n\nafforded a state  administrative hearing prior to  the prison\n\ntransfer.    Whatever the merit of  that argument, petitioner\n\ndid not assert  it in his state court  petitions, although he\n\nhad every opportunity to do  so.  \"The exhaustion requirement\n\nis not satisfied if petitioner presents new legal theories or\n\nnew factual allegations  in federal court that  transform his\n\ncase or  cast it in  a wholly  different light.\"   Carillo v.\n                                                          \n\nBrown,  807  F.2d  1094 (1st  Cir.  1986)  (citing  Picard v.\n                                                          \n\nConnor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971)).\n      \n\n          Accordingly, we deny the petition for a certificate\n                              \n\nof probable cause  to appeal the dismissal under  28 U.S.C.  \n\n2254, and we affirm the judgment of district court dismissing\n                   \n\nthe petition under 28 U.S.C.   2241.\n\n                             -9-\n",

In 1974,  the petitioner\n     was also  sentenced by  the United States  District\n\n     Court in New Jersey to  a term of eighteen years in\n     Federal prison  for bank  robbery [committed  while\n\n     petitioner  was   an  escapee   from  Massachusetts\n     prison, which sentence  is] to  commence after  his\n\n     State   sentence   .   .  .   In   February,   1980\n     Massachusetts  prison  officials   transferred  the\n\n     petitioner  from  the   Massachusetts  Correctional\n\n                    \n\n1.  Petitioner is in a state prison serving a state sentence,\nbut he  alleges that due to a procedurally defective transfer\nto federal prison in 1980, the state lost jurisdiction of his\ncase, and he should be  viewed as currently serving a federal\nsentence.  See note 3 infra.  His claim arguably falls within\n                           \neither or both   2241 or   2254.  On petitioner's motion, the\ndistrict court  consolidated the petitions, a procedure which\nwe  think  makes  good  sense,  since  the  petitions  assert\nidentical facts and overlapping legal arguments.  \n\n                             -2-\n\n     Institution, Cedar Junction,  to the Federal bureau\n     of  prisons   in  Lewisburg,  Pennsylvania.     The\n\n     petitioner  was returned  to  the  custody  of  the\n     Massachusetts Department of Corrections on December\n\n     23, 1983.  On March  26, 1990, the petitioner filed\n     his initial habeas corpus petition [in state court]\n\n     which  was  dismissed  on  August  30,  1990.    On\n     November 15,  1990, he  filed a  second application\n\n     for a writ of habeas corpus [also  in state court].\n     In both proceedings,  the petitioner contended that\n\n     at the time  of his transfer to  the Federal prison\n     in Lewisburg,  in February, 1980,  there existed no\n\n     valid    contract    between    the   Massachusetts\n     Commissioner  of Correction  and the  United States\n\n     Attorney  General  authorizing   a  transfer.    He\n     therefore alleged  that under  18 U.S.C.    5003(a)\n\n     and  [M.] G.L.  c.  127,    97A,  his transfer  was\n     unlawful and the Commonwealth had lost jurisdiction\n\n     over  his  person  and  sentence.    He   requested\n     immediate  release   to  the  custody   of  Federal\n\n     authorities.  \n     . . .\n\n     The initial petition was  dismissed after a hearing\n     and  [the state  court judge  dismissed  the second\n\n     petition because]  there was  no  showing that  the\n     ends  of justice  required  another hearing  on the\n\n     same issue.   \nDellelo  v.

Petitioner argues\n\nthat  his  1980-83  transfer to  federal  prison  was invalid\n\nbecause the contract between the state and federal government\n\nauthorizing  such transfers was  not signed by  a person whom\n\npetitioner  considers  a  \"proper\"  state  official  under 18\n\nU.S.C.    5003(a).3    The  federal  statute  authorizes  the\n\nAttorney General  to contract  with \"proper  officials\" of  a\n\nstate for  the  custody  and  care of  persons  convicted  of\n\ncriminal  offenses  in  state   courts.    The  corresponding\n\n                    \n\nkidnapping; larceny from a person; and unlawful carrying of a\nfirearm.  Sentences for these crimes run \"from and after\" his\nlife  sentence.    In  federal  court,  petitioner  was  also\nconvicted  of  use  of  a  firearm during  the  bank  robbery\nmentioned in the text.  \n\n3.  From this premise, petitioner further reasons as follows:\nthe Commonwealth lost  jurisdiction over  petitioner when  it\ntransferred  him (illegally) to federal prison; he thus began\nto serve  his federal sentence  at the time of  the transfer;\nsince  a  federal  sentence cannot  be  served  piecemeal, he\ncontinued  to serve  that sentence  when he  was returned  to\nstate prison and, having now served 12 of the 18 years on his\nfederal sentence without a parole hearing, he is  entitled to\nimmediate release  from the  federal sentence.   We need  not\nreach each turn in petitioner's reasoning since we reject his\nstarting premise. \n\n                             -4-\n\nMassachusetts   statute   authorizes  the   commissioner   of\n\ncorrections to enter into such contracts with the approval of\n\nthe  governor.   M.G.L.  c.  127,     97A.   Petitioner  sees\n\nillegality in the fact that William Hogan, the person serving\n\nas  commissioner of corrections  on the date  of petitioner's\n\ntransfer, never signed such a contract.  Respondent prevailed\n\nin state court on a showing that petitioner's transfer was in\n\naccordance with a contract  authorizing such transfers signed\n\nby Commissioner Hogan's predecessor in 1973. \n\n          The contract's existence,  genuineness, scope, term\n\nand coverage, as  well as the parties'  contracting authority\n\nare largely questions of historical fact.  The state  court's\n\ndetermination  of these matters is entitled to a \"presumption\n\nof  correctness\" on  a  petition for  habeas corpus  under 28\n\nU.S.C.   2254(d).   See Marshall v.

We  have reviewed  the state\n      \n\ncourt record and  we agree with the district  court that none\n\nof  the enumerated  circumstances are  present.4   The  state\n\ncourt had  before it all  the facts, including copies  of all\n\nrelevant   contracts   and   their   terms,  petitioner   was\n\nrepresented there by counsel, and the court's  hearing was as\n\nfull as necessary, fair, and adequate to resolve these issues\n\nof contractual interpretation.   Petitioner  offered in  this\n\nproceeding  no reason to  suppose that he  could overcome, by\n\nconvincing evidence, the presumption imposed  by   2254.  See\n                                                             \n\nLeavitt, 462 F.2d at 995.      \n       \n\n          Insofar as this  contract issue may be  viewed as a\n\nmixed question  of fact and  law, petitioner offers  no legal\n\nauthority  nor reasoned argument  in support of  his unlikely\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  district  court's  dismissal,  styled  as   one  for\n\"failure to  state a claim\" was in  accordance with Rule 8 of\nthe Rules Governing    2254 cases, which states  that when an\nevidentiary  hearing is not  required, \"the judge  shall make\nsuch disposition of  the petition as justice  shall require.\"\nUnder Rule  11 the district  court has discretion to  use the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure in appropriate cases.  Under\nthe  latter  rules   the  dismissal  might  also   have  been\ncharacterized  as  a  summary judgment  since  the  court had\nbefore  it, in addition to the parties' pleadings, voluminous\nexhibits which  constituted virtually the entire  state court\nrecord.   See  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.  12(c), 56.    Whatever  the\n             \nnomenclature, however, we  are convinced that petitioner  was\nafforded a reasonable and  meaningful opportunity to  present\nall pertinent evidence  and the result, dismissal  without an\nevidentiary hearing, was correct. \n\n                             -6-\n\npremise.5   In  any event,  we  agree with  the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court's alternative  holding that \"even assuming  the\n\nabsence  of  a valid  contract  at the  time  of petitioner's\n\ntransfer . . . which we do not conclude, the petitioner['s] .\n\n. .  only remedy  for an  improper transfer  was a  return to\n\nstate prison, which has already been effected.\"  Dellelo, No.\n                                                        \n\n91-P-524, slip op. at 4.

The district court did  not abuse its\n\ndiscretion  in denying  petitioner's motion for  discovery in\n\nlight of  the full state  court record  and the  lack of  any\n\nlegal basis for petitioner's claim.   And the district  court\n\ndid not  err in  dismissing petitioner's  claim  that he  was\n\ndenied due process  or equal  protection because  he was  not\n\nafforded a state  administrative hearing prior to  the prison\n\ntransfer.    Whatever the merit of  that argument, petitioner\n\ndid not assert  it in his state court  petitions, although he\n\nhad every opportunity to do  so.  \"The exhaustion requirement\n\nis not satisfied if petitioner presents new legal theories or\n\nnew factual allegations  in federal court that  transform his\n\ncase or  cast it in  a wholly  different light.\"   Carillo v.\n                                                          \n\nBrown,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480734\"><a href=\"/opinion/480734/john-carillo-v-john-n-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st  Cir.  1986)  (citing  Picard v.\n                                                          \n\nConnor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108417\"><a href=\"/opinion/108417/picard-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275 (1971)).\n      \n\n          Accordingly, we deny the petition for a certificate\n                              \n\nof probable cause  to appeal the dismissal under  28 U.S.C.  \n\n2254, and we affirm the judgment of district court dismissing\n                   \n\nthe petition under 28 U.S.C.   2241.\n\n                             -9-\n</pre>",
