Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Lipez, Selya and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Edmund F. Broadley III on brief pro se.\n     William A. Hardman III on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n                            December 10, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam. We affirm the judgment substantially for the\n\nreasons     enumerated       in     the      magistrate-judge's            Report    and\n\nRecommendation dated February 25, 2008, which the district judge\n\nadopted in a March 10, 2008 Memorandum and Order.                    We add only the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n            This pro se appeal involves a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action\n\nprompted by events occurring in state court.                      A company owned by\n\nplaintiff       Broadley   brought        suit    there    against    an    individual\n\nrepresented       by    defendant    Hardman,       a     Rhode    Island    attorney.\n\nPlaintiff       subsequently      filed    this    federal    action       against   the\n\nattorney directly, complaining of interference with plaintiff's\n\nlegal representation and abuse of the deposition process.                       To set\n\nforth   a   §    1983   claim,     one    must    allege    \"interference      with    a\n\nconstitutionally-protected right\" by someone \"acting under color of\n\nstate law.\"       Malachowski v. City of Keene, 787 F.2d 704, 710 (1st\n\nCir. 1986) (per curiam). Applying Estades-Negroni v. CPC Hosp. San\n\nJuan Capestrano, 412 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2005), and related cases, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed on the ground that state action had not\n\nbeen established.\n\n            In disputing this finding, plaintiff points to the fact\n\nthat defendant issued a subpoena in the name of the state of Rhode\n\nIsland commanding him to appear at a pretrial deposition. We agree\n\nwith the district court that defendant's use of this procedural\n\ndevice did not transform him into a state actor, at least absent\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fany allegation that state officials were used to enforce the\n\nprocess.   See, e.g., Hahn v. Star Bank, 190 F.3d 708, 717 (6th Cir.\n\n1999) (disavowing contrary holding in Timson v. Weiner, 395 F.\n\nSupp. 1344 (S.D. Ohio 1975)); Angelico v. Lehigh Valley Hosp.,\n\nInc., 184 F.3d 268, 278 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that \"an attorney\n\ndoes not become a state actor simply by employing the state's\n\nsubpoena laws\"; distinguishing between \"resorting to an available\n\nstate procedure and actually using state officials to enforce or\n\ncarry out that procedure\"); Barnard v. Young, 720 F.2d 1188, 1189\n\n(10th Cir. 1983) (\"If an attorney does not become a state actor\n\nmerely by virtue of instigating state court litigation, [citing\n\nLugar v. Edmonson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 939 n.21 (1982)], then the\n\nattorney does not become a state actor merely by employing state\n\nauthorized subpoena power.\").   Plaintiff has offered no meaningful\n\nrebuttal to this line of authority.\n\n           The fact that defendant signed and issued the subpoena in\n\nhis capacity as a notary public does not call for a different\n\nresult.1   Had the subpoena been obtained from the clerk of court,\n\nthe above-cited cases demonstrate that state action would be\n\n\n\n     1\n        Rhode Island law provides that a subpoena may be issued by\n\"the clerk of court or a notary public or other officer authorized\nby statute.\" Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(1)(A); see also R.I. Gen.\nLaws § 9-17-3. Notaries public are appointed by the governor for\nfour-year terms, see id. § 42-30-3, and members of the Rhode Island\nbar automatically qualify for appointment upon application, see id.\n§ 42-30-5(c). We take judicial notice of these provisions. Lamar\nv. Micou, 114 U.S. 218, 223 (1885).\n\n                                -3-\n\fabsent.2         The outcome cannot differ just because a notary public is\n\ninstead used.         By itself, the issuance of a subpoena, whether by a\n\ncourt clerk or a notary public, lacks \"consequences significant\n\nenough\" to amount to state action.               Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild,\n\nO'Brien & Frankel, 20 F.3d 1250, 1255 (3d Cir. 1994).               It \"does not\n\nrise to the level of a significant contribution of the state,\" but\n\nrather is \"one step removed.\"           Bochetto v. Labrum & Doak, L.L.P.,\n\n1997 WL 560191, at *5 (E.D. Pa. 1997).                Indeed, it is noteworthy\n\nthat       the     \"mere   invocation   of    state    legal     procedures\"   is\n\ninsufficient to create state action, Lugar, 457 U.S. at 939 n.21;\n\naccord, e.g., Casa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court, 988 F.2d 252, 259\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (\"something more than mere resort to a state court\n\nis required\"), even though such \"invocation\" normally entails the\n\ninvolvement of state court personnel.\n\n                 Plaintiff's   remaining      arguments    can    be   summarily\n\ndispatched. The fact that defendant was not serving as plaintiff's\n\ncounsel has no particular relevance to the state action inquiry.\n\nPlaintiff's reliance on Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403\n\nU.S. 388 (1971), is misplaced, since Bivens actions can only be\n\nbrought against \"federal agent[s] acting under color of federal\n\nlaw.\"      DeMayo v. Nugent, 517 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2008).            We also\n\n\n\n       2\n       In Pennsylvania, for example, only a clerk of court (called\na \"prothonotary\") can issue a subpoena.      See Pa. R. Civ. P.\n234.2(a).   Yet the Third Circuit in Angelico found that such\nprocess entailed no state action.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fnote that, contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the district court\n\nmade no finding that he had alleged sufficient facts to establish\n\nthe deprivation of a federal right; the court simply did not\n\naddress that prong of the § 1983 inquiry.   Dismissal likely could\n\nhave been predicated on this alternative ground as well--it is\n\ndifficult to detect any constitutional violation based on the facts\n\nalleged--but that matter need not be explored since the lack of\n\nstate action provides an adequate basis for decision.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
