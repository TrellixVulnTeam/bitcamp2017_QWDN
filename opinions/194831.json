See Fed.\r                                                                      \n\nR. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).\n\nA.   The Supporting Affidavit.\r          A.   The Supporting Affidavit\r                                       \n\n          The search warrant was issued by a state court judge on\n\nthe  strength of  the affidavit  of Agent  Winston McGill  of the\n\nMaine  Bureau of Intergovernmental Drug Enforcement.  The affida-\n\nvit  related in  great detail  two  controlled marijuana  \"buys,\"\n\nwithin the preceding ten days, from one Donald Moyse, a convicted\n\n                                2\r\n\ndrug  offender,  by  a confidential  informant  acting  under the\n\ndirect control and surveillance of Agent McGill.  McGill attested\n\nthat the confidential informant  previously had provided reliable\n\ntips and  had  cooperated with  local authorities  in other  con-\n\ntrolled  marijuana \"buys.\"   The  affidavit  related that  Donald\n\nMoyse told the confidential informant that the marijuana involved\n\nin both controlled  \"buys\" had come from Jordan's  residence, and\n\nthat  both \"buys\"  had  been conducted  in  essentially the  same\n\nmanner:   the confidential  informant  would meet  with one  Cary\n\nLaFrance  at a  local rest  stop area  and turn  over the  agreed\n\npurchase price (supplied by Agent McGill).  LaFrance  would drive\n\nto Donald  Moyse's residence,  and the two  would proceed  to the\n\nJordan residence where the marijuana was kept.  Moyse and LaFran-\n\nce would  then meet  with  the informant  at a  local school  and\n\ndeliver the marijuana.\n\n          On  the  occasion  of  each  controlled  \"buy,\"  McGill\n\nsearched the  confidential informant  for contraband  immediately\n\nprior to providing the purchase money; prior to the second \"buy,\"\n\nhe searched the informant's vehicle as well.  McGill then survei-\n\nlled  the  unfolding  transaction,  observing  as  the  informant\n\ndelivered  the \"buy\"  money to  LaFrance,  following LaFrance  to\n\nMoyse's house, and watching LaFrance and Moyse  as they proceeded\n\nto  Jordan's residence,  then to the  local school.   In each in-\n\nstance,  McGill's affidavit  attests, the  informant told  McGill\n\nthat the  marijuana had  been  turned over  to him  by Moyse  and\n\nLaFrance at the  school and that it had  been obtained, according\n\n                                3\r\n\nto Moyse, at Jordan's residence.  Following the second \"buy,\" the\n\ninformant  told McGill  that Moyse  had stated  that there  was a\n\n\"large quantity\" of  marijuana at the Jordan residence.  Finally,\n\nthe affidavit represented  that urinalysis conducted while  Moyse\n\nwas  on  probation  occasionally  revealed  positive results  for\n\nmarijuana use.\n\nB.   The District Court Decision.\r          B.   The District Court Decision.\r                                          \n\n          Contrary to Jordan's contention on appeal, the district\n\ncourt's \"grave reservations as to the sufficiency of the probable\n\ncause showing\" did not  amount to a finding that the  warrant was\n\nnot  based on  probable cause.    \"Grave reservations\"  do not  a\n\nruling make.   Rather,  the district  court plainly  bypassed any\n\n\"probable cause\"  ruling in  favor of  its functionally  distinct\n\nreliance on the \"good faith\"  exception to the exclusionary rule.\n\nIn addition, we agree with the government that the McGill affida-\n\nvit made a sufficient showing of probable cause.1\n\nC.

Probable Cause.\r                             \n\n          We must  accord  the issuing  judge's \"probable  cause\"\n\ndetermination \"great  deference,\" United States  v. Scalia,  slip\r                                                                    \n\nop.  No. 93-1018  at 4  (1st Cir.

See United States v. Caggiano, 899 F.2d 99, 102 (1st Cir.\r                                               \n\n1990) (citing Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39).  The \"fair probability\"\r                             \n\nthreshold  does not  require a  prima  facie showing  of criminal\n\nactivity.   Ciampa, 793  F.2d at  22 (citing  Gates, 462  U.S. at\r                                                             \n\n235).\n\n          Jordan makes a spirited attack on the McGill affidavit:\n\nneither  McGill nor  the  informant had  any direct  contact with\n\nJordan, nor  directly observed  any drug buy  or transfer  at the\n\nJordan residence; Moyse's representations that the marijuana came\n\nfrom Jordan's  home are \"double hearsay\"; Moyse, a marijuana user\n\nand convicted drug offender, was not a reliable hearsay declarant\n\nand, finally,  the affidavit  did not demonstrate  a \"fair  prob-\n\nability\" that marijuana  or related contraband would  be found at\n\nthe  Jordan residence  since  the  marijuana  Moyse sold  to  the\n\ninformant could  have come from  LaFrance, Moyse, the  school, or\n\nJordan's residence.\n\n          We  agree that nothing in the McGill affidavit excluded\n\nthe possibility that the marijuana  may have come from some place\n\nother  than  the  Jordan residence.

See,\r                                                                          \n\ne.g., Scalia,  slip op. at 2,  3; Ciampa, 793 F.2d at  24.  Their\r                                                  \n\nreliability may  be  corroborated  by  various  means,  including\n\ndirect surveillance  or circumstantial evidence, or vouchsafed by\n\nthe affiant    in this  case a highly experienced law enforcement\n\nofficer.   See, e.g., Scalia, slip  op. at 6-8.   McGill attested\r                                      \n\nthat the confidential informant had provided reliable information\n\nand investigative assistance to the police in the past, which may\n\nhave  been sufficient in  itself to establish  the reliability of\n\nthe informant's  hearsay statements.  See, e.g., Ciampa, 793 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\nat  24 (hearsay  conveyed by  \"proven  reliable informant\");  cf.\r                                                                           \n\nUnited States  v. Campbell, 732  F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st  Cir. 1984)\r                                    \n\n(double  hearsay  unacceptable  basis for  probable  cause  where\n\nneither  informant nor confidential contact had dealt with police\r                                \n\nin the past).  Moreover, McGill also attested  that (i) Moyse was\n\nan  unwitting participant  in  the  controlled  \"buy,\"  and  (ii)\n\nunbeknownst to Moyse, McGill observed Moyse's entrance to Jordan-\n\n's residence on  both occasions, thereby establishing  that Moyse\n\nwas in  a position to know  whether Jordan kept  marijuana at his\n\nresidence.  See Ciampa, 793 F.2d at 24.\r                                \n\n          Finally,   McGill   contemporaneously   surveilled  all\n\nconspicuous steps taken in the  course of both controlled \"buys,\"\n\n                                6\r\n\nwhich  proceeded exactly as  foretold by the  confidential infor-\n\nmant,  and included  stops  at  Jordan's home,  the  site of  the\n\nsearch.  Thus, independent corroboration lent further credence to\n\nthe confidential informant's  statements (i.e.,  the location  of\r                                                        \n\nthe marijuana).

But given the exper-\n\nience and training  of the affiant, the  confidential informant's\n\nproven  reliability, and the corroboration of the informant's and\n\nMoyse's hearsay reports  by means of direct  police surveillance,\n\nthe  issuing judge  was not  required to  credit the  speculative\n\npossibility that the marijuana might have been obtained elsewhere\n\nalong the drug route than Jordan's residence.

Viewed  in their\n\ntotality, therefore,  the circumstances related in the supporting\n\naffidavit, together with reasonable inferences therefrom, provid-\n\ned a  \"substantial basis\"  for the  issuing judge's  common-sense\n\ndetermination that  there was  a fair  probability that  Jordan's\n\n                                7\r\n\nhome contained contraband or evidence  of a crime.

The Supporting Affidavit\r                                       \n\n          The search warrant was issued by a state court judge on\n\nthe  strength of  the affidavit  of Agent  Winston McGill  of the\n\nMaine  Bureau of Intergovernmental Drug Enforcement.  The affida-\n\nvit  related in  great detail  two  controlled marijuana  \"buys,\"\n\nwithin the preceding ten days, from one Donald Moyse, a convicted\n\n                                2\r\n\ndrug  offender,  by  a confidential  informant  acting  under the\n\ndirect control and surveillance of Agent McGill.  McGill attested\n\nthat the confidential informant  previously had provided reliable\n\ntips and  had  cooperated with  local authorities  in other  con-\n\ntrolled  marijuana \"buys.\"   The  affidavit  related that  Donald\n\nMoyse told the confidential informant that the marijuana involved\n\nin both controlled  \"buys\" had come from Jordan's  residence, and\n\nthat  both \"buys\"  had  been conducted  in  essentially the  same\n\nmanner:   the confidential  informant  would meet  with one  Cary\n\nLaFrance  at a  local rest  stop area  and turn  over the  agreed\n\npurchase price (supplied by Agent McGill).  LaFrance  would drive\n\nto Donald  Moyse's residence,  and the two  would proceed  to the\n\nJordan residence where the marijuana was kept.  Moyse and LaFran-\n\nce would  then meet  with  the informant  at a  local school  and\n\ndeliver the marijuana.\n\n          On  the  occasion  of  each  controlled  \"buy,\"  McGill\n\nsearched the  confidential informant  for contraband  immediately\n\nprior to providing the purchase money; prior to the second \"buy,\"\n\nhe searched the informant's vehicle as well.  McGill then survei-\n\nlled  the  unfolding  transaction,  observing  as  the  informant\n\ndelivered  the \"buy\"  money to  LaFrance,  following LaFrance  to\n\nMoyse's house, and watching LaFrance and Moyse  as they proceeded\n\nto  Jordan's residence,  then to the  local school.   In each in-\n\nstance,  McGill's affidavit  attests, the  informant told  McGill\n\nthat the  marijuana had  been  turned over  to him  by Moyse  and\n\nLaFrance at the  school and that it had  been obtained, according\n\n                                3\r\n\nto Moyse, at Jordan's residence.  Following the second \"buy,\" the\n\ninformant  told McGill  that Moyse  had stated  that there  was a\n\n\"large quantity\" of  marijuana at the Jordan residence.  Finally,\n\nthe affidavit represented  that urinalysis conducted while  Moyse\n\nwas  on  probation  occasionally  revealed  positive results  for\n\nmarijuana use.\n\nB.

The District Court Decision.\r                                          \n\n          Contrary to Jordan's contention on appeal, the district\n\ncourt's \"grave reservations as to the sufficiency of the probable\n\ncause showing\" did not  amount to a finding that the  warrant was\n\nnot  based on  probable cause.    \"Grave reservations\"  do not  a\n\nruling make.   Rather,  the district  court plainly  bypassed any\n\n\"probable cause\"  ruling in  favor of  its functionally  distinct\n\nreliance on the \"good faith\"  exception to the exclusionary rule.\n\nIn addition, we agree with the government that the McGill affida-\n\nvit made a sufficient showing of probable cause.1\n\nC.
