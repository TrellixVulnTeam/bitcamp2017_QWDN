Hansen, with whom Willey Law Offices was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                 July 7, 2004\n\f              Per Curiam.         David Bennett appeals his convictions and\n\nensuing sentence for (1) \"travel[ing] in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce . . . with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or\n\nintimidate another person [with the result of] plac[ing] that\n\nperson    in       reasonable         fear   of    [death]    or    serious   bodily\n\ninjury    .    .   .    .\";     and   (2)    \"ship[ping]     or   transport[ing]    in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce . . . any firearm or ammunition\n\n[after having been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of\n\ndomestic violence].\"             18 U.S.C. §§ 2261A(1) and 922(g)(9).               We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n              Bennett was a frequent user of methamphetamine who often\n\naccused his wife of infidelity.                    In January 2002, Bennett was\n\nconvicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence against his\n\nwife. Following this incident, Bennett's wife –- fearing Bennett's\n\nrelease   from         prison    –-   gathered     the   children    and   fled   from\n\nCalifornia to a relative's home in Maine.                     On January 24, 2002,\n\nBennett was released from prison on the condition that he have no\n\ncontact with his wife. Three days later, Bennett's wife phoned him\n\nto tell him that she and the children had left for (and arrived\n\nsafely in) Maine.             During the course of this conversation, she\n\nprovided Bennett with the address of her current location. Bennett\n\nthereafter wired money so that his wife could rent an apartment.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f          On January 29th, Bennett's wife obtained a protection\n\norder   from      the   Maine     courts.          In    a   subsequent       telephone\n\nconversation -- Bennett apparently repeatedly phoned his wife –-\n\nBennett's wife told Bennett to stay out of Maine because the\n\nmarriage was finished.            Despite this admonition, Bennett left\n\nCalifornia for Maine on or about February 8th after having told two\n\nfriends that he planned to save his marriage.                   On the way, Bennett\n\nstopped in Utah to visit his father and acquired his father's\n\nhandgun on the pretext that he needed protection.                         Bennett then\n\ntraveled across the country with the gun.                       Bennett's wife was\n\nnotified of these events by Bennett's sister.\n\n             On   the   night    that     Bennett       arrived      in   Maine,    state\n\ntroopers observed       him     driving     past    the      place    where   his    wife\n\nformerly had been staying.           The troopers stopped Bennett, served\n\nhim with the Maine protection order, and told him to leave.\n\nBennett's wife thereafter took the family to a local shelter.\n\nBennett was arrested the next day a short distance from the\n\nchildren's school. Police located a gun and ammunition in the back\n\nof Bennett's truck.\n\n             Bennett    was     charged    in   a   two-count        indictment     with\n\ninterstate stalking (\"Count One\"), see 18 U.S.C. § 2261A(1), and\n\npossession     of   a   firearm     after       having       been    convicted      of   a\n\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence (\"Count Two\"), see id. §\n\n922(g)(9).     Bennett appeared in federal district court on December\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f6, 2002 (\"the first Rule 11 proceeding\"), apparently to plead\n\nguilty to Count One in exchange for the government's agreement to\n\ndismiss Count Two.     But, after Bennett disputed the requisite\n\nintent for Count One, the court rejected the proffered plea.     Four\n\ndays later, before a different judge, Bennett pleaded guilty to\n\nCount Two (\"the second Rule 11 proceeding\") and waived his right to\n\na jury trial on Count One.    Bennett subsequently was found guilty\n\non Count One.      At sentencing, the court denied Bennett's oral\n\nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea to Count Two.         The relevant\n\nparticulars are set forth below.\n\n          A.    The First Rule 11 Proceeding\n\n          On December 6, 2002, Bennett appeared before Judge Singal\n\nand proffered a guilty plea to Count One.      Trimmed of parts not\n\nhere pertinent, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n          Court:        He's pleading guilty to Count One?\n\n          D. Counsel: And Count Two will be dismissed.\n\n          Court:        Is that what the agreement is?\n\n          Govt.:        Yes, Your Honor. We had come here\n                        today with the expectation of the\n                        opposite, but moments before we\n                        entered court, [defense counsel]\n                        informed me that Mr. Bennett was\n                        willing to plead guilty to the\n                        more serious of the two.\n          . . .\n\n          Court:        Mr. Bennett, have you pleaded\n                        guilty to . . . Count One of the\n                        indictment because you are, in\n                        fact, actually guilty?\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     Do you have any doubt about that?\n\nBennett:   Not –- not the harassment and\n           intimidation. But to the killing,\n           I –- I didn't intend to kill or\n           injure anyone.\n\nCourt:     What you're telling me is you\n           traveled in interstate commerce\n           with   intent   to   harass and\n           intimidate your spouse?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     But you didn't go there with the\n           intent to kill or injure; is that\n           correct?\n\nBennett:   No.\n\n. . .\n\nCourt:     Ms. Malone [the prosecutor], I\n           note that the statute involved\n           here, Section 2261[A], deals with\n           the –- has the wording of, quote,\n           with the intent to kill, injure,\n           harass, or intimidate . . . [but]\n           your indictment reads it in the\n           conjunctive.\n\nGovt.:     Yes,   Your  Honor.     It's   my\n           understanding of the law that the\n           government is permitted to plead\n           in the conjunctive and prove in\n           the disjunctive. . . .\n\nCourt:     I agree . . . . Do you disagree,\n           [defense counsel]?\n\nD. Counsel: I do not, Your Honor.\n\n. . .\n\nCourt:      All right. Mr. Bennett, you told\n            me that you heard all of their\n\n                    -5-\n\f           evidence. Is there anything that\n           Ms. Malone indicated that you\n           disagree with?\n. . .\n\nBennett:   I disagree with saying that my\n           wife and I –- we had a little\n           confrontation on the phone for\n           about a minute, and that was it.\n           I changed the subject. And they\n           knew I was coming to Maine.\n. . .\n\nCourt:     All right.    Did you, in fact,\n           cross state lines with the intent\n           to harass and intimidate your\n           spouse?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     Do you have any doubt about that?\n\nBennett:   Truthfully, I didn't plan to harm\n           anyone, Your Honor.   I had pure\n           love in my heart.\n\nCourt:     You had what?\n\nBennett:   I had pure love in my heart for my\n           family.\n\nCourt:     All right. So what you're telling\n           me is that you didn't travel to\n           cause any harm –\n\nBennett:   No.\n\nCourt:     –- in any way?\n\nBennett:   No, I did not.\n\nCourt:     All right.\n\nBennett:   I didn't.\n\nCourt:     Thank you.    I'm not going to\n           accept this plea. He doesn't –\n\n\n\n                    -6-\n\f          Bennett:    I didn't want to hurt anyone.\n\n          Court:      That's –- don't say any more. Ms.\n                      Malone, I can't accept this plea.\n\n          B.   The Second Rule 11 Proceeding\n\n          Four days later, on December 10, 2002, Bennett appeared\n\nbefore Judge Hornby both to plead guilty to Count Two and to waive\n\nhis right to a jury trial on Count One.   Trimmed of parts not here\n\npertinent, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n          Court:       Have you used any drug or alcohol\n                       in the last 24 hours?\n\n          Bennett:     No.\n\n          Court:       Do you feel you understand what's\n                       happening in these proceedings?\n\n          Bennett:     Yes, I do.\n\n          Court:       These two lawyers have just told\n                       me that you want to change your\n                       plea   to   Count   Two   of   the\n                       indictment,     the     indictment\n                       concerning   possession    of  the\n                       weapon, is that correct?\n\n          Bennett:     Yes, it is.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Clerk:       Sir, how do you now plead to Count\n                       Two of the indictment, guilty or\n                       not guilty?\n\n          Bennett:     I plead guilty.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Court:       First of all, sir, have you\n                       pleaded   guilty   to  Count   Two\n                       because you are actually guilty of\n                       that crime?\n\n                                -7-\n\fBennett:   Yes.\n\n. . .\n\nCourt:     Mr. Bennett, did you receive a\n           copy of the indictment?\n\nBennett:   Yes, I did.\n\nCourt:     Did you have enough time to\n           discuss the charges with your\n           lawyer?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     Did   he  explain to  you the\n           elements . . . as well as the\n           penalties . . .?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     Mr. Bennett, you're charged in a\n           two-count indictment.      You're\n           entering a plea at this time only\n           to Count Two, so that's the one\n           I'm going to go over with you.\n           [explains the charge] Do you\n           understand this charge?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     [explains the penalties] Do you\n           understand all of these penalties?\n\nBennett:   Yes, I do.\n\nCourt:     Do you understand that you have\n           the right to continue to plead not\n           guilty to this charge?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     [explains trial procedure] If I\n           accept your guilty plea, you will\n           have given up your right to a\n           trial and the other rights that\n           I've just described to you, and\n           there will be no trial on this\n\n\n                    -8-\n\f           count of the indictment.     Do you\n           understand?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     I will proceed to enter a judgment\n           of guilty on this charge, and I\n           will sentence you on the basis of\n           your guilty plea on this charge.\n           And if all of that happens, you\n           will have virtually no right of\n           appeal from your conviction on\n           Count Two. Do you understand?\n\nBennett:   Yes, I do.\n\n. . .\n\nCourt:     In light of all that I've just\n           explained to you, do you still\n           choose to plead guilty to Count\n           Two?\n\nBennett:   Yes, I do.\n\n[recitation of evidence by the government]\n\nCourt:      Mr. Bennett,     did you hear the\n            prosecutor .     . . describe the\n            evidence that   he would produce if\n            Count Two did   proceed to trial?\n\nBennett:    Yes.\n\nCourt:      Is there anything he told me that\n            you disagree with?\n\nBennett:    No.\n\nCourt:      Is the information he gave me true\n            to your personal knowledge?\n\nBennett:    Yes, it is.\n\nCourt:      Very well. I find that there is a\n            factual basis for the guilty plea\n            to Count Two of the indictment.\n            Mr.    Bennett,    has    anybody\n\n\n                     -9-\n\f                      threatened you or tried to force\n                      you to plead guilty?\n\n          Bennett:    No.\n\n          Court:      Do you have any plea agreement,\n                      written   or  verbal,   with   the\n                      prosecutor or any other agreement\n                      about the sentence or about any of\n                      the other charges here?\n\n          Bennett:    No.\n\n          Court:      Do you understand, then, that so\n                      far as sentencing is concerned on\n                      Count Two . . . the authority to\n                      determine the sentence stays with\n                      me as the Judge? And . . . if the\n                      sentence turns out to be more\n                      severe than you hoped for, you'll\n                      have no right to withdraw your\n                      guilty plea.    You'll still be\n                      bound by it. Do you understand?\n\n          Bennett:    Yes, I do.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Court:      Has anybody made any promises to\n                      you to get you to plead guilty to\n                      Count Two?\n\n          Bennett:    No.\n\n          Judge Hornby thereafter accepted Bennett's guilty plea to\n\nCount Two and granted his request to waive trial by jury on Count\n\nOne.\n\n          C.   Subsequent Proceedings\n\n          On December 16, 2002, a bench trial was held before Judge\n\nHornby on Count One (the interstate-stalking charge). Judge Hornby\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\ffound Bennett guilty, explaining the requisite intent element as\n\nfollows:\n\n           There are four essential elements to be\n           addressed, as has been recognized . . . . The\n           real heart of the case, as the lawyers have\n           recognized, is the intent question, and the\n           requirement of the statute is that . . . the\n           defendant traveled in interstate commerce with\n           the intent to kill, injure, harass, or\n           intimidate another person. . . . I don't find\n           beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n           intended to kill or injure . . . but . . . I\n           do find beyond a reasonable doubt that he\n           intended to harass her, and that the travel in\n           interstate    commerce     was    with    that\n           intent . . . . Her acceptance of money from\n           him, coming from a community property state,\n           like California, and giving him an address to\n           send it do not contradict the foregoing.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing on November 5, 2003, Bennett's\n\nnew counsel orally moved to withdraw Bennett's guilty plea to Count\n\nTwo (the firearms charge):\n\n           [When my client appeared before Judge Singal,\n           he] agreed that . . . the harassment or\n           intimidation portion of the statute was what\n           he could agree to for factual recitation\n           purposes, but not anything dealing with intent\n           to harm or injure . . . . Judge Singal\n           rejected the plea offer. And ultimately . . .\n           the matter was before you [Judge Hornby] for\n           trial on both counts prior to the trial.\n           Apparently a plea on Count Two, the gun\n           charge, was tendered to you, and accepted by\n           you, . . . and you [later] found him guilty on\n           Count One with specific findings that it was a\n           harassment or intimidation activity. Nothing\n           was involved, I understand, on your findings\n           dealing with killing or injuring anyone,\n           [which was] exactly consistent with what [the\n           defendant] told Judge Singal. I only recently\n           had   this   transcript   of   the   Rule   11\n           proceedings . . . . I believe that the reason\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f           for the withdrawal of plea to Count Two is\n           important because factually, what the trial\n           did was confirm the defendant's plea to Count\n           One before Judge Singal on the mens rea issue.\n           My reading of the transcript before Judge\n           Singal . . . was that he apparently did not\n           believe that there was an adequate mens\n           rea . . . but a clear reading of it suggests\n           that . . . my client did accept at that time\n           the harassment, intimidation portion of the\n           statute, which was adequate for a plea.\n\n           Judge Hornby denied the motion, explaining his ruling as\n\nfollows:\n\n           The defendant has pleaded guilty to Count Two\n           in front of me, [and] there's no showing that\n           the guilty plea was anything other than\n           knowing,   voluntary,  intentional,   with  a\n           factual basis for the plea.       There's no\n           suggestion of innocence, there's no reason to\n           grant a motion to withdraw that guilty plea.\n           If there was some problem with the failed\n           attempt to plead guilty to Count One before\n           Judge Singal, and if there was some agreement\n           that was beneficial to the defendant at that\n           time, the proper remedy was to try to\n           resurrect that plea and to persuade Judge\n           Singal to accept the plea . . . . That did\n           not happen. So what I have here is a valid\n           guilty plea to Count Two without any grounds\n           to withdraw it.\n\nBennet thereafter was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment on Count\n\nOne with a concurrent term of 96 months' imprisonment on Count Two.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           We   are   presented   with    seven   issues   on   appeal:   (1)\n\n\"whether [Judge Singal] erred as a matter of law in rejecting [the\n\ndefendant's] plea to Count One on December 6, 2002\"; (2) \"whether\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthe U.S. Attorney's Office breached the plea agreement\"; (3)\n\n\"whether [Judge Hornby] erred as a matter of law in accepting the\n\nplea to Count Two . . . in violation of the plea agreement\"; (4)\n\n\"whether [Judge Hornby] erred as a matter of law in finding [the\n\ndefendant] guilty . . . of Count One\"; (5) whether [Judge Hornby]\n\nerred as a matter of law in the sentencing of [the defendant]\"; (6)\n\n\"whether [Judge Hornby] erred as a matter of law in denying [the\n\ndefendant's] request to withdraw his guilty plea to Count Two; and\n\n(7) \"whether [the defendant] was denied effective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\"    We handle each in the order previewed.\n\n            First, regarding Judge Singal's rejection of Bennett's\n\nproffered guilty plea to Count One, we note at the outset that\n\n\"[i]t is well settled that a defendant does not have an absolute\n\nright to plead guilty.\"    United States v. Ventura-Cruel, 356 F.3d\n\n55, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S.\n\n257, 262 (1971)).    Indeed, \"[b]efore entering judgment on a guilty\n\nplea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for\n\nthe plea.\"      Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).      Here, Judge Singal\n\nsupportably determined that a factual basis for the plea did not\n\nexist.1     Having already denied an intent to kill or injure, the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The relevant criminal statute criminalizes \"travel[ing] in\ninterstate or foreign commerce . . . with the intent to kill,\ninjure, harass, or intimidate another person\" when such travel\nplaces that person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily\ninjury. 18 U.S.C. § 2261(A) (emphasis added).\n\n                                 -13-\n\ffollowing exchange suggests that Bennett also denied having had an\n\nintent to harass or intimidate:\n\n          Court:        Do you have any doubt about [your\n                        intent to harass and intimidate]?\n\n          Bennett:      Truthfully, I didn't plan to harm\n                        anyone, Your Honor.   I had pure\n                        love in my heart.\n\n          Court:        You had what?\n\n          Bennett:      I had pure love in my heart for my\n                        family.\n\n          Court:        All right. So what you're telling\n                        me is that you didn't travel to\n                        cause any harm –\n\n          Bennett:      No.\n\n          Court:        –- in any way?\n\n          Bennett:      No, I did not.\n\n          Court:        All right.\n\n          Bennett:      I didn't.\n\n          Court:        Thank you.    I'm not going to\n                        accept this plea. He doesn't –\n\n          Bennett:      I didn't want to hurt anyone.\n\n          Bennett now argues that his denial of an intent to harm\n\nshould be construed only as a denial of an intent to kill or injure\n\nand not as a denial of an intent to intimidate or harass.2      We\n\nreject this argument.    The definition of harm is not confined to\n\nadverse physical effects such as physical injury or death; there is\n\n     2\n      Trial counsel neither objected nor proffered a similar\ninterpretative argument following Judge Singal's rejection of the\nplea.\n\n                                -14-\n\fa mental component as well.   See Webster's Third New International\n\nDictionary 1034 (1993) (defining \"harm\" as \"physical or mental\n\ndamage\").   Bennett's denial of any intention to harm together with\n\nhis assertion of \"pure love\" suggested a denial of all culpable\n\nintent, especially since these responses came immediately after\n\nhaving been asked specifically about his intent to harass or\n\nintimidate. Accordingly, we cannot say that Judge Singal committed\n\nreversible error in rejecting the plea.   See Santobello, 404 U.S.\n\nat 262 (\"A court may reject a plea in exercise of sound judicial\n\ndiscretion.\"); see also Ventura-Cruel 356 F.3d at 60 (quoting with\n\napproval Rule 11's historical advisory-committee notes, which state\n\nthat the \"normal consequences of a determination that there is not\n\na factual basis for the plea would be for the court to set aside\n\nthe plea and enter a plea of not guilty\").\n\n            Bennett's second argument –- that the United States\n\nAttorney's Office breached its plea agreement –- is without merit.\n\nBecause \"[e]very plea agreement is subject to court approval,\"\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 1991), no rights\n\nremained under the proffered plea agreement once Judge Singal\n\nrejected Bennett's guilty plea to Count One.        See id. at 37\n\n(\"Absent a showing that the government gained unfair advantage as\n\na result of the agreement . . ., once a plea agreement has been\n\nrejected by the court the government is under no obligation to\n\nabide by its terms.\" (citations omitted)). No unfair advantage has\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fbeen shown here. Indeed, in the second Rule 11 proceeding, Bennett\n\nhimself made clear that, in pleading guilty to Count Two, he was\n\nnot relying on –- and that, in fact, there did not exist -- a plea\n\nagreement with the government.3\n\n          Similarly without merit is Bennett's argument that Judge\n\nHornby erred in accepting his guilty plea to Count Two.   Resting on\n\nour discussion of the preceding two issues as well as the relevant\n\ncolloquy, see supra, we are convinced that no legitimate question\n\nhas been raised about any Rule 11 or related concern.\n\n          Bennett spends but one short paragraph elaborating his\n\nnext argument –- that Judge Hornby \"erred as matter of law in\n\nfinding [him] guilty . . . of Count One.\"     There is a \"settled\n\nappellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\" United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nIn any event, as best we can tell, Bennett is arguing that Judge\n\nHornby's findings are inconsistent with those of Judge Singal. But\n\nthat argument incorrectly is premised on the notion that Judge\n\nSingal (in the first Rule 11 proceeding) \"found that the elements\n\nof the [criminal] statute were not met.\"   Judge Singal did not so\n\nfind; rather, he found that Bennett had not admitted such elements.\n\n     3\n      Specifically, Judge Hornby asked Bennett whether he had \"any\nplea agreement, written or verbal, with the prosecutor or any other\nagreement about the sentence or about any of the other charges\nhere\" and whether \"anybody [had] made any promises to [him] to get\n[him] to plead guilty to Count Two.\" (emphasis added). Bennett\nanswered \"no\" to both questions.\n\n                               -16-\n\f            Bennett's Eighth Amendment-based sentencing argument is\n\npremised on \"the error of the district court in not accepting the\n\nplea to Count One, the government's breach of the plea agreement,\n\nthe district court's error in accepting the plea to Count Two and\n\nin finding the defendant guilty on Count One.\"                  Because we have\n\nrejected each and every premise on which Bennett relies, we find no\n\nmerit to this argument, which was in any event not raised below.\n\nSee United States v. McCormack, --- F.3d ---, 2004 WL 1244467 at *6\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (noting that a sentencing argument not raised below\n\nis reviewed only for plain error).               Bennett also argues that he\n\nshould   have    been   (1)    awarded    an    acceptance-of-responsibility\n\nadjustment because he \"attempt[ed] to accept responsibility for\n\nCount One . . . [and] did, in fact, accept responsibility by\n\npleading [guilty]       to    Count   Two\";     and   (2)   granted    a   downward\n\ndeparture       on   the      grounds      of     \"the      totality       of   the\n\ncircumstances . . ., diminished capacity, hyper-sexual and hyper-\n\nreligious behavior, and fatigue.\"               Both of these arguments were\n\npresented to –- and rejected by –- Judge Hornby at sentencing.4\n\n\n     4\n      Regarding the alleged acceptance of responsibility with\nrespect to Count One, Judge Hornby recited the relevant portions of\nthe first Rule 11 colloquy and then concluded as follows: \"Clearly,\n[Judge Singal] couldn't accept the plea. The defendant had denied\nresponsibility for having any kind of intent, even to harass or\nintimidate his wife; he had nothing but pure love in his heart. He\ndid not accept responsibility then. He went to trial as was his\nright, put the government to its proof.\" With respect to Count\nTwo, Judge Hornby determined that \"the two counts have to be\nultimately considered together [and], while it's true that he did\nplead guilty to Count Two, . . . given the overall offense conduct\nthat I'm analyzing under the guidelines, I do not find acceptance\n\n                                        -17-\n\fWe cannot say that Judge Hornby clearly erred in refusing to adjust\n\nthe sentence based on acceptance of responsibility, see United\n\nStates v. Muriel, 111 F.3d 975, 982 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"A defendant\n\nwho pleads guilty is not entitled to a downward adjustment for\n\nacceptance    of   responsibility   as     a   matter   of   right[;]   .   .   .\n\n[w]hether a defendant has accepted responsibility for the offense\n\nis a fact-dominated issue, and therefore we review the district\n\njudge's ruling for clear error.\" (citations omitted)), and we have\n\nno jurisdiction to review his discretionary decision not to depart,\n\nsee United States v. Morrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(noting that, because a \"refusal to depart cannot constitute an\n\nincorrect application of the Guidelines, . . . no appeal lies from\n\na discretionary refusal to depart . . . [unless] the decision not\n\nto depart is based on the sentencing court's assessment of its lack\n\nof authority or power to depart\" (citations and quotation marks\n\nomitted)).\n\n             Sixth, there was neither legal error nor a \"demonstrable\n\nabuse of discretion\" in the denial of Bennett's motion to withdraw\n\n\nof responsibility.\" See U.S.S.G. §3E1.1 (2002).\n     Regarding the departure issues, Judge Hornby concluded that\n(1) \"the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by [the\nvoluntary use of drugs and other intoxicants]\"; (2) \"the facts and\ncircumstances of the offense indicate a need to protect the\npublic\"; (3) \"the[se] circumstances . . . counsel against granting\na departure here [on the discouraged ground of] mental and\nemotional conditions\"; and (4) \"under . . . the general catch-all\nprovision, I likewise find no reason to depart here, even if I had\nthe authority, [because] the guideline range is very appropriate\ngiven the circumstances of what the defendant has done.\" See id.\n§§5H1.3 and 5K2.13.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fhis guilty plea to Count Two.             See United States v. Martinez-\n\nMolina, 64 F.3d 719, 732 (1st Cir. 1995).               Insofar as Bennett's\n\nargument in this regard is based on the other issues raised in his\n\nappeal, we have nothing to add other than to note that we are in\n\ncomplete agreement with Judge Hornby's careful analysis on this\n\npoint.     See supra.\n\n             Finally, this court has held \"with a regularity bordering\n\non   the     monotonous   that   fact-specific        claims    of   ineffective\n\nassistance cannot make their debut on direct appeal of criminal\n\nconvictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and\n\nacted upon by, the trial court.\"           United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d\n\n1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).                  Absent the rare\n\noccasion where, on direct appeal, the record is sufficiently clear\n\nto   allow    reasoned    consideration    of   the    ineffective-assistance\n\nclaim, see, e.g., United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302 (1st Cir.\n\n1991),     \"[t]he   preferable   vehicle    for   such    [a]    claim[]   is   a\n\ncollateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, in which the parties\n\nand the district court can address factual matters relevant to the\n\nissue,\" United States v. Genao, 281 F.3d 305, 313 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(citation omitted).        Bennett's ineffective-assistance claim does\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fnot fall within the narrow exception;5 accordingly, he must pursue\n\nit in the traditional fashion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Among other problems, Bennett points to former counsel's\n\"failure to investigate all avenues proposed by the defendant\" but\nthen neglects to identify any evidence in the record indicating\nwhat, in fact, defendant had proposed or what, in fact, former\ncounsel had considered (and, perhaps, rejected).\n\n                                 -20-\n\f",

David Bennett appeals his convictions and\n\nensuing sentence for (1) \"travel[ing] in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce . . . with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or\n\nintimidate another person [with the result of] plac[ing] that\n\nperson    in       reasonable         fear   of    [death]    or    serious   bodily\n\ninjury    .    .   .    .\";     and   (2)    \"ship[ping]     or   transport[ing]    in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce . . . any firearm or ammunition\n\n[after having been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of\n\ndomestic violence].\"             18 U.S.C. §§ 2261A(1) and 922(g)(9).               We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n              Bennett was a frequent user of methamphetamine who often\n\naccused his wife of infidelity.                    In January 2002, Bennett was\n\nconvicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence against his\n\nwife. Following this incident, Bennett's wife –- fearing Bennett's\n\nrelease   from         prison    –-   gathered     the   children    and   fled   from\n\nCalifornia to a relative's home in Maine.                     On January 24, 2002,\n\nBennett was released from prison on the condition that he have no\n\ncontact with his wife. Three days later, Bennett's wife phoned him\n\nto tell him that she and the children had left for (and arrived\n\nsafely in) Maine.             During the course of this conversation, she\n\nprovided Bennett with the address of her current location. Bennett\n\nthereafter wired money so that his wife could rent an apartment.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f          On January 29th, Bennett's wife obtained a protection\n\norder   from      the   Maine     courts.          In    a   subsequent       telephone\n\nconversation -- Bennett apparently repeatedly phoned his wife –-\n\nBennett's wife told Bennett to stay out of Maine because the\n\nmarriage was finished.            Despite this admonition, Bennett left\n\nCalifornia for Maine on or about February 8th after having told two\n\nfriends that he planned to save his marriage.                   On the way, Bennett\n\nstopped in Utah to visit his father and acquired his father's\n\nhandgun on the pretext that he needed protection.                         Bennett then\n\ntraveled across the country with the gun.                       Bennett's wife was\n\nnotified of these events by Bennett's sister.\n\n             On   the   night    that     Bennett       arrived      in   Maine,    state\n\ntroopers observed       him     driving     past    the      place    where   his    wife\n\nformerly had been staying.           The troopers stopped Bennett, served\n\nhim with the Maine protection order, and told him to leave.\n\nBennett's wife thereafter took the family to a local shelter.\n\nBennett was arrested the next day a short distance from the\n\nchildren's school. Police located a gun and ammunition in the back\n\nof Bennett's truck.\n\n             Bennett    was     charged    in   a   two-count        indictment     with\n\ninterstate stalking (\"Count One\"), see 18 U.S.C. § 2261A(1), and\n\npossession     of   a   firearm     after       having       been    convicted      of   a\n\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence (\"Count Two\"), see id. §\n\n922(g)(9).     Bennett appeared in federal district court on December\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f6, 2002 (\"the first Rule 11 proceeding\"), apparently to plead\n\nguilty to Count One in exchange for the government's agreement to\n\ndismiss Count Two.     But, after Bennett disputed the requisite\n\nintent for Count One, the court rejected the proffered plea.     Four\n\ndays later, before a different judge, Bennett pleaded guilty to\n\nCount Two (\"the second Rule 11 proceeding\") and waived his right to\n\na jury trial on Count One.    Bennett subsequently was found guilty\n\non Count One.      At sentencing, the court denied Bennett's oral\n\nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea to Count Two.         The relevant\n\nparticulars are set forth below.\n\n          A.    The First Rule 11 Proceeding\n\n          On December 6, 2002, Bennett appeared before Judge Singal\n\nand proffered a guilty plea to Count One.      Trimmed of parts not\n\nhere pertinent, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n          Court:        He's pleading guilty to Count One?\n\n          D. Counsel: And Count Two will be dismissed.\n\n          Court:        Is that what the agreement is?\n\n          Govt.:        Yes, Your Honor. We had come here\n                        today with the expectation of the\n                        opposite, but moments before we\n                        entered court, [defense counsel]\n                        informed me that Mr. Bennett was\n                        willing to plead guilty to the\n                        more serious of the two.\n          . . .\n\n          Court:        Mr. Bennett, have you pleaded\n                        guilty to . . . Count One of the\n                        indictment because you are, in\n                        fact, actually guilty?\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     Do you have any doubt about that?\n\nBennett:   Not –- not the harassment and\n           intimidation. But to the killing,\n           I –- I didn't intend to kill or\n           injure anyone.\n\nCourt:     What you're telling me is you\n           traveled in interstate commerce\n           with   intent   to   harass and\n           intimidate your spouse?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     But you didn't go there with the\n           intent to kill or injure; is that\n           correct?\n\nBennett:   No.\n\n. . .\n\nCourt:     Ms. Malone [the prosecutor], I\n           note that the statute involved\n           here, Section 2261[A], deals with\n           the –- has the wording of, quote,\n           with the intent to kill, injure,\n           harass, or intimidate . . . [but]\n           your indictment reads it in the\n           conjunctive.\n\nGovt.:     Yes,   Your  Honor.     It's   my\n           understanding of the law that the\n           government is permitted to plead\n           in the conjunctive and prove in\n           the disjunctive. . . .\n\nCourt:     I agree . . . . Do you disagree,\n           [defense counsel]?\n\nD. Counsel: I do not, Your Honor.\n\n. . .\n\nCourt:      All right. Mr. Bennett, you told\n            me that you heard all of their\n\n                    -5-\n\f           evidence. Is there anything that\n           Ms. Malone indicated that you\n           disagree with?\n. . .\n\nBennett:   I disagree with saying that my\n           wife and I –- we had a little\n           confrontation on the phone for\n           about a minute, and that was it.\n           I changed the subject. And they\n           knew I was coming to Maine.\n. . .\n\nCourt:     All right.    Did you, in fact,\n           cross state lines with the intent\n           to harass and intimidate your\n           spouse?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     Do you have any doubt about that?\n\nBennett:   Truthfully, I didn't plan to harm\n           anyone, Your Honor.   I had pure\n           love in my heart.\n\nCourt:     You had what?\n\nBennett:   I had pure love in my heart for my\n           family.\n\nCourt:     All right. So what you're telling\n           me is that you didn't travel to\n           cause any harm –\n\nBennett:   No.\n\nCourt:     –- in any way?\n\nBennett:   No, I did not.\n\nCourt:     All right.\n\nBennett:   I didn't.\n\nCourt:     Thank you.    I'm not going to\n           accept this plea. He doesn't –\n\n\n\n                    -6-\n\f          Bennett:    I didn't want to hurt anyone.\n\n          Court:      That's –- don't say any more. Ms.\n                      Malone, I can't accept this plea.\n\n          B.   The Second Rule 11 Proceeding\n\n          Four days later, on December 10, 2002, Bennett appeared\n\nbefore Judge Hornby both to plead guilty to Count Two and to waive\n\nhis right to a jury trial on Count One.   Trimmed of parts not here\n\npertinent, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n          Court:       Have you used any drug or alcohol\n                       in the last 24 hours?\n\n          Bennett:     No.\n\n          Court:       Do you feel you understand what's\n                       happening in these proceedings?\n\n          Bennett:     Yes, I do.\n\n          Court:       These two lawyers have just told\n                       me that you want to change your\n                       plea   to   Count   Two   of   the\n                       indictment,     the     indictment\n                       concerning   possession    of  the\n                       weapon, is that correct?\n\n          Bennett:     Yes, it is.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Clerk:       Sir, how do you now plead to Count\n                       Two of the indictment, guilty or\n                       not guilty?\n\n          Bennett:     I plead guilty.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Court:       First of all, sir, have you\n                       pleaded   guilty   to  Count   Two\n                       because you are actually guilty of\n                       that crime?\n\n                                -7-\n\fBennett:   Yes.\n\n. . .\n\nCourt:     Mr. Bennett, did you receive a\n           copy of the indictment?\n\nBennett:   Yes, I did.\n\nCourt:     Did you have enough time to\n           discuss the charges with your\n           lawyer?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     Did   he  explain to  you the\n           elements . . . as well as the\n           penalties . . .?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     Mr. Bennett, you're charged in a\n           two-count indictment.      You're\n           entering a plea at this time only\n           to Count Two, so that's the one\n           I'm going to go over with you.\n           [explains the charge] Do you\n           understand this charge?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     [explains the penalties] Do you\n           understand all of these penalties?\n\nBennett:   Yes, I do.\n\nCourt:     Do you understand that you have\n           the right to continue to plead not\n           guilty to this charge?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     [explains trial procedure] If I\n           accept your guilty plea, you will\n           have given up your right to a\n           trial and the other rights that\n           I've just described to you, and\n           there will be no trial on this\n\n\n                    -8-\n\f           count of the indictment.     Do you\n           understand?\n\nBennett:   Yes.\n\nCourt:     I will proceed to enter a judgment\n           of guilty on this charge, and I\n           will sentence you on the basis of\n           your guilty plea on this charge.\n           And if all of that happens, you\n           will have virtually no right of\n           appeal from your conviction on\n           Count Two. Do you understand?\n\nBennett:   Yes, I do.\n\n. . .\n\nCourt:     In light of all that I've just\n           explained to you, do you still\n           choose to plead guilty to Count\n           Two?\n\nBennett:   Yes, I do.\n\n[recitation of evidence by the government]\n\nCourt:      Mr. Bennett,     did you hear the\n            prosecutor .     . . describe the\n            evidence that   he would produce if\n            Count Two did   proceed to trial?\n\nBennett:    Yes.\n\nCourt:      Is there anything he told me that\n            you disagree with?\n\nBennett:    No.\n\nCourt:      Is the information he gave me true\n            to your personal knowledge?\n\nBennett:    Yes, it is.\n\nCourt:      Very well. I find that there is a\n            factual basis for the guilty plea\n            to Count Two of the indictment.\n            Mr.    Bennett,    has    anybody\n\n\n                     -9-\n\f                      threatened you or tried to force\n                      you to plead guilty?\n\n          Bennett:    No.\n\n          Court:      Do you have any plea agreement,\n                      written   or  verbal,   with   the\n                      prosecutor or any other agreement\n                      about the sentence or about any of\n                      the other charges here?\n\n          Bennett:    No.\n\n          Court:      Do you understand, then, that so\n                      far as sentencing is concerned on\n                      Count Two . . . the authority to\n                      determine the sentence stays with\n                      me as the Judge? And . . . if the\n                      sentence turns out to be more\n                      severe than you hoped for, you'll\n                      have no right to withdraw your\n                      guilty plea.    You'll still be\n                      bound by it. Do you understand?\n\n          Bennett:    Yes, I do.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Court:      Has anybody made any promises to\n                      you to get you to plead guilty to\n                      Count Two?\n\n          Bennett:    No.\n\n          Judge Hornby thereafter accepted Bennett's guilty plea to\n\nCount Two and granted his request to waive trial by jury on Count\n\nOne.\n\n          C.   Subsequent Proceedings\n\n          On December 16, 2002, a bench trial was held before Judge\n\nHornby on Count One (the interstate-stalking charge). Judge Hornby\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\ffound Bennett guilty, explaining the requisite intent element as\n\nfollows:\n\n           There are four essential elements to be\n           addressed, as has been recognized . . . . The\n           real heart of the case, as the lawyers have\n           recognized, is the intent question, and the\n           requirement of the statute is that . . . the\n           defendant traveled in interstate commerce with\n           the intent to kill, injure, harass, or\n           intimidate another person. . . . I don't find\n           beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n           intended to kill or injure . . . but . . . I\n           do find beyond a reasonable doubt that he\n           intended to harass her, and that the travel in\n           interstate    commerce     was    with    that\n           intent . . . . Her acceptance of money from\n           him, coming from a community property state,\n           like California, and giving him an address to\n           send it do not contradict the foregoing.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing on November 5, 2003, Bennett's\n\nnew counsel orally moved to withdraw Bennett's guilty plea to Count\n\nTwo (the firearms charge):\n\n           [When my client appeared before Judge Singal,\n           he] agreed that . . . the harassment or\n           intimidation portion of the statute was what\n           he could agree to for factual recitation\n           purposes, but not anything dealing with intent\n           to harm or injure . . . . Judge Singal\n           rejected the plea offer. And ultimately . . .\n           the matter was before you [Judge Hornby] for\n           trial on both counts prior to the trial.\n           Apparently a plea on Count Two, the gun\n           charge, was tendered to you, and accepted by\n           you, . . . and you [later] found him guilty on\n           Count One with specific findings that it was a\n           harassment or intimidation activity. Nothing\n           was involved, I understand, on your findings\n           dealing with killing or injuring anyone,\n           [which was] exactly consistent with what [the\n           defendant] told Judge Singal. I only recently\n           had   this   transcript   of   the   Rule   11\n           proceedings . . . . I believe that the reason\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f           for the withdrawal of plea to Count Two is\n           important because factually, what the trial\n           did was confirm the defendant's plea to Count\n           One before Judge Singal on the mens rea issue.\n           My reading of the transcript before Judge\n           Singal . . . was that he apparently did not\n           believe that there was an adequate mens\n           rea . . . but a clear reading of it suggests\n           that . . . my client did accept at that time\n           the harassment, intimidation portion of the\n           statute, which was adequate for a plea.\n\n           Judge Hornby denied the motion, explaining his ruling as\n\nfollows:\n\n           The defendant has pleaded guilty to Count Two\n           in front of me, [and] there's no showing that\n           the guilty plea was anything other than\n           knowing,   voluntary,  intentional,   with  a\n           factual basis for the plea.       There's no\n           suggestion of innocence, there's no reason to\n           grant a motion to withdraw that guilty plea.\n           If there was some problem with the failed\n           attempt to plead guilty to Count One before\n           Judge Singal, and if there was some agreement\n           that was beneficial to the defendant at that\n           time, the proper remedy was to try to\n           resurrect that plea and to persuade Judge\n           Singal to accept the plea . . . . That did\n           not happen. So what I have here is a valid\n           guilty plea to Count Two without any grounds\n           to withdraw it.\n\nBennet thereafter was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment on Count\n\nOne with a concurrent term of 96 months' imprisonment on Count Two.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           We   are   presented   with    seven   issues   on   appeal:   (1)\n\n\"whether [Judge Singal] erred as a matter of law in rejecting [the\n\ndefendant's] plea to Count One on December 6, 2002\"; (2) \"whether\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthe U.S. Attorney's Office breached the plea agreement\"; (3)\n\n\"whether [Judge Hornby] erred as a matter of law in accepting the\n\nplea to Count Two . . . in violation of the plea agreement\"; (4)\n\n\"whether [Judge Hornby] erred as a matter of law in finding [the\n\ndefendant] guilty . . . of Count One\"; (5) whether [Judge Hornby]\n\nerred as a matter of law in the sentencing of [the defendant]\"; (6)\n\n\"whether [Judge Hornby] erred as a matter of law in denying [the\n\ndefendant's] request to withdraw his guilty plea to Count Two; and\n\n(7) \"whether [the defendant] was denied effective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\"    We handle each in the order previewed.\n\n            First, regarding Judge Singal's rejection of Bennett's\n\nproffered guilty plea to Count One, we note at the outset that\n\n\"[i]t is well settled that a defendant does not have an absolute\n\nright to plead guilty.\"    United States v.

So what you're telling\n                        me is that you didn't travel to\n                        cause any harm –\n\n          Bennett:      No.\n\n          Court:        –- in any way?\n\n          Bennett:      No, I did not.\n\n          Court:        All right.\n\n          Bennett:      I didn't.\n\n          Court:        Thank you.

Bennett's denial of any intention to harm together with\n\nhis assertion of \"pure love\" suggested a denial of all culpable\n\nintent, especially since these responses came immediately after\n\nhaving been asked specifically about his intent to harass or\n\nintimidate. Accordingly, we cannot say that Judge Singal committed\n\nreversible error in rejecting the plea.   See Santobello, 404 U.S.\n\nat 262 (\"A court may reject a plea in exercise of sound judicial\n\ndiscretion.\"); see also Ventura-Cruel 356 F.3d at 60 (quoting with\n\napproval Rule 11's historical advisory-committee notes, which state\n\nthat the \"normal consequences of a determination that there is not\n\na factual basis for the plea would be for the court to set aside\n\nthe plea and enter a plea of not guilty\").\n\n            Bennett's second argument –- that the United States\n\nAttorney's Office breached its plea agreement –- is without merit.\n\nBecause \"[e]very plea agreement is subject to court approval,\"\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567922\"><a href=\"/opinion/567922/united-states-v-christian-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36 (1st Cir. 1991), no rights\n\nremained under the proffered plea agreement once Judge Singal\n\nrejected Bennett's guilty plea to Count One.        See id. at 37\n\n(\"Absent a showing that the government gained unfair advantage as\n\na result of the agreement . . ., once a plea agreement has been\n\nrejected by the court the government is under no obligation to\n\nabide by its terms.\" (citations omitted)). No unfair advantage has\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fbeen shown here. Indeed, in the second Rule 11 proceeding, Bennett\n\nhimself made clear that, in pleading guilty to Count Two, he was\n\nnot relying on –- and that, in fact, there did not exist -- a plea\n\nagreement with the government.3\n\n          Similarly without merit is Bennett's argument that Judge\n\nHornby erred in accepting his guilty plea to Count Two.   Resting on\n\nour discussion of the preceding two issues as well as the relevant\n\ncolloquy, see supra, we are convinced that no legitimate question\n\nhas been raised about any Rule 11 or related concern.\n\n          Bennett spends but one short paragraph elaborating his\n\nnext argument –- that Judge Hornby \"erred as matter of law in\n\nfinding [him] guilty . . . of Count One.\"     There is a \"settled\n\nappellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\" United States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nIn any event, as best we can tell, Bennett is arguing that Judge\n\nHornby's findings are inconsistent with those of Judge Singal. But\n\nthat argument incorrectly is premised on the notion that Judge\n\nSingal (in the first Rule 11 proceeding) \"found that the elements\n\nof the [criminal] statute were not met.\"   Judge Singal did not so\n\nfind; rather, he found that Bennett had not admitted such elements.\n\n     3\n      Specifically, Judge Hornby asked Bennett whether he had \"any\nplea agreement, written or verbal, with the prosecutor or any other\nagreement about the sentence or about any of the other charges\nhere\" and whether \"anybody [had] made any promises to [him] to get\n[him] to plead guilty to Count Two.\" (emphasis added). Bennett\nanswered \"no\" to both questions.\n\n                               -16-\n\f            Bennett's Eighth Amendment-based sentencing argument is\n\npremised on \"the error of the district court in not accepting the\n\nplea to Count One, the government's breach of the plea agreement,\n\nthe district court's error in accepting the plea to Count Two and\n\nin finding the defendant guilty on Count One.\"                  Because we have\n\nrejected each and every premise on which Bennett relies, we find no\n\nmerit to this argument, which was in any event not raised below.\n\nSee United States v.

Bennett also argues that he\n\nshould   have    been   (1)    awarded    an    acceptance-of-responsibility\n\nadjustment because he \"attempt[ed] to accept responsibility for\n\nCount One . . . [and] did, in fact, accept responsibility by\n\npleading [guilty]       to    Count   Two\";     and   (2)   granted    a   downward\n\ndeparture       on   the      grounds      of     \"the      totality       of   the\n\ncircumstances . . ., diminished capacity, hyper-sexual and hyper-\n\nreligious behavior, and fatigue.\"               Both of these arguments were\n\npresented to –- and rejected by –- Judge Hornby at sentencing.4\n\n\n     4\n      Regarding the alleged acceptance of responsibility with\nrespect to Count One, Judge Hornby recited the relevant portions of\nthe first Rule 11 colloquy and then concluded as follows: \"Clearly,\n[Judge Singal] couldn't accept the plea. The defendant had denied\nresponsibility for having any kind of intent, even to harass or\nintimidate his wife; he had nothing but pure love in his heart. He\ndid not accept responsibility then. He went to trial as was his\nright, put the government to its proof.\" With respect to Count\nTwo, Judge Hornby determined that \"the two counts have to be\nultimately considered together [and], while it's true that he did\nplead guilty to Count Two, . . . given the overall offense conduct\nthat I'm analyzing under the guidelines, I do not find acceptance\n\n                                        -17-\n\fWe cannot say that Judge Hornby clearly erred in refusing to adjust\n\nthe sentence based on acceptance of responsibility, see United\n\nStates v.

See supra.\n\n             Finally, this court has held \"with a regularity bordering\n\non   the     monotonous   that   fact-specific        claims    of   ineffective\n\nassistance cannot make their debut on direct appeal of criminal\n\nconvictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and\n\nacted upon by, the trial court.\"           United States v.
