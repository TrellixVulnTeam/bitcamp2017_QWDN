Fitzroy Prescott, an African-\n\nAmerican male, is a mechanic for the City of Boston (\"the City\")\n\nwho applied for a position as General Foreman for the City's Public\n\nWorks Department.       The selection committee -- made up of two white\n\nmales,    one   white    female,       and   one   African-American   male   --\n\nunanimously chose Horace Ryder, a white male.             Prescott filed suit\n\nagainst the City, and two city supervisors in their personal and\n\nprofessional capacities (collectively \"the Defendants\"), under\n\nvarious    federal      and    state    laws   for   racial   discrimination,\n\ndisability discrimination, tortious interference with contract,\n\nharassment creating a hostile work environment, and retaliation.\n\nDefendants filed for summary judgment, and Prescott cross-motioned\n\nfor summary judgment.          The district court granted the Defendants'\n\nmotion for summary judgment and denied Prescott's cross-motion.\n\nPrescott appealed.       After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                                 I.    Background\n\n            We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-movant, here Prescott.             See Ramos-Santiago v. United Parcel\n\nServ., 524 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir. 2008).            Prescott has been a city\n\nmechanic since 1984.          In June 2002, the City posted a position for\n\nGeneral Maintenance Mechanic Foreman, in Central Fleet Maintenance,\n\nBoston Public Works.          Four city employees were interviewed for the\n\nposition, including Prescott and Ryder.              All four candidates were\n\ninterviewed by four management-level supervisors in the Public\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fWorks Department: Jerry Coughlin (a white male), Maurice Smith (an\n\nAfrican-American   male),    Kathy    Kelley     (a   white    female),   and\n\nPrescott's supervisor, David Higgins (a white male). The interview\n\nfocused on three main criteria:            job knowledge, education, and\n\nexperience.\n\n          During   the    interview,       applicants   were    asked   seven\n\nobjective questions regarding the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety\n\nAct Federal Out of Service Criteria, which delineates the federal\n\nstandards for when vehicles are unsafe to drive.               Prescott was\n\nunable to correctly answer any of the questions pertaining to the\n\nfederal guidelines. Ryder answered all of the questions correctly.\n\nAccording to Prescott there were no questions during the interview\n\nthat focused on education or instruction in the field of mechanics.\n\nHe claims that there is no evidence that the City considered his\n\nperformance evaluations.     He contends that the interview process\n\nonly rewarded those who could provide the \"right\" answers to the\n\nquestions that were asked, questions he claims had no predictive\n\nability for the likelihood of success as a General Foreman.\n\n          The selection committee determined that Prescott and two\n\nother white candidates were not qualified for the position.               The\n\nonly committee member who thought that Prescott was qualified for\n\nthe position was Smith.     Smith, however, ranked Prescott third out\n\nof the four candidates.       The unanimous choice of the interview\n\npanel was Ryder.   Ryder had ten more years of experience than the\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fother   candidates,     and    he   also   had    more    supervisory    and\n\nadministrative experience than them as well.             Ryder had been the\n\nActing General Foreman for six months before he was interviewed,\n\nand the panel determined that he had better job knowledge than the\n\nother candidates.     The panel also determined that Ryder would have\n\nthe least negative impact on work product because he was the one\n\nmost familiar with the position.\n\n          Prescott     filed   a    complaint    with    the   Massachusetts\n\nCommittee Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") on October 10, 2002,\n\nalleging that he did not receive the promotion because of racial\n\ndiscrimination.   Prescott does not claim, however, that anyone has\n\never made, or that he has ever heard, racist or derogatory comments\n\nabout him or others.      He did not make any claims pertaining to\n\ndisability, retaliation, or lack of accommodation at the time.\n\nPrescott claims that he was more qualified than Ryder for the\n\nposition and points to his nineteen years of experience as a\n\nmechanic and six years as a foreman.        He also points to numerous\n\ncertifications he has obtained during his time in the field.\n\nPrescott alleges that the City has made unsubstantiated claims that\n\nRyder had supervisory experience.          Prescott also alleges that\n\nHiggins was not concerned with the backgrounds of African-American\n\nemployees or their schooling and that he simply did not promote\n\nAfrican-American workers.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f          Prescott contends that the selection criteria used by\n\nHiggins resulted in a less than eighty percent success rate for\n\nAfrican-American applicants and that the selection criteria have\n\nhad a disparate impact on African-American applicants.\n\n          Prescott also alleges that he was not compensated for\n\nserving as Acting General Foreman in 2002 when, Maurice García, the\n\nthen-General Foreman, was out on sick-leave. The difference in pay\n\nwas $200 a week.      Prescott filed a grievance with the union.\n\nPrescott also contends that he was required to work on a computer\n\nafter he had eye surgery, and he was required to lift ten-pound\n\nitems, which he was not supposed to do because of his surgery.\n\n          MCAD dismissed Prescott's complaint, finding a lack of\n\nprobable cause.   On appeal, the dismissal was affirmed by the MCAD\n\ninvestigation Commissioner.   Prescott filed suit in Superior Court\n\nin Suffolk County on January 24, 2006, and Defendants removed the\n\ncase to federal district court on February 10, 2006.   On March 6,\n\n2007, the defendants filed for summary judgment, and on March 20,\n\n2007, Prescott filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.         On\n\nAugust 27, 2007, the district court granted the Defendants' motion\n\nfor summary judgment and denied Prescott's cross-motion.         The\n\ndistrict court also denied Prescott's motion to take judicial\n\nnotice of facts from a pending case and his motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment.   Prescott now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f   II.    Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n            A.   Standard of Review\n\n            We   review   a    motion    for   summary    judgment    de    novo,\n\nconstruing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant\n\nand resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. See\n\nThompson v. Coca-Cola Co., 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir. 2008).                 We\n\nmay ignore \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and\n\nunsupported speculation.\"        Medina-Muñoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\n\nCo., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing Rossy v. Roche Products,\n\nInc., 880 F.2d 621, 624 (1st Cir. 1989)).          We will reverse only if,\n\n\"after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of\n\nthe non-moving party [here, Prescott], the evidence on record is\n\n'sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational factfinder to resolve\n\nthe issue in favor of either side.'\"            Maymí v. P.R. Ports Auth.,\n\n515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v.\n\nTown of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n            \"Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers    to    interrogatories,        admissions      on   file,   and     any\n\naffidavits.\"     Thompson, 522 F.3d at 175 (citing Fed. R. Civ P.\n\n56(c)).    \"A dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is\n\nsuch that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of\n\nthe non-moving party.\"        Id. (quoting Sánchez v. Alvarado, 101 F.3d\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f223, 227 (1st Cir. 1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).       \"A\n\nfact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome\n\nof the litigation.\"     Maymí, 515 F.3d at 25.   To defeat a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, evidence offered by the non-movant \"must be\n\nsignificantly probative of specific facts.\"        Pérez v. Volvo Car\n\nCorp., 247 F.3d 303, 317 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)).\n\n           B.   Discussion\n\n           Prescott appeals the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment   on   discrimination    claims   for   disparate   treatment,\n\ndisparate impact, compensation, hostile work environment, tortious\n\ninterference with a contract, retaliation, and disability. He also\n\nchallenges the district court's denial of his cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment. The familiar McDonnell Douglas framework governs\n\nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Massachusetts General Laws,\n\nchapter 151B claims.     See Villanueva v. Wellesley Coll., 930 F.2d\n\n124, 127 & n.2 (1st Cir. 1991).    The problem Prescott faces is that\n\nhe is unable to meet the prima facie burden that he is required to\n\nestablish in the first step of McDonnell Douglas. Accordingly, all\n\nhis discrimination claims must fail.          We address each of his\n\nallegations in turn.\n\n                   1.   Disparate Treatment\n\n           A plaintiff makes out a claim of disparate treatment by\n\nshowing that:   (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fqualified for the position he sought; (3) he was subjected to\n\nadverse employment action; and (4) the position remained open or\n\nwas filled by someone else with similar qualifications.           Kosereis\n\nv. Rhode Island, 331 F.3d 207, 212-13 (1st Cir. 2003) (citations\n\nomitted).     It is undisputed that Prescott is a member of a\n\nprotected class.     For Prescott to survive the motion for summary\n\njudgment, then, he needed to present evidence that showed that\n\nRyder's qualifications were similar to his own.         See Gu v. Boston\n\nPolice Dep't, 312 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2002).         The district court\n\nfound that he was unable to make that showing.         We agree.\n\n            Prescott was unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of\n\nthe interview panel that he was qualified for the position, and he\n\nfailed to accurately answer the questions that the panel posed to\n\nhim during his interview.     His answer to several of the questions\n\nwas that he was \"not sure.\"    In contrast, Ryder was able to provide\n\ncorrect answers to each question, and he had ten years more\n\nseniority than Prescott.\n\n            The   district   court    was   not   required   to    consider\n\nPrescott's proffer of evidence of pretext because he was unable to\n\nget past the second requirement, that he was qualified for the\n\ncontested position.    McDonnell Douglas made clear that a Title VII\n\nplaintiff carries the initial burden of establishing a prima facie\n\ncase.   See Oliver v. Digital Equip Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 107 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).       Only after Prescott has satisfied his burden of\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fshowing a prima facie case, and the defendants have proffered a\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for not promoting him, would we consider\n\nany evidence of discriminatory pretext.                     See Gillen v. Fallon\n\nAmbulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 30 (1st Cir. 2002).                   The record\n\nclearly indicates that Prescott was not qualified for the position\n\nhe sought.       Prescott was not able to meet his prima facie burden\n\nand thus his claim of disparate treatment is legally insufficient.\n\n                     2.    Disparate Impact\n\n            \"'[D]isparate         impact'        [claims]     involve     employment\n\npractices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different\n\ngroups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another\n\nand cannot be justified by business necessity.\" Hazen Paper Co. v.\n\nBiggins, 507 U.S. 604, 609 (1993) (quoting Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters\n\nv. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335-36 n.15 (1977)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); accord Bramble v. Am. Postal Workers\n\nUnion, 135 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1998).                     Prescott alleges that\n\nDefendants' hiring practices have a disparate impact on African-\n\nAmericans because Defendants use selection procedures that result\n\nin a less than eighty percent success rate for African-American\n\napplicants, as compared with white applicants.                      While in his\n\ndisparate    impact       claim    Prescott        is   not    required    to    show\n\ndiscriminatory motive, see Hazen Paper Co., 507 U.S. at 609, he is\n\nrequired    to    show   proof    of   a   disproportionate       impact    on   that\n\nAfrican-Americans.\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f            Prescott has not introduced any evidence of disparate\n\nimpact in this case.          Rather, his appeal hinges on the district\n\ncourt's denial of his motion to take judicial notice of evidence\n\nsubmitted in another case which purports to show disparate impact.\n\nWe review that evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.                         See\n\nUnited States v. Bello, 194 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 1999).                           The\n\nvalidity of the statistics and whether they showed disparate impact\n\nwas at issue in that case.          Therefore, the proof offered was not a\n\n\"matter beyond reasonable controversy,\" Fed. R. Evid. 201, advisory\n\ncommittee's note (Note to subdivision (b)), and there was no abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n                    3.    Compensation\n\n                              a.   Federal Law Claim\n\n            To make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination\n\nin compensation under Title VII or § 1981, Prescott must show that\n\n(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he met his employer's\n\nexpectations;     (3)    he    suffered    adverse      employment    action      with\n\nrespect    to   compensation;      and    (4)    similarly-situated        employees\n\noutside the protected class received more favorable treatment. See\n\nWhite v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing    McDonnell     Douglas    Corp.       v.   Green,   411   U.S.   792,    802\n\n(1973)).     Prescott claims that he was discriminated against in\n\ncompensation because he was not paid for the weeks when he served\n\nas Acting General Foreman while others performing the same work\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\freceived higher compensation.            Notwithstanding this claim, the\n\nevidence is clear that Prescott has not proven that he met his\n\nemployer's expectations as an Acting General Foreman.              Prescott\n\nalso fails to meet the fourth prong of the prima facie test because\n\nhe never put forth any evidence of similarly-situated employees who\n\nwere given higher compensation.          Since he has failed to establish\n\na prima facie case, his claim of disparate compensation also fails.\n\n                            b.   Massachusetts State Law Claim\n\n            In addition to making a complaint under federal law,\n\nPrescott    also   claims    that   he    was   discriminated   against   in\n\ncompensation under Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 149, §§ 148,\n\n150. Section 148 provides that \"[e]very person having employees in\n\nhis service shall pay . . . such employee the wages earned by\n\nhim.\"1     The purpose of § 148, is to prevent the \"unreasonable\n\ndetention of wages [by employers].\"             Boston Police Patrolmen's\n\nAssoc., Inc., v. City of Boston, 761 N.E.2d 479, 481 (Mass. 2002)\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Section 150 provides, in relevant part:\n\n      Any employee claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of\n      section [§] 148 . . . may, at the expiration of ninety\n      days after the filing of a complaint with the attorney\n      general, or sooner, if the attorney general assents in\n      writing, and within three years of such violation,\n      institute and prosecute in his own name and on his own\n      behalf, or for himself and for others similarly situated,\n      a civil action for injunctive relief and any damages\n      incurred, including treble damages for any loss of wages\n      and other benefits.\n\n                                     -11-\n\f(citing Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Comm'r of Labor & Indus., 163\n\nN.E.2d 19, 21 (Mass. 1959)).\n\n              Defendants acknowledge that when an employee is appointed\n\nto a position on an acting basis, that person is normally paid the\n\nwages for the higher position.               Though Prescott claims that he\n\nserved   as    Acting     General    Foreman    for    four    months   in   Maurice\n\nGarcía's absence, García's employee attendance calendar clearly\n\ndemonstrates that García was not away from work for more than two\n\nweeks.   Kathleen Kelley, the principal personnel officer for the\n\nCity, checked the City's records and spoke with managers in Central\n\nFleet Maintenance who confirmed this.                 Serving as Acting General\n\nForeman in a co-worker's absence is not the same as being appointed\n\nto the position.        Prescott's state law claim fails because he has\n\nnot demonstrated that he was deprived of wages that he earned.\n\n                      4.    Hostile Work Environment\n\n              To   make    out   a   prima     facie    case    of   hostile   work\n\nenvironment, a plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) he experienced uninvited harassment; (3) the\n\nharassment was racially-based; (4) the harassment was so severe or\n\npervasive as to create an abusive work environment; and (5) the\n\nharassment was objectively and subjectively offensive. Cf. Douglas\n\nv. J.C. Penney Co., 474 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2007).                         \"Under\n\nMassachusetts law, a hostile work environment is one that is\n\n'pervaded by harassment or abuse, with the resulting intimidation,\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fhumiliation, and stigmatization, [such that it] poses a formidable\n\nbarrier    to   the     full   participation       of    an    individual    in    the\n\nworkplace.'\"     Thompson, 522 F.3d at 180 (quoting Cuddyer v. Stop &\n\nShop Supermarket Co., 750 N.E.2d 928, 937 (Mass. 2001)).                    Prescott\n\nhas not shown that he was subjected to conduct that was extreme,\n\nhumiliating, or that unreasonably interfered with his ability to\n\nwork.     See id. (\"The environment must be sufficiently hostile or\n\nabusive    in   light    of    all   of   the    circumstances,     including      the\n\n'frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it\n\nis physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;      and   whether        it   unreasonably        interferes    with    an\n\nemployee's work performance.'\" (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca\n\nRatón, 524 U.S. 775, 787-88 (1998))).                   In fact, Prescott's own\n\nstatements undermine his claim of a hostile work environment.                       He\n\nacknowledges that in over twenty years of work for the City, he\n\nnever heard a single racist remark or joke; he also describes his\n\nrelationship with his supervisor, Higgins, as \"good.\" Prescott did\n\nnot put forth any evidence that he was subject to supervisory\n\nharassment by any individual that qualifies as a supervisor, i.e.,\n\nan individual with the authority to hire, fire, or demote.                         See\n\nNoviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 96 (1st Cir. 2005).                        We\n\ntherefore must agree with the district court that his hostile work\n\nenvironment claim is without basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f                           5.   Tortious Interference with Contract\n\n                 To establish a prima facie case for tortious interference\n\nwith       a    contract,       Prescott        must    show   that   (1)   a   business\n\nrelationship existed; (2) a defendant knowingly induced another\n\ndefendant to break the contract; (3) the defendant's interference\n\nwas intentional and improper; and (4) he was harmed as a result.\n\nSee Shea v. Emmanuel Coll., 682 N.E.2d 1348, 1350-51 (Mass. 1997)\n\n(citing Wright v. Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, 589 N.E.2d\n\n1241, 1245 (Mass. 1992)).                Prescott's argument to the effect that\n\nHiggins, or anyone else, tortiously interfered with a contract\n\nlacks legal sufficiency.             Though Prescott does not have a cause of\n\naction against the City for interfering with its own contract,\n\nthere could be one against Higgins personally were he to have\n\ntortiously interfered with a subordinate's employment relationship.\n\nSee Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit Union, 262 F.3d 70, 76 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).         Under this theory, Prescott would have had to show\n\nproof of actual malice by Higgins, but Higgins would be \"entitled\n\nto     a       qualified    privilege       in     an     employment-based      tortious\n\ninterference case (and, thus, will not be liable for employment\n\ndecisions that are within the scope of his supervisory duties).\"\n\nId.        Prescott    would      have     to    establish     that   \"malice   was   the\n\ncontrolling factor in the supervisor's interference.\" Id. (citing\n\nAlba v. Sampson, 690 N.E.2d 1240, 1243 (Mass. 1998)).                           There is\n\nnothing in the record to support a claim for malice.                        Prescott has\n\n\n                                                -14-\n\fthus   failed   to   make   out    a    prima   facie   case   for   tortious\n\ninterference with a contract, and this claim fails as well.\n\n                     6.   Retaliation\n\n           A prima facie case for retaliation is established if\n\nPrescott shows that (1) he engaged in protected conduct; (2) he was\n\nsubjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse\n\nemployment action is causally linked to the protected conduct. See\n\nNoviello, 398 F.3d at 88.         \"For a retaliation claim to survive a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must point to evidence\n\nin the record that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude\n\nthat the employment action was retaliatory.\" Thompson, 522 F.3d at\n\n181 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Prescott's retaliation\n\nclaim suffers the same fate as his other claims.          Prescott fails to\n\nestablish a prima facie case because he does not identify the\n\nprotected conduct that he supposedly engaged in.           We are thus not\n\nrequired to go further.           Nevertheless, as previously stated,\n\nDefendants have convincingly established that Prescott was not\n\nselected for the position because he was not qualified.              Thus, his\n\nclaim for retaliatory conduct fails.\n\n                     7.   Disability\n\n           Prescott argues that the defendants engaged in disability\n\ndiscrimination and harassment against him because they forced him\n\nto do work reading a computer screen right after he had eye surgery\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fand required him to lift heavy objects when he had a note saying\n\nthat he should not do any heavy lifting.\n\n                              a.    Rehabilitation Act Claim\n\n             Although        the    district       court        dismissed   Prescott's\n\ndisability        claims    because     he   did    not    exhaust       administrative\n\nremedies under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 791, exhaustion\n\nis not required under the Act.               See Brennan v. King, 139 F.3d 258,\n\n268 n.12 (1st Cir. 1998).               Nevertheless, Prescott's disability\n\nclaim was in any event subject to dismissal because he is not\n\ndisabled within the meaning of the Act.                    See 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)\n\n(B); Tardie v. Rehab. Hosp. of R.I., 168 F.3d 538, 542 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (\"In any claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff\n\nmust first establish that she has a disability covered by the Act.\"\n\n(citing Leary v. Dalton, 58 F.3d 748, 752 (1st Cir. 1995))).\n\nPrescott does not qualify as having a disability because he does\n\nnot have a permanent or long-term disability that substantially\n\naffects one or more of his major life activities, a requirement\n\nunder § 705.        See Rolland v. Potter, 492 F.3d 45, 47-48 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).       We    have    specifically      addressed      the     issue   of   lifting\n\nlimitations and held that limitations on lifting, without more, are\n\nnot a substantial limitation on a major life activity. See Gillen,\n\n283   F.3d    at    22     (\"[I]f   a   restriction        on    heavy    lifting   were\n\nconsidered a substantial limitation on a major life activity, then\n\nthe ranks of the disabled would swell to include infants, the\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\felderly, the weak, and the out-of-shape.\"). Furthermore, as to his\n\nvision problems, Prescott does not assert that they were long-term\n\nor permanent, and, in fact, he stated that they were resolved after\n\nsurgery.   The record shows that he was not required to work on a\n\ncomputer until after his vision improved. Consequently, Prescott's\n\ndisability claim fails for lack of a legal basis.\n\n                       b.   Massachusetts State Law Claim\n\n           Prescott's disability claims under Massachusetts state\n\nlaw were dismissed by the district court on procedural grounds\n\nbecause Prescott's disability claim is not reasonably related to a\n\nracial discrimination claim. Regardless of whether or not Prescott\n\nexhausted his claim, he does not meet the definition of \"handicap\"\n\nunder chapter 151B.2   See Dahill v. Police Dep't of Boston, 748\n\nN.E.2d 956, 963-64 (Mass. 2001).\n\n           Prescott must demonstrate that he is \"handicapped\" within\n\nthe meaning of chapter 151B by satisfying a three-step analysis:\n\nwe must determine (1) \"whether a plaintiff's condition, actual or\n\nperceived, constitutes a mental or physical 'impairment'\"; (2)\n\n\"whether the life activity curtailed constitutes a 'major' life\n\nactivity as defined in G.L. c. 151B, § 1(20), and its accompanying\n\n\n\n2\n  Under Massachusetts law, \"handicap\" is defined as \"a physical or\nmental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life\nactivities of a person; (b) a record of having such impairment; or\n(c) being regarded as having such impairment.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n151B, § 1(17). A \"handicapped person\" is defined as any person who\nhas a \"handicap\" under that statutory definition. Id. § 1(19).\n\n                                -17-\n\fregulations\"; (3) \"whether the impairment substantially limited the\n\nmajor life activity.\"       City of New Bedford v. Mass. Comm'n Against\n\nDiscrimination, 799 N.E.2d 578, 588-89 (Mass. 2003).             To meet his\n\nburden, Prescott must do more than submit evidence that he was\n\ndiagnosed with an impairment.          See id. at 589.        \"Rather, those\n\nseeking [G.L. c. 151B] protection must offer evidence that 'the\n\nextent of the limitation [caused by their impairment] in terms of\n\ntheir own experience . . . is substantial.'\"           Id. (quoting Carroll\n\nv. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir. 2002)).             Prescott has\n\noffered no such evidence, and he is, therefore, not handicapped\n\nwithin the meaning of chapter 151B.          There is no information in the\n\nrecord   that   he   has   a   permanent    or   long-term   disability   that\n\nsubstantially affects one or more of his major life activities.\n\nEven though \"working\" is a major life activity under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, Prescott has not demonstrated that he was \"substantially\n\nlimited\" in his ability to work.            His claims under Massachusetts\n\nstate law fail.\n\n                     8.    Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n           Prescott's cross-motion does not prosper for the same\n\nreasons that the City's motions were granted;           Prescott has failed\n\nto establish a prima facie case for any of his contentions.\n\n            III.     Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment\n\n           After the district court granted summary judgment to the\n\nDefendants and denied Prescott's cross-motion for summary judgment,\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fPrescott moved to alter the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 59(e).   The district court denied the motion.\n\n          We review the district court's denial of a Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion for abuse of discretion.   See Kansky v. Coca-Cola Bottling\n\nCo. of New Eng., 492 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2007).      \"Rule 59(e)\n\nmotions are granted only where the movant shows a manifest error of\n\nlaw or newly discovered evidence.\"     Id. (citing Marie v. Allied\n\nHome Mortgage Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 7 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005)).\n\n          Prescott points to no manifest error of law or newly\n\ndiscovered evidence. He merely restates the same arguments that he\n\nmade in his opposition to summary judgment and in his cross-motion\n\nfor summary judgment. \"The repetition of previous arguments is not\n\nsufficient to prevail on a Rule 59(e) motion.\"    United States v.\n\n$23,000 in U.S. Currency, 356 F.3d 157, 165 n.9 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing FDIC v. World Univ. Inc., 978 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\nAccordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when\n\nit denied the motion.\n\n                          IV.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the grant of\n\nsummary judgment for the Defendants, the denial of Prescott's\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment, and the denial of the motion to\n\nalter or amend the judgment.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

The selection committee  made up of two white males, one white female, and one African-American male  unanimously chose Horace Ryder, a white male. Prescott filed suit against the City, and two city supervisors in their personal and professional capacities (collectively \"the Defendants\"), under various federal and state laws for racial discrimination, disability discrimination, tortious interference with contract, harassment creating a hostile work environment, and retaliation. Defendants filed for summary judgment, and Prescott cross-motioned for summary judgment. The district court granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment and denied Prescott's cross-motion. Prescott appealed. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, here Prescott. <i>See </i><i>Ramos-Santiago v. United Parcel Serv.,</i> 524 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir. 2008). Prescott has been a city mechanic since 1984. In June 2002, the City posted a position for General Maintenance Mechanic Foreman, in Central Fleet Maintenance, Boston Public Works. Four city employees were interviewed for the position, including Prescott and Ryder. All four candidates were interviewed by four management-level supervisors in the Public Works Department: Jerry Coughlin (a white male), Maurice Smith (an African-American male), Kathy Kelley (a white female), and Prescott's supervisor, David Higgins (a white male). The interview focused on three main criteria: job knowledge, education, and experience.</p>\n<p>During the interview, applicants were asked seven objective questions regarding the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act Federal Out of Service Criteria, which delineates the federal standards for when vehicles are unsafe to drive. Prescott was unable to correctly answer any of the questions pertaining to the federal guidelines. Ryder answered all of the questions correctly. According to Prescott there were no questions during the interview that focused on education or instruction in the field of mechanics. He claims that there is no evidence that the City considered his performance evaluations. He contends that the interview process only rewarded those who could provide the \"right\" answers to the questions that were asked, questions he claims had no predictive ability for the likelihood of success as a General Foreman.</p>\n<p>The selection committee determined that Prescott and two other white candidates were not qualified for the position. The only committee member who thought that Prescott was qualified for the position was Smith. Smith, however, ranked Prescott <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> third out of the four candidates. The unanimous choice of the interview panel was Ryder. Ryder had ten more years of experience than the other candidates, and he also had more supervisory and administrative experience than them as well. Ryder had been the Acting General Foreman for six months before he was interviewed, and the panel determined that he had better job knowledge than the other candidates. The panel also determined that Ryder would have the least negative impact on work product because he was the one most familiar with the position.</p>\n<p>Prescott filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Committee Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") on October 10, 2002, alleging that he did not receive the promotion because of racial discrimination. Prescott does not claim, however, that anyone has ever made, or that he has ever heard, racist or derogatory comments about him or others. He did not make any claims pertaining to disability, retaliation, or lack of accommodation at the time. Prescott claims that he was more qualified than Ryder for the position and points to his nineteen years of experience as a mechanic and six years as a foreman. He also points to numerous certifications he has obtained during his time in the field. Prescott alleges that the City has made unsubstantiated claims that Ryder had supervisory experience. Prescott also alleges that Higgins was not concerned with the backgrounds of African-American employees or their schooling and that he simply did not promote African-American workers.</p>\n<p>Prescott contends that the selection criteria used by Higgins resulted in a less than eighty percent success rate for African-American applicants and that the selection criteria have had a disparate impact on African-American applicants.</p>\n<p>Prescott also alleges that he was not compensated for serving as Acting General Foreman in 2002 when, Maurice García, the then-General Foreman, was out on sick-leave. The difference in pay was $200 a week. Prescott filed a grievance with the union. Prescott also contends that he was required to work on a computer after he had eye surgery, and he was required to lift ten-pound items, which he was not supposed to do because of his surgery.</p>\n<p>MCAD dismissed Prescott's complaint, finding a lack of probable cause. On appeal, the dismissal was affirmed by the MCAD investigation Commissioner. Prescott filed suit in Superior Court in Suffolk County on January 24, 2006, and Defendants removed the case to federal district court on February 10, 2006. On March 6, 2007, the defendants filed for summary judgment, and on March 20, 2007, Prescott filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On August 27, 2007, the district court granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment and denied Prescott's cross-motion. The district court also denied Prescott's motion to take judicial notice of facts from a pending case and his motion to alter or amend the judgment. Prescott now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review a motion for summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> construing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See </i><i>Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co.,</i> 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir. 2008). We may ignore \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Medina-Muñoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990) (citing <i>Rossy v. Roche Products, Inc.,</i> 880 F.2d 621, 624 (1st Cir.1989)). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> We will reverse only if, \"after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the non-moving party [here, Prescott], the evidence on record is `sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.'\" <i>Maymí v. P.R. Ports Auth.,</i> 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p>\"Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits.\" <i>Thompson,</i> 522 F.3d at 175 (citing Fed. R. Civ P. 56(c)). \"A dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the non-moving party.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Sánchez v. Alvarado,</i> 101 F.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir. 1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"A fact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome of the litigation.\" <i>Maymí,</i> 515 F.3d at 25. To defeat a motion for summary judgment, evidence offered by the non-movant \"must be significantly probative of specific facts.\" <i>Pérez v. Volvo Car Corp.,</i> 247 F.3d 303, 317 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Discussion</h2>\n<p>Prescott appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment on discrimination claims for disparate treatment, disparate impact, compensation, hostile work environment, tortious interference with a contract, retaliation, and disability. He also challenges the district court's denial of his cross-motion for summary judgment. The familiar <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework governs Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 151B claims. <i>See </i><i>Villanueva v. Wellesley Coll.,</i> 930 F.2d 124, 127 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir. 1991). The problem Prescott faces is that he is unable to meet the prima facie burden that he is required to establish in the first step of <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i> Accordingly, all his discrimination claims must fail. We address each of his allegations in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Disparate Treatment</h2>\n<p>A plaintiff makes out a claim of disparate treatment by showing that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position he sought; (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action; and (4) the position remained open or was filled by someone else with similar qualifications. <i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> 331 F.3d 207, 212-13 (1st Cir.2003) (citations omitted). It is undisputed that Prescott is a member of a protected class. For Prescott to survive the motion for summary judgment, then, he needed to present evidence that showed that Ryder's qualifications were similar to his own. <i>See </i><i>Gu v. Boston Police Dep't,</i> 312 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir.2002). The district court found that he was unable to make that showing. We agree.</p>\n<p>Prescott was unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the interview panel that he was qualified for the position, and he failed to accurately answer the questions that the panel posed to him during his interview. His answer to several of the questions was that he was \"not sure.\" In contrast, Ryder was able to provide correct answers to each question, and he had ten years more seniority than Prescott.</p>\n<p>The district court was not required to consider Prescott's proffer of evidence of pretext because he was unable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> to get past the second requirement, that he was qualified for the contested position. <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> made clear that a Title VII plaintiff carries the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. <i>See </i><i>Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 846 F.2d 103, 107 (1st Cir.1988). Only after Prescott has satisfied his burden of showing a prima facie case, and the defendants have proffered a non-discriminatory reason for not promoting him, would we consider any evidence of discriminatory pretext. <i>See </i><i>Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc.,</i> 283 F.3d 11, 30 (1st Cir.2002). The record clearly indicates that Prescott was not qualified for the position he sought. Prescott was not able to meet his prima facie burden and thus his claim of disparate treatment is legally insufficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Disparate Impact</h2>\n<p>\"`[D]isparate impact' [claims] involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.\" <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> 507 U.S. 604, 609, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993) (quoting <i>Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 324, 335-36 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Bramble v. Am. Postal Workers Union,</i> 135 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1998). Prescott alleges that Defendants' hiring practices have a disparate impact on African-Americans because Defendants use selection procedures that result in a less than eighty percent success rate for African-American applicants, as compared with white applicants. While in his disparate impact claim Prescott is not required to show discriminatory motive, <i>see </i><i>Hazen Paper Co.,</i> 507 U.S. at 609, 113 S.Ct. 1701, he is required to show proof of a disproportionate impact on that African-Americans.</p>\n<p>Prescott has not introduced any evidence of disparate impact in this case. Rather, his appeal hinges on the district court's denial of his motion to take judicial notice of evidence submitted in another case which purports to show disparate impact. We review that evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bello,</i> 194 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.1999). The validity of the statistics and whether they showed disparate impact was at issue in that case. Therefore, the proof offered was not a \"matter beyond reasonable controversy,\" Fed.R.Evid. 201, advisory committee's note (Note to subdivision (b)), and there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Compensation</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Federal Law Claim</h2>\n<p>To make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in compensation under Title VII or § 1981, Prescott must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he met his employer's expectations; (3) he suffered adverse employment action with respect to compensation; and (4) similarly-situated employees outside the protected class received more favorable treatment. <i>See </i><i>White v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC,</i> 375 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). Prescott claims that he was discriminated against in compensation because he was not paid for the weeks when he served as Acting General Foreman while others performing the same work received higher compensation. Notwithstanding this claim, the evidence is clear that Prescott has not proven that he met his employer's expectations as an Acting General Foreman. Prescott also fails to meet the fourth prong of the prima facie test because he never put forth any evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> of similarly-situated employees who were given higher compensation. Since he has failed to establish a prima facie case, his claim of disparate compensation also fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Massachusetts State Law Claim</h2>\n<p>In addition to making a complaint under federal law, Prescott also claims that he was discriminated against in compensation under Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 149, §§ 148, 150. Section 148 provides that \"[e]very person having employees in his service shall pay . . . such employee the wages earned by him.\"<sup>[1]</sup> The purpose of § 148, is to prevent the \"unreasonable detention of wages [by employers].\" <i>Boston Police Patrolmen's Assoc., Inc., v. City of Boston,</i> 435 Mass. 718, 761 N.E.2d 479, 481 (Mass.2002) (citing <i>Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Comm'r of Labor &amp; Indus.,</i> 340 Mass. 144, 163 N.E.2d 19, 21 (Mass.1959)).</p>\n<p>Defendants acknowledge that when an employee is appointed to a position on an acting basis, that person is normally paid the wages for the higher position. Though Prescott claims that he served as Acting General Foreman for four months in Maurice García's absence, García's employee attendance calendar clearly demonstrates that García was not away from work for more than two weeks. Kathleen Kelley, the principal personnel officer for the City, checked the City's records and spoke with managers in Central Fleet Maintenance who confirmed this. Serving as Acting General Foreman in a co-worker's absence is not the same as being appointed to the position. Prescott's state law claim fails because he has not demonstrated that he was deprived of wages that he earned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Hostile Work Environment</h2>\n<p>To make out a prima facie case of hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he experienced uninvited harassment; (3) the harassment was racially-based; (4) the harassment was so severe or pervasive as to create an abusive work environment; and (5) the harassment was objectively and subjectively offensive. <i>Cf. </i><i>Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> 474 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir.2007). \"Under Massachusetts law, a hostile work environment is one that is `pervaded by harassment or abuse, with the resulting intimidation, humiliation, and stigmatization, [such that it] poses a formidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in the workplace.'\" <i>Thompson,</i> 522 F.3d at 180 (quoting <i>Cuddyer v. Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co.,</i> 434 Mass. 521, 750 N.E.2d 928, 937 (Mass.2001)). Prescott has not shown that he was subjected to conduct that was extreme, humiliating, or that unreasonably interfered with his ability to work. <i>See id.</i> (\"The environment must be sufficiently hostile or abusive in light of all of the circumstances, including the `frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'\" (quoting <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 787-88, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> L.Ed.2d 662 (1998))). In fact, Prescott's own statements undermine his claim of a hostile work environment. He acknowledges that in over twenty years of work for the City, he never heard a single racist remark or joke; he also describes his relationship with his supervisor, Higgins, as \"good.\" Prescott did not put forth any evidence that he was subject to supervisory harassment by any individual that qualifies as a supervisor, <i>i.e.,</i> an individual with the authority to hire, fire, or demote. <i>See </i><i>Noviello v. City of Boston,</i> 398 F.3d 76, 96 (1st Cir.2005). We therefore must agree with the district court that his hostile work environment claim is without basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Tortious Interference with Contract</h2>\n<p>To establish a prima facie case for tortious interference with a contract, Prescott must show that (1) a business relationship existed; (2) a defendant knowingly induced another defendant to break the contract; (3) the defendant's interference was intentional and improper; and (4) he was harmed as a result. <i>See </i><i>Shea v. Emmanuel Coll.,</i> 425 Mass. 761, 682 N.E.2d 1348, 1350-51 (Mass.1997) (citing <i>Wright v. Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children,</i> 412 Mass. 469, 589 N.E.2d 1241, 1245 (Mass.1992)). Prescott's argument to the effect that Higgins, or anyone else, tortiously interfered with a contract lacks legal sufficiency. Though Prescott does not have a cause of action against the City for interfering with its own contract, there could be one against Higgins personally were he to have tortiously interfered with a subordinate's employment relationship. <i>See </i><i>Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit Union,</i> 262 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2001). Under this theory, Prescott would have had to show proof of actual malice by Higgins, but Higgins would be \"entitled to a qualified privilege in an employment-based tortious interference case (and, thus, will not be liable for employment decisions that are within the scope of his supervisory duties).\" <i>Id.</i> Prescott would have to establish that \"malice was the controlling factor in the supervisor's interference.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Alba v. Sampson,</i> 44 Mass.App.Ct. 311, 690 N.E.2d 1240, 1243 (Mass.1998)). There is nothing in the record to support a claim for malice. Prescott has thus failed to make out a prima facie case for tortious interference with a contract, and this claim fails as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. Retaliation</h2>\n<p>A prima facie case for retaliation is established if Prescott shows that (1) he engaged in protected conduct; (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse employment action is causally linked to the protected conduct. <i>See </i><i>Noviello,</i> 398 F.3d at 88. \"For a retaliation claim to survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must point to evidence in the record that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the employment action was retaliatory.\" <i>Thompson,</i> 522 F.3d at 181 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Prescott's retaliation claim suffers the same fate as his other claims. Prescott fails to establish a prima facie case because he does not identify the protected conduct that he supposedly engaged in. We are thus not required to go further. Nevertheless, as previously stated, Defendants have convincingly established that Prescott was not selected for the position because he was not qualified. Thus, his claim for retaliatory conduct fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. Disability</h2>\n<p>Prescott argues that the defendants engaged in disability discrimination and harassment against him because they forced him to do work reading a computer screen right after he had eye surgery and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> required him to lift heavy objects when he had a note saying that he should not do any heavy lifting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Rehabilitation Act Claim</h2>\n<p>Although the district court dismissed Prescott's disability claims because he did not exhaust administrative remedies under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 791, exhaustion is not required under the Act. <i>See </i><i>Brennan v. King,</i> 139 F.3d 258, 268 n. 12 (1st Cir.1998). Nevertheless, Prescott's disability claim was in any event subject to dismissal because he is not disabled within the meaning of the Act. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B); <i>Tardie v. Rehab. Hosp. of R.I.,</i> 168 F.3d 538, 542 (1st Cir.1999) (\"In any claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must first establish that she has a disability covered by the Act.\" (citing <i>Leary v. Dalton,</i> 58 F.3d 748, 752 (1st Cir.1995))). Prescott does not qualify as having a disability because he does not have a permanent or long-term disability that substantially affects one or more of his major life activities, a requirement under § 705. <i>See </i><i>Rolland v. Potter,</i> 492 F.3d 45, 47-48 (1st Cir.2007). We have specifically addressed the issue of lifting limitations and held that limitations on lifting, without more, are not a substantial limitation on a major life activity. <i>See </i><i>Gillen,</i> 283 F.3d at 22 (\"[I]f a restriction on heavy lifting were considered a substantial limitation on a major life activity, then the ranks of the disabled would swell to include infants, the elderly, the weak, and the out-of-shape.\"). Furthermore, as to his vision problems, Prescott does not assert that they were long-term or permanent, and, in fact, he stated that they were resolved after surgery. The record shows that he was not required to work on a computer until after his vision improved. Consequently, Prescott's disability claim fails for lack of a legal basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Massachusetts State Law Claim</h2>\n<p>Prescott's disability claims under Massachusetts state law were dismissed by the district court on procedural grounds because Prescott's disability claim is not reasonably related to a racial discrimination claim. Regardless of whether or not Prescott exhausted his claim, he does not meet the definition of \"handicap\" under chapter 151B.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Dahill v. Police Dep't of Boston,</i> 434 Mass. 233, 748 N.E.2d 956, 963-64 (Mass.2001).</p>\n<p>Prescott must demonstrate that he is \"handicapped\" within the meaning of chapter 151B by satisfying a three-step analysis: we must determine (1) \"whether a plaintiff's condition, actual or perceived, constitutes a mental or physical `impairment'\"; (2) \"whether the life activity curtailed constitutes a `major' life activity as defined in G.L. c. 151B, § 1(20), and its accompanying regulations\"; (3) \"whether the impairment <i>substantially limited the major life activity.\" City of New Bedford v. Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination,</i> 440 Mass. 450, 799 N.E.2d 578, 588-89 (Mass.2003). To meet his burden, Prescott must do more than submit evidence that he was diagnosed with an impairment. <i>See id.</i> 440 Mass. 450, 799 N.E.2d at 589. \"Rather, those seeking [G.L. c. 151B] protection must offer evidence that `the extent of the limitation [caused by their impairment] in terms of their own experience . . . is substantial.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir.2002)). Prescott has offered no such evidence, and he is, therefore, not handicapped within the meaning of chapter 151B. There is no information in the record that he has a permanent or long-term disability that substantially affects one or more of his major life activities. Even though \"working\" is a major life activity under Massachusetts law, Prescott has not demonstrated that he was \"substantially limited\" in his ability to work. His claims under Massachusetts state law fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>8. Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment</h2>\n<p>Prescott's cross-motion does not prosper for the same reasons that the City's motions were granted; Prescott has failed to establish a prima facie case for any of his contentions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>After the district court granted summary judgment to the Defendants and denied Prescott's cross-motion for summary judgment, Prescott moved to alter the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Kansky v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of New Eng.,</i> 492 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir.2007). \"Rule 59(e) motions are granted only where the movant shows a manifest error of law or newly discovered evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Marie v. Allied Home Mortgage Corp.,</i> 402 F.3d 1, 7 n. 2 (1st Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p>Prescott points to no manifest error of law or newly discovered evidence. He merely restates the same arguments that he made in his opposition to summary judgment and in his cross-motion for summary judgment. \"The repetition of previous arguments is not sufficient to prevail on a Rule 59(e) motion.\" <i>United States v. $23,000 in U.S. Currency,</i> 356 F.3d 157, 165 n. 9 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>FDIC v. World Univ. Inc.,</i> 978 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1992)). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the Defendants, the denial of Prescott's cross-motion for summary judgment, and the denial of the motion to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon.

The selection committee  made up of two white males, one white female, and one African-American male  unanimously chose Horace Ryder, a white male. Prescott filed suit against the City, and two city supervisors in their personal and professional capacities (collectively \"the Defendants\"), under various federal and state laws for racial discrimination, disability discrimination, tortious interference with contract, harassment creating a hostile work environment, and retaliation. Defendants filed for summary judgment, and Prescott cross-motioned for summary judgment. The district court granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment and denied Prescott's cross-motion. Prescott appealed. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, here Prescott. <i>See </i><i>Ramos-Santiago v. United Parcel Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span>, 122 (1st Cir. 2008). Prescott has been a city mechanic since 1984. In June 2002, the City posted a position for General Maintenance Mechanic Foreman, in Central Fleet Maintenance, Boston Public Works. Four city employees were interviewed for the position, including Prescott and Ryder. All four candidates were interviewed by four management-level supervisors in the Public Works Department: Jerry Coughlin (a white male), Maurice Smith (an African-American male), Kathy Kelley (a white female), and Prescott's supervisor, David Higgins (a white male). The interview focused on three main criteria: job knowledge, education, and experience.</p>\n<p>During the interview, applicants were asked seven objective questions regarding the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act Federal Out of Service Criteria, which delineates the federal standards for when vehicles are unsafe to drive. Prescott was unable to correctly answer any of the questions pertaining to the federal guidelines. Ryder answered all of the questions correctly. According to Prescott there were no questions during the interview that focused on education or instruction in the field of mechanics. He claims that there is no evidence that the City considered his performance evaluations. He contends that the interview process only rewarded those who could provide the \"right\" answers to the questions that were asked, questions he claims had no predictive ability for the likelihood of success as a General Foreman.</p>\n<p>The selection committee determined that Prescott and two other white candidates were not qualified for the position. The only committee member who thought that Prescott was qualified for the position was Smith. Smith, however, ranked Prescott <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> third out of the four candidates. The unanimous choice of the interview panel was Ryder. Ryder had ten more years of experience than the other candidates, and he also had more supervisory and administrative experience than them as well. Ryder had been the Acting General Foreman for six months before he was interviewed, and the panel determined that he had better job knowledge than the other candidates. The panel also determined that Ryder would have the least negative impact on work product because he was the one most familiar with the position.</p>\n<p>Prescott filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Committee Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") on October 10, 2002, alleging that he did not receive the promotion because of racial discrimination. Prescott does not claim, however, that anyone has ever made, or that he has ever heard, racist or derogatory comments about him or others. He did not make any claims pertaining to disability, retaliation, or lack of accommodation at the time. Prescott claims that he was more qualified than Ryder for the position and points to his nineteen years of experience as a mechanic and six years as a foreman. He also points to numerous certifications he has obtained during his time in the field. Prescott alleges that the City has made unsubstantiated claims that Ryder had supervisory experience. Prescott also alleges that Higgins was not concerned with the backgrounds of African-American employees or their schooling and that he simply did not promote African-American workers.</p>\n<p>Prescott contends that the selection criteria used by Higgins resulted in a less than eighty percent success rate for African-American applicants and that the selection criteria have had a disparate impact on African-American applicants.</p>\n<p>Prescott also alleges that he was not compensated for serving as Acting General Foreman in 2002 when, Maurice García, the then-General Foreman, was out on sick-leave. The difference in pay was $200 a week. Prescott filed a grievance with the union. Prescott also contends that he was required to work on a computer after he had eye surgery, and he was required to lift ten-pound items, which he was not supposed to do because of his surgery.</p>\n<p>MCAD dismissed Prescott's complaint, finding a lack of probable cause. On appeal, the dismissal was affirmed by the MCAD investigation Commissioner. Prescott filed suit in Superior Court in Suffolk County on January 24, 2006, and Defendants removed the case to federal district court on February 10, 2006. On March 6, 2007, the defendants filed for summary judgment, and on March 20, 2007, Prescott filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On August 27, 2007, the district court granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment and denied Prescott's cross-motion. The district court also denied Prescott's motion to take judicial notice of facts from a pending case and his motion to alter or amend the judgment. Prescott now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.

He also challenges the district court's denial of his cross-motion for summary judgment. The familiar <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework governs Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 151B claims. <i>See </i><i>Villanueva v. Wellesley Coll.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558945\"><a href=\"/opinion/558945/tino-villanueva-v-wellesley-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 127 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir. 1991). The problem Prescott faces is that he is unable to meet the prima facie burden that he is required to establish in the first step of <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i> Accordingly, all his discrimination claims must fail. We address each of his allegations in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Disparate Treatment</h2>\n<p>A plaintiff makes out a claim of disparate treatment by showing that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position he sought; (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action; and (4) the position remained open or was filled by someone else with similar qualifications. <i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200505\"><a href=\"/opinion/200505/kosereis-v-department-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 212-13 (1st Cir.2003) (citations omitted). It is undisputed that Prescott is a member of a protected class. For Prescott to survive the motion for summary judgment, then, he needed to present evidence that showed that Ryder's qualifications were similar to his own. <i>See </i><i>Gu v. Boston Police Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200231\"><a href=\"/opinion/200231/gu-v-boston-police-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2002). The district court found that he was unable to make that showing. We agree.</p>\n<p>Prescott was unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the interview panel that he was qualified for the position, and he failed to accurately answer the questions that the panel posed to him during his interview. His answer to several of the questions was that he was \"not sure.\" In contrast, Ryder was able to provide correct answers to each question, and he had ten years more seniority than Prescott.</p>\n<p>The district court was not required to consider Prescott's proffer of evidence of pretext because he was unable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> to get past the second requirement, that he was qualified for the contested position. <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> made clear that a Title VII plaintiff carries the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. <i>See </i><i>Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505831\"><a href=\"/opinion/505831/46-fair-emplpraccas-1535-46-empl-prac-dec-p-37989-norman-w-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir.1988). Only after Prescott has satisfied his burden of showing a prima facie case, and the defendants have proffered a non-discriminatory reason for not promoting him, would we consider any evidence of discriminatory pretext. <i>See </i><i>Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199872\"><a href=\"/opinion/199872/gillen-v-fallon-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2002). The record clearly indicates that Prescott was not qualified for the position he sought. Prescott was not able to meet his prima facie burden and thus his claim of disparate treatment is legally insufficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Disparate Impact</h2>\n<p>\"`[D]isparate impact' [claims] involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.\" <i>Hazen Paper Co. v.

Prescott alleges that Defendants' hiring practices have a disparate impact on African-Americans because Defendants use selection procedures that result in a less than eighty percent success rate for African-American applicants, as compared with white applicants. While in his disparate impact claim Prescott is not required to show discriminatory motive, <i>see </i><i>Hazen Paper Co.,</i> 507 U.S. at 609, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112844\"><a href=\"/opinion/112844/hazen-paper-co-v-biggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1701</span></a></span>, he is required to show proof of a disproportionate impact on that African-Americans.</p>\n<p>Prescott has not introduced any evidence of disparate impact in this case. Rather, his appeal hinges on the district court's denial of his motion to take judicial notice of evidence submitted in another case which purports to show disparate impact. We review that evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198683\"><a href=\"/opinion/198683/united-states-v-bello/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1999). The validity of the statistics and whether they showed disparate impact was at issue in that case. Therefore, the proof offered was not a \"matter beyond reasonable controversy,\" Fed.R.Evid. 201, advisory committee's note (Note to subdivision (b)), and there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Compensation</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Federal Law Claim</h2>\n<p>To make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in compensation under Title VII or § 1981, Prescott must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he met his employer's expectations; (3) he suffered adverse employment action with respect to compensation; and (4) similarly-situated employees outside the protected class received more favorable treatment. <i>See </i><i>White v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786900\"><a href=\"/opinion/786900/arnold-white-v-bfi-waste-services-llc-delbert-gaskins-v-bfi-waste/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 295 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973)). Prescott claims that he was discriminated against in compensation because he was not paid for the weeks when he served as Acting General Foreman while others performing the same work received higher compensation. Notwithstanding this claim, the evidence is clear that Prescott has not proven that he met his employer's expectations as an Acting General Foreman. Prescott also fails to meet the fourth prong of the prima facie test because he never put forth any evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> of similarly-situated employees who were given higher compensation. Since he has failed to establish a prima facie case, his claim of disparate compensation also fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Massachusetts State Law Claim</h2>\n<p>In addition to making a complaint under federal law, Prescott also claims that he was discriminated against in compensation under Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 149, §§ 148, 150. Section 148 provides that \"[e]very person having employees in his service shall pay . . . such employee the wages earned by him.\"<sup>[1]</sup> The purpose of § 148, is to prevent the \"unreasonable detention of wages [by employers].\" <i>Boston Police Patrolmen's Assoc., Inc., v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></span>, 481 (Mass.2002) (citing <i>Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Comm'r of Labor &amp; Indus.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span>, 21 (Mass.1959)).</p>\n<p>Defendants acknowledge that when an employee is appointed to a position on an acting basis, that person is normally paid the wages for the higher position. Though Prescott claims that he served as Acting General Foreman for four months in Maurice García's absence, García's employee attendance calendar clearly demonstrates that García was not away from work for more than two weeks. Kathleen Kelley, the principal personnel officer for the City, checked the City's records and spoke with managers in Central Fleet Maintenance who confirmed this. Serving as Acting General Foreman in a co-worker's absence is not the same as being appointed to the position. Prescott's state law claim fails because he has not demonstrated that he was deprived of wages that he earned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Hostile Work Environment</h2>\n<p>To make out a prima facie case of hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he experienced uninvited harassment; (3) the harassment was racially-based; (4) the harassment was so severe or pervasive as to create an abusive work environment; and (5) the harassment was objectively and subjectively offensive. <i>Cf. </i><i>Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202597\"><a href=\"/opinion/202597/douglas-v-jc-penney-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2007). \"Under Massachusetts law, a hostile work environment is one that is `pervaded by harassment or abuse, with the resulting intimidation, humiliation, and stigmatization, [such that it] poses a formidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in the workplace.'\" <i>Thompson,</i> 522 F.3d at 180 (quoting <i>Cuddyer v. Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span>, 937 (Mass.2001)). Prescott has not shown that he was subjected to conduct that was extreme, humiliating, or that unreasonably interfered with his ability to work. <i>See id.</i> (\"The environment must be sufficiently hostile or abusive in light of all of the circumstances, including the `frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'\" (quoting <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 787-88, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2275</span></a></span>, 141 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> L.Ed.2d 662 (1998))). In fact, Prescott's own statements undermine his claim of a hostile work environment. He acknowledges that in over twenty years of work for the City, he never heard a single racist remark or joke; he also describes his relationship with his supervisor, Higgins, as \"good.\" Prescott did not put forth any evidence that he was subject to supervisory harassment by any individual that qualifies as a supervisor, <i>i.e.,</i> an individual with the authority to hire, fire, or demote. <i>See </i><i>Noviello v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201453\"><a href=\"/opinion/201453/noviello-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 96 (1st Cir.2005). We therefore must agree with the district court that his hostile work environment claim is without basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Tortious Interference with Contract</h2>\n<p>To establish a prima facie case for tortious interference with a contract, Prescott must show that (1) a business relationship existed; (2) a defendant knowingly induced another defendant to break the contract; (3) the defendant's interference was intentional and improper; and (4) he was harmed as a result. <i>See </i><i>Shea v. Emmanuel Coll.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1348</span></span>, 1350-51 (Mass.1997) (citing <i>Wright v. Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></span>, 1245 (Mass.1992)). Prescott's argument to the effect that Higgins, or anyone else, tortiously interfered with a contract lacks legal sufficiency. Though Prescott does not have a cause of action against the City for interfering with its own contract, there could be one against Higgins personally were he to have tortiously interfered with a subordinate's employment relationship. <i>See </i><i>Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774578\"><a href=\"/opinion/774578/celia-g-zimmerman-v-direct-federal-credit-union-and-david-breslin/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2001). Under this theory, Prescott would have had to show proof of actual malice by Higgins, but Higgins would be \"entitled to a qualified privilege in an employment-based tortious interference case (and, thus, will not be liable for employment decisions that are within the scope of his supervisory duties).\" <i>Id.</i> Prescott would have to establish that \"malice was the controlling factor in the supervisor's interference.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Alba v. Sampson,</i> 44 Mass.App.Ct. 311, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1240</span></span>, 1243 (Mass.1998)). There is nothing in the record to support a claim for malice. Prescott has thus failed to make out a prima facie case for tortious interference with a contract, and this claim fails as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. Retaliation</h2>\n<p>A prima facie case for retaliation is established if Prescott shows that (1) he engaged in protected conduct; (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse employment action is causally linked to the protected conduct. <i>See </i><i>Noviello,</i> 398 F.3d at 88. \"For a retaliation claim to survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must point to evidence in the record that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the employment action was retaliatory.\" <i>Thompson,</i> 522 F.3d at 181 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Prescott's retaliation claim suffers the same fate as his other claims. Prescott fails to establish a prima facie case because he does not identify the protected conduct that he supposedly engaged in. We are thus not required to go further. Nevertheless, as previously stated, Defendants have convincingly established that Prescott was not selected for the position because he was not qualified. Thus, his claim for retaliatory conduct fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. Disability</h2>\n<p>Prescott argues that the defendants engaged in disability discrimination and harassment against him because they forced him to do work reading a computer screen right after he had eye surgery and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> required him to lift heavy objects when he had a note saying that he should not do any heavy lifting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Rehabilitation Act Claim</h2>\n<p>Although the district court dismissed Prescott's disability claims because he did not exhaust administrative remedies under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 791, exhaustion is not required under the Act. <i>See </i><i>Brennan v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197854\"><a href=\"/opinion/197854/brennan-v-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 268 n. 12 (1st Cir.1998). Nevertheless, Prescott's disability claim was in any event subject to dismissal because he is not disabled within the meaning of the Act. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B); <i>Tardie v. Rehab. Hosp. of R.I.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198333\"><a href=\"/opinion/198333/tardie-v-rehabilitation/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 542 (1st Cir.1999) (\"In any claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must first establish that she has a disability covered by the Act.\" (citing <i>Leary v. Dalton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196146\"><a href=\"/opinion/196146/leary-v-navy-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 752 (1st Cir.1995))). Prescott does not qualify as having a disability because he does not have a permanent or long-term disability that substantially affects one or more of his major life activities, a requirement under § 705. <i>See </i><i>Rolland v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202826\"><a href=\"/opinion/202826/rolland-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 47-48 (1st Cir.2007). We have specifically addressed the issue of lifting limitations and held that limitations on lifting, without more, are not a substantial limitation on a major life activity. <i>See </i><i>Gillen,</i> 283 F.3d at 22 (\"[I]f a restriction on heavy lifting were considered a substantial limitation on a major life activity, then the ranks of the disabled would swell to include infants, the elderly, the weak, and the out-of-shape.\"). Furthermore, as to his vision problems, Prescott does not assert that they were long-term or permanent, and, in fact, he stated that they were resolved after surgery. The record shows that he was not required to work on a computer until after his vision improved. Consequently, Prescott's disability claim fails for lack of a legal basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Massachusetts State Law Claim</h2>\n<p>Prescott's disability claims under Massachusetts state law were dismissed by the district court on procedural grounds because Prescott's disability claim is not reasonably related to a racial discrimination claim. Regardless of whether or not Prescott exhausted his claim, he does not meet the definition of \"handicap\" under chapter 151B.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Dahill v. Police Dep't of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></span>, 963-64 (Mass.2001).</p>\n<p>Prescott must demonstrate that he is \"handicapped\" within the meaning of chapter 151B by satisfying a three-step analysis: we must determine (1) \"whether a plaintiff's condition, actual or perceived, constitutes a mental or physical `impairment'\"; (2) \"whether the life activity curtailed constitutes a `major' life activity as defined in G.L. c. 151B, § 1(20), and its accompanying regulations\"; (3) \"whether the impairment <i>substantially limited the major life activity.\" City of New Bedford v. Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></span>, 588-89 (Mass.2003). To meet his burden, Prescott must do more than submit evidence that he was diagnosed with an impairment. <i>See id.</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></span>, 799 N.E.2d at 589. \"Rather, those seeking [G.L. c. 151B] protection must offer evidence that `the extent of the limitation [caused by their impairment] in terms of their own experience . . . is substantial.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir.2002)). Prescott has offered no such evidence, and he is, therefore, not handicapped within the meaning of chapter 151B. There is no information in the record that he has a permanent or long-term disability that substantially affects one or more of his major life activities. Even though \"working\" is a major life activity under Massachusetts law, Prescott has not demonstrated that he was \"substantially limited\" in his ability to work. His claims under Massachusetts state law fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>8. Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment</h2>\n<p>Prescott's cross-motion does not prosper for the same reasons that the City's motions were granted; Prescott has failed to establish a prima facie case for any of his contentions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>After the district court granted summary judgment to the Defendants and denied Prescott's cross-motion for summary judgment, Prescott moved to alter the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Kansky v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of New Eng.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202829\"><a href=\"/opinion/202829/kansky-v-coca-cola-bottling-co-of-new-england/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2007). \"Rule 59(e) motions are granted only where the movant shows a manifest error of law or newly discovered evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Marie v.

He merely restates the same arguments that he made in his opposition to summary judgment and in his cross-motion for summary judgment. \"The repetition of previous arguments is not sufficient to prevail on a Rule 59(e) motion.\" <i>United States v. $23,000 in U.S. Currency,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200829\"><a href=\"/opinion/200829/united-states-v-rodriguez-barrientos/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 165 n. 9 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>FDIC v.
