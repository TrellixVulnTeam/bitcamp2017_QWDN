We affirm the judgment of dismissal\n\nsubstantially for the reasons set forth in the magistrate\n\njudge's Report and Recommendation dated April 13, 2006, which\n\nthe district judge adopted in an Order dated May 5, 2006.               We\n\nadd only the following comments.\n\n           A    commercial   dispute      between   Bahig    Bishay     and\n\nBrighton   Avenue    Associates,    LLC   (\"BAA\")   was     submitted    to\n\narbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association\n\n(\"AAA\").       In due course, a three-member arbitration panel\n\nissued a final award mostly favorable to BAA.               Dissatisfied\n\nwith the result, Bishay filed the instant pro se action against\n\nboth AAA and BAA, alleging that the award had been \"procured by\n\ncorruption, fraud, or undue means\" within the meaning of the\n\nFederal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. ยง 10(a)(1).            Federal\n\njurisdiction was premised on diversity of citizenship.                  Cf.\n\nBull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 328 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (\"the FAA itself does not create a basis for federal\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction\"). Defendants moved to dismiss for\n\nlack of jurisdiction (among other grounds)--contending that,\n\nbecause Bishay and BAA were both citizens of Massachusetts, the\n\nrequisite \"complete diversity of citizenship\" was lacking.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 68 (1996).                      The\n\ndistrict court agreed and dismissed on that basis.\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f              Bishay advances a single challenge to this ruling--\n\ninsisting that, because BAA is only a \"nominal\" party to the\n\ndispute, its citizenship can be disregarded for purposes of\n\ndetermining diversity.           See, e.g., Navarro Savings Ass'n v.\n\nLee, 446 U.S. 458, 461 (1980) (\"a federal court must disregard\n\nnominal or formal parties and rest jurisdiction only upon the\n\ncitizenship      of    real    parties    to    the    controversy\").     He\n\ncharacterizes the instant suit as a simple contract dispute\n\nbetween himself and AAA.            In his view, he enlisted AAA to\n\nperform a service; AAA failed to do so; and so he is entitled\n\nto a refund of all monies he paid to AAA.\n\n              Yet Bishay's complaint sought much more than a refund\n\nfrom   AAA;    it     also    requested   a    court   order   vacating   the\n\narbitration award and directing that his commercial dispute\n\nwith BAA be considered de novo by a new arbitration panel\n\nunaffiliated with AAA (or by the court itself). Given that the\n\naward was predominantly in BAA's favor, Bishay is thus mistaken\n\nin arguing that BAA was a nominal party with \"no interest in\n\nthe controversy.\"        Salem Trust Co. v. Mfrs.' Finance Co., 264\n\nU.S. 182, 190 (1924); see, e.g., H.D. Corp. of Puerto Rico v.\n\nFord Motor Co., 791 F.2d 987, 992 (1st Cir. 1986) (noting that\n\none factor in determining whether citizenship of non-diverse\n\nparty can be disregarded is \"to what extent a judgment rendered\n\nin the person's absence might be prejudicial\" to that party)\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b)).   We therefore agree with the\n\ndistrict court that complete diversity of citizenship was\n\nabsent and that the court consequently lacked jurisdiction.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -4-\n\f",
