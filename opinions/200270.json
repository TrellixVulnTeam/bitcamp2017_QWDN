Tama Donovan and\nHale and Door LLP were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        December 31, 2002\n\f            COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge. These consolidated appeals\n\nresult from the district court’s grant of summary judgment to\ndefendants-appellees, New England Electrical System (NEES) and\n\nrelated organizations, affirming the decision of the NEES Benefits\n\nAppeal Committee to deny severance benefits under the Standard\nSeverance Plan (Plan) to plaintiffs-appellants.\n\n             The district court’s Memorandum of Decision of March 29,\n\n2002, set forth the relevant facts: the terms of the Plan, the sale\n\nof power generating assets to U.S. Gen Acquisition Corporation\n\n(USGen), the termination of appellants’ employment with NEES, and\n\ntheir     immediate,       uninterrupted             employment        with       equivalent\n\ncompensation and benefits by USGen.                       We reiterate the highly\n\ndeferential standard of review applicable to this case because the\n\nPlan    explicitly       gives    the     Plan       administrator          discretion    to\n\ninterpret    the    Plan's       terms:    a    decision      will     be    overruled    as\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" only if it was \"unreasonable in light of\n\nthe information available to it.\" Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life\n\n& Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir. 2000).\n            The     district       court       also    set     forth        the   reasoning\n\nunderlying its decision, that the key words, \"permanently released\n\nfrom employment for reasons beyond [the employees’] control,\" were\n\nambiguous.     The court concluded that extrinsic evidence, such as\nthe past practice of NEES to apply its Plan only to individual\nterminations       and   its     devising       of    plans    such     as    the   Special\n\nSeverance Plan to cover major corporate reorganizations, rendered\nthe     decision    of     the     NEES        Benefits       Appeal     Committee       not\n\n                                           -4-\n\funreasonable, and therefore, not arbitrary and capricious.              We\n\naffirm the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees,\n\nrelying substantially on the district court opinion and adding only\nthe following to reflect more fully points advanced in briefs and\n\narguments before us.\n\n          We   begin    with   the    keystone   of   our   decision,   our\n\nconclusion that, in the context of this case and the specific Plan\n\ninvolved, the words \"permanently released from employment for\n\nreasons beyond their control\" are ambiguous.          The phrase contains\n\nvarying degrees of ambiguity.        The first is the language \"released\n\nfrom employment.\"      Appellants insist that this should be construed\n\nas \"released from employment by NEES.\" The question is not whether\nthis is a reasonable interpretation, but whether it is the only\nreasonable interpretation; otherwise, appellants fail at their\n\nthreshold argument that the language is unambiguous in compelling\nthe result they seek.\n          Dictionary definitions of \"employment\"             include such\n\nphrases as \"the state of being employed\" and \"an occupation by\nwhich a person earns a living.\"       The Random House Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 638 (2d ed. 1987).        If employees at no time were\n\nseparated from the \"state of being employed,\" it would follow that\n\nthey were not \"released\" from that state -- by NEES or anyone else.\n\nThis interpretation does not seem to us unreasonable.             It also\n\naccords with a common sense judgment that if one continues without\n\ninterruption   to do the same work in the same place for similar pay\n\nand benefits, he has not been out of a job.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          A second source of ambiguity is the word \"permanently.\"\n\nOne interpretation, favorable to appellees, is that the action of\n\nNEES in accomplishing the transfer of employees to USGen without a\nbreak in service, loss of pay, or absence from the job, did not\n\nconstitute a \"permanent\" release from employment.                Appellants\n\ncounter by arguing that \"permanently\" has to mean \"permanently\n\nreleased from employment with NEES,\" because if it meant released\n\nfrom something other than employment with NEES, it would mean any\n\nwork anywhere, in any vocation, and there would be no way to\n\ndetermine when a person would ever qualify for benefits. This, say\n\nappellants, is tantamount to a requirement that a person \"never\n\nagain work at all.\"      This argument not only requires us to construe\n\"permanently\" in an extreme sense, far beyond common understanding,\nbut it falls of its own weight – for it is vulnerable to the same\n\nreasoning.       That is, an appellant, now working with USGen and\nterminated from NEES, may in the future find reemployment with NEES\nand therefore would never be eligible for benefits.           In any event,\n\nwhatever the validity of this argument, it falls short of being the\nonly rational interpretation of the language.\n             A   third   example   of    the   phrase's   ambiguity   is   the\n\npreclusion of applicability of the Plan to anyone who voluntarily\n\naccepted a job at USGen.       See Allen v. Adage, Inc., 967 F.2d 695,\n\n699 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that a ruling may be made \"against the\n\nbackdrop of a particular set of plan provisions\").             The Benefits\n\nAppeal Committee, as did the Severance Committee, reasoned that the\n\nclaimants had the option of not accepting a job with USGen and of\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fparticipating      in     the   process      of    being   considered         for   other\n\npositions with NEES.        This is closer to the line, but we cannot say\n\nthat the concept of \"voluntary\" is entirely free of ambiguity.\n            There is more.       Appellants rightly call our attention to\n\nthe Preamble of the Plan, Article 1.1, in which the \"purpose\" of\n\nthe Plan is described as \"to provide severance benefits to regular\n\nfull-time and part-time non-union employees who are permanently\n\nreleased    from    the    Company     for    reasons      beyond     the     employee’s\n\ncontrol.\"    On the other hand, the Summary Plan Description (SPD)\n\nbegins by stating that it was \"designed to help ease the financial\n\nand emotional hardship that can occur if you are involuntarily\n\nterminated for reasons beyond your control.\" As the Second Circuit\nhas stated in Moore v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 856 F.2d 488 (2d\n\nCir. 1988), \"Congress intended that plan documents and the SPDs\n\nexclusively govern an employer’s obligations under ERISA plans.\"\nId. at 492.        Moreover, the inclusion in the Plan of provisions\ndealing with outplacement services (including job search and career\n\ncounseling guidance) and healthcare strongly point to minimizing\nhardship as a motivating force of the Plan.\n            The    district     court     did     not   err     in   ruling     that   the\n\ncritical Plan       language     was    ambiguous.         So    ruling,      the   court\n\nproperly considered extrinsic evidence including past practice, the\n\nnotices    given    appellants,        and   the    provisions       of   the    Special\n\nSeverance Plan, as well as the fact that appellants proffered no\n\nextrinsic evidence supporting their eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            The outcome accords with our pronouncement in Allen:\n\n            Whatever the exact ramifications of the highly\n            nuanced phrase \"reduction-in-force,\" [read\n            \"permanently released from employment\"] that\n            term would rarely be thought to cover, for\n            severance pay purposes, the selling of a\n            division    to    another     company    under\n            circumstances in which the work force is kept\n            solidly in place by the purchaser, doing\n            roughly comparable work for roughly comparable\n            wages.\n\nAllen, 967 F.2d at 700.           This statement is particularly pertinent\n\nwhen we consider the context in which this case arises -- the major\n\nreshuffling of a company involving a large mass of workers with\n\nwidely     differing      problems      of     and    approaches   to     employment\nreadjustment.\n            Finally, we stress the criticality of the deferential\n\nstandard of review. Only arbitrary and capricious decisions by the\nPlan    administrator      will    be    set    aside.     A   plethora    of   cases\ninvolving severance provisions in ERISA plans can be cited.                       But\n\nresults often turn on whether a de novo or a deferential standard\napplies.        A dramatic example is a case heavily relied on by\nappellants, Anstett v. Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc., 203 F.3d 501\n\n(7th Cir. 2000).          The court, in a de novo review, construed\n\"terminated\" in a severance plan to cover the situation where a\n\ndivision is sold to a buyer that immediately reemploys the workers.\n\nThe court called attention to its prior contrary holding on similar\n\nfacts in Sly v.     P.R. Mallory & Co., 712 F.2d 1209 (7th Cir. 1983),\n\nexplaining that Sly involved deferential review and that the court\n\nthere    \"was    simply    upholding         the     administrator’s    reading   as\nreasonable.\"      Anstett, 203          F.3d at 506.      Similarly, in the more\n\n                                          -8-\n\frecent case of James v. General Motors Corp., 230 F.3d 315 (7th\n\nCir.    2000),    the    court,    reviewing    a   plan   involving    the   word\n\n\"terminated,\" explained that \"[b]ecause the plan [in Anstett] did\nnot grant discretion to the administrator, we looked at it de novo\n\nand held [the employer] to the letter of its benefit package.\"                Id.\n\nat 318.    Given that the arbitrary and capricious standard applies\n\nhere, and considering that the extrinsic evidence weighed heavily\n\nin favor of appellees' interpretation of the Plan, the district\n\ncourt    did    not     err   in   concluding   that   the   Benefits    Appeals\n\nCommittee's denial was not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n               Appellants here faced a very high hurdle.               They have\n\nargued forcefully for their interpretation.                  But they had the\nchallenge of showing a lack of ambiguity in the terms such that no\nother interpretation fell within reasonable bounds.               We hold that\n\nthis challenge was not met.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f",

The court concluded that extrinsic evidence, such as\nthe past practice of NEES to apply its Plan only to individual\nterminations       and   its     devising       of    plans    such     as    the   Special\n\nSeverance Plan to cover major corporate reorganizations, rendered\nthe     decision    of     the     NEES        Benefits       Appeal     Committee       not\n\n                                           -4-\n\funreasonable, and therefore, not arbitrary and capricious.              We\n\naffirm the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees,\n\nrelying substantially on the district court opinion and adding only\nthe following to reflect more fully points advanced in briefs and\n\narguments before us.\n\n          We   begin    with   the    keystone   of   our   decision,   our\n\nconclusion that, in the context of this case and the specific Plan\n\ninvolved, the words \"permanently released from employment for\n\nreasons beyond their control\" are ambiguous.          The phrase contains\n\nvarying degrees of ambiguity.        The first is the language \"released\n\nfrom employment.\"      Appellants insist that this should be construed\n\nas \"released from employment by NEES.\" The question is not whether\nthis is a reasonable interpretation, but whether it is the only\nreasonable interpretation; otherwise, appellants fail at their\n\nthreshold argument that the language is unambiguous in compelling\nthe result they seek.\n          Dictionary definitions of \"employment\"             include such\n\nphrases as \"the state of being employed\" and \"an occupation by\nwhich a person earns a living.\"       The Random House Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 638 (2d ed. 1987).        If employees at no time were\n\nseparated from the \"state of being employed,\" it would follow that\n\nthey were not \"released\" from that state -- by NEES or anyone else.\n\nThis interpretation does not seem to us unreasonable.             It also\n\naccords with a common sense judgment that if one continues without\n\ninterruption   to do the same work in the same place for similar pay\n\nand benefits, he has not been out of a job.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          A second source of ambiguity is the word \"permanently.\"\n\nOne interpretation, favorable to appellees, is that the action of\n\nNEES in accomplishing the transfer of employees to USGen without a\nbreak in service, loss of pay, or absence from the job, did not\n\nconstitute a \"permanent\" release from employment.                Appellants\n\ncounter by arguing that \"permanently\" has to mean \"permanently\n\nreleased from employment with NEES,\" because if it meant released\n\nfrom something other than employment with NEES, it would mean any\n\nwork anywhere, in any vocation, and there would be no way to\n\ndetermine when a person would ever qualify for benefits. This, say\n\nappellants, is tantamount to a requirement that a person \"never\n\nagain work at all.\"      This argument not only requires us to construe\n\"permanently\" in an extreme sense, far beyond common understanding,\nbut it falls of its own weight – for it is vulnerable to the same\n\nreasoning.       That is, an appellant, now working with USGen and\nterminated from NEES, may in the future find reemployment with NEES\nand therefore would never be eligible for benefits.           In any event,\n\nwhatever the validity of this argument, it falls short of being the\nonly rational interpretation of the language.\n             A   third   example   of    the   phrase's   ambiguity   is   the\n\npreclusion of applicability of the Plan to anyone who voluntarily\n\naccepted a job at USGen.       See Allen v. Adage, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585780\"><a href=\"/opinion/585780/richard-g-allen-v-adage-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n699 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that a ruling may be made \"against the\n\nbackdrop of a particular set of plan provisions\").             The Benefits\n\nAppeal Committee, as did the Severance Committee, reasoned that the\n\nclaimants had the option of not accepting a job with USGen and of\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fparticipating      in     the   process      of    being   considered         for   other\n\npositions with NEES.        This is closer to the line, but we cannot say\n\nthat the concept of \"voluntary\" is entirely free of ambiguity.\n            There is more.       Appellants rightly call our attention to\n\nthe Preamble of the Plan, Article 1.1, in which the \"purpose\" of\n\nthe Plan is described as \"to provide severance benefits to regular\n\nfull-time and part-time non-union employees who are permanently\n\nreleased    from    the    Company     for    reasons      beyond     the     employee’s\n\ncontrol.\"    On the other hand, the Summary Plan Description (SPD)\n\nbegins by stating that it was \"designed to help ease the financial\n\nand emotional hardship that can occur if you are involuntarily\n\nterminated for reasons beyond your control.\" As the Second Circuit\nhas stated in Moore v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511579\"><a href=\"/opinion/511579/richard-a-moore-and-mary-amstad-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d\n\nCir. 1988), \"Congress intended that plan documents and the SPDs\n\nexclusively govern an employer’s obligations under ERISA plans.\"\nId. at 492.        Moreover, the inclusion in the Plan of provisions\ndealing with outplacement services (including job search and career\n\ncounseling guidance) and healthcare strongly point to minimizing\nhardship as a motivating force of the Plan.\n            The    district     court     did     not   err     in   ruling     that   the\n\ncritical Plan       language     was    ambiguous.         So    ruling,      the   court\n\nproperly considered extrinsic evidence including past practice, the\n\nnotices    given    appellants,        and   the    provisions       of   the    Special\n\nSeverance Plan, as well as the fact that appellants proffered no\n\nextrinsic evidence supporting their eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            The outcome accords with our pronouncement in Allen:\n\n            Whatever the exact ramifications of the highly\n            nuanced phrase \"reduction-in-force,\" [read\n            \"permanently released from employment\"] that\n            term would rarely be thought to cover, for\n            severance pay purposes, the selling of a\n            division    to    another     company    under\n            circumstances in which the work force is kept\n            solidly in place by the purchaser, doing\n            roughly comparable work for roughly comparable\n            wages.\n\nAllen, 967 F.2d at 700.           This statement is particularly pertinent\n\nwhen we consider the context in which this case arises -- the major\n\nreshuffling of a company involving a large mass of workers with\n\nwidely     differing      problems      of     and    approaches   to     employment\nreadjustment.\n            Finally, we stress the criticality of the deferential\n\nstandard of review. Only arbitrary and capricious decisions by the\nPlan    administrator      will    be    set    aside.     A   plethora    of   cases\ninvolving severance provisions in ERISA plans can be cited.                       But\n\nresults often turn on whether a de novo or a deferential standard\napplies.        A dramatic example is a case heavily relied on by\nappellants, Anstett v.

The court, in a de novo review, construed\n\"terminated\" in a severance plan to cover the situation where a\n\ndivision is sold to a buyer that immediately reemploys the workers.\n\nThe court called attention to its prior contrary holding on similar\n\nfacts in Sly v.

Similarly, in the more\n\n                                          -8-\n\frecent case of James v.

Given that the arbitrary and capricious standard applies\n\nhere, and considering that the extrinsic evidence weighed heavily\n\nin favor of appellees' interpretation of the Plan, the district\n\ncourt    did    not     err   in   concluding   that   the   Benefits    Appeals\n\nCommittee's denial was not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n               Appellants here faced a very high hurdle.               They have\n\nargued forcefully for their interpretation.                  But they had the\nchallenge of showing a lack of ambiguity in the terms such that no\nother interpretation fell within reasonable bounds.               We hold that\n\nthis challenge was not met.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f</pre>",
