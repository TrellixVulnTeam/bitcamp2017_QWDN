Billy Samuel Jackson-Omier, a national of\n\nCosta Rica, entered the United States on December 23, 1996, and\n\nstayed beyond the time permitted by his visa.                 On May 14, 2001,\n\nJackson submitted an application for a U.S. passport, on which he\n\nfalsely indicated that he was born in the Panama Canal Zone and\n\nthat his parents were United States citizens, which taken in\n\ncombination would have made him a U.S. citizen.              8 U.S.C. § 1403(a)\n\n(2000).\n\n              Jackson was subsequently convicted by guilty plea of\n\npassport      fraud,   18    U.S.C.   §    1542    (2000),   and    sentenced     to\n\nprobation.      At the same time, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService began proceedings to remove him based inter alia on his\n\nfalse claim of citizenship in his passport application.                   8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(3)(D)(i).         Jackson thereafter sought relief based on his\n\nmarriage in 2002 to a U.S. citizen and the later birth of their\n\nson.1\n\n              On November 1, 2004, removal proceedings were held before\n\nan immigration judge (\"IJ\").              The IJ ordered Jackson removed to\n\nCosta Rica.         8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B), (a)(2)(A)(i), (a)(3)(D).\n\nThe     IJ   also   ruled   that   Jackson's      applications     for   waiver   of\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      Specifically, Jackson filed an application for adjustment of\nstatus under 8 U.S.C. § 1255 and a waiver of inadmissibility under\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), (i), in aid of a grant of permanent resident\nstatus.\n\n                                          -2-\n\finadmissibility      and    adjustment     of   status   were    precluded   by\n\nJackson's false passport application.           8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C).\n\n            In   February    2006,   the   Board    of   Immigration   Appeals\n\naffirmed without opinion, and Jackson now petitions for review.\n\nEffectively, we review the IJ's decision, Gao v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d\n\n33, 37 (1st Cir. 2006), which is amply supported.               Indeed, none of\n\nJackson's arguments warrants more than brief comment.\n\n            First, Jackson says that he never claimed that his\n\nparents were U.S. citizens. His passport application shows that he\n\nchecked the box next to the name of each parent saying \"yes\" to the\n\nquestion whether they were U.S. citizens.            This is enough.\n\n            Second, he says that he did not falsely represent himself\n\nas a U.S. citizen because he failed to submit the requisite proof\n\n--i.e., his parents' birth certificates--needed to obtain the\n\npassport.     But the application itself amounted to a fraudulent\n\nclaim of U.S. citizenship and neither the deportation or waiver\n\nprovisions requires more than the fraudulent claim of citizenship\n\nto   secure      a   passport.       8     U.S.C.   §§    1182(a)(6)(C)(ii),\n\n1227(a)(3)(D)(i).\n\n            Third, citing Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 3003 (2007), Jackson says that the\n\nIJ erred in reviewing the passport application and should instead\n\nhave confined herself to a review of the conviction and charging\n\ndocuments.       Conteh was concerned with whether an alien may be\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fremoved for an aggravated felony conviction.   Id. at 49-50.   Here,\n\nJackson was removable because of a fraudulent claim of citizenship,\n\nregardless of conviction, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(D)(i), and the IJ\n\nwas free to consider whether the application itself was fraudulent.\n\nCompare Conteh,   461 F.3d   at 56.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
