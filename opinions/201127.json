Frank Kumah is a native of Ghana who entered\n\nthe United States without permission in January 1994.       In March\n\n1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"), as it was\n\nthen known, began removal proceedings.       Kumah requested asylum\n\nbased on an application and supporting affidavit that he had filed\n\nin September 1994.\n\n          In April 2000, a hearing on Kumah's asylum application\n\nwas held at which he testified.    In substance, he said that in 1992\n\nhe had become an organizer and regional secretary for the New\n\nPatriotic Party, in opposition to the military government under\n\nJerry John Rawlings. Kumah participated in rallies and then, after\n\nthe November 1992 elections which Rawlings won, in protests which\n\nwere dispersed with violence.     Kumah said that in December 1992 he\n\nattended an evening party meeting in a school building and was then\n\narrested by police along with others and held for 12 days in bad\n\nconditions.\n\n          Kumah also testified that after 12 days, he escaped\n\nduring a transfer to another prison, hid in the house of a friend\n\nwho helped him to escape from the country and then after about a\n\nyear arrived in the United States.      A written statement from the\n\nfriend was offered stating that Kumah had arrived at his house\n\nafter detention, but giving the date of arrival as one day after\n\nthe date that Kumah gave for his arrest.    Based on this and certain\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fother discrepancies, the immigration judge found Kumah's testimony\n\nnot credible and denied the asylum application.\n\n            The    Board   of    Immigration      Appeals      (\"Board\")     affirmed\n\nwithout opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.1(a)(7) (2004).                       Kumah\n\nnow seeks review in this court. On review, the immigration judge's\n\ndecision must stand if supported by substantial evidence, see\n\nAlbathani   v.     INS,    318    F.3d   365,     372   (1st    Cir.   2003);      and\n\ncredibility judgments are ordinarily respected so long as the\n\nimmigration   judge       has    \"a   specific,    cogent   reason     for    .    .   .\n\ndisbelief.\"       Qin v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 302, 306 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting earlier precedents).\n\n            We think the credibility determination is sufficiently\n\nsupported, although just barely so.             The immigration judge pointed\n\nto a set of specific discrepancies including the unexplained\n\nconflict in dates, inconsistent statements by Kumah himself as to\n\nwhether he was handcuffed on his arrest, and a supposed (although\n\ndebatable) discrepancy as to whether Kumah was arrested inside the\n\nbuilding or out.      This is some, but hardly overwhelming, evidence\n\ntending to discredit.\n\n            There might have been a misrecollection as to dates or\n\neven a typographical error in the friend's statement, although\n\nKumah offered the statement along with his own testimony and was\n\nfree to explain the fairly obvious discrepancy.                 Whether Kumah was\n\nhandcuffed or not is a contradiction a little harder to explain but\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fis more of a detail than a central question like how long Kumah was\n\nin custody.       As to the issue of whether he was arrested inside or\n\noutside the building, Kumah did explain why there should be no\n\ninference of a contradiction although the immigration judge was not\n\ncompelled to accept the explanation.              Nevertheless, these are not\n\ndetails unrelated        to   the   main    story   of   persecution,    and   the\n\nimmigration judge did have the advantage of watching the witness\n\ntestify.\n\n            If the immigration judge disbelieved Kumah as to central\n\nincidents, he was permitted, although not compelled, to disbelieve\n\nthe basic story.      See Qin, 360 F.3d at 308; Yongo v. INS, 355 F.3d\n\n27, 33     (1st   Cir.   2004).      This    is   so   even   though   there   was\n\nbackground evidence as to conditions in Ghana in the early 1990s\n\nmaking it clear that Kumah's party was the subject of harassment by\n\nthe Rawlings government and that there were arrests of party\n\nsupporters.       On a cold record, the immigration judge's result is\n\nsomewhat surprising, but it is explained; the explanation is not\n\nfanciful or unsupported by the record and some deference is due\n\nimmigration judges who not only see the witness but handle the very\n\nlarge number of similar cases.\n\n            There is a hint in the immigration judge's decision that\n\nhe did not regard the claim of past persecution as very powerful\n\neven if Kumah's description were true.              Although Kumah claimed to\n\nhave been beaten several times during the breakup of rallies, such\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\frandom and anonymous brutality would not likely justify a fear of\n\nfuture persecution for an individual; and the only violence that\n\nKumah described in prison was that he was beaten for refusing to do\n\nassigned work on the prison farm. He testified that he understands\n\nthat there is now a warrant out for his arrest, but there is no\n\nclear indication whether it is for political crimes or merely for\n\nescaping from prison.\n\n           The background information as to events in Ghana which is\n\npart of the record suggests that by the time of the hearing in\n\n2000, political repression in Ghana had somewhat lessened and\n\nKumah's party had minority representation in Parliament, although\n\nsome abuses apparently continued.          However, the immigration judge\n\ndid not rely upon changed circumstances but instead rejected\n\nKumah's story based on inconsistencies; and it is on this latter\n\nbasis that we uphold the result.\n\n           Kumah makes several other claims of error, but only two\n\nrequire brief comment.     First is the assertion that administrative\n\nlaw principles required the Board to give reasons for its summary\n\naffirmance.    This argument has already been rejected by other\n\npanels of this court.      Yongo, 355 F.3d at 34-35; Albathani, 318\n\nF.3d at    377-78.     Finally,     we   reject   Kumah's    contention   that\n\naffirmance without opinion in his case was improper under 8 C.F.R.\n\nยง 1003.1(a)(7)(ii). Assuming arguendo that the Board's decision to\n\naffirm    without    opinion   in   particular     matters    is   separately\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\freviewable, this case is a fact-specific credibility matter and\n\ninvolved no new legal issues.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
