Plaintiff Pedro Montes appeals\n\nthe district court’s judgments on his various 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nclaims, and a jury verdict on his claim of excessive force.              We\n\nAFFIRM.\n\n     In 1999 in the City of Ponce, Puerto Rico, the police arrested\n\nMontes after he got into a heated argument with his neighbor.\n\nAccording to Montes, the arresting officers kicked and punched him\n\nin the face repeatedly for over ten minutes.         The police took him\n\nto the nearest precinct where they put him in a three-foot by\n\nthree-foot cell that smelled like a sewer.       Montes sued the City of\n\nPonce, its Mayor Santiago, the Police Commissioner Rodriguez, and\n\nthe three police officers effecting the arrest, asserting multiple\n\nconstitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.               His family\n\njoined his complaint asserting an emotional distress claim under\n\nPuerto Rico law.\n\n     At trial, after Montes presented his evidence, the district\n\ncourt granted judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 50, for the City, Mayor, and Police Commissioner.             After the\n\nremaining police defendants countered with their evidence, the\n\ndistrict   court   granted   judgment   as   a   matter   of   law   against\n\nMontes’s claims of (1) arrest without probable cause, (2) unlawful\n\nsearch and seizure, (3) unfit place of detention, and (4) failure\n\nto provide prompt medical attention. The jury found for the police\n\ndefendants on the excessive force claim.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f      Montes (and his family) filed a notice of appeal from the\n\njudgment entered on February 7, 2002; however, the notice made no\n\nmention of the February 5, 2002 judgment dismissing the City,\n\nMayor, and Police Commissioner.\n\n                               Notice of Appeal\n\n      Since Montes’s notice of appeal failed to mention the February\n\n5, 2002 judgment dismissing the claims against the City, Mayor, and\n\nPolice Commissioner, these defendants argue that this omission\n\nwaived any appeal.\n\n      Fed.   R.   App.    P.   3(c)    requires    that    a   notice   of    appeal\n\n“designate the judgment, order, or part thereof appealed from.”\n\nIts   requirements       are   to     be    construed   liberally,      and   “mere\n\ntechnicalities” will not defeat appellate jurisdiction so long as\n\nthe filing is the “functional equivalent.”                Blockel v. J.C. Penney\n\nCo., 337 F.3d 17, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2003).            But First Circuit caselaw\n\nas to when to allow deviations from the strict requirements of Rule\n\n3 has evolved in a case by case basis, and articulating a definite\n\nrule is difficult.       Compare In re Spookyworld, Inc., --- F.3d ---,\n\n2003 WL 22210065 (1st Cir. Sept. 25, 2003) with Blockel, 337 F.3d\n\nat 23-24.    In this instance there is no doubt that this court has\n\njurisdiction over the case in general – there was a timely appeal\n\nfiled for at least one order – and with respect to the other order\n\nit turns out not to matter because the claim fails on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fBecause it fails so clearly, we find it easier to assume without\n\ndeciding that the notice of appeal was adequate.\n\n      Montes’s viable1 claims on appeal challenge the judgments as\n\na matter of law against him on (1) municipal and supervisory § 1983\n\nclaims against the City, Mayor, and Police Commissioner, (2) his\n\nconditions of confinement claim, and (3) his denial of medical\n\ntreatment claim. He also asserts that the evidence did not support\n\nthe jury’s verdict against him on the excessive force claim.\n\n                         Conditions of Confinement\n\n      Montes makes a cruel and unusual punishment claim for his\n\ndetention in a poorly ventilated small cell for seventeen hours.\n\nWe review the judgment against Montes de novo, taking all evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to him.        See Tang v. Rhode Island Dep’t\n\nof Elderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1998).           We may affirm\n\nif   there   was   “no   legally   sufficient   evidentiary   basis   for   a\n\nreasonable jury” to find for Montes.         Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).\n\n      Since pretrial detainees are not technically being punished,\n\ntheir protection for Eighth Amendment-type claims springs from the\n\nliberty component of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.\n\n\n\n      1\n       Montes’s family’s claims under Puerto Rico tort law, and\nMontes’s claims regarding the probable cause and unlawful search\nand seizure are never mentioned in his brief; thus, they are\nwaived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990). Additionally, Montes’s claim under Puerto Rico tort law for\nhimself never appeared in his complaint, and we will not consider\nthe issue raised for the first time on appeal. Rocafort v. IBM\nCorp., 334 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fSee Burrell v. Hamshire County, 307 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002).          No\n\nunconstitutional     deprivation   of    liberty   occurs   unless     the\n\ndetainment amounts to punishment, which occurs when the condition\n\nis imposed for the purpose of punishment rather than         some other\n\nlegitimate reason.    O’Connor v. Huard, 117 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).   We will uphold legitimate administrative purposes offered,\n\nunless there is “substantial evidence” it is an “exaggerated\n\nresponse“   to some concern.     Id.\n\n     The defendants’ proffered explanation is that the small cell\n\nwas the only cell located in the nearest precinct, and the police\n\nhave a policy of taking the arrestee to the closest precinct.         This\n\npolicy serves a legitimate government interest in safely detaining\n\na possibly dangerous arrested person as soon as possible.        Montes\n\noffered no substantial evidence impeaching this reason. Given this\n\nuncontroverted   rational    explanation,   the    detainment   did   not\n\nconstitute punishment.    Therefore, the judgment as a matter of law\n\non that issue is upheld.\n\n                            Medical Attention\n\n     Montes next complains about the lack of medical attention\n\nduring his confinement.        The Due Process Clause requires the\n\ngovernment to provide medical care to pretrial detainees injured\n\nwhile being apprehended by the police.      Gaudreault v. Municipality\n\nof Salem, 923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir. 1990).         Officials violate\n\nthis requirement only if they exhibit “deliberate indifference” to\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f“serious medical needs.”       Id.       A “serious” medical need is one\n\ndiagnosed by a physician as mandating immediate treatment, or one\n\nthat is “so obvious” that a layman would “easily” recognize the\n\nnecessity for medical treatment.           Id.\n\n     Montes’s claim fails because he gave the lower court no\n\nevidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find he had a “serious\n\nmedical need.”      He had no cuts or bleeding.            His own doctor\n\ntestified that Montes only had swelling and some discoloration, and\n\nsimply treated him with over-the-counter pain killers.             Moreover,\n\nMontes was quite active in his cell, smashing the chair they had\n\ngiven him and pulling tiles off the walls.\n\n     In Gaudreault, we upheld a summary judgment against an injured\n\ndetainee    who   only   required    a   sling,   an   eye-patch    and   some\n\ndisinfectant for abrasions.         See 923 F.2d at 208.     In that case,\n\nthe detainee suffered a “blow out fracture of the right orbit,\n\nresulting in a deviated septum, a cyst in his sinus and some\n\ntransient nerve damage.”       Id. at 209 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   Here, Montes’s condition was significantly less serious\n\nbecause he only needed over-the-counter pain killers.              Montes has\n\nfailed to give any evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find\n\na “serious medical need.”      Therefore, judgment as a matter of law\n\nwas properly granted on that claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f                                Excessive Force\n\n        Montes next challenges the evidentiary basis for the jury’s\n\nverdict finding no excessive force.             Claims of excessive police\n\nforce    derive   from    the   Fourth    Amendment’s   prohibition   against\n\nunreasonable seizures. The test for excessive force is whether the\n\npolice     actions       were    “objectively     reasonable”   given    the\n\ncircumstances, ignoring the officers’ subjective intent.              Bastien\n\nv. Goddard, 279 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2002).                Since the jury\n\nrendered a verdict for the police, we must affirm unless the\n\nevidence was “so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the\n\n[verdict] that no reasonable jury could have returned [it].”\n\nCrowley v. L.L. Bean, 303 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir. 2002).              As part\n\nof this determination, we view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the police and resolve all credibility issues in favor\n\nof the jury’s verdict.          Id.\n\n        The arrest occurred because Montes was attacking his disabled\n\nneighbor.     The defense put on evidence that Montes screamed foul\n\nwords and was drunk and “aggressive.”             The police testified that\n\nMontes attempted to assault one of them, and explained this turned\n\nthe arrest into a struggle.           Thus, the defense put forth evidence\n\nof reasons for the force used and evidence showing the lack of any\n\nserious injury.          Since we must accept all this testimony as\n\ncredible and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fjury’s verdict, we uphold the jury’s finding that the officers’\n\nforce was not excessive.\n\n               Municipal and Supervisory Liability\n\n     Having found no underlying constitutional violation by the\n\npolice, Montes’s municipal and supervisory § 1983 claims against\n\nthe City, Mayor, and Police Commissioner necessarily fail.   See\n\nWilson v. Town of Mendon, 294 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n     We AFFIRM the district court on all claims.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Huard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197444\"><a href=\"/opinion/197444/oconnor-v-huward/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).   We will uphold legitimate administrative purposes offered,\n\nunless there is “substantial evidence” it is an “exaggerated\n\nresponse“   to some concern.     Id.\n\n     The defendants’ proffered explanation is that the small cell\n\nwas the only cell located in the nearest precinct, and the police\n\nhave a policy of taking the arrestee to the closest precinct.         This\n\npolicy serves a legitimate government interest in safely detaining\n\na possibly dangerous arrested person as soon as possible.        Montes\n\noffered no substantial evidence impeaching this reason. Given this\n\nuncontroverted   rational    explanation,   the    detainment   did   not\n\nconstitute punishment.    Therefore, the judgment as a matter of law\n\non that issue is upheld.\n\n                            Medical Attention\n\n     Montes next complains about the lack of medical attention\n\nduring his confinement.        The Due Process Clause requires the\n\ngovernment to provide medical care to pretrial detainees injured\n\nwhile being apprehended by the police.      Gaudreault v. Municipality\n\nof Salem, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554019\"><a href=\"/opinion/554019/robert-a-gaudreault-v-municipality-of-salem-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (1st Cir. 1990).         Officials violate\n\nthis requirement only if they exhibit “deliberate indifference” to\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f“serious medical needs.”       Id.       A “serious” medical need is one\n\ndiagnosed by a physician as mandating immediate treatment, or one\n\nthat is “so obvious” that a layman would “easily” recognize the\n\nnecessity for medical treatment.           Id.\n\n     Montes’s claim fails because he gave the lower court no\n\nevidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find he had a “serious\n\nmedical need.”      He had no cuts or bleeding.            His own doctor\n\ntestified that Montes only had swelling and some discoloration, and\n\nsimply treated him with over-the-counter pain killers.             Moreover,\n\nMontes was quite active in his cell, smashing the chair they had\n\ngiven him and pulling tiles off the walls.\n\n     In Gaudreault, we upheld a summary judgment against an injured\n\ndetainee    who   only   required    a   sling,   an   eye-patch    and   some\n\ndisinfectant for abrasions.         See 923 F.2d at 208.     In that case,\n\nthe detainee suffered a “blow out fracture of the right orbit,\n\nresulting in a deviated septum, a cyst in his sinus and some\n\ntransient nerve damage.”       Id. at 209 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   Here, Montes’s condition was significantly less serious\n\nbecause he only needed over-the-counter pain killers.              Montes has\n\nfailed to give any evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find\n\na “serious medical need.”      Therefore, judgment as a matter of law\n\nwas properly granted on that claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f                                Excessive Force\n\n        Montes next challenges the evidentiary basis for the jury’s\n\nverdict finding no excessive force.             Claims of excessive police\n\nforce    derive   from    the   Fourth    Amendment’s   prohibition   against\n\nunreasonable seizures. The test for excessive force is whether the\n\npolice     actions       were    “objectively     reasonable”   given    the\n\ncircumstances, ignoring the officers’ subjective intent.

Since the jury\n\nrendered a verdict for the police, we must affirm unless the\n\nevidence was “so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the\n\n[verdict] that no reasonable jury could have returned [it].”\n\nCrowley v. L.L. Bean, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200130\"><a href=\"/opinion/200130/crowley-v-ll-bean-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393 (1st Cir. 2002).              As part\n\nof this determination, we view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the police and resolve all credibility issues in favor\n\nof the jury’s verdict.          Id.\n\n        The arrest occurred because Montes was attacking his disabled\n\nneighbor.     The defense put on evidence that Montes screamed foul\n\nwords and was drunk and “aggressive.”             The police testified that\n\nMontes attempted to assault one of them, and explained this turned\n\nthe arrest into a struggle.           Thus, the defense put forth evidence\n\nof reasons for the force used and evidence showing the lack of any\n\nserious injury.          Since we must accept all this testimony as\n\ncredible and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fjury’s verdict, we uphold the jury’s finding that the officers’\n\nforce was not excessive.\n\n               Municipal and Supervisory Liability\n\n     Having found no underlying constitutional violation by the\n\npolice, Montes’s municipal and supervisory § 1983 claims against\n\nthe City, Mayor, and Police Commissioner necessarily fail.
