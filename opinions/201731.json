This case tests the scope of\n\nhospital liability under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active\n\nLabor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. EMTALA requires a hospital\n\nto even-handedly administer an appropriate screening procedure to\n\nall emergency room patients and, if it determines that an emergency\n\nmedical condition exists, to stabilize the patient's condition\n\nbefore    discharge    or    transfer     to    another    hospital.      See    id.\n\nAsserting that Hospital Español Auxilio Mutuo de Puerto Rico\n\n(Auxilio Mutuo) did not comply with its own protocol in screening\n\nEdgardo Cruz-Queipo (Cruz) and that it failed to stabilize him\n\nprior to discharge, the plaintiffs appeal a grant of summary\n\njudgment against them.        For the reasons set forth below, we vacate\n\nthe   district     court's   grant   of      summary     judgment   on    both   the\n\nscreening    and    stabilization       claims     and     remand   for    further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we view the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.                       See Del\n\nCarmen Guadalupe v. Negron Agosto, 299 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nAccordingly, we draw the following facts from the summary judgment\n\nrecord, \"indulging all reasonable inferences in [the plaintiffs']\n\nfavor.\"    Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            At approximately 4 p.m. on August 31, 2001, Cruz visited\n\nthe Auxilio Mutuo emergency room complaining of pain in his chest,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\farm, and wrist.        Pursuant to Auxilio Mutuo's written policy,\n\nemergency    room   patients    receive       a    screening   examination     upon\n\narrival to determine the severity of their conditions and are then\n\nclassified in one of four categories.               Category I encompasses the\n\nmost serious conditions, including acute chest pain with unstable\n\nvital signs, and Categories II, III, and IV encompass progressively\n\nless serious conditions.             Triage officer Dr. Miguel Rodríguez\n\nperformed an initial screening evaluation of Cruz pursuant to\n\nAuxilio Mutuo's policy.         After checking Cruz's vital signs and\n\nnoting that Cruz complained of pain in his left arm and warmth in\n\nhis wrist, Dr. Rodríguez placed Cruz in Category IV, which includes\n\nback and muscle pain.        Notes from the screening examination do not\n\nindicate that Cruz complained of chest pain.                       For purposes of\n\nsummary judgment, however, we must credit Cruz's assertion that he\n\ndid,   in   fact,   report    such    pain,       and,   drawing    all   reasonable\n\ninferences in Cruz's favor, we must assume that the emergency room\n\ndoctors were aware of the chest pain.\n\n       A second physician, Dr. James Davison, performed a more\n\nthorough examination of Cruz at approximately 5:30 p.m.                    Like Dr.\n\nRodríguez, Dr. Davison did not document a complaint of chest pain.\n\nFinding that Cruz suffered from shoulder pain, however, Dr. Davison\n\nordered an electrocardiogram (EKG) and a cervical spinal x-ray. He\n\ninterpreted the results of both tests as negative.                    Based on his\n\nexamination and the test results, Dr. Davison diagnosed Cruz with\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthoracic outlet syndrome, a non-emergency disorder that involves\n\nthe compression of blood vessels and nerves in the shoulder region.\n\nSee   National    Institute    of    Neurological   Disorders    and   Stroke,\n\nThoracic         Outlet       Syndrome       Information         Page,     at\n\nhttp://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/thoracic/thoracic.htm                 (last\n\nvisited July 20, 2005).       Dr. Davison prescribed Celebrex (an anti-\n\ninflammatory) and Clonazepan (an anti-convulsant) and discharged\n\nCruz, encouraging him to follow up with a specialist.\n\n      The following day (September 1, 2001), Cruz returned to the\n\nAuxilio Mutuo emergency room with severe chest pain radiating to\n\nhis left arm and jaw.      Doctors determined that Cruz had suffered an\n\nacute myocardial infarction (heart attack). He was admitted to the\n\ncoronary care unit, where he remained for approximately one week\n\nbefore being transferred to another hospital where he underwent\n\nsextuple bypass surgery.            As a result of the infarction, Cruz\n\nsuffered permanent damage to his heart, including scarring and\n\ndecreased cardiac performance.\n\n      On October 2, 2002, the plaintiffs -- Cruz; his wife, Maria\n\nIsabel Puig-Sanchez; and their conjugal partnership -- filed a\n\ncomplaint   against       Auxilio    Mutuo   and    American    International\n\nInsurance Company,1 charging violations of EMTALA.              Specifically,\n\n\n      1\n      American International Insurance Company was dismissed as a\ndefendant on April 7, 2003 pursuant to an unopposed motion for\nsummary judgment on the grounds that it \"did not have in effect an\ninsurance policy for Hospital Español Auxilio Mutuo covering the\ndamages claimed in the complaint.\"\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthe plaintiffs asserted that Cruz had been suffering from acute\n\ncoronary syndrome during his August 31 hospital visit and that\n\nhospital personnel failed to properly screen and stabilize him.\n\nThe plaintiffs also contended that these deficiencies led to the\n\npermanent damage that Cruz suffered as a result of his heart attack\n\non September 1.        After the close of discovery, Auxilio Mutuo filed\n\na motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiffs\n\nfailed to state a claim under EMTALA.          It argued that Cruz had been\n\ngiven an appropriate medical screening, that he was subjected to\n\nthe same procedures used for every patient who visits the emergency\n\nroom,    that    the    August   31   visit   did    not   implicate     EMTALA's\n\nstabilization requirement because the hospital did not detect an\n\nemergency       medical   condition,    and   that    there   was   no    causal\n\nrelationship between the damages alleged and the purported EMTALA\n\nviolation.      Over the plaintiffs' vigorous objections, the district\n\ncourt granted Auxilio Mutuo's motion, finding that the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims \"are more suited to a medical malpractice claim.\"2                     The\n\nplaintiffs appeal from this decision.\n\n                                       II.\n\n     We review the grant of summary judgment de novo.               Littlefield\n\nv. Acadia Ins. Co., 392 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004).                        Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers\n\n\n\n     2\n      The plaintiffs filed a separate malpractice suit in the\nPuerto Rico courts.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nA.   The EMTALA statutory scheme\n\n     Congress enacted EMTALA in response to \"the increasing number\n\nof reports that hospital emergency rooms are refusing to accept or\n\ntreat patients with emergency conditions if the patient does not\n\nhave medical insurance.\"     Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69 F.3d\n\n1184, 1189 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nEMTALA   imposes   two    primary    requirements   on   participating\n\nhospitals:3\n\n     First, it requires that a participating hospital afford\n     an appropriate medical screening to all persons who come\n     to its emergency room seeking medical assistance. See 42\n     U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).    Second, it requires that, if an\n     emergency medical condition exists, the participating\n     hospital must render the services that are necessary to\n     stabilize    the    patient's    condition,    see   id.\n     § 1395dd(b)(1)(A) . . . .\n\nId. at 1190.   As an enforcement mechanism for these requirements,\n\nEMTALA creates a private right of action for violations.      See   42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1395dd(d)(1), (2).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      EMTALA defines a participating hospital as a \"hospital that\nhas entered into a provider agreement under section 1395cc of this\ntitle.\"   42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(2).    Neither side disputes that\nAuxilio Mutuo is a participating hospital.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fB.   EMTALA screening claim\n\n     Although   EMTALA    does   not   define   an    \"appropriate    medical\n\nscreening examination,\" our circuit law does:\n\n     A hospital fulfills its statutory duty to screen patients\n     in its emergency room if it provides for a screening\n     examination reasonably calculated to identify critical\n     medical conditions that may be afflicting symptomatic\n     patients and provides that level of screening uniformly\n     to   all  those   who   present   substantially   similar\n     complaints.\n\nCorrea, 69 F.3d at 1192.     \"The essence of this requirement is that\n\nthere be some screening procedure, and that it be administered\n\neven-handedly.\"     Id.      When      a   hospital   prescribes     internal\n\nprocedures for a screening examination, those internal procedures\n\n\"set the parameters for an appropriate screening.\"                   Id.4   A\n\nhospital thus must adhere to its own procedures in administering\n\nthe screening examination.\n\n     The plaintiffs do not dispute that Cruz received a screening\n\nexamination, nor do they contend that Auxilio Mutuo's screening\n\nprotocol was per se inappropriate.           Rather, they argue that the\n\nhospital failed to follow its own protocol when it placed Cruz in\n\n\n\n     4\n      This is the view of other circuits as well.       See, e.g.,\nSummers v. Baptist Med. Ctr. Arkadelphia, 91 F.3d 1132, 1138 (8th\nCir. 1996) (\"It is up to the hospital itself to determine what its\nscreening procedures will be. Having done so, it must apply them\nalike to all patients.\"); Baber v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 977 F.2d\n872, 878 & 879 n.7 (4th Cir. 1992) (\"EMTALA only requires hospitals\nto apply their standard screening procedure for identification of\nan emergency medical condition uniformly to all patients.\").\n\n                                    -7-\n\fCategory IV despite his complaint of chest pains that should have\n\nplaced him in Category II (acute chest pain with stable vital\n\nsigns), and that this departure from hospital protocol violated\n\nEMTALA's      appropriate   screening   requirement.5   In   short,   they\n\nchallenge the district court's conclusion that they \"have no claim\n\nunder EMTALA\" because \"Cruz was screened and evaluated according to\n\nAuxilio Mutuo protocol.\"       There is more to this challenge than may\n\ninitially meet the eye.\n\n     In its brief, Auxilio Mutuo devotes a great deal of attention\n\nto the aspects of its triage protocol that were followed in this\n\ncase.       It points out that Cruz was examined and placed in a triage\n\ncategory upon his appearance in the emergency room, and that he was\n\nsubsequently evaluated by the emergency room physician.          Auxilio\n\nMutuo asserts that Cruz's screening therefore did not deviate from\n\nthe standard hospital protocol and that, at bottom, the plaintiffs'\n\nclaim is really one of medical malpractice rather than of an EMTALA\n\nviolation.       See id. at 1192-93 (\"EMTALA does not create a cause of\n\naction for medical malpractice.           Therefore, a refusal to follow\n\nregular screening procedures in a particular instance contravenes\n\nthe statute, but faulty screening, in a particular case, as opposed\n\n\n        5\n      Plaintiffs contend that Cruz should have been placed in\neither Category I or II, emphasizing that both categories include\nacute chest pain.    Category I, however, applies specifically to\nacute chest pain with unstable vital signs. The triage officer\ndetermined that Cruz's vital signs were stable, and Cruz does not\ndispute that determination.     Therefore, he did not meet the\nrequirements for Category I.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fto disparate screening or refusing to screen at all, does not\n\ncontravene the statute.\" (internal citations omitted)).\n\n     Auxilio Mutuo's reasoning overlooks one key factor -- namely,\n\nour inference, for purposes of summary judgment, that emergency\n\nroom doctors were aware that Cruz was suffering from chest pain.\n\nUnder Auxilio Mutuo's written triage policy, a patient with stable\n\nvital signs who complains of chest pain must be assigned to triage\n\nCategory II.    Indeed, the hospital conceded in its motion for\n\nsummary judgment that, under its own standards, \"[i]f the patient\n\n[had] referred a complaint of chest pains, he would have been\n\nplaced in Category I or II with an emergency condition.\"         Cruz's\n\nplacement in Category IV despite a complaint of chest pains thus\n\nmarked a departure from the hospital's standards, which \"set the\n\nparameters for an appropriate screening.\"        Id. at 1193; see also\n\nid. (\"under EMTALA § 1395dd(a), the same screening examination must\n\nbe   made   available    to   all   similarly    situated   patients\").\n\nAccordingly, Auxilio Mutuo is not entitled to summary judgment on\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim that Cruz was denied an appropriate screening\n\nin violation of EMTALA.\n\nC.   EMTALA stabilization claim\n\n     The    plaintiffs    also   assert    a    claim   under   EMTALA's\n\nstabilization requirement, which provides that\n\n     [i]f any individual . . . comes to a hospital and the\n     hospital determines that the individual has an emergency\n     medical condition, the hospital must provide . . .\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f     (A) within the staff and facilities available at the\n     hospital, for such further medical examination and such\n     treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical\n     condition.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)(1)(A).         The statute defines an emergency\n\nmedical condition (for an individual not in active labor) as\n\n     a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms\n     of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that\n     the absence of immediate medical attention could\n     reasonably be expected to result in (i) placing the\n     health of the individual . . . in serious jeopardy, (ii)\n     serious impairment to bodily functions, or (iii) serious\n     dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\nId. § 1395dd(e)(1)(A).\n\n     In support of their stabilization claim, the plaintiffs point\n\nto Auxilio Mutuo's acknowledgment, in its motion for summary\n\njudgment, that \"[i]f the patient [had] referred a complaint of\n\nchest pains, he would have [had] . . . an emergency condition,\n\n[and] therefore the hospital [would have been] obliged to stabilize\n\nthe patient.\"    Emphasizing this concession, the plaintiffs assert\n\nthat if we accept that Cruz complained of chest pains during his\n\nAugust 31 visit, we must also conclude that the hospital had a duty\n\nto stabilize the heart condition that culminated in a heart attack\n\non September 1.    We agree.\n\n     At   this   stage   of   the   proceedings,   as   we   have   already\n\nexplained, we must draw the inference that the hospital knew that\n\nCruz was suffering from chest pain.        By its own admission, then,\n\nthe hospital also knew that Cruz was suffering from an emergency\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fmedical condition and had a duty to stabilize that condition.\n\nAuxilio Mutuo therefore was not entitled to summary judgment on the\n\nplaintiffs' stabilization claim.6\n\n                               III.\n\n     Although a jury ultimately may determine that the hospital's\n\ntreatment of Cruz did not violate EMTALA, the summary judgment\n\nrecord, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, does\n\nnot permit that conclusion as a matter of law.   In light of Cruz's\n\nclaim that he complained of chest pain during his August 31 visit\n\nto the emergency room and the hospital's concession regarding its\n\nown standards for handling such a complaint, we must vacate the\n\ngrant of summary judgment to Auxilio Mutuo and remand to the\n\n\n\n     6\n      Auxilio Mutuo also asserts that it is entitled to summary\njudgment on the ground that \"there is no causal relation[ship]\nbetween the damages alleged and the purported EMTALA violation.\"\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(2)(A) (\"Any individual who suffers\npersonal harm as a direct result of a participating hospital's\nviolation of a requirement of [EMTALA] may, in a civil action\nagainst the participating hospital, obtain those damages available\nfor personal injury under the law of the State in which the\nhospital is located . . . .\"); 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5141 (damages\navailable under Puerto Rico law when \"[a] person who by an act or\nomission causes damage to another through fault or negligence\"\n(emphasis added)). Specifically, Auxilio Mutuo claims that Cruz's\nheart condition was attributable to his \"inability to adequately\ncare for his physical condition\" by controlling his cholesterol and\nblood pressure, rather than to any action or omission of the\nhospital. This argument is a non-starter. Hospitals generally do\nnot cause the emergency conditions that they are called upon to\nstabilize under EMTALA.     That does not mean, however, that a\nhospital's failure to stabilize a condition bears no causal\nrelationship to the damages suffered by a patient as a result of a\ndeterioration in his condition that could have been avoided by\nstabilization.\n\n                               -11-\n\fdistrict   court   for   further   proceedings   consistent   with   this\n\nopinion.\n\n    So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",

Pursuant to Auxilio Mutuo's written policy, emergency room patients receive a screening examination upon arrival to determine the severity of their conditions and are then classified in one of four categories. Category I encompasses the most serious conditions, including acute chest pain with unstable vital signs, and Categories II, III, and IV encompass progressively less serious conditions.

Rather, they argue that the hospital failed to follow its own protocol when it placed Cruz in Category IV despite his complaint of chest pains that should have placed him in Category II (acute chest pain with stable vital signs), and that this departure from hospital protocol violated EMTALA's appropriate screening requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In short, they challenge the district court's conclusion that they \"have no claim under EMTALA\" because \"Cruz was screened and evaluated according to Auxilio Mutuo protocol.\" There is more to this challenge than may initially meet the eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, Auxilio Mutuo devotes a great deal of attention to the aspects of its triage protocol that were followed in this case. It points out that Cruz was examined and placed in a triage category upon his appearance in the emergency room, and that he was subsequently evaluated by the emergency room physician. Auxilio Mutuo asserts that Cruz's screening therefore did not deviate from the standard hospital protocol and that, at bottom, the plaintiffs' claim is really one of medical malpractice rather than of an EMTALA violation. <i>See id.</i> at 1192-93 (\"EMTALA does not create a cause of action for medical malpractice. Therefore, a refusal to follow regular screening procedures in a particular instance contravenes the statute, but faulty screening, in a particular case, as opposed to disparate screening or refusing to screen at all, does not contravene the statute.\" (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Auxilio Mutuo's reasoning overlooks one key factor&#8212;namely, our inference, for purposes of summary judgment, that emergency room doctors were aware that Cruz was suffering from chest pain. Under Auxilio Mutuo's written triage policy, a patient with stable vital signs who complains of chest pain must be assigned to triage Category II. Indeed, the hospital conceded in its motion for summary judgment that, under its own standards, \"[i]f the patient [had] referred a complaint of chest pains, he would have been placed in Category I or II with an emergency condition.\" Cruz's placement in Category IV despite a complaint of chest pains thus marked a departure from the hospital's standards, which \"set the parameters for an appropriate screening.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1193; <i>see also id.</i> (\"under EMTALA &#167; 1395dd(a), the same screening examination must be made available to all similarly situated patients\").

Laws Ann. &#167; 5141 (damages available under Puerto Rico law when \"[a] person who by an act or omission <i>causes damage</i> to another through fault or negligence\" (emphasis added)). Specifically, Auxilio Mutuo claims that Cruz's heart condition was attributable to his \"inability to adequately care for his physical condition\" by controlling his cholesterol and blood pressure, rather than to any action or omission of the hospital. This argument is a non-starter. Hospitals generally do not cause the emergency conditions that they are called upon to stabilize under EMTALA. That does not mean, however, that a hospital's failure to stabilize a condition bears no causal relationship to the damages suffered by a patient as a result of a deterioration in his condition that could have been avoided by stabilization.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

EMTALA screening claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although EMTALA does not define an \"appropriate medical screening examination,\" our circuit law does:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A hospital fulfills its statutory duty to screen patients in its emergency room if it provides for a screening examination reasonably calculated to identify critical medical conditions that may be afflicting symptomatic patients and provides that level of screening uniformly to all those who present substantially similar complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1192. \"The essence of this requirement is that there be some screening procedure, and that it be administered even-handedly.\" <i>Id.</i> When a hospital prescribes internal procedures for a screening examination, those internal procedures \"set the parameters for an appropriate screening.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> A hospital thus must adhere to its own procedures in administering the screening examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs do not dispute that Cruz received a screening examination, nor do they contend that Auxilio Mutuo's screening protocol was <i>per se</i> inappropriate. Rather, they argue that the hospital failed to follow its own protocol when it placed Cruz in Category IV despite his complaint of chest pains that should have placed him in Category II (acute chest pain with stable vital signs), and that this departure from hospital protocol violated EMTALA's appropriate screening requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In short, they challenge the district court's conclusion that they \"have no claim under EMTALA\" because \"Cruz was screened and evaluated according to Auxilio Mutuo protocol.\" There is more to this challenge than may initially meet the eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, Auxilio Mutuo devotes a great deal of attention to the aspects of its triage protocol that were followed in this case. It points out that Cruz was examined and placed in a triage category upon his appearance in the emergency room, and that he was subsequently evaluated by the emergency room physician. Auxilio Mutuo asserts that Cruz's screening therefore did not deviate from the standard hospital protocol and that, at bottom, the plaintiffs' claim is really one of medical malpractice rather than of an EMTALA violation. <i>See id.</i> at 1192-93 (\"EMTALA does not create a cause of action for medical malpractice. Therefore, a refusal to follow regular screening procedures in a particular instance contravenes the statute, but faulty screening, in a particular case, as opposed to disparate screening or refusing to screen at all, does not contravene the statute.\" (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Auxilio Mutuo's reasoning overlooks one key factor&#8212;namely, our inference, for purposes of summary judgment, that emergency room doctors were aware that Cruz was suffering from chest pain. Under Auxilio Mutuo's written triage policy, a patient with stable vital signs who complains of chest pain must be assigned to triage Category II. Indeed, the hospital conceded in its motion for summary judgment that, under its own standards, \"[i]f the patient [had] referred a complaint of chest pains, he would have been placed in Category I or II with an emergency condition.\" Cruz's placement in Category IV despite a complaint of chest pains thus marked a departure from the hospital's standards, which \"set the parameters for an appropriate screening.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1193; <i>see also id.</i> (\"under EMTALA &#167; 1395dd(a), the same screening examination must be made available to all similarly situated patients\"). Accordingly, Auxilio Mutuo is not entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs' claim that Cruz was denied an appropriate screening in violation of EMTALA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. EMTALA stabilization claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also assert a claim under EMTALA's stabilization requirement, which provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]f any individual . . . comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(b)(1)(A). The statute defines an emergency medical condition (for an individual not in active labor) as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in (i) placing the health of the individual. . . in serious jeopardy, (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395dd(e)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their stabilization claim, the plaintiffs point to Auxilio Mutuo's acknowledgment, in its motion for summary judgment, that \"[i]f the patient [had] referred a complaint of chest pains, he would have [had] . . . an emergency condition, [and] therefore the hospital [would have been] obliged to stabilize the patient.\" Emphasizing this concession, the plaintiffs assert that if we accept that Cruz complained of chest pains during his August 31 visit, we must also conclude that the hospital had a duty to stabilize the heart condition that culminated in a heart attack on September 1. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this stage of the proceedings, as we have already explained, we must draw the inference that the hospital knew that Cruz was suffering from chest pain. By its own admission, then, the hospital also knew that Cruz was suffering from an emergency medical condition and had a duty to stabilize that condition. Auxilio Mutuo therefore was not entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs' stabilization claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a jury ultimately may determine that the hospital's treatment of Cruz did not violate EMTALA, the summary judgment record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, does not permit that conclusion as a matter of law. In light of Cruz's claim that he complained of chest pain during his August 31 visit to the emergency room and the hospital's concession regarding its own standards for handling such a complaint, we must <i>vacate</i> the grant of summary judgment to Auxilio Mutuo and <i>remand</i> to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> American International Insurance Company was dismissed as a defendant on April 7, 2003 pursuant to an unopposed motion for summary judgment on the grounds that it \"did not have in effect an insurance policy for Hospital Espa&#241;ol Auxilio Mutuo covering the damages claimed in the complaint.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs filed a separate malpractice suit in the Puerto Rico courts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> EMTALA defines a participating hospital as a \"hospital that has entered into a provider agreement under section 1395cc of this title.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(e)(2).

Laws Ann. &#167; 5141 (damages available under Puerto Rico law when \"[a] person who by an act or omission <i>causes damage</i> to another through fault or negligence\" (emphasis added)). Specifically, Auxilio Mutuo claims that Cruz's heart condition was attributable to his \"inability to adequately care for his physical condition\" by controlling his cholesterol and blood pressure, rather than to any action or omission of the hospital. This argument is a non-starter. Hospitals generally do not cause the emergency conditions that they are called upon to stabilize under EMTALA. That does not mean, however, that a hospital's failure to stabilize a condition bears no causal relationship to the damages suffered by a patient as a result of a deterioration in his condition that could have been avoided by stabilization.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
