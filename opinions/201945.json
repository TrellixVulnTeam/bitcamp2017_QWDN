When a dispute arose\n\nbetween the National Casualty Company and the First State Insurance\n\nGroup over the amount of a reimbursement the former owed the latter\n\nunder a reinsurance contract, the parties undertook to arbitrate\n\nit.    During the arbitration proceedings, National Casualty sought\n\ncertain documents in discovery, but First State refused to produce\n\nthem    despite    an   order   from   the   arbitration   panel    to   do   so.\n\nUltimately, the arbitrators reached a decision in First State's\n\nfavor    despite    First   State's    failure    to    produce    the   desired\n\ndocuments.    Frustrated, National Casualty brought suit in federal\n\nDistrict Court seeking to overturn the decision of the arbitration\n\npanel.     The district judge denied all relief, and this appeal\n\nfollowed.    We affirm.\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n            Appellant National Casualty and appellee First State were\n\nparties to a set of contracts under which National Casualty served\n\nas a reinsurer to First State on a number of First State's\n\ninsurance obligations.          The arbitration agreement and proceedings\n\nat issue in this case relate only to the reinsurance contracts, but\n\nthe argument between the parties over their obligations under the\n\nreinsurance contracts will be more intelligible if we relate some\n\nbackground information relevant to the First State policies for\n\nwhich National Casualty was the reinsurer.                 We use the term\n\n\"underlying policies\" to designate the policies First State issued\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fto its insureds.             The \"reinsurance contracts\" or simply \"the\n\ncontracts\" will refer to the reinsurance contracts at issue in the\n\ncase.       There is no dispute over the facts, so we relate them as\n\nrepresented by the parties, with certain supplemental information\n\ngleaned from the record.\n\n               First State was required under the underlying policies to\n\ncover       some   portion   of   its   insureds'   liability   for   so-called\n\nasbestos non-product liability claims.1 The equipment-installation\n\nand facilities-maintenance firms typically exposed to these claims\n\ngenerally carry what is called \"operations\" insurance.                   Where\n\ninsurance for product liability claims is often hard-capped at a\n\nfixed sum, operations insurance, by contrast, usually repays a\n\ncertain maximum amount for each incident giving rise to liability.\n\nThe per-incident coverage means that, if an insured had a given\n\namount, for example, $1 million, of liability, and First State\n\noffered per-incident coverage of $100,000, First State's obligation\n\nto the insured could be determined only in light of the source of\n\nthe liability.         If the $1 million in liability arose from one\n\n\n\n        1\n      \"Asbestos non-product liability claims\" are a relatively\nrecent category of asbestos-related claims. The earlier class of\nclaims known as \"asbestos product liability claims,\" claims pressed\nagainst asbestos manufacturers, are now rare: the pool of funds\navailable to cover this type of claim was largely depleted by the\n1990s as the asbestos manufacturers went bankrupt. In the late\n1990s, claims were increasingly brought against firms which had\nbeen responsible for installing or servicing products containing\nasbestos.   These new claims are referred to in the industry as\n\"non-product liability claims.\"\n\n                                         -3-\n\fincident, First State would owe its per-incident amount only once,\n\nand pay $100,000, while if $1 million was the insured's total\n\nliability on three claims, First State would pay $300,000.         Under\n\nthe policies at issue, therefore, First State would pay a smaller\n\nshare of a given amount of a policyholder's liability to third\n\nparties if that liability was based on a single incident, and a\n\ngreater share if the underlying liability was based on multiple\n\nincidents.\n\n            National Casualty was First State's reinsurer for these\n\npolicies.    It was obligated to reimburse First State for some\n\nportion of the latter's payments to its insureds. Briefly put, the\n\nstructure of the reinsurance contracts was such that, if First\n\nState settled its underlying claims on a single-occurrence basis,\n\nNational Casualty would reimburse it for a greater amount, and if\n\nit settled those claims on a multiple-occurrence basis, National\n\nCasualty would pay less.\n\n            First State settled a number of contested claims under\n\nthe underlying policies, and looked to National Casualty for\n\nreimbursement.      It   asserted   to    National   Casualty   that   the\n\nunderlying claims had been settled on a single-occurrence basis and\n\nthat it was therefore entitled to a high level of reimbursement.\n\nNational Casualty, suspecting that First State had misrepresented\n\nthe bases on which the underlying claims had been settled in an\n\neffort to maximize its reimbursement, compelled arbitration, as it\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fwas entitled to do under the contracts' binding and mandatory\n\narbitration clauses.2   The parties selected an arbitration panel\n\nunder the terms of their agreement, which permitted each side to\n\nchoose one member of the panel, with a third panel member selected\n\nby the two unilaterally appointed members.\n\n          During the arbitration, National Casualty requested that\n\nFirst State provide it with certain documents that detailed First\n\nState's internal legal assessments of the claims for which it was\n\nrequesting reinsurance payments.      National Casualty claimed that\n\nthese documents, and these documents only, would reveal the basis\n\non which First State had settled the underlying claims, and that\n\nproduction of the documents was therefore necessary in order to\n\ndetermine National Casualty's obligations to First State.        The\n\npanel ordered First State to produce the documents, warning that,\n\nif it did not, the panel would draw whatever negative inferences it\n\ndeemed appropriate.   First State, claiming that the documents were\n\nprivileged attorney-client communications or attorney work-product,\n\n\n     2\n      The broad arbitration clauses in each of the reinsurance\ncontracts read: \"If any dispute shall arise between the Reinsured\nand the Reinsurer, either before or after the termination of this\nContract, with reference to the interpretation of this Contract or\nthe rights of either party with respect to any transaction under\nthis Contract, the dispute shall be referred to three arbitrators,\none to be chosen by each party and the third by the two so chosen.\n. . . The arbitrators shall consider this Contract an honorable\nengagement rather than merely a legal obligation; they are relieved\nof all judicial formalities and may abstain from following the\nstrict rules of law. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators\nshall be final and binding on both the Reinsured and the\nReinsurer.\"\n\n                                -5-\n\fdeclined to produce the documents out of fear, it said, of waiving\n\nany privilege in future dealings with its insureds.\n\n           National Casualty immediately protested First State's\n\nfailure   to   produce     the   documents.        It    requested       that    the\n\narbitration panel delay its hearings in order to give the parties\n\ntime to brief the prejudicial effect of the withholding of the\n\ndocuments, but the panel denied the request.                   National Casualty\n\nthen filed a claim in the District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts,    asking     the    court   to    enjoin       further     arbitral\n\nproceedings.     While     the   claim   before    the   District        Court   was\n\npending, the panel ruled in favor of First State, and National\n\nCasualty paid First State the balance owed as determined by the\n\npanel.    The issuance of a final order by the arbitration panel\n\nrendered National Casualty's initial claims for an injunction\n\nagainst continuation of the arbitration moot, but National Casualty\n\nthen amended its complaint.          In the amended complaint, National\n\nCasualty argued that the court should overturn the arbitration\n\naward in First State's favor because First State's failure to\n\ncomply with the arbitration panel's production order constituted a\n\nbreach of contract, voiding the arbitration clause and terminating\n\nthe arbitration panel's jurisdiction.             It also moved to have the\n\ndistrict court vacate the arbitration panel's award for procedural\n\ndeficiencies   under     sections    10(a)(1)     and    (3)    of   the    Federal\n\nArbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. §§ 10(a)(1) & (3).                   First State\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\frequested dismissal of the complaint, challenged the motion for\n\nvacatur, and moved for sanctions.             The district court denied the\n\nmotion to vacate and dismissed National Casualty's complaint, but\n\ndeclined First State's request that it impose sanctions on National\n\nCasualty.      National Casualty timely appealed.\n\n                                II. DISCUSSION\n\n              On this appeal, National Casualty urges that the district\n\ncourt was wrong to deny its motion to vacate under its various FAA\n\ntheories and to dismiss its breach of contract claim.              We discuss\n\neach issue in turn.\n\nA. FAA\n\n              The district court treated National Casualty's complaint\n\nrequesting vacatur of the arbitration panel's final award as a\n\nmotion to vacate the award under 9 U.S.C. § 10.3              We review the\n\ndisposition of a motion to vacate under FAA § 10 de novo.             Bull HN\n\nInfo. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 330 (1st Cir. 2000).              We\n\nare, however, bound, as the district court was, by the rule that\n\ncourt       review   of   arbitral   awards     is   \"extremely   narrow   and\n\nexceedingly deferential,\" id. (quoting Wheelabrator Envirotech\n\n\n        3\n      National Casualty made its original request for vacatur under\nthe FAA in its complaint. The general rule under the FAA, however,\nis that challenges brought under its provisions follow the rules of\nmotion practice.     See O.R. Securities, Inc. v. Professional\nPlanning Associates, Inc., 857 F.2d 742, 745-46 (11th Cir. 1988);\n9 U.S.C. § 6. The district court therefore treated the portions of\nthe complaint brought under the FAA as if they had been raised by\nmotion. This appears to have been proper and in any event, because\nthe issue is not raised by the parties, we will assume that it was.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fOperating Servs. Inc. v. Mass. Laborers Dist. Council Local 1144,\n\n88 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 1996)), with the result that \"[a]rbitral\n\nawards are nearly impervious to judicial oversight,\" id. (quoting\n\nTeamsters Local Union No. 42 v. Supervalu, Inc., 212 F.3d 59, 61\n\n(1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n           National Casualty limited its FAA claims on the motion to\n\nvacate to claims of procedural irregularity.           Specifically, it\n\nclaims that the award was procured by undue means in violation of\n\nsection   10(a)(1),   and   that   the   arbitrators   were   guilty   of\n\nmisconduct under section 10(a)(3).4      Our review of the procedures\n\nthat an arbitrator has implemented is, under the statute, extremely\n\nnarrow.   We turn now to identifying the scope of our review under\n\neach section and to evaluating the claims themselves.\n\n\n     4\n      9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(1) permits a court to vacate \"where the\naward was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.\" 9 U.S.C.\n§ 10(a)(3) permits vacatur \"where the arbitrators were guilty of\nmisconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient\ncause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material\nto the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights\nof any party have been prejudiced.\" National Casualty complains\nthat the district court applied the wrong legal standard in\nevaluating its claims under these provisions. The district court\nquoted our opinion in Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Autotote\nSys., Inc., 274 F.3d 34, 35 (1st Cir. 2001), and said that \"[a]n\narbitration award must be enforced if it is in any way plausible.\"\n(alteration in original).     National Casualty suggests that the\ndistrict court did not properly evaluate its claims under section\n10, because it satisfied itself that the award was generally\nplausible, and so did not scrutinize the procedures the arbitrators\nemployed for compliance with the FAA.       Nothing in Wonderland\nsuggests that it meant to make our review of arbitral decisions\nnarrower than it had been before, or to preclude review under the\nFAA or under any other source of authority. The district court\nevidently understood this, and committed no error.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f            1. Arbitrator Misconduct\n\n            Section 10(a)(3) of the FAA lists three separate grounds\n\nfor vacatur: it is appropriate \"[w]here the arbitrators were guilty\n\nof misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient\n\ncause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material\n\nto the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights\n\nof any party have been prejudiced.\"        9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(3).    National\n\nCasualty urges an argument based on the second ground: it complains\n\nthat the panel refused to hear pertinent and material evidence, and\n\nthat the refusal amounted to \"misconduct.\"\n\n            In this case, the arbitrators, who had been selected by\n\nthe parties under the terms of a contract into which each freely\n\nentered, attempted at the behest of National Casualty to compel\n\nFirst   State   to   produce   the   documents   in   question,   but   those\n\ndocuments   were     not   ultimately   produced.     What   is   more,   the\n\narbitrators determined that they could reach a fair result if they\n\ndrew an inference adverse to First State as to the contents of the\n\nwithheld documents on the basis of First State's failure to produce\n\nthem.   National Casualty's claim is that this determination, that\n\nthe case could be fairly resolved with a negative inference rather\n\nthan with the evidence sought, constituted misconduct.\n\n            We may vacate under 10(a)(3) when an arbitrator has been\n\n\"guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and\n\nmaterial to the controversy.\"           9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(3).        Not all\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\frefusals to hear evidence are misconduct, of course.              We have held\n\ninstead that, under section 10(a)(3), \"[v]acatur is appropriate\n\nonly when the exclusion of relevant evidence 'so affects the rights\n\nof a party that it may be said that he was deprived of a fair\n\nhearing.'\"      Hoteles Condado Beach, La Concha and Convention Center\n\nv. Union De Tronquistas Local 901, 763 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 1985)\n\n(quoting     Newark Stereotypers' Union No. 18 v. Newark Morning\n\nLedger Co., 397 F.2d 594, 599 (3rd Cir. 1968)).            Our evaluation of\n\nwhether a deprivation of a right to present evidence rendered a\n\nhearing unfair does not take place in a vacuum, but will be\n\ninformed by the parties' understanding of what constituted a fair\n\nhearing when they entered into their contract.            Here, the relevant\n\ncontract provisions not only relieved the arbitrators of any\n\nobligation to follow \"the strict rules of law,\" but also released\n\nthe arbitrators from \"all judicial formalities.\"               In the face of a\n\nclause   that    broad,    which   makes   no   mention   of   the   production\n\nobligations of the parties or of the discovery procedures to be\n\nfollowed, and which so fully signs over to the arbitrators the\n\npower to run the dispute resolution process unrestrained by the\n\nstrict bounds of law or of judicial process, a party will have\n\ngreat difficulty indeed making the showing, requisite to vacatur,\n\nthat their rights were prejudiced.\n\n           Of    course,    the    archetypical    case   in    which   we   will\n\nconsider a 10(a)(3) challenge is the one most clearly contemplated\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fby the statute, in which an arbitrator declines to take evidence\n\nproffered by a party.   National Casualty directs us to no case in\n\nwhich an arbitrator's failure in its attempt to compel discovery\n\nconstituted   misconduct,   and   one    might   quibble   that   the   term\n\n\"refuse\" could never apply to a case such as this, where the\n\narbitrators did not refuse but rather sought to hear the evidence\n\nat issue.   That literal interpretation, however, has not been the\n\none adopted by the circuits that have had occasion to apply the\n\nlaw, which have taken section 10(a)(3) to authorize review for\n\nevidentiary failures broader than a simple refusal to consider\n\nevidence.   See, e.g., Robbins v. Day, 954 F.2d 679 (11th Cir. 1992)\n\n(court willing to consider claim that failure to compel testimony\n\nconstituted refusal to hear evidence under section 10(a)(3)),\n\noverruled on other grounds by First Options of Chicago v. Kaplan,\n\n514 U.S. 938 (1995); Gulf Coast Indus. Workers Union v. Exxon Co.,\n\nUSA, 70 F.3d 847 (5th Cir. 1995) (arbitrator refused to hear\n\nevidence where it misled party into thinking it need not present\n\ncertain evidence).\n\n            We assume arguendo that, as in our sister circuits, the\n\nlaw in this circuit permits a party to seek vacatur under 10(a)(3)\n\nwhere the arbitrator has not refused to hear evidence, but has\n\ninstead merely failed in its efforts to bring certain evidence into\n\nthe proceedings.     Even so, we find no violation of the statute\n\nhere, because any failure to hear evidence did not \"'so affect[]\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe rights of a party that it may be said that he was deprived of\n\na fair hearing.'\"    The arbitrators ruled that as a result of First\n\nState's refusal to produce the requested documents, they would draw\n\ninferences against First State as to what those documents would\n\nshow.     This is a routine remedy, well within the arbitrator's\n\npowers.    The drawing of an inference against First State in this\n\ncase offset any unfairness to National Casualty that resulted from\n\nholding a hearing without giving National Casualty access to the\n\nactual documents it sought.\n\n            We make this evaluation in light of the contract between\n\nthe parties, which, as we have noted, contemplated broad power in\n\nthe arbitrator to conduct the arbitral proceedings.           We note also\n\nthat we have no reason here to suspect coercion or fraud in the\n\ninducement    on   the   part   of   the    parties,   who   appear   to   be\n\nsophisticated and capable of negotiating their business contracts\n\nin advance to protect themselves from the potential folly of any\n\narbitrator they elect to subject their disputes to.               In these\n\ncircumstances, we have no difficulty holding that the procedural\n\ndevice the arbitration panel implemented, offering a party the\n\nchoice between production and a negative inference, was well within\n\nthe discretion committed to it by the parties under the FAA.\n\n            National Casualty's secondary argument is its assertion\n\nthat the arbitrators could not have reached the results they\n\nreached if they had drawn the promised negative inference.            There\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fare several problems with this analysis, apart from the fact that\n\nits premise is false.      First, this is simply an attack on the\n\nmerits of the award, which National Casualty has eschewed. Second,\n\ncourts do not generally review what weight arbitrators give to a\n\nsingle piece of evidence.       Finally, arbitrators need not give\n\nspecific reasons for the decisions they reach.          For all of these\n\nreasons, this argument has no merit.\n\n          2. Undue Means\n\n          National   Casualty    also   argues   that   the   arbitration\n\npanel's decision should be vacated as the product of \"undue means.\"\n\nSection 10(a)(1) permits vacatur \"[w]here the award was procured by\n\ncorruption, fraud, or undue means.\"       9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(1).      While\n\nthis circuit has never confronted a claim for vacatur for \"undue\n\nmeans,\" our sister circuits sensibly read the clause in a way that\n\nbars National Casualty's claim.     The phrase \"undue means\" in the\n\nstatute follows the terms \"corruption\" and \"fraud.\"              It is a\n\nfamiliar principle of statutory construction that a word should be\n\nknown by the company it keeps.    See Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co.,\n\n367 U.S. 303, 307 (1961).       The best reading of the term \"undue\n\nmeans\" under the maxim noscitur a sociis is that it describes\n\nunderhanded or conniving ways of procuring an award that are\n\nsimilar to corruption or fraud, but do not precisely constitute\n\neither.   See PaineWebber Group, Inc. v.

Here, one party was\n\noffered a choice between producing documents or having to contend\n\nwith an inference about their content.               This, as we have just\n\ndiscussed, was a choice that was within the arbitrator's power to\n\noffer.   To hold that the arbitrator may offer choice A or choice B\n\nto a party, but that the party's selection of choice B would\n\ninvalidate the arbitrator's award, would defy common sense, and we\n\nwill not do it.    We therefore affirm the district court's holding\n\nthat First State did not procure the arbitrator's award by undue\n\nmeans.\n\nB. Breach of Contract\n\n           The district court dismissed National Casualty's claims\n\nfor breach of contract under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(6)   for   failure   to   state   a   claim.     We   review   12(b)(6)\n\ndismissal de novo.    Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de\n\nMelicio, 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f            National Casualty contends that First State's failure to\n\ncomply with the arbitration panel's production order constituted\n\nbreach of contract and thus terminated the panel's jurisdiction.\n\nThe question of breach, however, is not ours to decide.              The terms\n\nof the contract before us, read in light of the language of the FAA\n\nand Congress' evident intent in passing it, preclude our review of\n\nNational Casualty's claim. Indeed, to consider ourselves empowered\n\nto undertake that review would be to jeopardize the national policy\n\nin favor of arbitration.\n\n            National Casualty's argument is based in part on First\n\nOptions, 514 U.S. 938, in which the Supreme Court held that\n\nthreshold    questions   of    arbitrability      are    for   the    courts.\n\nArbitrability questions are questions about who is the proper\n\ndecision-maker in certain classes of cases.            The default rule, in\n\nthe absence of express contractual terms to the contrary, is that\n\nit is for the court to decide the validity and scope of an\n\narbitration clause, and for the arbitrator to decide all matters\n\nwithin the scope of a valid clause.              Id.    When a substantive\n\nquestion    falls   within    the   scope   of   an    arbitration    clause,\n\nprocedural questions ancillary to the substantive one are by\n\ndefault for the arbitrator to decide.            See Marie v. Allied Home\n\nMortgage Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 9-11 (1st Cir. 2005); Richard C. Young\n\n& Co., Ltd. v. Leventhal, 389 F.3d 1, 3-5 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nPaineWebber Inc. v.

This is not even a case where a party has blatantly\n\ndefied an arbitrator's order.          Rather, National Casualty insists\n\nthat   it   may   seek   a   court   hearing   on   the   effect    of   another\n\narbitrating party's selection among procedural options offered by\n\nan arbitrator, during a discovery dispute, in the course of an\n\narbitration both parties agreed to enter.             This seems to us the\n\nvery essence of a procedural matter.            National Casualty has not\n\nprovided, and we have not found, any authority that would license\n\nthe district court to resolve the dispute involved.                The question\n\nwhether failure to comply with the arbitral order at issue here\n\nconstituted breach and entitled National Casualty to any sort of\n\nremedy was for the arbitrator, and the district court rightly\n\ndismissed National Casualty's complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f                        III.

During the arbitration proceedings, National Casualty sought certain documents in discovery, but First State refused to produce them despite an order from the arbitration panel to do so. Ultimately, the arbitrators reached a decision in First State's favor despite First State's failure to produce the desired documents. Frustrated, National Casualty brought suit in federal District Court seeking to overturn the decision of the arbitration panel. The district judge denied all relief, and this appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant National Casualty and appellee First State were parties to a set of contracts under which National Casualty served as a reinsurer to First State on a number of First State's insurance obligations. The arbitration agreement and proceedings at issue in this case relate only to the reinsurance contracts, but the argument between the parties over their obligations under the reinsurance contracts will be more intelligible if we relate some background information relevant to the First State policies for which National Casualty was the reinsurer. We use the term \"underlying policies\" to designate the policies First State issued to its insureds. The \"reinsurance contracts\" or simply \"the contracts\" will refer to the reinsurance contracts at issue in the case. There is no dispute over the facts, so we relate them as represented by the parties, with certain supplemental information gleaned from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First State was required under the underlying policies to cover some portion of its insureds' liability for so-called asbestos non-product liability claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The equipment-installation and facilities-maintenance firms typically exposed to these claims generally carry what is called \"operations\" insurance. Where insurance for product liability claims is often hard-capped at a fixed sum, operations insurance, by contrast, usually repays a certain maximum amount for <i>each</i> incident giving rise to liability. The per-incident coverage means that, if an insured had a given amount, for example, $1 million, of liability, and First State offered per-incident coverage of $100,000, First State's obligation to the insured could be determined only in light of the source of the liability. If the $1 million in liability arose from one incident, First State would owe its per-incident amount only once, and pay $100,000, while if $1 million was the insured's total liability on three claims, First State would pay $300,000. Under the policies at issue, therefore, First State would pay a smaller share of a given amount of a policyholder's liability to third parties if that liability was based on a single incident, and a greater share if the underlying liability was based on multiple incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty was First State's reinsurer for these policies. It was obligated to reimburse First State for some portion of the latter's payments to its insureds. Briefly put, the structure of the reinsurance contracts was such that, if First State settled its underlying claims on a single-occurrence basis, National Casualty would reimburse it for a greater amount, and if it settled those claims on a multiple-occurrence basis, National Casualty would pay less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First State settled a number of contested claims under the underlying policies, and looked to National Casualty for reimbursement. It asserted to National Casualty that the underlying claims had been settled on a single-occurrence basis and that it was therefore entitled to a high level of reimbursement. National Casualty, suspecting that First State had misrepresented the bases on which the underlying claims had been settled in an effort to maximize its reimbursement, compelled arbitration, as it was entitled to do under the contracts' binding and mandatory arbitration clauses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The parties selected an arbitration panel under the terms of their agreement, which permitted each side to choose one member of the panel, with a third panel member selected by the two unilaterally appointed members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the arbitration, National Casualty requested that First State provide it with certain documents that detailed First State's internal legal assessments of the claims for which it was requesting reinsurance payments. National Casualty claimed that these documents, and these documents only, would reveal the basis on which First State had settled the underlying claims, and that production of the documents was therefore necessary in order to determine National Casualty's obligations to First State. The panel ordered First State to produce the documents, warning that, if it did not, the panel would draw whatever negative inferences it deemed appropriate. First State, claiming that the documents were privileged attorney-client communications or attorney work-product, declined to produce the documents out of fear, it said, of waiving any privilege in future dealings with its insureds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty immediately protested First State's failure to produce the documents. It requested that the arbitration panel delay its hearings in order to give the parties time to brief the prejudicial effect of the withholding of the documents, but the panel denied the request. National Casualty then filed a claim in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asking the court to enjoin further arbitral proceedings. While the claim before the District Court was pending, the panel ruled in favor of First State, and National Casualty paid First State the balance owed as determined by the panel. The issuance of a final order by the arbitration panel rendered National Casualty's initial claims for an injunction against continuation of the arbitration moot, but National Casualty then amended its complaint. In the amended complaint, National Casualty argued that the court should overturn the arbitration award in First State's favor because First State's failure to comply with the arbitration panel's production order constituted a breach of contract, voiding the arbitration clause and terminating the arbitration panel's jurisdiction. It also moved to have the district court vacate the arbitration panel's award for procedural deficiencies under sections 10(a)(1) and (3) of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 10(a)(1) &amp; (3). First State requested dismissal of the complaint, challenged the motion for vacatur, and moved for sanctions. The district court denied the motion to vacate and dismissed National Casualty's complaint, but declined First State's request that it impose sanctions on National Casualty. National Casualty timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, National Casualty urges that the district court was wrong to deny its motion to vacate under its various FAA theories and to dismiss its breach of contract claim. We discuss each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. FAA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court treated National Casualty's complaint requesting vacatur of the arbitration panel's final award as a motion to vacate the award under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We review the disposition of a motion to vacate under FAA &#167; 10 <i>de novo. Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson,</i> 229 F.3d 321, 330 (1st Cir.2000). We are, however, bound, as the district court was, by the rule that court review of arbitral awards is \"extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Wheelabrator Envirotech Operating Servs. Inc. v. Mass. Laborers Dist. Council Local 1144,</i> 88 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir.1996)), with the result that \"[a]rbitral awards are nearly impervious to judicial oversight,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Teamsters Local Union No. 42 v. Supervalu, Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 59, 61 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty limited its FAA claims on the motion to vacate to claims of procedural irregularity. Specifically, it claims that the award was procured by undue means in violation of section 10(a)(1), and that the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct under section 10(a)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Our review of the procedures that an arbitrator has implemented is, under the statute, extremely narrow. We turn now to identifying the scope of our review under each section and to evaluating the claims themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Arbitrator Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 10(a)(3) of the FAA lists three separate grounds for vacatur: it is appropriate \"[w]here the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3). National Casualty urges an argument based on the second ground: it complains that the panel refused to hear pertinent and material evidence, and that the refusal amounted to \"misconduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the arbitrators, who had been selected by the parties under the terms of a contract into which each freely entered, attempted at the behest of National Casualty to compel First State to produce the documents in question, but those documents were not ultimately produced. What is more, the arbitrators determined that they could reach a fair result if they drew an inference adverse to First State as to the contents of the withheld documents on the basis of First State's failure to produce them. National Casualty's claim is that this determination, that the case could be fairly resolved with a negative inference rather than with the evidence sought, constituted misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may vacate under 10(a)(3) when an arbitrator has been \"guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3). Not all refusals to hear evidence are misconduct, of course. We have held instead that, under section 10(a)(3), \"[v]acatur is appropriate only when the exclusion of relevant evidence `so affects the rights of a party that it may be said that he was deprived of a fair hearing.'\" <i>Hoteles Condado Beach, La Concha and Convention Center v. Union De Tronquistas Local 901,</i> 763 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting <i>Newark Stereotypers' Union No. 18 v. Newark Morning Ledger Co.,</i> 397 F.2d 594, 599 (3rd Cir.1968)). Our evaluation of whether a deprivation of a right to present evidence rendered a hearing unfair does not take place in a vacuum, but will be informed by the parties' understanding of what constituted a fair hearing when they entered into their contract. Here, the relevant contract provisions not only relieved the arbitrators of any obligation to follow \"the strict rules of law,\" but also released the arbitrators from \"all judicial formalities.\" In the face of a clause that broad, which makes no mention of the production obligations of the parties or of the discovery procedures to be followed, and which so fully signs over to the arbitrators the power to run the dispute resolution process unrestrained by the strict bounds of law or of judicial process, a party will have great difficulty indeed making the showing, requisite to vacatur, that their rights were prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the archetypical case in which we will consider a 10(a)(3) challenge is the one most clearly contemplated by the statute, in which an arbitrator declines to take evidence proffered by a party. National Casualty directs us to no case in which an arbitrator's failure in its attempt to compel discovery constituted misconduct, and one might quibble that the term \"refuse\" could never apply to a case such as this, where the arbitrators did not refuse but rather sought to hear the evidence at issue. That literal interpretation, however, has not been the one adopted by the circuits that have had occasion to apply the law, which have taken section 10(a)(3) to authorize review for evidentiary failures broader than a simple refusal to consider evidence. <i>See, e.g., Robbins v. Day,</i> 954 F.2d 679 (11th Cir.1992) (court willing to consider claim that failure to compel testimony constituted refusal to hear evidence under section 10(a)(3)), <i>overruled on other grounds by First Options of Chicago v. Kaplan,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995); <i>Gulf Coast Indus. Workers Union v. Exxon Co., USA,</i> 70 F.3d 847 (5th Cir.1995) (arbitrator refused to hear evidence where it misled party into thinking it need not present certain evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume <i>arguendo</i> that, as in our sister circuits, the law in this circuit permits a party to seek vacatur under 10(a)(3) where the arbitrator has not refused to hear evidence, but has instead merely failed in its efforts to bring certain evidence into the proceedings. Even so, we find no violation of the statute here, because any failure to hear evidence did not \"`so affect[ ] the rights of a party that it may be said that he was deprived of a fair hearing.'\" The arbitrators ruled that as a result of First State's refusal to produce the requested documents, they would draw inferences against First State as to what those documents would show. This is a routine remedy, well within the arbitrator's powers. The drawing of an inference against First State in this case offset any unfairness to National Casualty that resulted from holding a hearing without giving National Casualty access to the actual documents it sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make this evaluation in light of the contract between the parties, which, as we have noted, contemplated broad power in the arbitrator to conduct the arbitral proceedings. We note also that we have no reason here to suspect coercion or fraud in the inducement on the part of the parties, who appear to be sophisticated and capable of negotiating their business contracts in advance to protect themselves from the potential folly of any arbitrator they elect to subject their disputes to. In these circumstances, we have no difficulty holding that the procedural device the arbitration panel implemented, offering a party the choice between production and a negative inference, was well within the discretion committed to it by the parties under the FAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty's secondary argument is its assertion that the arbitrators could not have reached the results they reached if they had drawn the promised negative inference. There are several problems with this analysis, apart from the fact that its premise is false. First, this is simply an attack on the merits of the award, which National Casualty has eschewed. Second, courts do not generally review what weight arbitrators give to a single piece of evidence. Finally, arbitrators need not give specific reasons for the decisions they reach. For all of these reasons, this argument has no merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Undue Means</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty also argues that the arbitration panel's decision should be vacated as the product of \"undue means.\" Section 10(a)(1) permits vacatur \"[w]here the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(1). While this circuit has never confronted a claim for vacatur for \"undue means,\" our sister circuits sensibly read the clause in a way that bars National Casualty's claim. The phrase \"undue means\" in the statute follows the terms \"corruption\" and \"fraud.\" It is a familiar principle of statutory construction that a word should be known by the company it keeps. <i>See Jarecki v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.,</i> 367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961). The best reading of the term \"undue means\" under the maxim <i>noscitur a sociis</i> is that it describes underhanded or conniving ways of procuring an award that are similar to corruption or fraud, but do not precisely constitute either. <i>See Paine-Webber Group, Inc. v. Zinsmeyer Trusts P'ship,</i> 187 F.3d 988, 991 (8th Cir.1999) (\"The term `undue means' must be read in conjunction with the words `fraud' and `corruption' that precede it in the statute.\"); <i>Am. Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> 52 F.3d 359, 362 (D.C.Cir.1995) (\"undue means\" refers to conduct \"equivalent in gravity to corruption or fraud, such as a physical threat to an arbitrator\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing appellant has argued suggests that First State acted in a manner amounting to the kind of intentional malfeasance that justifies vacatur under the statute. Here, one party was offered a choice between producing documents or having to contend with an inference about their content. This, as we have just discussed, was a choice that was within the arbitrator's power to offer. To hold that the arbitrator may offer choice A or choice B to a party, but that the party's selection of choice B would invalidate the arbitrator's award, would defy common sense, and we will not do it. We therefore affirm the district court's holding that First State did not procure the arbitrator's award by undue means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed National Casualty's claims for breach of contract under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. We review 12(b)(6) dismissal <i>de novo. Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty contends that First State's failure to comply with the arbitration panel's production order constituted breach of contract and thus terminated the panel's jurisdiction. The question of breach, however, is not ours to decide. The terms of the contract before us, read in light of the language of the FAA and Congress' evident intent in passing it, preclude our review of National Casualty's claim. Indeed, to consider ourselves empowered to undertake that review would be to jeopardize the national policy in favor of arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty's argument is based in part on <i>First Options,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985, in which the Supreme Court held that threshold questions of arbitrability are for the courts. Arbitrability questions are questions about who is the proper decision-maker in certain classes of cases. The default rule, in the absence of express contractual terms to the contrary, is that it is for the court to decide the validity and scope of an arbitration clause, and for the arbitrator to decide all matters within the scope of a valid clause. <i>Id.</i> When a substantive question falls within the scope of an arbitration clause, procedural questions ancillary to the substantive one are by default for the arbitrator to decide. <i>See Marie v. Allied Home Mortgage Corp.,</i> 402 F.3d 1, 9-11 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Richard C. Young &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Leventhal,</i> 389 F.3d 1, 3-5 (1st Cir.2004); <i>PaineWebber Inc. v. Elahi,</i> 87 F.3d 589, 599 (1st Cir.1996) (\"if the parties have (1) entered into a valid arbitration agreement, ... and (2) the arbitration agreement covers the subject matter of the underlying dispute between them, ... then we will presume that the parties have made a commitment to have an arbitrator decide all the remaining issues necessary to reach a decision on the merits of the dispute.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case of two parties contesting whether a certain matter is within the ambit of an arbitration agreement. This is not a case where an arbitrator has stated that failure to comply with a certain order would terminate the arbitrator's jurisdiction. This is not even a case where a party has blatantly defied an arbitrator's order. Rather, National Casualty insists that it may seek a <i>court</i> hearing on the effect of another arbitrating party's selection among procedural options offered by an arbitrator, during a discovery dispute, in the course of an arbitration both parties agreed to enter. This seems to us the very essence of a procedural matter. National Casualty has not provided, and we have not found, any authority that would license the district court to resolve the dispute involved. The question whether failure to comply with the arbitral order at issue here constituted breach and entitled National Casualty to any sort of remedy was for the arbitrator, and the district court rightly dismissed National Casualty's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we <i>affirm</i> the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Asbestos non-product liability claims\" are a relatively recent category of asbestos-related claims. The earlier class of claims known as \"asbestos product liability claims,\" claims pressed against asbestos manufacturers, are now rare: the pool of funds available to cover this type of claim was largely depleted by the 1990s as the asbestos manufacturers went bankrupt. In the late 1990s, claims were increasingly brought against firms which had been responsible for installing or servicing products containing asbestos. These new claims are referred to in the industry as \"non-product liability claims.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The broad arbitration clauses in each of the reinsurance contracts read: \"If any dispute shall arise between the Reinsured and the Reinsurer, either before or after the termination of this Contract, with reference to the interpretation of this Contract or the rights of either party with respect to any transaction under this Contract, the dispute shall be referred to three arbitrators, one to be chosen by each party and the third by the two so chosen.... The arbitrators shall consider this Contract an honorable engagement rather than merely a legal obligation; they are relieved of all judicial formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on both the Reinsured and the Reinsurer.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> National Casualty made its original request for vacatur under the FAA in its complaint. The general rule under the FAA, however, is that challenges brought under its provisions follow the rules of motion practice<i>See O.R. Securities, Inc. v. Professional Planning Associates, Inc.,</i> 857 F.2d 742, 745-46 (11th Cir.1988); 9 U.S.C. &#167; 6. The district court therefore treated the portions of the complaint brought under the FAA as if they had been raised by motion. This appears to have been proper and in any event, because the issue is not raised by the parties, we will assume that it was.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(1) permits a court to vacate \"where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3) permits vacatur \"where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.\" National Casualty complains that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating its claims under these provisions. The district court quoted our opinion in<i>Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Autotote Sys., Inc.,</i> 274 F.3d 34, 35 (1st Cir.2001), and said that \"[a]n arbitration award must be enforced if it is in any way plausible.\" (alteration in original). National Casualty suggests that the district court did not properly evaluate its claims under section 10, because it satisfied itself that the award was generally plausible, and so did not scrutinize the procedures the arbitrators employed for compliance with the FAA. Nothing in <i>Wonderland</i> suggests that it meant to make our review of arbitral decisions narrower than it had been before, or to preclude review under the FAA or under any other source of authority. The district court evidently understood this, and committed no error.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

During the arbitration proceedings, National Casualty sought certain documents in discovery, but First State refused to produce them despite an order from the arbitration panel to do so. Ultimately, the arbitrators reached a decision in First State's favor despite First State's failure to produce the desired documents. Frustrated, National Casualty brought suit in federal District Court seeking to overturn the decision of the arbitration panel. The district judge denied all relief, and this appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant National Casualty and appellee First State were parties to a set of contracts under which National Casualty served as a reinsurer to First State on a number of First State's insurance obligations. The arbitration agreement and proceedings at issue in this case relate only to the reinsurance contracts, but the argument between the parties over their obligations under the reinsurance contracts will be more intelligible if we relate some background information relevant to the First State policies for which National Casualty was the reinsurer. We use the term \"underlying policies\" to designate the policies First State issued to its insureds. The \"reinsurance contracts\" or simply \"the contracts\" will refer to the reinsurance contracts at issue in the case. There is no dispute over the facts, so we relate them as represented by the parties, with certain supplemental information gleaned from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First State was required under the underlying policies to cover some portion of its insureds' liability for so-called asbestos non-product liability claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The equipment-installation and facilities-maintenance firms typically exposed to these claims generally carry what is called \"operations\" insurance. Where insurance for product liability claims is often hard-capped at a fixed sum, operations insurance, by contrast, usually repays a certain maximum amount for <i>each</i> incident giving rise to liability. The per-incident coverage means that, if an insured had a given amount, for example, $1 million, of liability, and First State offered per-incident coverage of $100,000, First State's obligation to the insured could be determined only in light of the source of the liability. If the $1 million in liability arose from one incident, First State would owe its per-incident amount only once, and pay $100,000, while if $1 million was the insured's total liability on three claims, First State would pay $300,000. Under the policies at issue, therefore, First State would pay a smaller share of a given amount of a policyholder's liability to third parties if that liability was based on a single incident, and a greater share if the underlying liability was based on multiple incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty was First State's reinsurer for these policies. It was obligated to reimburse First State for some portion of the latter's payments to its insureds. Briefly put, the structure of the reinsurance contracts was such that, if First State settled its underlying claims on a single-occurrence basis, National Casualty would reimburse it for a greater amount, and if it settled those claims on a multiple-occurrence basis, National Casualty would pay less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First State settled a number of contested claims under the underlying policies, and looked to National Casualty for reimbursement. It asserted to National Casualty that the underlying claims had been settled on a single-occurrence basis and that it was therefore entitled to a high level of reimbursement. National Casualty, suspecting that First State had misrepresented the bases on which the underlying claims had been settled in an effort to maximize its reimbursement, compelled arbitration, as it was entitled to do under the contracts' binding and mandatory arbitration clauses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The parties selected an arbitration panel under the terms of their agreement, which permitted each side to choose one member of the panel, with a third panel member selected by the two unilaterally appointed members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the arbitration, National Casualty requested that First State provide it with certain documents that detailed First State's internal legal assessments of the claims for which it was requesting reinsurance payments. National Casualty claimed that these documents, and these documents only, would reveal the basis on which First State had settled the underlying claims, and that production of the documents was therefore necessary in order to determine National Casualty's obligations to First State. The panel ordered First State to produce the documents, warning that, if it did not, the panel would draw whatever negative inferences it deemed appropriate. First State, claiming that the documents were privileged attorney-client communications or attorney work-product, declined to produce the documents out of fear, it said, of waiving any privilege in future dealings with its insureds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty immediately protested First State's failure to produce the documents. It requested that the arbitration panel delay its hearings in order to give the parties time to brief the prejudicial effect of the withholding of the documents, but the panel denied the request. National Casualty then filed a claim in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asking the court to enjoin further arbitral proceedings. While the claim before the District Court was pending, the panel ruled in favor of First State, and National Casualty paid First State the balance owed as determined by the panel. The issuance of a final order by the arbitration panel rendered National Casualty's initial claims for an injunction against continuation of the arbitration moot, but National Casualty then amended its complaint. In the amended complaint, National Casualty argued that the court should overturn the arbitration award in First State's favor because First State's failure to comply with the arbitration panel's production order constituted a breach of contract, voiding the arbitration clause and terminating the arbitration panel's jurisdiction. It also moved to have the district court vacate the arbitration panel's award for procedural deficiencies under sections 10(a)(1) and (3) of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 10(a)(1) &amp; (3). First State requested dismissal of the complaint, challenged the motion for vacatur, and moved for sanctions. The district court denied the motion to vacate and dismissed National Casualty's complaint, but declined First State's request that it impose sanctions on National Casualty. National Casualty timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, National Casualty urges that the district court was wrong to deny its motion to vacate under its various FAA theories and to dismiss its breach of contract claim.

Specifically, it claims that the award was procured by undue means in violation of section 10(a)(1), and that the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct under section 10(a)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Our review of the procedures that an arbitrator has implemented is, under the statute, extremely narrow. We turn now to identifying the scope of our review under each section and to evaluating the claims themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Arbitrator Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 10(a)(3) of the FAA lists three separate grounds for vacatur: it is appropriate \"[w]here the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3). National Casualty urges an argument based on the second ground: it complains that the panel refused to hear pertinent and material evidence, and that the refusal amounted to \"misconduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the arbitrators, who had been selected by the parties under the terms of a contract into which each freely entered, attempted at the behest of National Casualty to compel First State to produce the documents in question, but those documents were not ultimately produced. What is more, the arbitrators determined that they could reach a fair result if they drew an inference adverse to First State as to the contents of the withheld documents on the basis of First State's failure to produce them. National Casualty's claim is that this determination, that the case could be fairly resolved with a negative inference rather than with the evidence sought, constituted misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may vacate under 10(a)(3) when an arbitrator has been \"guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3). Not all refusals to hear evidence are misconduct, of course. We have held instead that, under section 10(a)(3), \"[v]acatur is appropriate only when the exclusion of relevant evidence `so affects the rights of a party that it may be said that he was deprived of a fair hearing.'\" <i>Hoteles Condado Beach, La Concha and Convention Center v. Union De Tronquistas Local 901,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453021\"><a href=\"/opinion/453021/hoteles-condado-beach-la-concha-and-convention-center-v-union-de/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting <i>Newark Stereotypers' Union No. 18 v.

Our evaluation of whether a deprivation of a right to present evidence rendered a hearing unfair does not take place in a vacuum, but will be informed by the parties' understanding of what constituted a fair hearing when they entered into their contract. Here, the relevant contract provisions not only relieved the arbitrators of any obligation to follow \"the strict rules of law,\" but also released the arbitrators from \"all judicial formalities.\" In the face of a clause that broad, which makes no mention of the production obligations of the parties or of the discovery procedures to be followed, and which so fully signs over to the arbitrators the power to run the dispute resolution process unrestrained by the strict bounds of law or of judicial process, a party will have great difficulty indeed making the showing, requisite to vacatur, that their rights were prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the archetypical case in which we will consider a 10(a)(3) challenge is the one most clearly contemplated by the statute, in which an arbitrator declines to take evidence proffered by a party. National Casualty directs us to no case in which an arbitrator's failure in its attempt to compel discovery constituted misconduct, and one might quibble that the term \"refuse\" could never apply to a case such as this, where the arbitrators did not refuse but rather sought to hear the evidence at issue. That literal interpretation, however, has not been the one adopted by the circuits that have had occasion to apply the law, which have taken section 10(a)(3) to authorize review for evidentiary failures broader than a simple refusal to consider evidence. <i>See, e.g., Robbins v.

Even so, we find no violation of the statute here, because any failure to hear evidence did not \"`so affect[ ] the rights of a party that it may be said that he was deprived of a fair hearing.'\" The arbitrators ruled that as a result of First State's refusal to produce the requested documents, they would draw inferences against First State as to what those documents would show. This is a routine remedy, well within the arbitrator's powers. The drawing of an inference against First State in this case offset any unfairness to National Casualty that resulted from holding a hearing without giving National Casualty access to the actual documents it sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make this evaluation in light of the contract between the parties, which, as we have noted, contemplated broad power in the arbitrator to conduct the arbitral proceedings. We note also that we have no reason here to suspect coercion or fraud in the inducement on the part of the parties, who appear to be sophisticated and capable of negotiating their business contracts in advance to protect themselves from the potential folly of any arbitrator they elect to subject their disputes to. In these circumstances, we have no difficulty holding that the procedural device the arbitration panel implemented, offering a party the choice between production and a negative inference, was well within the discretion committed to it by the parties under the FAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty's secondary argument is its assertion that the arbitrators could not have reached the results they reached if they had drawn the promised negative inference. There are several problems with this analysis, apart from the fact that its premise is false. First, this is simply an attack on the merits of the award, which National Casualty has eschewed. Second, courts do not generally review what weight arbitrators give to a single piece of evidence. Finally, arbitrators need not give specific reasons for the decisions they reach. For all of these reasons, this argument has no merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Undue Means</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty also argues that the arbitration panel's decision should be vacated as the product of \"undue means.\" Section 10(a)(1) permits vacatur \"[w]here the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(1). While this circuit has never confronted a claim for vacatur for \"undue means,\" our sister circuits sensibly read the clause in a way that bars National Casualty's claim. The phrase \"undue means\" in the statute follows the terms \"corruption\" and \"fraud.\" It is a familiar principle of statutory construction that a word should be known by the company it keeps. <i>See Jarecki v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106270\"><a href=\"/opinion/106270/jarecki-v-gd-searle-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 307, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106270\"><a href=\"/opinion/106270/jarecki-v-gd-searle-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span> (1961). The best reading of the term \"undue means\" under the maxim <i>noscitur a sociis</i> is that it describes underhanded or conniving ways of procuring an award that are similar to corruption or fraud, but do not precisely constitute either. <i>See Paine-Webber Group, Inc. v. Zinsmeyer Trusts P'ship,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765699\"><a href=\"/opinion/765699/painewebber-group-inc-painewebber-inc-mitchell-hutchins-asset/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>, 991 (8th Cir.1999) (\"The term `undue means' must be read in conjunction with the words `fraud' and `corruption' that precede it in the statute.\"); <i>Am.

Here, one party was offered a choice between producing documents or having to contend with an inference about their content. This, as we have just discussed, was a choice that was within the arbitrator's power to offer. To hold that the arbitrator may offer choice A or choice B to a party, but that the party's selection of choice B would invalidate the arbitrator's award, would defy common sense, and we will not do it. We therefore affirm the district court's holding that First State did not procure the arbitrator's award by undue means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Feliciano de Melecio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201545\"><a href=\"/opinion/201545/centro-medico-del-v-feliciano-de-melecio/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty contends that First State's failure to comply with the arbitration panel's production order constituted breach of contract and thus terminated the panel's jurisdiction. The question of breach, however, is not ours to decide. The terms of the contract before us, read in light of the language of the FAA and Congress' evident intent in passing it, preclude our review of National Casualty's claim. Indeed, to consider ourselves empowered to undertake that review would be to jeopardize the national policy in favor of arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Casualty's argument is based in part on <i>First Options,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117937\"><a href=\"/opinion/117937/first-options-of-chicago-inc-v-kaplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117937\"><a href=\"/opinion/117937/first-options-of-chicago-inc-v-kaplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1920</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117937\"><a href=\"/opinion/117937/first-options-of-chicago-inc-v-kaplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, in which the Supreme Court held that threshold questions of arbitrability are for the courts. Arbitrability questions are questions about who is the proper decision-maker in certain classes of cases. The default rule, in the absence of express contractual terms to the contrary, is that it is for the court to decide the validity and scope of an arbitration clause, and for the arbitrator to decide all matters within the scope of a valid clause. <i>Id.</i> When a substantive question falls within the scope of an arbitration clause, procedural questions ancillary to the substantive one are by default for the arbitrator to decide. <i>See Marie v. Allied Home Mortgage Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201485\"><a href=\"/opinion/201485/marie-v-allied-home-mtg-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9-11 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Richard C. Young &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Leventhal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201310\"><a href=\"/opinion/201310/richard-c-young-co-v-leventhal/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-5 (1st Cir.2004); <i>PaineWebber Inc. v. Elahi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720635\"><a href=\"/opinion/720635/painewebber-incorporated-v-mohamad-s-elahi-kokab-moarefi-elahi-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 599 (1st Cir.1996) (\"if the parties have (1) entered into a valid arbitration agreement, ... and (2) the arbitration agreement covers the subject matter of the underlying dispute between them, ... then we will presume that the parties have made a commitment to have an arbitrator decide all the remaining issues necessary to reach a decision on the merits of the dispute.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case of two parties contesting whether a certain matter is within the ambit of an arbitration agreement. This is not a case where an arbitrator has stated that failure to comply with a certain order would terminate the arbitrator's jurisdiction. This is not even a case where a party has blatantly defied an arbitrator's order. Rather, National Casualty insists that it may seek a <i>court</i> hearing on the effect of another arbitrating party's selection among procedural options offered by an arbitrator, during a discovery dispute, in the course of an arbitration both parties agreed to enter. This seems to us the very essence of a procedural matter. National Casualty has not provided, and we have not found, any authority that would license the district court to resolve the dispute involved. The question whether failure to comply with the arbitral order at issue here constituted breach and entitled National Casualty to any sort of remedy was for the arbitrator, and the district court rightly dismissed National Casualty's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we <i>affirm</i> the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Asbestos non-product liability claims\" are a relatively recent category of asbestos-related claims. The earlier class of claims known as \"asbestos product liability claims,\" claims pressed against asbestos manufacturers, are now rare: the pool of funds available to cover this type of claim was largely depleted by the 1990s as the asbestos manufacturers went bankrupt. In the late 1990s, claims were increasingly brought against firms which had been responsible for installing or servicing products containing asbestos. These new claims are referred to in the industry as \"non-product liability claims.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The broad arbitration clauses in each of the reinsurance contracts read: \"If any dispute shall arise between the Reinsured and the Reinsurer, either before or after the termination of this Contract, with reference to the interpretation of this Contract or the rights of either party with respect to any transaction under this Contract, the dispute shall be referred to three arbitrators, one to be chosen by each party and the third by the two so chosen.... The arbitrators shall consider this Contract an honorable engagement rather than merely a legal obligation; they are relieved of all judicial formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on both the Reinsured and the Reinsurer.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> National Casualty made its original request for vacatur under the FAA in its complaint. The general rule under the FAA, however, is that challenges brought under its provisions follow the rules of motion practice<i>See O.R. Securities, Inc. v. Professional Planning Associates, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511872\"><a href=\"/opinion/511872/or-securities-inc-v-professional-planning-associates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 745-46 (11th Cir.1988); 9 U.S.C. &#167; 6. The district court therefore treated the portions of the complaint brought under the FAA as if they had been raised by motion. This appears to have been proper and in any event, because the issue is not raised by the parties, we will assume that it was.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(1) permits a court to vacate \"where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3) permits vacatur \"where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.\" National Casualty complains that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating its claims under these provisions. The district court quoted our opinion in<i>Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Autotote Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199740\"><a href=\"/opinion/199740/wonderland-greyhound-v-autotote-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2001), and said that \"[a]n arbitration award must be enforced if it is in any way plausible.\" (alteration in original). National Casualty suggests that the district court did not properly evaluate its claims under section 10, because it satisfied itself that the award was generally plausible, and so did not scrutinize the procedures the arbitrators employed for compliance with the FAA. Nothing in <i>Wonderland</i> suggests that it meant to make our review of arbitral decisions narrower than it had been before, or to preclude review under the FAA or under any other source of authority. The district court evidently understood this, and committed no error.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
