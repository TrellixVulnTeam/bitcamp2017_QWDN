D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     James S. Hewes on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 28, 2006\n\f                 Per Curiam.     Steven Washington, who pled guilty to\n\ndistributing heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), was\n\nsentenced, after United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), to\n\n168 months' imprisonment, the bottom of the applicable Guideline\n\nrange.       The length of his sentence was based primarily on his\n\n\"career offender\" status under USSG § 4B1.1(b)(C).1               In this appeal\n\nfrom       his   sentence,     Washington   argues   that   his    sentence   is\n\nunreasonably high in light of (i) the relatively small amount of\n\nheroin involved (less than one gram) and (ii) the district court's\n\nfailure adequately to explain the sentence with respect to the\n\nprovisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), particularly the \"parsimony\"\n\nprovision.        After carefully reviewing the record and the parties'\n\nbriefs, we conclude that the sentence is not unreasonable and was\n\nadequately explained.\n\n                 A sentencing judge is \"not obliged to give a lower\n\nsentence because of the quantity,\" United States v. Saez, 444 F.3d\n\n15, 19 (1st Cir. 2006) (emphasis added), particularly where, as\n\nhere, other considerations weigh in the opposite direction, see\n\n\n       1\n      It is undisputed that Washington qualified for career\noffender status because he committed the instant offense when he\nwas at least 18 years old (he was 33), the instant offense is a\ncontrolled substance offense (distribution of heroin), and he had\nat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence\nor a controlled substance offense (one for a crime of violence--\nrobbery--and one for a controlled substance offense--manufacture,\ndelivery, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute).\nThat status resulted in an offense level of 30, rather than 10; a\ncriminal history category of VI rather than V; and a Guideline\nrange of 168 to 210 months, rather than 21 to 27 months.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fgenerally United States v. Sagendorf, 445 F.3d 515, 518 n.2 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (per curiam) (noting that \"'the requirement that the\n\nsentencing judge consider a . . . factor that may cut in a\n\ndefendant's favor does not bestow on the defendant an entitlement\n\nto receive any particular \"credit\" under that factor'\" (citation\n\nomitted)).   Here, the judge expressly acknowledged the severity of\n\nthe sentence in relation to the small quantity of drugs involved\n\nand concluded that a long sentence was warranted in light of\n\nCongress's express intent that career offenders be sentenced \"to a\n\nterm of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized.\"          28\n\nU.S.C. § 994(h).      Any resulting disproportionality between the\n\nsentence and the drug quantity \"is one that results from the policy\n\nchoices   made   by   Congress   and   implemented   by   the   Sentencing\n\nCommission.\"     United States v. Caraballo, 447 F.3d 26, 27-28 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (per curiam).    The district court therefore permissibly\n\ndeclined to impose a below-Guidelines sentence on that basis. Id.;\n\ncf. United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 520 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc) (finding it permissible to sentence defendant as a\n\ncareer offender even if his prior offenses were relatively minor).\n\n           The court also tempered the consequences of Washington's\n\ncareer offender status by sentencing him to the bottom of the\n\napplicable Guideline range.      The resulting fourteen-year sentence,\n\nwhich the court characterized as \"very severe,\" was still more than\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ffour years below the top of the applicable Guideline range and six\n\nyears below the twenty-year statutory maximum.\n\n               In rejecting Washington's plea for a below-Guidelines\n\nsentence, the district court also expressly considered several\n\nfactors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).                Specifically, the court\n\nconsidered       and     rejected   Washington's     argument    that   a     below-\n\nGuidelines sentence was necessary to avoid unwarranted disparity\n\nwith the suspended sentence given to his accomplice after a state-\n\ncourt       conviction    arising   from    the   same   incident.      The   court\n\nreasoned that, even if the accomplice was more culpable (a point on\n\nwhich the parties disagreed but which the court did not resolve),\n\nWashington's harsher sentence was warranted by his more serious\n\ncriminal history.2           The district court further opined that the\n\ndisparity to be avoided was among sentences in the federal system,\n\nnot between state and federal sentences.                   Without deciding the\n\nlatter point, see United States v. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d 1, 10 n.**\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), we agree with the district court that a sentencing\n\ndisparity       explained     by    differences     in    defendants'    criminal\n\nhistories or degrees of cooperation is not \"unwarranted\" within the\n\nmeaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), see Saez, 444 F.3d at 18.\n\n               The district court also expressly considered and rejected\n\nWashington's        arguments       that    the    purposes     of   sentencing,\n\n\n        2\n      The record further indicates that the accomplice's sentence\nmay have taken into account her cooperation with local law\nenforcement authorities.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fparticularly the need to afford adequate deterrence and protect the\n\npublic    from   future       crimes    by     this   defendant,       18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a)(2)(B),(C), could be served by a lesser sentence. In that\n\nregard, the district court noted that despite the \"very severe\n\nsentences\" that Washington received for his prior offenses, soon\n\nafter he was released from prison on those sentences he continued\n\nto commit other serious crimes.                 For that reason, the court\n\nconcluded that an even more severe sentence was necessary this\n\ntime.    The district court also took into account Washington's need\n\nfor   educational       and   vocational      training   and   substance     abuse\n\ntreatment,    id.   §    3553(a)(2)(D),       by   encouraging   him    to   \"take\n\nadvantage of every program in prison\" and recommending that he be\n\nenrolled in a comprehensive drug treatment program.\n\n            Although the district court did not expressly cite the\n\n\"parsimony\" provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the above-described\n\ncomments evidence its consideration of the underlying principle\n\nthat a sentence should be sufficient but no higher than necessary\n\nto meet the statutory goals.           Nor is there any indication that the\n\nsentence was designed to serve some other, impermissible, purpose.\n\nSee United States v. Scherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 95 (1st Cir. 2006) (en\n\nbanc).    Accordingly, we find no error in the court's failure to\n\nincant the parsimony provision per se. See United States v. Dixon,\n\nNo. 05-1559, 2006 WL 1452687, at *9 (1st Cir. May 26, 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f          Similarly, although the court did not expressly address\n\nother potentially mitigating factors proffered by Washington at\n\nsentencing--including his troubled childhood and his efforts at\n\npost-conviction rehabilitation while in prison--we infer that the\n\ncourt was unpersuaded that those factors outweighed the stated\n\ngrounds for declining to impose a below-Guidelines sentence.   See\n\nScherrer, 444 F.3d at 94.    No further explanation was required.\n\nCf. United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006) (stating\n\nthat \"'the farther the judge's sentence departs from the guidelines\n\nsentence . . . the more compelling the justification . . . the\n\njudge must offer'\" (citation omitted)).\n\n          Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
