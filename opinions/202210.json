After review of the briefs, record, and relevant\n\ncase law, we have concluded that the district court properly\n\ndismissed appellants’ claims for the reasons articulated in its\n\nOrder of July 5, 2005.        In very brief summary, we note that, as an\n\nemployee subject to a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”),\n\nappellant has no cause of action for wrongful discharge under New\n\nHampshire law.      See Censullo v. Brenka Video, Inc., 989 F.2d 40, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).       Moreover, any such claim, as well as any related\n\nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, would\n\nrequire review of appellant’s contractual rights under the CBA and\n\nthus would be preempted.        See Flibotte v. Penn. Truck Lines, Inc.,\n\n131 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n     Although some state law claims may be brought by employees\n\ncovered by collective bargaining agreements, see Lingle v. Norge\n\nDiv. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U.S. 399, 409 n.8, 413 (1988); Allis-\n\nChalmers    Corp.     v.   Lueck,   471   U.S.   202,   211-13   (1985),     that\n\nopportunity is of no aid to appellant.              His asserted causes of\n\naction     do   not    implicate     specific,     independent       state    law\n\nprotections, such as against retaliation for filing a worker’s\n\ncompensation    claim.       See,   e.g.,   Lingle,     486   U.S.   at   406-10.\n\nAlthough his complaint makes passing reference to defamation and\n\nother possible state law claims, he neither alleged nor argued such\n\ncauses of action in the district court; we consequently have no\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\foccasion to consider whether they would be sufficiently distinct to\n\navoid preemption.\n\n     Finally, the alleged constitutional violations are, to quote\n\nthe district court, “curious claims, given the fact that his former\n\nemployer is a private, rather than governmental, entity.”\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
