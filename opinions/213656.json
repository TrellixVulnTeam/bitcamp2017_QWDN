Plaintiff   Víctor     Hugo   Ríos-Colón\n\n(“Ríos”) appeals from the judgment of the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico, dismissing his suit alleging\n\nracial discrimination in the course of his employment in the Puerto\n\nRico Police Department for failure to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief can be granted.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).         The complaint\n\nalleged that he is black and that his supervisor in the Police\n\nDepartment used racial slurs against him and transferred him to a\n\nless desirable position.         For the reasons explained below, we\n\nconclude that the complaint plausibly alleged claims of racial\n\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2000e-17, and of the Equal Protection\n\nClause   of   the   Fourteenth     Amendment    of   the    United   States\n\nConstitution, made actionable by 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Accordingly, we\n\nvacate in part and remand for further proceedings.1\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\nI. Allegations of the Complaint\n\n     The complaint2 alleges as follows:\n\n     At all relevant times, Ríos was an officer in the Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n     1\n      The complaint also asserted claims under section 1983 of\ndeprivation of rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth\nAmendments, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nwhich the district court also dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim. Ríos does not challenge those rulings on appeal.\n     2\n      “Complaint” refers to the First Amended Complaint filed\nSeptember 10, 2008.\n\n                                   - 2 -\n\fPolice Department.        He holds a master’s degree in education from\n\nAna G. Méndez University and has been certified to give drug\n\nprevention talks to schools, churches, and offices.               The complaint\n\nasserts that he is “of the Negro race” and that “the color of his\n\nskin is black.”\n\n     From    2005    to   2007,   Ríos   was   assigned    to     the   Division\n\nPrevención Drogas Mediante Educación a la Comunidad (hereinafter\n\nthe “Drug Prevention Division”) for the Aguadilla area, which had\n\noffices near the Aguadilla airport.            His duties included giving\n\ndrug prevention talks and required him to work nights and weekends.\n\nHis earnings included approximately $100 per month in overtime pay.\n\n     Agent Orlando Adames Cardona (“Adames”) was also assigned to\n\nthe Drug Prevention Division. Both Ríos and Adames were supervised\n\nby Lieutenant Eddie Cordero Martínez (“Cordero”).                   Adames and\n\nCordero are white.\n\n     In     August   2006,   Cordero     and   another    white    lieutenant,\n\nElizabeth      Acevedo-Rivera       (“Acevedo”),         began      exhibiting\n\ndiscriminatory animus against Ríos in front of other officers. For\n\nexample, the complaint alleges that Cordero, in front of Ríos, made\n\nreference to “this damn nigger,” and that Acevedo said of Ríos “I\n\nwill take that negro out of here,” and “I don’t want him here.”\n\nAcevedo and Cordero also allegedly conspired to deprive Ríos of the\n\nuse of his office.\n\n     In February 2007, Cordero reassigned Ríos to the Bureau of\n\n\n                                    - 3 -\n\fIllegal Arms, Airport Illegal Arms Section, West Region, also in\n\nAguadilla. The new position was less desirable in that it required\n\nRíos to travel to other airports by himself without backup and did\n\nnot offer a private office or the same opportunity for overtime\n\npay.    No one was assigned to fill Ríos’s former position at the\n\nDrug Prevention Division.\n\n       In December 2007, Adames was transferred at his request,\n\ncreating a second vacancy at the Drug Prevention Division. Cordero\n\nrecommended a white agent, Sixto Salinas Cabàn (“Salinas”), for the\n\nposition,    and    he   was   appointed.      The       complaint   asserts   on\n\ninformation and belief that Salinas was less qualified than Ríos as\n\nhe had only recently obtained a bachelor’s degree and was not\n\ncertified to give drug prevention talks.\n\nII. The District Court’s Decisions\n\n       On May 23, 2008, Ríos filed a complaint in the United States\n\nDistrict    Court    for   the   District     of    Puerto   Rico,    naming   as\n\ndefendants    in    both   their   personal        and   official    capacities:\n\nCordero; Acevedo; and Pedro A. Toledo-Dávila (“Toledo”), who was\n\nSuperintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department.                  The court\n\ngranted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint for failure\n\nto state a claim.        Ríos-Colón v. Toledo-Dávila, No. 08-1577-CCC,\n\n2009 WL 1767566 (D.P.R. June 19, 2009).\n\n       The court ruled that the complaint failed under Title VII\n\nbecause     that    statute    applies   to    employers,      not    individual\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\fsupervisors, and the complaint did not name the Police Department\n\nas a defendant.   Id. at *3.   The court also held that the complaint\n\ndid not plausibly allege violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth,\n\nand Tenth Amendments, or the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. Id. at *3-*6. Without addressing whether the complaint\n\nstated a claim of racial discrimination in violation of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court dismissed\n\nall of the federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the remaining claims under Puerto Rico law.\n\n     Upon Ríos’s motion for reconsideration, the court upheld its\n\nprior ruling.     With respect to the Title VII claim, the court\n\nacknowledged that the complaint “clearly pled a cause of action for\n\nrace discrimination,” but adhered to the dismissal of the claim\n\nbecause the complaint did not name the Police Department as a\n\ndefendant.   Once again, the court did not address whether the\n\ncomplaint stated a claim of racial discrimination in violation of\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause.\n\n     This appeal followed.\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n     We review the district court’s dismissal of the complaint de\n\nnovo.    Sanchez v. Pereira-Castillo, 590 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain\n\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to\n\nrelief that is plausible on its face.’”     Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fCt. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.\n\n544, 570 (2007)).\n\n        Ríos advances two arguments on appeal.                     First, noting the\n\ndistrict          court’s   eventual      acknowledgment         that    the   complaint\n\nasserted a viable claim of violation of Title VII, Ríos contends\n\nthe court erred in dismissing it on the ground that he brought the\n\nsuit        against   his     superior    officers,    rather      than    against     his\n\nemployer.         Second, Ríos contends the complaint plausibly alleged a\n\nclaim of racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\n\nClause.        We agree with both contentions.\n\nI.   Title VII\n\n        Although acknowledging that the complaint “clearly pled a\n\ncause of action for race discrimination” in violation of Title\n\nVII,3       the    district    court     dismissed    the   claim       because   it   was\n\nasserted against Ríos’s three supervisors, instead of against the\n\nPolice Department, his employer.\n\n        Given       that    the   complaint        named    as    defendants       Ríos’s\n\nsupervisors (including the Department’s Superintendent) in their\n\nofficial capacities, the failure to name the Police Department\n\nitself did not justify dismissal of the Title VII claim.                          We have\n\nruled that a Title VII claim brought against a supervisory employee\n\nin his official capacity as an agent of the employer operates as a\n\n\n        3\n      On appeal, defendants have not challenged the district\ncourt’s   conclusion  that   the   complaint plausibly alleges\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII.\n\n                                           - 6 -\n\fclaim against the employer.          See Vera v. McHugh, 622 F.3d 17, 25\n\nn.8 (1st Cir. 2010) (noting that, in a Title VII suit brought by an\n\nemployee of the Puerto Rico Army solely against the Secretary of\n\nthe Army, “[t]he Secretary was sued in his capacity as [the\n\nplaintiff’s] employer”); see also Sauers v. Salt Lake Cnty., 1 F.3d\n\n1122, 1125 (10th Cir. 1993) (“[T]he proper method for a plaintiff\n\nto recover under Title VII is by suing the employer, either by\n\nnaming the supervisory employees as agents of the employer or by\n\nnaming the employer directly.” (quoting Busby v. City of Orlando,\n\n931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir. 1991))).\n\nII.   Equal Protection\n\n      The district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety\n\nwithout addressing whether it plausibly alleged a violation of the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.           We agree with Ríos that the complaint\n\nasserted a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, which should\n\nnot   have   been   dismissed.       To     prevail    on    a    claim   of   racial\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, a\n\nplaintiff must establish (1) that he was selected for adverse\n\ntreatment compared with others similarly situated, and (2) that the\n\nselection for adverse treatment was based on his race.                            See\n\nRubinovitz     v.   Rogato,   60    F.3d    906,    909-10       (1st   Cir.   1995);\n\nYerardi’s Moody St. Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. Bd. of Selectmen, 878\n\nF.2d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n      The    complaint   alleges     that    Ríos     was   transferred        from   a\n\n\n                                      - 7 -\n\fposition with the Drug Prevention Division to a less desirable\n\nposition with the Bureau of Illegal Arms.               The position to which he\n\nwas   transferred       allegedly       offered   materially   less     attractive\n\nworking conditions and fewer opportunities to earn overtime pay.\n\nThe    complaint        furthermore         plausibly      alleges     that        the\n\ndisadvantageous transfer was based on racial discrimination. It\n\nalleges   that    Cordero,    the       supervisor   who    caused    Ríos    to    be\n\ntransferred and who recommended a less qualified white candidate in\n\npreference to Ríos when a position in the Drug Prevention Division\n\nlater became available, had used abusive and derogatory slurs\n\nexpressing explicit anti-black racial bias. These allegations were\n\nsufficient to plead a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection\n\nClause,   as     they    convey     a    plausible   inference       that    Cordero\n\ndiscriminated against Ríos in official acts, depriving him of\n\nsignificant advantages because of his race.                See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1949 (a claim survives a motion to dismiss if the factual\n\nallegations permit “the reasonable inference that the defendant is\n\nliable for the misconduct alleged”); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\n\nPena, 515 U.S. 200, 229–30 (1995) (“[W]henever the government\n\ntreats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person\n\nhas suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and\n\nspirit of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.”).\n\n      We conclude that the complaint pleaded a claim under section\n\n1983 of racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\n\n\n                                         - 8 -\n\fClause, which claim should not have been dismissed.4\n\nIII. Supplemental Jurisdiction\n\n     Defendants argue that Ríos should be precluded from advancing\n\nhis local law claims upon remand because in this appeal he did not\n\nseparately challenge the district court’s decision to decline\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over those claims.          We disagree.   The\n\ndistrict court’s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction was\n\nbased on its conclusion that the complaint failed to state any\n\nviable federal claims. Our decision to vacate the dismissal of the\n\nfederal claims eliminates the basis of that decision.         We find no\n\nwaiver. We accordingly vacate the district court’s order declining\n\nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the local law claims.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n     The district court’s dismissal of Ríos’s claims of racial\n\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII and the Equal Protection\n\nClause,     and   its   order   declining    to   exercise   supplemental\n\njurisdiction over his local law claims, are hereby vacated, and the\n\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion. Costs of the appeal to abide the ultimate resolution of\n\nthe case.\n\n\n     4\n      The district court perhaps believed that the plaintiff’s\nclaim of racial discrimination was asserted only under Title VII\nand not as a constitutional matter.       We acknowledge that the\ncomplaint could have been clearer in this regard. Nonetheless, the\nbriefs for both the defendants and the plaintiff, submitted in\nrelation to the defendants’ motion to dismiss, expressly recognized\nthat the complaint included an equal protection claim.\n\n                                  - 9 -\n\f",

Accordingly, we\n\nvacate in part and remand for further proceedings.1\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\nI.

Ríos does not challenge those rulings on appeal.\n     2\n      “Complaint” refers to the First Amended Complaint filed\nSeptember 10, 2008.\n\n                                   - 2 -\n\fPolice Department.

June 19, 2009).\n\n       The court ruled that the complaint failed under Title VII\n\nbecause     that    statute    applies   to    employers,      not    individual\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\fsupervisors, and the complaint did not name the Police Department\n\nas a defendant.   Id. at *3.   The court also held that the complaint\n\ndid not plausibly allege violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth,\n\nand Tenth Amendments, or the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. Id. at *3-*6. Without addressing whether the complaint\n\nstated a claim of racial discrimination in violation of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court dismissed\n\nall of the federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the remaining claims under Puerto Rico law.\n\n     Upon Ríos’s motion for reconsideration, the court upheld its\n\nprior ruling.     With respect to the Title VII claim, the court\n\nacknowledged that the complaint “clearly pled a cause of action for\n\nrace discrimination,” but adhered to the dismissal of the claim\n\nbecause the complaint did not name the Police Department as a\n\ndefendant.   Once again, the court did not address whether the\n\ncomplaint stated a claim of racial discrimination in violation of\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause.\n\n     This appeal followed.\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n     We review the district court’s dismissal of the complaint de\n\nnovo.

First, noting the\n\ndistrict          court’s   eventual      acknowledgment         that    the   complaint\n\nasserted a viable claim of violation of Title VII, Ríos contends\n\nthe court erred in dismissing it on the ground that he brought the\n\nsuit        against   his     superior    officers,    rather      than    against     his\n\nemployer.         Second, Ríos contends the complaint plausibly alleged a\n\nclaim of racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\n\nClause.        We agree with both contentions.\n\nI.   Title VII\n\n        Although acknowledging that the complaint “clearly pled a\n\ncause of action for race discrimination” in violation of Title\n\nVII,3       the    district    court     dismissed    the   claim       because   it   was\n\nasserted against Ríos’s three supervisors, instead of against the\n\nPolice Department, his employer.\n\n        Given       that    the   complaint        named    as    defendants       Ríos’s\n\nsupervisors (including the Department’s Superintendent) in their\n\nofficial capacities, the failure to name the Police Department\n\nitself did not justify dismissal of the Title VII claim.                          We have\n\nruled that a Title VII claim brought against a supervisory employee\n\nin his official capacity as an agent of the employer operates as a\n\n\n        3\n      On appeal, defendants have not challenged the district\ncourt’s   conclusion  that   the   complaint plausibly alleges\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII.\n\n                                           - 6 -\n\fclaim against the employer.          See Vera v. McHugh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"176714\"><a href=\"/opinion/176714/vera-v-mchugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25\n\nn.8 (1st Cir. 2010) (noting that, in a Title VII suit brought by an\n\nemployee of the Puerto Rico Army solely against the Secretary of\n\nthe Army, “[t]he Secretary was sued in his capacity as [the\n\nplaintiff’s] employer”); see also Sauers v.

Equal Protection\n\n      The district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety\n\nwithout addressing whether it plausibly alleged a violation of the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.           We agree with Ríos that the complaint\n\nasserted a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, which should\n\nnot   have   been   dismissed.       To     prevail    on    a    claim   of   racial\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, a\n\nplaintiff must establish (1) that he was selected for adverse\n\ntreatment compared with others similarly situated, and (2) that the\n\nselection for adverse treatment was based on his race.                            See\n\nRubinovitz     v.   Rogato,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196213\"><a href=\"/opinion/196213/rubinovitz-v-rogato/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    909-10       (1st   Cir.   1995);\n\nYerardi’s Moody St. Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. Bd. of Selectmen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525274\"><a href=\"/opinion/525274/yerardis-moody-street-restaurant-lounge-inc-v-board-of-selectmen-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n      The    complaint   alleges     that    Ríos     was   transferred        from   a\n\n\n                                      - 7 -\n\fposition with the Drug Prevention Division to a less desirable\n\nposition with the Bureau of Illegal Arms.               The position to which he\n\nwas   transferred       allegedly       offered   materially   less     attractive\n\nworking conditions and fewer opportunities to earn overtime pay.\n\nThe    complaint        furthermore         plausibly      alleges     that        the\n\ndisadvantageous transfer was based on racial discrimination. It\n\nalleges   that    Cordero,    the       supervisor   who    caused    Ríos    to    be\n\ntransferred and who recommended a less qualified white candidate in\n\npreference to Ríos when a position in the Drug Prevention Division\n\nlater became available, had used abusive and derogatory slurs\n\nexpressing explicit anti-black racial bias. These allegations were\n\nsufficient to plead a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection\n\nClause,   as     they    convey     a    plausible   inference       that    Cordero\n\ndiscriminated against Ríos in official acts, depriving him of\n\nsignificant advantages because of his race.                See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1949 (a claim survives a motion to dismiss if the factual\n\nallegations permit “the reasonable inference that the defendant is\n\nliable for the misconduct alleged”); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\n\nPena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229–30 (1995) (“[W]henever the government\n\ntreats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person\n\nhas suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and\n\nspirit of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.”).\n\n      We conclude that the complaint pleaded a claim under section\n\n1983 of racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\n\n\n                                         - 8 -\n\fClause, which claim should not have been dismissed.4\n\nIII. Supplemental Jurisdiction\n\n     Defendants argue that Ríos should be precluded from advancing\n\nhis local law claims upon remand because in this appeal he did not\n\nseparately challenge the district court’s decision to decline\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over those claims.          We disagree.   The\n\ndistrict court’s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction was\n\nbased on its conclusion that the complaint failed to state any\n\nviable federal claims. Our decision to vacate the dismissal of the\n\nfederal claims eliminates the basis of that decision.         We find no\n\nwaiver. We accordingly vacate the district court’s order declining\n\nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the local law claims.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n     The district court’s dismissal of Ríos’s claims of racial\n\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII and the Equal Protection\n\nClause,     and   its   order   declining    to   exercise   supplemental\n\njurisdiction over his local law claims, are hereby vacated, and the\n\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion. Costs of the appeal to abide the ultimate resolution of\n\nthe case.\n\n\n     4\n      The district court perhaps believed that the plaintiff’s\nclaim of racial discrimination was asserted only under Title VII\nand not as a constitutional matter.       We acknowledge that the\ncomplaint could have been clearer in this regard. Nonetheless, the\nbriefs for both the defendants and the plaintiff, submitted in\nrelation to the defendants’ motion to dismiss, expressly recognized\nthat the complaint included an equal protection claim.\n\n                                  - 9 -\n\f</pre>",
