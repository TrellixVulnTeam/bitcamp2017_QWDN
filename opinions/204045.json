The Rhode Island Coastal Resources\n\nManagement Council (\"CRMC\") challenges a decision by the federal\n\ndistrict court, which has rejected two regulatory barriers CRMC\n\nimposed to plans to build a Liquified Natural Gas (\"LNG\") terminal\n\nin the City of Fall River with a berth in Massachusetts coastal\n\nwaters of Mount Hope Bay.       Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC (\"Weaver's\n\nCove\") is the sponsor of the LNG terminal.          Weaver's Cove Energy,\n\nLLC v. R.I. Coastal Res. Mgmt. Council, 583 F. Supp. 2d 259 (D.R.I.\n\n2008).    The barriers, which CRMC has attempted to impose, are to\n\nnecessary dredging by Weaver's Cove in Rhode Island navigable\n\nwaters, in a federal navigation channel.              The Federal Energy\n\nRegulatory Commission (\"FERC\") generally approved the project in\n\n2005, subject to certain conditions.         Until those conditions are\n\nmet, Weaver's Cove cannot start construction.         The Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts, joined by the City of Fall River, has filed a brief\n\nas amicus curiae in support of CRMC.\n\n           We address three main issues.          The first is whether we\n\nhave Article III jurisdiction to decide these matters.         The second\n\nis whether the district court erred in holding that CRMC's failure\n\nto respond within six months to Weaver's Cove's application for\n\nfederal consistency review requires there be a presumption of\n\nconcurrence in the project, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A)\n\nof the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (\"CZMA\").          The third is\n\nwhether   CRMC's   use   of   its   state   law   licensing   program   for\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\falterations to the coast, 04-000-010 R.I. Code R. §§ 100.1, 300.1,\n\nto block the project is preempted by the Natural Gas Act (\"NGA\").\n\n             For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's decision.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             We first briefly explain the regulatory framework that\n\ngoverns this case.\n\n             Central to this dispute are two federal statutes, the\n\nNGA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 717-717z, and the CZMA, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451-66.\n\nThe NGA was originally passed in the 1930s to facilitate the growth\n\nof    the    energy-transportation        industry     and   requires     FERC\n\nauthorization for the importing of natural gas.                15 U.S.C. §\n\n717b(a).     FERC's authority under the to NGA to regulate facilities\n\nengaged in the import of natural gas has long been interpreted as\n\n\"plenary and elastic,\" Distrigas Corp. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 495\n\nF.2d 1057, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1974), and courts have interpreted the\n\nNGA to preempt state regulatory authority within the scope of\n\nFERC's jurisdiction, see, e.g., Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co.,\n\n485   U.S.   293   (1988).   Following      a   2005   amendment,   the   NGA\n\nexplicitly grants FERC \"exclusive authority to approve or deny an\n\napplication for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation\n\nof an LNG terminal.\"     Id. § 717b(e)(1).       Parties wishing to build\n\nan LNG terminal must file an extensive application with FERC, 18\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fC.F.R. § 157.6, which must then consult with states regarding\n\nsafety and environmental questions, 15 U.S.C. § 717b-1(b).\n\n            The NGA creates a consolidated regulatory process for\n\napproving    LNG   facilities     that    maintains     the   role     of    federal\n\nagencies and, in circumscribed areas, state agencies.                  It does so\n\nby limiting FERC's exclusive authority in two ways relevant to this\n\ncase.    First, the NGA, except where expressly provided, does not\n\naffect   \"any     Federal    agency's     authorities    or   responsibilities\n\nrelated to LNG terminals.\"        Id. § 717b(e)(1) (emphasis added).              In\n\naddition,    the    NGA     explicitly    states   that,      unless       otherwise\n\nprovided, it does not affect the rights of states under three\n\nfederal regulatory statutes, of which only the CZMA is pertinent to\n\nthis case.      Id. § 717b(d)(1).\n\n            The    CZMA   establishes     the   relationship     between      state\n\nbodies, like the Rhode Island CRMC, and federal agencies during the\n\npermitting process for LNG terminal construction projects that\n\nimpact   coastal     zones.      It     provides   states     with     a    limited\n\nopportunity to review applications to ensure they are consistent\n\nwith state regulations, 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A), and, in doing\n\nso, grants states \"a conditional veto over federally licensed or\n\npermitted projects,\" Weaver's Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 267.                    That\n\nconditional veto, however, is itself subject to review.\n\n            In order to conduct a consistency review, state agencies\n\nmust first have obtained approval from the federal National Oceanic\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fAtmospheric      Administration         (\"NOAA\"),   a   Department     of    Commerce\n\nagency, for the state agency's own coastal management plan. 16\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1454, 1455(d)-(e), 1456(c)(3)(A).                    Coastal management\n\nplans    set     forth    general   state       policies   for     developing    and\n\nmaintaining coastal areas and, as is the case in Rhode Island, may\n\ninclude not only the conditions for federal consistency review but\n\nalso for state licensing programs.\n\n               Once a state coastal management plan has been approved,\n\nan applicant for a federal permit wishing to undertake any activity\n\nthe state plan regulates must certify with the local agency that\n\nthe proposed activity is consistent with the coastal management\n\nplan.1   Id. § 1456(c)(3)(A).            In support of the application, the\n\napplicant       must     submit   all    \"necessary     data     and   information\"\n\nidentified       in      the   coastal     management      plan.        15     C.F.R.\n\n§ 930.58(a)(2).          Under federal law, the state agency has thirty\n\ndays from the time the application was submitted to notify the\n\napplicant and the federal agency if it takes the position that the\n\napplicant has failed to submit all of the required information.\n\nId. § 930.60(a)(2).\n\n               Importantly, the CZMA limits the time a state may conduct\n\nsuch a review, in order to prevent frustration of federal purposes.\n\n\n\n     1\n          A state is prohibited from undertaking interstate\nconsistency review of activities occurring in a different state\nunless the state requests and obtains interstate review authority\nfrom NOAA. 15 C.F.R. § 930.154(e).\n\n                                          -6-\n\fWhether CRMC failed to act within this limit is a key issue in this\n\ncase. Once an applicant submits its consistency certification, the\n\nstate agency has six months either to concur with the certification\n\nor    to   object    if    it   concludes    that   the   proposed   activity    is\n\ninconsistent        with    the    coastal   management     plan.      16   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1456(c)(3)(A).          If the state agency fails to respond within six\n\nmonths, the state's concurrence will be \"conclusively presumed.\"\n\nId.     If the application is incomplete and the state agency so\n\ninforms the applicant within the required thirty-day time period,\n\n\"the State agency's six-month review period will commence on the\n\ndate of receipt of the missing necessary data and information.\" 15\n\nC.F.R. § 930.60(a)(2).              However, the state agency's review of\n\nwhether the application is complete \"is not a substantive review of\n\nthe adequacy of the information received,\" and the agency's request\n\nfor clarification of the information provided or its assertion that\n\nthe information is \"substantively deficient\" does not toll the six-\n\nmonth review period.              Id. § 930.60(c).        These rules encourage\n\nstates to act quickly when reviewing applications so that no one\n\nstate      can   delay    the   federal   approval    process.       Congress   was\n\nsufficiently concerned about the ability of local state agencies to\n\ndelay projects that it did not use a generalized standard, such as\n\n\"a reasonable period of time\" as it did, for instance, in the\n\nTelecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(3)(B), but\n\ncapped the time at six months.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            The CZMA also limits state authority to delay or prohibit\n\nprojects subject to consistency review, by providing for federal\n\nreview of state agency determinations. If the state agency objects\n\nto consistency certification, the applicant may appeal the decision\n\nto the Secretary of Commerce, who can override the objection on a\n\nfinding \"that the activity is consistent with the objectives of\n\nthis chapter or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national\n\nsecurity.\"    16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(A).      The Secretary's decision, in\n\nturn, may be reviewed in federal district court.2 See, e.g.,\n\nMillennium Pipeline Co., L.P. v. Gutierrez, 424 F. Supp. 2d 168,\n\n173-74 (D.D.C. 2006).\n\n            One other federal statute relevant to this case is the\n\nRivers and Harbors Act, at section 10.             33 U.S.C. § 403.         It\n\nprohibits    construction    or   other    work,   such   as    dredging,   in\n\nnavigable U.S. waters without congressional authorization or a\n\nrecommendation by the Army Corps Chief of Engineers as well as the\n\nSecretary    of   the   Army's   authorization.     Id.        Because   FERC's\n\nexclusive authority under the NGA does not disturb the Army Corps's\n\nauthority under the Rivers and Harbors Act, 15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1),\n\nparties seeking FERC approval for LNG terminal proposals that\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          A state may reopen review of a certification if the\napplicant makes a \"major amendment\" to the project.    15 C.F.R.\n§§ 930.51(b)-(c), (e), 930.66(b). That provision is inapplicable\nhere.\n\n                                     -8-\n\finclude dredging in navigable waterways, like Weaver's Cove, must\n\nalso apply for approval from the Army Corps.\n\n               In Rhode Island, the federally designated agency under\n\nthe    CZMA    is    the     appellant,    CRMC.        CRMC    is   responsible     for\n\nadministering Rhode Island's coastal management plan, the Rhode\n\nIsland Coastal Resources Management Program (\"CRMP\"). When a party\n\nwishes to conduct an activity listed in the CRMP, such as dredging\n\nin Rhode Island, under state law, that party should obtain from the\n\nCRMC a state law license called an \"Assent.\"                    04-000-010 R.I. Code\n\nR. § 100.1.         The more extensive \"Category B Assent\" process under\n\nstate law is required for approval of all projects that involve\n\nmajor alterations proposed for Rhode Island tidal waters, shoreline\n\nfeatures,      or    areas     contiguous      with   shoreline       features.      Id.\n\n§§ 100.1(A), (D), 300.1.              If the party's proposed listed activity\n\nis also part of a project that is subject to federal licensing,\n\nCRMC   is     the    body    tasked    with    providing       the   required    federal\n\nconsistency review.\n\n               CRMC's document, labeled the Federal Consistency Manual,\n\nemphasizes       that       although    the    Assent    and     consistency      review\n\nprocesses may overlap, they are distinct approvals.                      R.I. Coastal\n\nRes. Mgmt. Council, Federal Consistency Manual 7, available at\n\nhttp://www.crmc.ri.gov/regulations/Fed_Consistency.pdf.                         The same\n\nlist of activities that require Assents also require consistency\n\nreview.       Id. at 12.      Major alterations to the Rhode Island coastal\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\farea that trigger the more extensive Category B Assent process\n\ntrigger the same level of review for consistency certifications.\n\nId. at 8.\n\n            Finally, the manual states that a grant or denial of an\n\nAssent in an application when a consistency review is ongoing\n\nconstitutes a concurrence or an objection for the purposes of the\n\nreview.     Id. at 13.     A key difference between the two forms of\n\nreview is that whereas the CZMA limits consistency review through\n\nthe six-month time limit, administrative review by the Secretary of\n\nCommerce, and federal judicial review, no federal statute limits\n\nhow long state decisions regarding Category B Assent may take or\n\nprovides for federal review.\n\n            The   substantive       provision   of    the   state    CRMP   most\n\npertinent to this case is section 300.9(C), which requires approval\n\nby the CRMC for all dredging activities.             Particularly in dispute\n\nin this case is the meaning of section 300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP,\n\nwhich requires that \"[w]hen disposal is proposed for approved\n\nupland    facilities,     the    applicant   shall    provide    a   letter   of\n\nacceptance from that facility, unless the disposal is approved for\n\nthe central landfill.\"          04-000-010 R.I. Code R. § 300.9(C)(7).\n\n            The CRMC also coordinates some of its responsibilities\n\nwith   another    state    agency,     the   Rhode    Island    Department    of\n\nEnvironmental Management (\"RIDEM\").          Particularly relevant to this\n\ncase is RIDEM's role in identifying a list of approved upland sites\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\ffor disposal of dredged material, which CRMC is responsible for\n\nincorporating      into       a    comprehensive        plan   for    dredged      material\n\nmanagement.      R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-6.1-5.\n\n                                            II.\n\n            Weaver's      Cove       proposes      to    build    and    operate     a    LNG\n\nterminal    in    Fall    River.        The   proposed         project   received        FERC\n\napproval in 2005, subject to certain conditions.3                           Weaver's Cove\n\nEnergy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,070, at 61,528 (2005).                          FERC found\n\nthat the proposal \"will promote the public interest by increasing\n\nthe   availability       of       natural   gas    supplies      in   the    New    England\n\nmarket.\"    Id.\n\n            Under the original LNG proposal, submitted in 2003, ships\n\ncarrying LNG would pass through waters in both Rhode Island and\n\nMassachusetts, traveling up the Taunton River to the terminal\n\nlocation.     This has changed.             According to Weaver's Cove's 2009\n\n\"Offshore Berth Amendment,\" the proposal now calls for ships to\n\ndeliver their cargo to an offshore berth in Mount Hope Bay, from\n\nwhich the LNG would be transported via a submerged pipeline to the\n\nonshore terminal.             The offshore berth, the pipeline, and the\n\nterminal would all be located in Massachusetts.                              In both the\n\n\n      3\n          LNG, produced by cooling natural gas to a liquid state,\nhas less volume and so can be more economically transported. The\nterminal proposed by Weaver's Cove would receive imported LNG from\ntanker ships, regasify it, and inject it into the U.S. natural gas\ngrid.   According to Weaver's Cove, the proposed terminal would\nsupply fifteen percent of New England's \"peak day\" natural gas\ndemand in 2010. Weaver's Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 262-63, 262 n.2.\n\n                                            -11-\n\foriginal      proposal    and    the    amended   version,       the    only    planned\n\nactivity in Rhode Island waters is dredging in a federal navigation\n\nchannel to ensure the safe passage of the LNG tankers.                                That\n\ndredging is the subject of this litigation.\n\n              On December 19, 2003, Weaver's Cove filed an application,\n\npursuant      to   the   NGA,    for    FERC   approval   of     the    proposed      LNG\n\nfacility.      FERC, as said, approved the application in 2005 subject\n\nto a number of conditions, one of which was that Weaver's Cove was\n\nto \"file . . . prior to construction documentation of concurrence\n\nfrom the [CRMC] that the project is consistent with the Rhode\n\nIsland   [CRMP].\"        Weaver's       Cove   Energy,    LLC,    112    F.E.R.C.      at\n\n¶¶ 61,550-51 (emphasis in original).\n\n              Turning    to     state    regulatory      requirements,         such    as\n\nCategory B Assent, FERC added that \"state or local permits issued\n\nwith respect to the jurisdictional facilities authorized herein\n\nmust be consistent with the conditions in this order.\" Id. at\n\n¶   61,546.        Although     FERC    encouraged    Weaver's     Cove    and    local\n\nauthorities to cooperate during local review of Weaver's Cove's\n\nproposal, it made clear that \"this does not mean that state and\n\nlocal agencies, through application of state or local laws, may\n\nprohibit or unreasonably delay the construction or operation of\n\nfacilities approved by this Commission.\"                 Id.\n\n              Following cross-motions for rehearing, FERC reaffirmed\n\nthis order in 2006 in all respects relevant to this case.

Energy Regulatory Comm'n, 507\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           Because the proposed dredging activities also required\n\napproval from the Army Corps under the Rivers and Harbors Act,\n\nWeaver's Cove filed an application to the Army Corps on March 18,\n\n2004.   Dredging is a listed activity in Rhode Island's federally\n\napproved CRMP. 04-000-010 R.I. Code R. § 300.9.      On filing its\n\napplication to the Army Corps, Weaver's Cove was therefore also\n\nrequired by the CZMA to file a consistency certification with CRMC,\n\nwhich it did in July 2004.    With this application, Weaver's Cove\n\nalso applied for Rhode Island's state law license for dredging,\n\nCategory B Assent.   However, Weaver's Cove informed CRMC that it\n\nbelieved the Assent unnecessary.\n\n           Within the thirty-day window to inform applicants for\n\nconcurrence that their applications are incomplete required by the\n\nCZMA, CRMC informed Weaver's Cove by phone that its consistency\n\ncertification and Category B Assent application were, in CRMC's\n\nview, incomplete on two grounds.   The validity of those grounds is\n\nat issue in this case.    The first, quickly remedied by Weaver's\n\nCove, was that it had failed to submit the engineering plans with\n\nthe stamp of a Rhode Island engineer.   The second ground, at issue\n\nin this case, was that Weaver's Cove's application was incomplete,\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fand so the six-month clock was not ticking, because Weaver's Cove\n\nhad     failed    to   provide    documentation,           pursuant     to     section\n\n300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP, that dredged materials would be accepted\n\nby \"an approved upland facilit[y].\"                In a letter dated August 2,\n\n2004, Weaver's Cove replied that because the dredged materials were\n\nto be disposed of in Massachusetts, and not in Rhode Island,\n\nsection 300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP did not apply.                On August 26, 2004,\n\nCRMC responded, informing Weaver's Cove that its application was\n\nstill    incomplete    because    it   failed       to    file   a   Water     Quality\n\nCertificate but making no mention of the upland disposal issue.\n\nAfter additional communications, the parties failed to resolve the\n\ndispute.         Because   it    claimed      to    lack    necessary        data   and\n\ninformation, CRMC did not commence review of Weaver's Cove's\n\nconsistency certification or its Category B assent.                    It still has\n\nnot done so.      In short, as of this date, the appellant state agency\n\nhas not acted on the merits of an application which has been\n\npending before it since July 2004.\n\n            Over a year after its original application to CRMC,\n\nWeaver's    Cove    made   separate    filings       to    NOAA,     FERC,    and   the\n\nSecretary of Commerce, requesting a determination that CRMC's\n\nconcurrence be \"conclusively presumed\" because CRMC had failed to\n\nact on Weaver's Cove's application within the statutorily required\n\nsix-month deadline.        16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A).                 NOAA took no\n\naction, FERC concluded it did not have authority to address the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fissue, and the Secretary of Commerce determined that he could not\n\nreview the matter without an actual objection from CRMC. This left\n\nthe matter of whether CRMC's concurrence should be conclusively\n\npresumed to the courts for resolution.\n\n             Weaver's Cove filed suit in the U.S. District Court for\n\nthe   District     of    Rhode      Island    on    June     29,   2007.          It    sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the disposal\n\ninformation       and    the       water    quality    certification,           which     the\n\nappellant    CRMC       had    requested,      were    not      \"necessary        data     and\n\ninformation,\" as required by the CZMA.                 Weaver's Cove asserted the\n\nCZMA's     six-month         deadline      should   not    be      tolled      and     CRMC's\n\nconcurrence      should       be    conclusively      presumed.           In   an      amended\n\ncomplaint, Weaver's Cove also argued that Category B Assent was\n\npreempted by provisions of the NGA that grant FERC \"exclusive\n\nauthority\" in approving LNG facilities, 15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1), and\n\nunlawful under the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\n             The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nWeaver's Cove, on both the CZMA and the NGA claims.                       Weaver's Cove,\n\n583 F. Supp. 2d at 262.             The court found that neither the disposal\n\ninformation, nor the water quality certificate were necessary data\n\nand   information,           and   so   Weaver's      Cove    application           was   not\n\nincomplete.       Id. at 272-73.            Thus, CRMC had failed to meet the\n\nstatutory deadline and its concurrence was conclusively presumed.\n\nId.   at   275.         In    particular,      with    respect       to     the      disposal\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\finformation, the court found, based on statutory interpretation and\n\nthe interpretation which the other state agency of Rhode Island,\n\nRIDEM, had adopted, that the term \"approved upland facilities\" in\n\nsection   300.9(C)(7)     of    the   CRMP   referred    only   to   disposal\n\nfacilities in Rhode Island.           Weaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n270-75.     Since Weaver's Cove intended to dispose of the dredged\n\nmaterial out of state (in Massachusetts) at that time,4 the court\n\nconcluded that CRMC could not require proof that the material would\n\nbe accepted.     Id.   The district court, acting under the NGA, also\n\nheld the Category B Assent process utilized by CRMC was preempted\n\non three grounds.      First, it found the process expressly preempted\n\nby the language of 15 U.S.C. § 717b(3)(1), granting FERC \"exclusive\n\nauthority to approve or deny an application\" to build an LNG\n\nterminal.    Weaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 280-83.          Second, the\n\ncourt found the assent process implicitly field preempted because\n\n\"Congress clearly intended that the NGA occupy the entire field of\n\nLNG regulation.\" Id. at 283-84. Finally, the district court found\n\nthe   Category    B    Assent    process     preempted   here   because   it\n\nspecifically conflicted with FERC's jurisdiction to regulate LNG\n\nfacilities.    Id. at 284-85.     The court also held that the case was\n\nnot rendered moot by the changes in the project that occurred after\n\n\n\n      4\n          The original proposal to the Army Corps set forth a\nMassachusetts disposal site but also considered offshore disposal\nat a federal ocean disposal site approved by the Environmental\nProtection Agency and the Army Corps.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fthe date Weaver's Cove submitted its consistency certification.\n\nId. at 275-76.         It did not reach the dormant Commerce Clause\n\nquestion.\n\n                                    III.\n\nA.             Jurisdiction\n\n               We first hold that we have jurisdiction to hear this\n\ncase.       CRMC does not raise any challenge to standing, mootness, or\n\nripeness.5      Massachusetts, in its brief amicus curiae to this court\n\n(but not to the district court), argues broadly that there is no\n\ncase or controversy here, based on standing, mootness, and lack of\n\nripeness.       Amici cannot insert new arguments, not made by a party,\n\ninto a case.      Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d\n\n66, 74 n.5 (1st Cir. 2001).          Nonetheless, we review standing,\n\nmootness, and ripeness in the constitutional sense to see whether\n\nwe have Article III jurisdiction because we are independently\n\nobligated to do so, regardless of whether the parties raise the\n\nissue.       Pagan v. Calderon, 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2006).   For\n\nthe reasons discussed below, we are satisfied we have jurisdiction.\n\n               We first address standing.   Massachusetts asserts that\n\nbecause Weaver's Cove has not shown that a decision in their favor\n\n\n        5\n          Because CRMC has not itself challenged the district\ncourt's finding with respect to mootness, we do not address CRMC's\nchallenge to the jurisdictional questions raised in footnote 18 of\nthe district court's opinion. In re Williams, 156 F.3d 86, 90 (1st\nCir. 1998) (\"[F]ederal appellate courts review decisions,\njudgments, orders, and decrees--not opinions, factual findings,\nreasoning, or explanations.\").\n\n                                    -17-\n\f\"will relieve a discrete injury\" to them, Weaver's Cove lacks\n\nstanding.     Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007) (quoting\n\nLarson   v.    Valente,     456   U.S.     228,    243   n.15     (1982))    (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).             It argues that \"events completely\n\nunrelated     to   CRMC's    regulatory      processes\"      have    prevented     the\n\nproject from proceeding.           Massachusetts is not entirely clear in\n\nexplaining     what   those       events    are,     but    its    brief's    earlier\n\ndescription of the project suggests it is referring to challenges\n\nWeaver's Cove has faced in satisfying other state and federal\n\npermitting requirements. Because CRMC's regulatory requirements do\n\naffect   Weaver's     Cove's      ultimate        ability   to     receive    federal\n\napproval, we conclude that Weaver's Cove has standing.\n\n              A plaintiff wishing to establish standing must show \"a\n\nconcrete and particularized injury in fact, a causal connection\n\nthat permits tracing the claimed injury to the defendant's actions,\n\nand a likelihood that prevailing in the action will afford some\n\nredress for the injury.\"          City of Bangor v. Citizens Commc'ns Co.,\n\n532 F.3d 70, 92 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Me. People's Alliance &\n\nNatural Res. Def. Council v. Mallinckrodt, Inc., 471 F.3d 277, 283\n\n(1st Cir. 2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff\n\nneed not show that \"the defendant's actions are the very last step\n\nin the chain of causation\" for the injury.                  Bennet v. Spear, 520\n\nU.S. 154, 169 (1997).             It suffices if the plaintiff can show\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f\"injury produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the\n\naction of someone else.\"         Id.\n\n            In this case, CRMC's actions have directly affected the\n\nfederal   regulatory       processes     that    determine     whether      the    LNG\n\nterminal project can proceed.            Consistency review is a condition\n\nfor FERC approval, and FERC has stated it has no authority to\n\naddress CRMC's refusal to act.6           While CRMC's inaction may not be\n\nthe exclusive reason federal approval has not been granted, it is\n\nclear    that   failure     to   obtain    concurrence        from   CRMC    has    a\n\n\"determinative       or   coercive     effect\"    on    the   federal    agencies.\n\nBennet, 520 U.S. at 169.         Weaver's Cove therefore has standing to\n\nmake its CZMA-related claims.\n\n            In addition, Weaver's Cove has standing to make its\n\npreemption claims because it suffers a concrete injury from Rhode\n\nIsland subjecting it to a preempted state law.                    Even if CRMC's\n\nconcurrence     in   Weaver's    Cove's    consistency        certification       were\n\npresumed, Category B Assent would still bar LNG construction if we\n\ndid not address it here.               This \"would impose a palpable and\n\nconsiderable hardship\" on its project.                 Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v.\n\nState Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 201-02\n\n(1983).\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          The Army Corps also requires Weaver's Cove to submit\nverification that its application to CRMC is complete before it can\ncomplete its review.\n\n                                        -19-\n\f             This case is not rendered moot by Weaver’s Cove's failure\n\nto achieve complete regulatory approval for its original proposal\n\nor by its submission of the Offshore Berth Amendment.                  “[A] case is\n\nmoot when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties\n\nlack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”                        Powell v.\n\nMcCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969).                We will only find a case moot\n\nif an intervening event “makes it impossible for the court to grant\n\nany effectual relief.”         Gulf of Me. Fisherman’s Alliance v. Daley,\n\n292 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Church of Scientology v.\n\nUnited States, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n             Weaver’s Cove’s efforts to obtain regulatory approval for\n\nthe   LNG   terminal    from    all   of     the    relevant      actors   do    indeed\n\nconstitute a live issue.              These efforts are ongoing and the\n\nOffshore Berth Amendment represents an attempt by Weaver's Cove to\n\naddress     some   of   the   concerns       that    may   have    earlier      delayed\n\napproval.      While    Weaver’s      Cove    still     has   conditions        to   meet\n\nfollowing the amendment, Weaver's Cove did, for example, get\n\napproval from the Coast Guard, which previously had been a hurdle.\n\nSince CRMC's consistency certification remains a requirement of\n\nFERC and of the Army Corps, that question is clearly live.                      This is\n\nespecially so because the Offshore Berth Amendment itself does not\n\nrender moot the dispute here with Rhode Island.                   As the Army Corps\n\nhas itself noted, the planned dredging activities in Rhode Island\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fhave not changed, even under the amendment.7       A decision in favor\n\nof the plaintiff in this case would provide \"effectual relief\"\n\nbecause it would clear a barrier to achieving approval for the\n\nproject.\n\n               This case is also ripe.     Although federal regulatory\n\napproval for the Offshore Berth Amendment is ongoing, our review of\n\nthis case is neither “advisory” nor “irrelevant to the ultimate\n\napprovability of the project.”      Fall River, 507 F.3d at 8.\n\n               Massachusetts cites Fall River in an attempt to argue\n\nthat this case will lack ripeness until the project receives\n\nauthorization from several key federal agencies. But it disregards\n\nimportant differences in the facts and procedural background of\n\nthis case.        In Fall River, we held that a challenge to FERC's\n\nconditional approval of this project was not ripe because the\n\ndecision was not final until the completion of reviews by the\n\nUnited States Coast Guard and the Department of the Interior.        Id.\n\nat 7.       Because FERC's decision was not final we could not be sure\n\nour opinion would not be advisory.        Id. at 7-8.   In contrast, the\n\nplaintiff's requested relief in this case would be final.        CRMC's\n\nconsistency review and Category B Assent requirements would cease\n\n\n        7\n          We affirm the district court's holding that the Offshore\nBerth Amendment does not affect CRMC's consistency review.\nWeaver's Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 275-78. That FERC is reviewing\nthe Offshore Berth Amendment is irrelevant and does not moot this\nappeal regarding findings by a Rhode Island agency. What effect\nthat amendment may have on dredging activities in Massachusetts is\nnot at issue before us.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fto be barriers to ultimate approval of the project.          Another\n\ndifference from Fall River is that FERC and the other relevant\n\nagencies have expressly declined to resolve the issue raised by\n\nthis appeal on the grounds that they have no authority to do so.\n\nIt is true that resolutions of these issues might not secure the\n\nproject's ultimate approval, but it would neither be \"advisory\" nor\n\n\"irrelevant.\"\n\nB.        CZMA Consistency    Review:   \"Conclusive   Presumption   of\n          Concurrence\"\n\n          We hold that CRMC’s concurrence with Weaver’s Cove’s\n\ndredging plans must be conclusively presumed under 16 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1456(c)(3)(A). We affirm the district court. Weaver’s Cove, 583\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 270-75.\n\n          A district court may grant summary judgment on a finding\n\nthat \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"      Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c).   \"An issue is genuine 'if the evidence is such that\n\na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,'\n\nand a fact is material if it has the 'potential to affect the\n\noutcome of the suit.'\"   Velázquez-García v.

Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2000)) (citation\n\nomitted). On appeal, we review a district court's grant of summary\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fjudgment de novo. Torrech-Hernandez v. General Elec. Co., 519 F.3d\n\n41, 46 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                 We review the district court’s holding that, in this\n\ncase, a letter certifying acceptance of dredged material, as listed\n\nin section 300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP, did not constitute necessary\n\ndata and information within the meaning of 15 C.F.R. § 930.58(a)(2)\n\nbecause Weaver’s Cove did not intend to dispose of the waste in\n\nRhode Island.8         Weaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 271-72.          If, as\n\nCRMC       contends,   the   letter   is    necessary    data   and   information\n\nrequired by the CRMP, CRMC is not compelled to commence reviewing\n\nthe consistency certification until Weaver's Cove provides it.                 15\n\nC.F.R.       §   930.60(a)(2).    The      six-month    deadline   for   presumed\n\nconcurrence would be tolled until that time.              Id.   If, on the other\n\nhand, the letter is not necessary data and information, as the\n\ndistrict court found, the six-month period from Weaver's Cove's\n\nsubmission of the consistency certification in July 2004 has\n\nclearly expired, and we are required to find CRMC's concurrence\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          We note that Weaver’s Cove no longer intends to dispose\nof the dredged materials at any “upland facilit[y]” and instead now\nplans to dispose of the waste at an offshore site. As CRMC points\nout in its reply brief, this was not the case at the time of the\noriginal consistency review application.     Weaver’s Cove at that\ntime planned to dispose of the waste at its Fall River Facility.\nWe do not address this change, because it occurred after the time\nconcurrence would have been presumed, and neither party has raised\nit on appeal.\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fpresumed.     16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A).               We affirm the district\n\ncourt's conclusion.\n\n             As the district court noted, the state CRMP does not\n\ndefine \"approved upland facilit[y].\"              Weaver's Cove, 583 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 271.    However, other Rhode Island laws have shed light on the\n\nlanguage's meaning.     Rhode Island's Marine Waterways and Boating\n\nFacilities Act of 2001 (\"Waterways and Boating Act\"), R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws §§ 46-6.1-1 to -10, and associated regulations, set forth a\n\ncomprehensive system regulating dredging activities and disposal of\n\ndredged materials in the state. The district judge relied on these\n\nregulations to conclude that facilities outside of Rhode Island are\n\nnot among the \"approved upland facilities\" from which the CRMP\n\nrequires a letter of acceptance.          Weaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n271-72.\n\n             We agree with the district court that the language of\n\nsection   300.9(C)(7)      of    the   CRMP    can    only   be   read   to    cover\n\nfacilities located in the state of Rhode Island because the state's\n\nregulatory     framework        for    dredging      only    provides    for     the\n\nidentification of \"approved upland facilities\" within the state.\n\n             We begin with the Rhode Island statutes that govern\n\nregulation of dredging in the state.              Rhode Island law makes the\n\nCRMC responsible for \"prepar[ing], adopt[ing] and maintain[ing]\n\n. . . a comprehensive plan for dredged material management for\n\ndredging that takes place in the coastal zone.\"                   R.I. Gen. Laws.\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f§ 46-6.1-5(a).    But the same statute delegates to RIDEM the task of\n\n\"adopt[ing] by rule a list of upland sites and types of areas\n\nsuitable for beneficial use and disposal of dredged materials.\"\n\nId. § 46-6.1-5(b). This list is then \"incorporated in the [CRMC's]\n\ncomprehensive plan for dredged material management.\"                 Id.    The\n\nWaterways and Boating Act does not define \"upland sites,\" but it\n\ndoes define \"[u]pland areas\" as \"areas that are not in the coastal\n\nzone.\"   Id. § 46-6.1-4(16).         Thus, while both agencies may be\n\nresponsible for interpreting whether \"upland disposal facilities\"\n\ncan include out of state disposal facilities, only RIDEM is charged\n\nwith approving upland sites.\n\n          RIDEM    has   in   turn    promulgated       its   own   Rules   and\n\nRegulations for Dredging and the Management of Dredged Material\n\n(\"Dredging Regulations\") pursuant to the Waterways and Boating Act.\n\nR.I. Dept. of Envtl. Mgmt., Rules and Regulations for Dredging and\n\nthe   Management    of   Dredged       Material     §    2,    available     at\n\nhttp://www.dem.ri.gov/pubs/regs/regs/water/dred0203.pdf\n\n[hereinafter \"R.I. Dredging Regulations\"].          These regulations are\n\nalso intended to be consistent with the CZMA, id., and must be\n\nimplemented according to a written protocol jointly adopted by CRMC\n\nand RIDEM, id. § 3.   Among the stated purposes of these regulations\n\nis to \"[i]dentify and list upland sites suitable for beneficial use\n\nand/or disposal of dredged material,\" id. § 1.5, and, as the\n\ndistrict court noted, the Dredging Regulations \"apply to all\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\faspects of dredging proposed in marine waters of the State of Rhode\n\nIsland,\" id. § 3.      The Dredging Regulations do not contain an\n\nexpress definition for \"approved upland facilities,\" but they do\n\ndefine \"Upland Areas\" more narrowly than the corresponding term in\n\nthe Waterways and Boating Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-6.1-4(16), as\n\n\"[a]ll areas of the state that are not in the coastal zone.\"         R.I.\n\nDredging Regulations § 4.20 (emphasis added).\n\n            Since RIDEM is tasked with approving upland disposal\n\nfacilities, R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-6.1-5(b), and it only approves\n\nupland facilities within the state of Rhode Island, R.I. Dredging\n\nRegulations    §   4.20,   it   follows   that   the   \"approved   upland\n\nfacilities\" referred to by section 300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP should\n\nbe read to be facilities within the state of Rhode Island.           \"To\n\nhold otherwise would render the C[R]MP's specific language a\n\nnullity.\"    Weaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 272.\n\n            In any event, appellant has not pointed to any regulatory\n\nprocess for the approval of upland sites outside of Rhode Island,\n\nnor has it produced a list of approved facilities outside of the\n\nstate.    Absent language in Rhode Island law to the contrary, we\n\npresume state laws, like this one, not to have extraterritorial\n\neffect.   Cf. Carnero v. Boston Sci. Corp., 433 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n            CRMC responds that it has an interest in confirming that\n\nmaterial dredged from its coast is properly disposed, regardless of\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fthe ultimate location, and that the district court improperly\n\nrelied on another agency's interpretation of the Waterways and\n\nBoating Act, which it administers.            Citing language from both the\n\nWaterways and Boating Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-6.1-3(1), and the\n\nCRMC's organic statute, id. § 46-23-1(e), that designate CRMC as\n\nthe \"lead agency\" for purposes of regulating dredging activities,\n\nCRMC       argues   that   federal   courts     must    defer   to   its   broader\n\ninterpretation of its own regulations for its own purposes.                     It\n\nexplains that although RIDEM may, in its limited role of approving\n\ndisposal sites, only be concerned with upland facilities within\n\nRhode Island, CRMC is more broadly concerned with ensuring the\n\nproper disposal of dredged material.9\n\n               CRMC cites no authority in support of its view, and in\n\nthis context, the view is untenable.              Since for the purposes of\n\nCZMA       consistency     review,   we   are    only     concerned    with    the\n\nrequirements of the CRMP, CRMC's argument that it is entitled to\n\ndeference in its interpretation of the Waterways and Boating Act is\n\ninapposite.         We are concerned only with its interpretation of\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          Thus, in order to prevent a hypothetical \"trash barge to\nnowhere scenario,\" in which Rhode Island is forced to dispose of\ndredged material that no one else will accept, CRMC is entitled to\ndemand proof that Weaver's Cove's proposed upland disposal facility\nwill accept it.     Of course, this is not a barge to nowhere\nsituation, because Weaver's Cove has identified a disposal site\nsubject to the jurisdiction of other agencies that play a role\nunder the CZMA.\n\n                                      -27-\n\fsection 3009.(C)(7) of the CRMP, and complementary regulatory\n\nschemes to the extent they shed light on its meaning.\n\n               It is true, as CRMC points out, that federal agency\n\ninterpretations       of    their     own    regulations    (when    authorized    by\n\nCongress)       are   \"controlling            unless   'plainly      erroneous     or\n\ninconsistent with the regulation.'\" Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452,\n\n461 (1997) (quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council,\n\n490 U.S. 332, 359 (1989)).                  However, even if we applied that\n\nstandard here, CRMC cannot satisfy it because the plain language of\n\nsection       300.9(C)(7)       of   the    CRMP   calls   for    \"approved     upland\n\nfacilities\" (emphasis added).               Thus, even if upland facilities can\n\nbe interpreted to include facilities outside of Rhode Island, CRMC\n\nhas not pointed to any regulatory scheme that deals with the\n\napproval of out-of-state facilities or even a list of approved out-\n\nof-state facilities.             The only regulatory scheme for approving\n\nupland       facilities    is    that      administered    by    RIDEM,   and   CRMC's\n\ninterpretation of its regulation is therefore clearly erroneous.10\n\n               This construction of state law also permits us to avoid\n\nan issue of whether a different construction would violate federal\n\nlaw.        As noted, see supra note 1, an individual state may not\n\n\n       10\n          We also reject CRMC's argument that it deserves deference\nunder Mountain Rhythm Resources v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm'n,\n302 F.3d 958 (9th Cir. 2009).     That case involved review of a\nfederal agency's decision to adopt a state's interpretation of its\ncoastal management plan under the arbitrary and capricious\nstandard. Id. at 966. Here we are reviewing the state agency's\ninterpretation itself.\n\n                                            -28-\n\fpurport to undertake out of state regulation for consistency review\n\npurposes without getting NOAA's consent.       15 C.F.R. § 930.154(e).\n\nC.         Preemption of State Category B Assent to Dredging by\n           Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act and by FERC's\n           Conditional Approval\n\n           We review the district court's finding that CRMC's state\n\nlaw licensing program for coastal dredging, the Category B Assent\n\nprocess, is preempted by the NGA, at least on the facts here.         At\n\nstake is whether CRMC may still delay the project based on Weaver's\n\nCove's failure to satisfy section 300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP or other\n\nCRMP requirements, despite our conclusion that concurrence in\n\nWeaver's Cove's consistency certification should be presumed.        Our\n\nstandard when reviewing a district court's finding of preemption is\n\nde novo.   Fitzgerald v. Harris, 549 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2008);\n\nSPGGC, LLC v. Ayotte, 488 F.3d 525, 530 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           While the district court found the Category B Assent\n\nprocess preempted on a number of grounds, Weaver’s Cove, 583 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 279-85, we affirm for the narrowest reason, that of\n\nconflict preemption.\n\n           In its order, FERC analyzed Weaver's Cove's proposed\n\ndredging   activities   in   both   Rhode   Island   and   Massachusetts,\n\nassessed the environmental impact the dredging would have and\n\ncompared it with alternatives, and analyzed the effect on the water\n\nand wildlife, land use, recreation, ship traffic, and air quality.\n\nWeaver's Cove Energy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. at ¶ 61,540 (discussing\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fenvironmental issues reviewed and adopting the findings of FERC's\n\nFinal Environmental Impact Statement (\"FEIS\")); Office of Energy\n\nProjects, Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm'n, Docket No. CP04-36-000,\n\nWeaver's Cove LNG Project Final Environmental Impact Statement (May\n\n2005) [hereinafter \"Weaver's Cove FEIS\"].     Further, FERC concluded\n\nthat the dredging was part of the construction and operation of the\n\nterminal project.     Thus, Category B Assent clearly conflicts with\n\nFERC's \"exclusive authority,\" as exercised here, to license the\n\n\"siting, construction, expansion, or operation\" of LNG terminals.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1).11\n\n             To simplify a complex area of law, preemption arguments\n\nare generally divided into three categories.     Fitzgerald, 549 F.3d\n\nat 52.      The first, express preemption, results from language in a\n\nstatute revealing an explicit congressional intent to preempt state\n\nlaw.    Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25,\n\n31 (1996).      The second, field preemption, is that Congress may\n\nimplicitly preempt a state law by creating a pervasive scheme of\n\nregulation.     Fitzgerald, 549 F.3d at 52; N. Natural Gas Co. v. Iowa\n\nUtils. Bd., 377 F.3d 817, 823 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding a state's\n\n\n\n       11\n          This provision of the NGA was not in effect until August\n8, 2005, after FERC issued its order on July 15, 2005. However,\nFERC's interpretation of its own preemptive authority under the NGA\nto regulate construction of LNG facilities was clearly articulated\nbefore this provision came into force. Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC,\n112 F.E.R.C. at ¶ 61,546. Further, FERC reaffirmed its approval of\nWeaver's Cove's application after the provision became effective.\nWeaver's Cove Energy, LLC, 114 F.E.R.C. at ¶ 61,185-86.\n\n                                  -30-\n\fsite-specific environmental review field preempted because FERC has\n\nauthority under the NGA to consider environmental issues).       The\n\nthird category is conflict preemption. In this category, state law\n\nis \"pre-empted to the extent it actually conflicts with federal\n\nlaw, that is, when compliance with both state and federal law is\n\nimpossible, or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the\n\naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of\n\nCongress.\"    Id. at 53 (quoting Good v. Altria Group, Inc., 501 F.3d\n\n29, 47 (1st Cir. 2007)).\n\n          Weaver's Cove asks us to find preemption under the first\n\ntwo grounds.    It also stresses the district court's application of\n\na field preemption test set forth in a NGA preemption case.\n\nWeaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (citing Schneidewind, 485\n\nU.S. at 301).\n\n          We prefer to decide on the narrowest grounds: conflict\n\npreemption.     In this case, FERC has interpreted the dredging\n\nactivities in the Weaver's Cove's project, including those in Rhode\n\nIsland, to be within its preemptive jurisdiction.    See Fitzgerald,\n\n549 F.3d at 55 (\"The proposition that federal agency action, taken\n\npursuant to its interpretation of a statute, may itself preempt is\n\nquite correct.\").    CRMC does not argue that the proposed dredging\n\nis not a part of the LNG terminal's \"siting, construction, . . . or\n\noperation\" under 15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1), although Massachusetts, as\n\n\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\famicus, does.12   In its original order, FERC extensively reviewed\n\nthe dredging as part of the overall terminal construction and\n\noperational plan.    Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. at\n\n¶ 61,535-36, 61,545, 61,550.    Here, FERC carefully reviewed the\n\nvery dredging Rhode Island seeks to further regulate and, after\n\nconsidering environmental impacts, authorized the project.    Id. at\n\n61,546.   The FEIS, adopted by reference in the FERC order, id. at\n\n61,540, found that the dredging was necessary \"to accommodate the\n\npassage of LNG ships\" to the facility, Weaver's Cove FEIS, at 2-25\n\n(May 2005), and that it would be impossible to \"reduce the volume\n\nor extent of dredging and still satisfy the objectives of the\n\nproject at the proposed site,\" id. at 3-70.     Thus, FERC concluded\n\nthat the dredging was part of the construction and the operation of\n\nthe terminal facility. That ruling is final and binding because no\n\nobjections were made to FERC's findings on these points in the\n\nparties' request for rehearing.13     Further, the dredging is in an\n\napproved federal navigation channel.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n          Rather CRMC argues that Section 10 of the River and\nHarbors Act saves Category B Assent from preemption by the NGA, a\ncontention we consider below.\n     13\n          The parties never raised objections to these findings in\ntheir request for rehearing to FERC and thus courts have no\njurisdiction to review this determination by FERC.      15 U.S.C.\n§ 717r(a) (\"No proceeding to review any order of the Commission\nshall be brought by any person unless such person shall have made\napplication to the Commission for a rehearing thereon.\").\n\n                               -32-\n\f          By finding the dredging activities were part of the\n\nconstruction and operation of the terminal facility, FERC has\n\ninterpreted the Rhode Island dredging at issue in this case to be\n\nwithin its jurisdiction.      Thus, the Category B Assent process\n\nutilized by Rhode Island clearly collides with FERC's delegated\n\nauthority and is preempted.     FERC made this clear in its order\n\nregarding Weaver's Cove's application, which stated that state\n\nagencies could not use state law to \"prohibit or unreasonably delay\n\nthe construction or operation of facilities approved by this\n\nCommission.\"   Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. at ¶ 61,546.\n\nFERC affirmed this point on rehearing, in response to the City of\n\nFall River's challenge. Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC, 114 F.E.R.C. at\n\n¶ 61,185-86.\n\n          CRMC's handling of the Category B Assent process both\n\nconflicts with and is an obstacle to the authority FERC has\n\nasserted in this case.     Unlike CZMA consistency review, which\n\nallows the CRMC to review the dredging proposals, limited by a six-\n\nmonth deadline and administrative and federal judicial review, the\n\nCategory B Assent process contains no such limitations, and to this\n\ndate the appellant has not processed this application or reached\n\nany decision on the merits.    CRMC has taken the position that it\n\nmust carry out the Category B Assent process concurrently with the\n\nconsistency review, and because the consistency review has not\n\ncommenced, it cannot address the application for Category B Assent.\n\n\n                                -33-\n\fThus, even if concurrence were presumed, CRMC's position is that\n\nthe Category B Assent process would itself independently block full\n\nlicensing of the facility. This is clearly an application of state\n\nlaw that delays or has the potential to prohibit the ultimate\n\nlicensing and construction of the LNG terminal.      Weaver's Cove\n\nEnergy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. at ¶ 61,546.   Further, CRMC's two bites\n\nat the apple approach necessarily conflicts with the federal\n\nprocess for and interest in defining what is necessary data.\n\nBecause CRMC's actions here conflict with FERC's jurisdiction and\n\nthe limits for consistency review, it is preempted.14\n\n\n     14\n          CRMC and Massachusetts also incorrectly argue that the\ndistrict court based its Category B Assent preemption on the\ndoctrine of federal navigational servitude and that a finding of\npreemption under the servitude was improper because Congress failed\nto invoke it expressly within the NGA. The argument misreads the\ndistrict court's holding and is irrelevant. Congress's power to\npreempt state regulation here emanates not only from its power to\nregulate navigation but also from its power to regulate commerce\nitself. U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3; 43 U.S.C. § 1314(a) (\"The\nUnited States retains all its navigational servitude and rights in\nand powers of regulation and control of said lands and navigable\nwaters for the constitutional purposes of commerce, [and]\nnavigation . . . .\"); see also First Iowa Hydro-Elec. Coop. v.\nFederal Power Com., 328 U.S. 152, 182 (1946) (\"The states possess\ncontrol of the waters within their borders, 'subject to the\nacknowledged jurisdiction of the United States under the\nConstitution in regard to commerce and the navigation of the waters\nof rivers.'\" (quoting United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co.,\n311 U.S. 377, 404 (1940)).\n     In its reply brief, CRMC raises a new argument that while\nCongress could preempt commercial regulation under the Commerce\nClause, it could not displace Rhode Island's property rights\nwithout invoking the navigational servitude doctrine.       Because\narguments raised for the first time in reply briefs are\nprocedurally barred, we need not consider this contention. United\nStates v. Hall, 557 F.3d 15, 20 n.3 (1st Cir. 2009). In any event,\nthe argument is wrong.     The Supreme Court has held that state\n\n                               -34-\n\fD.         Rivers and Harbors Act\n\n           Finally, CRMC argues that the federal Rivers and Harbors\n\nAct saves its state Category B Assent process from preemption.\n\nPointing   to   language   in    the    NGA    qualifying   FERC's   exclusive\n\nauthority to the extent that it affects law \"related to\" the\n\nauthority of other federal agencies, 15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1), CRMC\n\nargues that the NGA preserves not only the Army Corps's role in\n\napproving dredging activities but also the entire body of law\n\n\"related to\" that role.         Since the Army Corps's approval process\n\nunder the Rivers and Harbors Act does not preempt state licensing\n\nschemes, CRMC argues that the savings clause in the NGA must\n\ntherefore protect Category B Assent.\n\n           These arguments, assuming arguendo they were preserved in\n\nthe district court, are meritless.            The language of § 717(b)(e)(1)\n\nis plainly aimed at preserving the authority of federal agencies\n\nand not that of state agencies like CRMC.           CRMC's argument that its\n\nstate licensing program is \"related to\" the authority of FERC is\n\nalso untenable.    As CRMC points out in other parts of its brief,\n\nCRMC's authority to require Category B Assent derives from Rhode\n\nIsland's status as a sovereign, whereas the Army Corps's authority\n\nderives from the federal government.            The fact that the Rivers and\n\n\n\nproperty interests in land may not preempt federal statutes enacted\npursuant to the Commerce Clause. Douglas v. Seacoast Prods., Inc.,\n431 U.S. 265, 283-84 (1977).\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\fHarbors Act does not itself preempt Category B Assent is therefore\n\nirrelevant to the NGA's preemptive effect.\n\n          Under   its   exclusive   authority,   FERC   considers   the\n\ndredging in Rhode Island to be a part of the LNG construction.\n\nFERC, as required by the NGA, has provided CRMC an opportunity to\n\nreview the project through CZMA consistency review.       CRMC cannot\n\nnow avoid presumed concurrence by relying on a nearly identical\n\nstate law licensing procedure.\n\n          The district court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\f",

The Rhode Island Coastal Resources\n\nManagement Council (\"CRMC\") challenges a decision by the federal\n\ndistrict court, which has rejected two regulatory barriers CRMC\n\nimposed to plans to build a Liquified Natural Gas (\"LNG\") terminal\n\nin the City of Fall River with a berth in Massachusetts coastal\n\nwaters of Mount Hope Bay.       Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC (\"Weaver's\n\nCove\") is the sponsor of the LNG terminal.          Weaver's Cove Energy,\n\nLLC v. R.I. Coastal Res. Mgmt.

The barriers, which CRMC has attempted to impose, are to\n\nnecessary dredging by Weaver's Cove in Rhode Island navigable\n\nwaters, in a federal navigation channel.              The Federal Energy\n\nRegulatory Commission (\"FERC\") generally approved the project in\n\n2005, subject to certain conditions.         Until those conditions are\n\nmet, Weaver's Cove cannot start construction.         The Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts, joined by the City of Fall River, has filed a brief\n\nas amicus curiae in support of CRMC.\n\n           We address three main issues.          The first is whether we\n\nhave Article III jurisdiction to decide these matters.         The second\n\nis whether the district court erred in holding that CRMC's failure\n\nto respond within six months to Weaver's Cove's application for\n\nfederal consistency review requires there be a presumption of\n\nconcurrence in the project, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A)\n\nof the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (\"CZMA\").          The third is\n\nwhether   CRMC's   use   of   its   state   law   licensing   program   for\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\falterations to the coast, 04-000-010 R.I. Code R. §§ 100.1, 300.1,\n\nto block the project is preempted by the Natural Gas Act (\"NGA\").\n\n             For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's decision.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             We first briefly explain the regulatory framework that\n\ngoverns this case.\n\n             Central to this dispute are two federal statutes, the\n\nNGA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 717-717z, and the CZMA, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451-66.\n\nThe NGA was originally passed in the 1930s to facilitate the growth\n\nof    the    energy-transportation        industry     and   requires     FERC\n\nauthorization for the importing of natural gas.                15 U.S.C. §\n\n717b(a).     FERC's authority under the to NGA to regulate facilities\n\nengaged in the import of natural gas has long been interpreted as\n\n\"plenary and elastic,\" Distrigas Corp. v.

Following      a   2005   amendment,   the   NGA\n\nexplicitly grants FERC \"exclusive authority to approve or deny an\n\napplication for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation\n\nof an LNG terminal.\"     Id. § 717b(e)(1).       Parties wishing to build\n\nan LNG terminal must file an extensive application with FERC, 18\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fC.F.R. § 157.6, which must then consult with states regarding\n\nsafety and environmental questions, 15 U.S.C. § 717b-1(b).\n\n            The NGA creates a consolidated regulatory process for\n\napproving    LNG   facilities     that    maintains     the   role     of    federal\n\nagencies and, in circumscribed areas, state agencies.                  It does so\n\nby limiting FERC's exclusive authority in two ways relevant to this\n\ncase.    First, the NGA, except where expressly provided, does not\n\naffect   \"any     Federal    agency's     authorities    or   responsibilities\n\nrelated to LNG terminals.\"        Id. § 717b(e)(1) (emphasis added).              In\n\naddition,    the    NGA     explicitly    states   that,      unless       otherwise\n\nprovided, it does not affect the rights of states under three\n\nfederal regulatory statutes, of which only the CZMA is pertinent to\n\nthis case.      Id. § 717b(d)(1).\n\n            The    CZMA   establishes     the   relationship     between      state\n\nbodies, like the Rhode Island CRMC, and federal agencies during the\n\npermitting process for LNG terminal construction projects that\n\nimpact   coastal     zones.      It     provides   states     with     a    limited\n\nopportunity to review applications to ensure they are consistent\n\nwith state regulations, 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A), and, in doing\n\nso, grants states \"a conditional veto over federally licensed or\n\npermitted projects,\" Weaver's Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 267.                    That\n\nconditional veto, however, is itself subject to review.\n\n            In order to conduct a consistency review, state agencies\n\nmust first have obtained approval from the federal National Oceanic\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fAtmospheric      Administration         (\"NOAA\"),   a   Department     of    Commerce\n\nagency, for the state agency's own coastal management plan. 16\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1454, 1455(d)-(e), 1456(c)(3)(A).                    Coastal management\n\nplans    set     forth    general   state       policies   for     developing    and\n\nmaintaining coastal areas and, as is the case in Rhode Island, may\n\ninclude not only the conditions for federal consistency review but\n\nalso for state licensing programs.\n\n               Once a state coastal management plan has been approved,\n\nan applicant for a federal permit wishing to undertake any activity\n\nthe state plan regulates must certify with the local agency that\n\nthe proposed activity is consistent with the coastal management\n\nplan.1   Id. § 1456(c)(3)(A).            In support of the application, the\n\napplicant       must     submit   all    \"necessary     data     and   information\"\n\nidentified       in      the   coastal     management      plan.        15     C.F.R.\n\n§ 930.58(a)(2).          Under federal law, the state agency has thirty\n\ndays from the time the application was submitted to notify the\n\napplicant and the federal agency if it takes the position that the\n\napplicant has failed to submit all of the required information.\n\nId. § 930.60(a)(2).\n\n               Importantly, the CZMA limits the time a state may conduct\n\nsuch a review, in order to prevent frustration of federal purposes.\n\n\n\n     1\n          A state is prohibited from undertaking interstate\nconsistency review of activities occurring in a different state\nunless the state requests and obtains interstate review authority\nfrom NOAA. 15 C.F.R. § 930.154(e).\n\n                                          -6-\n\fWhether CRMC failed to act within this limit is a key issue in this\n\ncase. Once an applicant submits its consistency certification, the\n\nstate agency has six months either to concur with the certification\n\nor    to   object    if    it   concludes    that   the   proposed   activity    is\n\ninconsistent        with    the    coastal   management     plan.      16   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1456(c)(3)(A).          If the state agency fails to respond within six\n\nmonths, the state's concurrence will be \"conclusively presumed.\"\n\nId.     If the application is incomplete and the state agency so\n\ninforms the applicant within the required thirty-day time period,\n\n\"the State agency's six-month review period will commence on the\n\ndate of receipt of the missing necessary data and information.\" 15\n\nC.F.R. § 930.60(a)(2).              However, the state agency's review of\n\nwhether the application is complete \"is not a substantive review of\n\nthe adequacy of the information received,\" and the agency's request\n\nfor clarification of the information provided or its assertion that\n\nthe information is \"substantively deficient\" does not toll the six-\n\nmonth review period.              Id. § 930.60(c).        These rules encourage\n\nstates to act quickly when reviewing applications so that no one\n\nstate      can   delay    the   federal   approval    process.       Congress   was\n\nsufficiently concerned about the ability of local state agencies to\n\ndelay projects that it did not use a generalized standard, such as\n\n\"a reasonable period of time\" as it did, for instance, in the\n\nTelecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(3)(B), but\n\ncapped the time at six months.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            The CZMA also limits state authority to delay or prohibit\n\nprojects subject to consistency review, by providing for federal\n\nreview of state agency determinations. If the state agency objects\n\nto consistency certification, the applicant may appeal the decision\n\nto the Secretary of Commerce, who can override the objection on a\n\nfinding \"that the activity is consistent with the objectives of\n\nthis chapter or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national\n\nsecurity.\"    16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(A).      The Secretary's decision, in\n\nturn, may be reviewed in federal district court.2 See, e.g.,\n\nMillennium Pipeline Co., L.P. v.

It\n\nprohibits    construction    or   other    work,   such   as    dredging,   in\n\nnavigable U.S. waters without congressional authorization or a\n\nrecommendation by the Army Corps Chief of Engineers as well as the\n\nSecretary    of   the   Army's   authorization.     Id.        Because   FERC's\n\nexclusive authority under the NGA does not disturb the Army Corps's\n\nauthority under the Rivers and Harbors Act, 15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1),\n\nparties seeking FERC approval for LNG terminal proposals that\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          A state may reopen review of a certification if the\napplicant makes a \"major amendment\" to the project.    15 C.F.R.\n§§ 930.51(b)-(c), (e), 930.66(b). That provision is inapplicable\nhere.\n\n                                     -8-\n\finclude dredging in navigable waterways, like Weaver's Cove, must\n\nalso apply for approval from the Army Corps.\n\n               In Rhode Island, the federally designated agency under\n\nthe    CZMA    is    the     appellant,    CRMC.        CRMC    is   responsible     for\n\nadministering Rhode Island's coastal management plan, the Rhode\n\nIsland Coastal Resources Management Program (\"CRMP\"). When a party\n\nwishes to conduct an activity listed in the CRMP, such as dredging\n\nin Rhode Island, under state law, that party should obtain from the\n\nCRMC a state law license called an \"Assent.\"                    04-000-010 R.I. Code\n\nR. § 100.1.         The more extensive \"Category B Assent\" process under\n\nstate law is required for approval of all projects that involve\n\nmajor alterations proposed for Rhode Island tidal waters, shoreline\n\nfeatures,      or    areas     contiguous      with   shoreline       features.      Id.\n\n§§ 100.1(A), (D), 300.1.              If the party's proposed listed activity\n\nis also part of a project that is subject to federal licensing,\n\nCRMC   is     the    body    tasked    with    providing       the   required    federal\n\nconsistency review.\n\n               CRMC's document, labeled the Federal Consistency Manual,\n\nemphasizes       that       although    the    Assent    and     consistency      review\n\nprocesses may overlap, they are distinct approvals.                      R.I. Coastal\n\nRes. Mgmt. Council, Federal Consistency Manual 7, available at\n\nhttp://www.crmc.ri.gov/regulations/Fed_Consistency.pdf.                         The same\n\nlist of activities that require Assents also require consistency\n\nreview.       Id. at 12.

Id. at 13.     A key difference between the two forms of\n\nreview is that whereas the CZMA limits consistency review through\n\nthe six-month time limit, administrative review by the Secretary of\n\nCommerce, and federal judicial review, no federal statute limits\n\nhow long state decisions regarding Category B Assent may take or\n\nprovides for federal review.\n\n            The   substantive       provision   of    the   state    CRMP   most\n\npertinent to this case is section 300.9(C), which requires approval\n\nby the CRMC for all dredging activities.             Particularly in dispute\n\nin this case is the meaning of section 300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP,\n\nwhich requires that \"[w]hen disposal is proposed for approved\n\nupland    facilities,     the    applicant   shall    provide    a   letter   of\n\nacceptance from that facility, unless the disposal is approved for\n\nthe central landfill.\"          04-000-010 R.I. Code R. § 300.9(C)(7).\n\n            The CRMC also coordinates some of its responsibilities\n\nwith   another    state    agency,     the   Rhode    Island    Department    of\n\nEnvironmental Management (\"RIDEM\").          Particularly relevant to this\n\ncase is RIDEM's role in identifying a list of approved upland sites\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\ffor disposal of dredged material, which CRMC is responsible for\n\nincorporating      into       a    comprehensive        plan   for    dredged      material\n\nmanagement.

The   proposed         project   received        FERC\n\napproval in 2005, subject to certain conditions.3                           Weaver's Cove\n\nEnergy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,070, at 61,528 (2005).                          FERC found\n\nthat the proposal \"will promote the public interest by increasing\n\nthe   availability       of       natural   gas    supplies      in   the    New    England\n\nmarket.\"    Id.\n\n            Under the original LNG proposal, submitted in 2003, ships\n\ncarrying LNG would pass through waters in both Rhode Island and\n\nMassachusetts, traveling up the Taunton River to the terminal\n\nlocation.     This has changed.             According to Weaver's Cove's 2009\n\n\"Offshore Berth Amendment,\" the proposal now calls for ships to\n\ndeliver their cargo to an offshore berth in Mount Hope Bay, from\n\nwhich the LNG would be transported via a submerged pipeline to the\n\nonshore terminal.             The offshore berth, the pipeline, and the\n\nterminal would all be located in Massachusetts.                              In both the\n\n\n      3\n          LNG, produced by cooling natural gas to a liquid state,\nhas less volume and so can be more economically transported. The\nterminal proposed by Weaver's Cove would receive imported LNG from\ntanker ships, regasify it, and inject it into the U.S. natural gas\ngrid.   According to Weaver's Cove, the proposed terminal would\nsupply fifteen percent of New England's \"peak day\" natural gas\ndemand in 2010. Weaver's Cove, 583 F.

FERC, as said, approved the application in 2005 subject\n\nto a number of conditions, one of which was that Weaver's Cove was\n\nto \"file . . . prior to construction documentation of concurrence\n\nfrom the [CRMC] that the project is consistent with the Rhode\n\nIsland   [CRMP].\"        Weaver's       Cove   Energy,    LLC,    112    F.E.R.C.      at\n\n¶¶ 61,550-51 (emphasis in original).\n\n              Turning    to     state    regulatory      requirements,         such    as\n\nCategory B Assent, FERC added that \"state or local permits issued\n\nwith respect to the jurisdictional facilities authorized herein\n\nmust be consistent with the conditions in this order.\" Id. at\n\n¶   61,546.        Although     FERC    encouraged    Weaver's     Cove    and    local\n\nauthorities to cooperate during local review of Weaver's Cove's\n\nproposal, it made clear that \"this does not mean that state and\n\nlocal agencies, through application of state or local laws, may\n\nprohibit or unreasonably delay the construction or operation of\n\nfacilities approved by this Commission.\"                 Id.\n\n              Following cross-motions for rehearing, FERC reaffirmed\n\nthis order in 2006 in all respects relevant to this case.

Dredging is a listed activity in Rhode Island's federally\n\napproved CRMP. 04-000-010 R.I. Code R. § 300.9.      On filing its\n\napplication to the Army Corps, Weaver's Cove was therefore also\n\nrequired by the CZMA to file a consistency certification with CRMC,\n\nwhich it did in July 2004.    With this application, Weaver's Cove\n\nalso applied for Rhode Island's state law license for dredging,\n\nCategory B Assent.   However, Weaver's Cove informed CRMC that it\n\nbelieved the Assent unnecessary.\n\n           Within the thirty-day window to inform applicants for\n\nconcurrence that their applications are incomplete required by the\n\nCZMA, CRMC informed Weaver's Cove by phone that its consistency\n\ncertification and Category B Assent application were, in CRMC's\n\nview, incomplete on two grounds.

The first, quickly remedied by Weaver's\n\nCove, was that it had failed to submit the engineering plans with\n\nthe stamp of a Rhode Island engineer.   The second ground, at issue\n\nin this case, was that Weaver's Cove's application was incomplete,\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fand so the six-month clock was not ticking, because Weaver's Cove\n\nhad     failed    to   provide    documentation,           pursuant     to     section\n\n300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP, that dredged materials would be accepted\n\nby \"an approved upland facilit[y].\"                In a letter dated August 2,\n\n2004, Weaver's Cove replied that because the dredged materials were\n\nto be disposed of in Massachusetts, and not in Rhode Island,\n\nsection 300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP did not apply.                On August 26, 2004,\n\nCRMC responded, informing Weaver's Cove that its application was\n\nstill    incomplete    because    it   failed       to    file   a   Water     Quality\n\nCertificate but making no mention of the upland disposal issue.\n\nAfter additional communications, the parties failed to resolve the\n\ndispute.         Because   it    claimed      to    lack    necessary        data   and\n\ninformation, CRMC did not commence review of Weaver's Cove's\n\nconsistency certification or its Category B assent.                    It still has\n\nnot done so.      In short, as of this date, the appellant state agency\n\nhas not acted on the merits of an application which has been\n\npending before it since July 2004.\n\n            Over a year after its original application to CRMC,\n\nWeaver's    Cove    made   separate    filings       to    NOAA,     FERC,    and   the\n\nSecretary of Commerce, requesting a determination that CRMC's\n\nconcurrence be \"conclusively presumed\" because CRMC had failed to\n\nact on Weaver's Cove's application within the statutorily required\n\nsix-month deadline.        16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A).                 NOAA took no\n\naction, FERC concluded it did not have authority to address the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fissue, and the Secretary of Commerce determined that he could not\n\nreview the matter without an actual objection from CRMC. This left\n\nthe matter of whether CRMC's concurrence should be conclusively\n\npresumed to the courts for resolution.\n\n             Weaver's Cove filed suit in the U.S. District Court for\n\nthe   District     of    Rhode      Island    on    June     29,   2007.          It    sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the disposal\n\ninformation       and    the       water    quality    certification,           which     the\n\nappellant    CRMC       had    requested,      were    not      \"necessary        data     and\n\ninformation,\" as required by the CZMA.                 Weaver's Cove asserted the\n\nCZMA's     six-month         deadline      should   not    be      tolled      and     CRMC's\n\nconcurrence      should       be    conclusively      presumed.           In   an      amended\n\ncomplaint, Weaver's Cove also argued that Category B Assent was\n\npreempted by provisions of the NGA that grant FERC \"exclusive\n\nauthority\" in approving LNG facilities, 15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1), and\n\nunlawful under the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\n             The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nWeaver's Cove, on both the CZMA and the NGA claims.                       Weaver's Cove,\n\n583 F. Supp. 2d at 262.             The court found that neither the disposal\n\ninformation, nor the water quality certificate were necessary data\n\nand   information,           and   so   Weaver's      Cove    application           was   not\n\nincomplete.       Id. at 272-73.            Thus, CRMC had failed to meet the\n\nstatutory deadline and its concurrence was conclusively presumed.\n\nId.   at   275.         In    particular,      with    respect       to     the      disposal\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\finformation, the court found, based on statutory interpretation and\n\nthe interpretation which the other state agency of Rhode Island,\n\nRIDEM, had adopted, that the term \"approved upland facilities\" in\n\nsection   300.9(C)(7)     of    the   CRMP   referred    only   to   disposal\n\nfacilities in Rhode Island.           Weaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n270-75.     Since Weaver's Cove intended to dispose of the dredged\n\nmaterial out of state (in Massachusetts) at that time,4 the court\n\nconcluded that CRMC could not require proof that the material would\n\nbe accepted.     Id.   The district court, acting under the NGA, also\n\nheld the Category B Assent process utilized by CRMC was preempted\n\non three grounds.      First, it found the process expressly preempted\n\nby the language of 15 U.S.C. § 717b(3)(1), granting FERC \"exclusive\n\nauthority to approve or deny an application\" to build an LNG\n\nterminal.    Weaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 280-83.          Second, the\n\ncourt found the assent process implicitly field preempted because\n\n\"Congress clearly intended that the NGA occupy the entire field of\n\nLNG regulation.\" Id. at 283-84. Finally, the district court found\n\nthe   Category    B    Assent    process     preempted   here   because   it\n\nspecifically conflicted with FERC's jurisdiction to regulate LNG\n\nfacilities.    Id. at 284-85.     The court also held that the case was\n\nnot rendered moot by the changes in the project that occurred after\n\n\n\n      4\n          The original proposal to the Army Corps set forth a\nMassachusetts disposal site but also considered offshore disposal\nat a federal ocean disposal site approved by the Environmental\nProtection Agency and the Army Corps.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fthe date Weaver's Cove submitted its consistency certification.\n\nId. at 275-76.         It did not reach the dormant Commerce Clause\n\nquestion.\n\n                                    III.\n\nA.             Jurisdiction\n\n               We first hold that we have jurisdiction to hear this\n\ncase.       CRMC does not raise any challenge to standing, mootness, or\n\nripeness.5      Massachusetts, in its brief amicus curiae to this court\n\n(but not to the district court), argues broadly that there is no\n\ncase or controversy here, based on standing, mootness, and lack of\n\nripeness.

Consistency review is a condition\n\nfor FERC approval, and FERC has stated it has no authority to\n\naddress CRMC's refusal to act.6           While CRMC's inaction may not be\n\nthe exclusive reason federal approval has not been granted, it is\n\nclear    that   failure     to   obtain    concurrence        from   CRMC    has    a\n\n\"determinative       or   coercive     effect\"    on    the   federal    agencies.\n\nBennet, 520 U.S. at 169.         Weaver's Cove therefore has standing to\n\nmake its CZMA-related claims.\n\n            In addition, Weaver's Cove has standing to make its\n\npreemption claims because it suffers a concrete injury from Rhode\n\nIsland subjecting it to a preempted state law.

These efforts are ongoing and the\n\nOffshore Berth Amendment represents an attempt by Weaver's Cove to\n\naddress     some   of   the   concerns       that    may   have    earlier      delayed\n\napproval.      While    Weaver’s      Cove    still     has   conditions        to   meet\n\nfollowing the amendment, Weaver's Cove did, for example, get\n\napproval from the Coast Guard, which previously had been a hurdle.\n\nSince CRMC's consistency certification remains a requirement of\n\nFERC and of the Army Corps, that question is clearly live.                      This is\n\nespecially so because the Offshore Berth Amendment itself does not\n\nrender moot the dispute here with Rhode Island.

In Fall River, we held that a challenge to FERC's\n\nconditional approval of this project was not ripe because the\n\ndecision was not final until the completion of reviews by the\n\nUnited States Coast Guard and the Department of the Interior.

If, on the other\n\nhand, the letter is not necessary data and information, as the\n\ndistrict court found, the six-month period from Weaver's Cove's\n\nsubmission of the consistency certification in July 2004 has\n\nclearly expired, and we are required to find CRMC's concurrence\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          We note that Weaver’s Cove no longer intends to dispose\nof the dredged materials at any “upland facilit[y]” and instead now\nplans to dispose of the waste at an offshore site. As CRMC points\nout in its reply brief, this was not the case at the time of the\noriginal consistency review application.     Weaver’s Cove at that\ntime planned to dispose of the waste at its Fall River Facility.\nWe do not address this change, because it occurred after the time\nconcurrence would have been presumed, and neither party has raised\nit on appeal.\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fpresumed.     16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A).               We affirm the district\n\ncourt's conclusion.\n\n             As the district court noted, the state CRMP does not\n\ndefine \"approved upland facilit[y].\"              Weaver's Cove, 583 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 271.    However, other Rhode Island laws have shed light on the\n\nlanguage's meaning.     Rhode Island's Marine Waterways and Boating\n\nFacilities Act of 2001 (\"Waterways and Boating Act\"), R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws §§ 46-6.1-1 to -10, and associated regulations, set forth a\n\ncomprehensive system regulating dredging activities and disposal of\n\ndredged materials in the state. The district judge relied on these\n\nregulations to conclude that facilities outside of Rhode Island are\n\nnot among the \"approved upland facilities\" from which the CRMP\n\nrequires a letter of acceptance.          Weaver’s Cove, 583 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n271-72.\n\n             We agree with the district court that the language of\n\nsection   300.9(C)(7)      of    the   CRMP    can    only   be   read   to    cover\n\nfacilities located in the state of Rhode Island because the state's\n\nregulatory     framework        for    dredging      only    provides    for     the\n\nidentification of \"approved upland facilities\" within the state.\n\n             We begin with the Rhode Island statutes that govern\n\nregulation of dredging in the state.              Rhode Island law makes the\n\nCRMC responsible for \"prepar[ing], adopt[ing] and maintain[ing]\n\n. . . a comprehensive plan for dredged material management for\n\ndredging that takes place in the coastal zone.\"                   R.I. Gen. Laws.\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f§ 46-6.1-5(a).    But the same statute delegates to RIDEM the task of\n\n\"adopt[ing] by rule a list of upland sites and types of areas\n\nsuitable for beneficial use and disposal of dredged materials.\"\n\nId. § 46-6.1-5(b). This list is then \"incorporated in the [CRMC's]\n\ncomprehensive plan for dredged material management.\"                 Id.    The\n\nWaterways and Boating Act does not define \"upland sites,\" but it\n\ndoes define \"[u]pland areas\" as \"areas that are not in the coastal\n\nzone.\"   Id. § 46-6.1-4(16).         Thus, while both agencies may be\n\nresponsible for interpreting whether \"upland disposal facilities\"\n\ncan include out of state disposal facilities, only RIDEM is charged\n\nwith approving upland sites.\n\n          RIDEM    has   in   turn    promulgated       its   own   Rules   and\n\nRegulations for Dredging and the Management of Dredged Material\n\n(\"Dredging Regulations\") pursuant to the Waterways and Boating Act.\n\nR.I. Dept. of Envtl. Mgmt., Rules and Regulations for Dredging and\n\nthe   Management    of   Dredged       Material     §    2,    available     at\n\nhttp://www.dem.ri.gov/pubs/regs/regs/water/dred0203.pdf\n\n[hereinafter \"R.I. Dredging Regulations\"].          These regulations are\n\nalso intended to be consistent with the CZMA, id., and must be\n\nimplemented according to a written protocol jointly adopted by CRMC\n\nand RIDEM, id. § 3.   Among the stated purposes of these regulations\n\nis to \"[i]dentify and list upland sites suitable for beneficial use\n\nand/or disposal of dredged material,\" id. § 1.5, and, as the\n\ndistrict court noted, the Dredging Regulations \"apply to all\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\faspects of dredging proposed in marine waters of the State of Rhode\n\nIsland,\" id. § 3.      The Dredging Regulations do not contain an\n\nexpress definition for \"approved upland facilities,\" but they do\n\ndefine \"Upland Areas\" more narrowly than the corresponding term in\n\nthe Waterways and Boating Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-6.1-4(16), as\n\n\"[a]ll areas of the state that are not in the coastal zone.\"         R.I.\n\nDredging Regulations § 4.20 (emphasis added).\n\n            Since RIDEM is tasked with approving upland disposal\n\nfacilities, R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-6.1-5(b), and it only approves\n\nupland facilities within the state of Rhode Island, R.I. Dredging\n\nRegulations    §   4.20,   it   follows   that   the   \"approved   upland\n\nfacilities\" referred to by section 300.9(C)(7) of the CRMP should\n\nbe read to be facilities within the state of Rhode Island.           \"To\n\nhold otherwise would render the C[R]MP's specific language a\n\nnullity.\"    Weaver’s Cove, 583 F.

Absent language in Rhode Island law to the contrary, we\n\npresume state laws, like this one, not to have extraterritorial\n\neffect.   Cf. Carnero v. Boston Sci.

Citing language from both the\n\nWaterways and Boating Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-6.1-3(1), and the\n\nCRMC's organic statute, id. § 46-23-1(e), that designate CRMC as\n\nthe \"lead agency\" for purposes of regulating dredging activities,\n\nCRMC       argues   that   federal   courts     must    defer   to   its   broader\n\ninterpretation of its own regulations for its own purposes.                     It\n\nexplains that although RIDEM may, in its limited role of approving\n\ndisposal sites, only be concerned with upland facilities within\n\nRhode Island, CRMC is more broadly concerned with ensuring the\n\nproper disposal of dredged material.9\n\n               CRMC cites no authority in support of its view, and in\n\nthis context, the view is untenable.              Since for the purposes of\n\nCZMA       consistency     review,   we   are    only     concerned    with    the\n\nrequirements of the CRMP, CRMC's argument that it is entitled to\n\ndeference in its interpretation of the Waterways and Boating Act is\n\ninapposite.         We are concerned only with its interpretation of\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          Thus, in order to prevent a hypothetical \"trash barge to\nnowhere scenario,\" in which Rhode Island is forced to dispose of\ndredged material that no one else will accept, CRMC is entitled to\ndemand proof that Weaver's Cove's proposed upland disposal facility\nwill accept it.     Of course, this is not a barge to nowhere\nsituation, because Weaver's Cove has identified a disposal site\nsubject to the jurisdiction of other agencies that play a role\nunder the CZMA.\n\n                                      -27-\n\fsection 3009.(C)(7) of the CRMP, and complementary regulatory\n\nschemes to the extent they shed light on its meaning.\n\n               It is true, as CRMC points out, that federal agency\n\ninterpretations       of    their     own    regulations    (when    authorized    by\n\nCongress)       are   \"controlling            unless   'plainly      erroneous     or\n\ninconsistent with the regulation.'\" Auer v.

However, even if we applied that\n\nstandard here, CRMC cannot satisfy it because the plain language of\n\nsection       300.9(C)(7)       of   the    CRMP   calls   for    \"approved     upland\n\nfacilities\" (emphasis added).               Thus, even if upland facilities can\n\nbe interpreted to include facilities outside of Rhode Island, CRMC\n\nhas not pointed to any regulatory scheme that deals with the\n\napproval of out-of-state facilities or even a list of approved out-\n\nof-state facilities.             The only regulatory scheme for approving\n\nupland       facilities    is    that      administered    by    RIDEM,   and   CRMC's\n\ninterpretation of its regulation is therefore clearly erroneous.10\n\n               This construction of state law also permits us to avoid\n\nan issue of whether a different construction would violate federal\n\nlaw.

Fitzgerald, 549 F.3d\n\nat 52.      The first, express preemption, results from language in a\n\nstatute revealing an explicit congressional intent to preempt state\n\nlaw.    Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v.

The second, field preemption, is that Congress may\n\nimplicitly preempt a state law by creating a pervasive scheme of\n\nregulation.     Fitzgerald, 549 F.3d at 52; N. Natural Gas Co. v.

The\n\nthird category is conflict preemption.

Supp. 2d at 285 (citing Schneidewind, 485\n\nU.S. at 301).\n\n          We prefer to decide on the narrowest grounds: conflict\n\npreemption.     In this case, FERC has interpreted the dredging\n\nactivities in the Weaver's Cove's project, including those in Rhode\n\nIsland, to be within its preemptive jurisdiction.    See Fitzgerald,\n\n549 F.3d at 55 (\"The proposition that federal agency action, taken\n\npursuant to its interpretation of a statute, may itself preempt is\n\nquite correct.\").    CRMC does not argue that the proposed dredging\n\nis not a part of the LNG terminal's \"siting, construction, . . . or\n\noperation\" under 15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1), although Massachusetts, as\n\n\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\famicus, does.12   In its original order, FERC extensively reviewed\n\nthe dredging as part of the overall terminal construction and\n\noperational plan.    Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. at\n\n¶ 61,535-36, 61,545, 61,550.    Here, FERC carefully reviewed the\n\nvery dredging Rhode Island seeks to further regulate and, after\n\nconsidering environmental impacts, authorized the project.    Id. at\n\n61,546.   The FEIS, adopted by reference in the FERC order, id. at\n\n61,540, found that the dredging was necessary \"to accommodate the\n\npassage of LNG ships\" to the facility, Weaver's Cove FEIS, at 2-25\n\n(May 2005), and that it would be impossible to \"reduce the volume\n\nor extent of dredging and still satisfy the objectives of the\n\nproject at the proposed site,\" id. at 3-70.     Thus, FERC concluded\n\nthat the dredging was part of the construction and the operation of\n\nthe terminal facility. That ruling is final and binding because no\n\nobjections were made to FERC's findings on these points in the\n\nparties' request for rehearing.13     Further, the dredging is in an\n\napproved federal navigation channel.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n          Rather CRMC argues that Section 10 of the River and\nHarbors Act saves Category B Assent from preemption by the NGA, a\ncontention we consider below.\n     13\n          The parties never raised objections to these findings in\ntheir request for rehearing to FERC and thus courts have no\njurisdiction to review this determination by FERC.      15 U.S.C.\n§ 717r(a) (\"No proceeding to review any order of the Commission\nshall be brought by any person unless such person shall have made\napplication to the Commission for a rehearing thereon.\").\n\n                               -32-\n\f          By finding the dredging activities were part of the\n\nconstruction and operation of the terminal facility, FERC has\n\ninterpreted the Rhode Island dredging at issue in this case to be\n\nwithin its jurisdiction.      Thus, the Category B Assent process\n\nutilized by Rhode Island clearly collides with FERC's delegated\n\nauthority and is preempted.     FERC made this clear in its order\n\nregarding Weaver's Cove's application, which stated that state\n\nagencies could not use state law to \"prohibit or unreasonably delay\n\nthe construction or operation of facilities approved by this\n\nCommission.\"   Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. at ¶ 61,546.\n\nFERC affirmed this point on rehearing, in response to the City of\n\nFall River's challenge. Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC, 114 F.E.R.C. at\n\n¶ 61,185-86.\n\n          CRMC's handling of the Category B Assent process both\n\nconflicts with and is an obstacle to the authority FERC has\n\nasserted in this case.     Unlike CZMA consistency review, which\n\nallows the CRMC to review the dredging proposals, limited by a six-\n\nmonth deadline and administrative and federal judicial review, the\n\nCategory B Assent process contains no such limitations, and to this\n\ndate the appellant has not processed this application or reached\n\nany decision on the merits.    CRMC has taken the position that it\n\nmust carry out the Category B Assent process concurrently with the\n\nconsistency review, and because the consistency review has not\n\ncommenced, it cannot address the application for Category B Assent.\n\n\n                                -33-\n\fThus, even if concurrence were presumed, CRMC's position is that\n\nthe Category B Assent process would itself independently block full\n\nlicensing of the facility. This is clearly an application of state\n\nlaw that delays or has the potential to prohibit the ultimate\n\nlicensing and construction of the LNG terminal.      Weaver's Cove\n\nEnergy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. at ¶ 61,546.   Further, CRMC's two bites\n\nat the apple approach necessarily conflicts with the federal\n\nprocess for and interest in defining what is necessary data.\n\nBecause CRMC's actions here conflict with FERC's jurisdiction and\n\nthe limits for consistency review, it is preempted.14\n\n\n     14\n          CRMC and Massachusetts also incorrectly argue that the\ndistrict court based its Category B Assent preemption on the\ndoctrine of federal navigational servitude and that a finding of\npreemption under the servitude was improper because Congress failed\nto invoke it expressly within the NGA. The argument misreads the\ndistrict court's holding and is irrelevant. Congress's power to\npreempt state regulation here emanates not only from its power to\nregulate navigation but also from its power to regulate commerce\nitself. U.S. Const. art.

Because\narguments raised for the first time in reply briefs are\nprocedurally barred, we need not consider this contention. United\nStates v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433875\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433875/united-states-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 n.3 (1st Cir. 2009). In any event,\nthe argument is wrong.     The Supreme Court has held that state\n\n                               -34-\n\fD.         Rivers and Harbors Act\n\n           Finally, CRMC argues that the federal Rivers and Harbors\n\nAct saves its state Category B Assent process from preemption.\n\nPointing   to   language   in    the    NGA    qualifying   FERC's   exclusive\n\nauthority to the extent that it affects law \"related to\" the\n\nauthority of other federal agencies, 15 U.S.C. § 717b(e)(1), CRMC\n\nargues that the NGA preserves not only the Army Corps's role in\n\napproving dredging activities but also the entire body of law\n\n\"related to\" that role.         Since the Army Corps's approval process\n\nunder the Rivers and Harbors Act does not preempt state licensing\n\nschemes, CRMC argues that the savings clause in the NGA must\n\ntherefore protect Category B Assent.\n\n           These arguments, assuming arguendo they were preserved in\n\nthe district court, are meritless.            The language of § 717(b)(e)(1)\n\nis plainly aimed at preserving the authority of federal agencies\n\nand not that of state agencies like CRMC.           CRMC's argument that its\n\nstate licensing program is \"related to\" the authority of FERC is\n\nalso untenable.    As CRMC points out in other parts of its brief,\n\nCRMC's authority to require Category B Assent derives from Rhode\n\nIsland's status as a sovereign, whereas the Army Corps's authority\n\nderives from the federal government.            The fact that the Rivers and\n\n\n\nproperty interests in land may not preempt federal statutes enacted\npursuant to the Commerce Clause. Douglas v.

CRMC cannot\n\nnow avoid presumed concurrence by relying on a nearly identical\n\nstate law licensing procedure.\n\n          The district court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\f</pre>",
