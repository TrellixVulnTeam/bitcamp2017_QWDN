Petitioner Aihua Chiv Wang, a\n\nnative of Laos and a citizen of the People's Republic of China,\n\npetitions for review of the denial of her application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT).     She also requests that we remand the case for\n\nreconsideration based on changed country conditions.             We deny the\n\npetition.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Wang was born on February 10, 1974 in Laos and lived\n\nthere until July 5, 1990, when she arrived in Chicago, Illinois on\n\na tourist visa.   On July 5, 1992, Wang received a student visa.           As\n\nof June 1995, she ceased to be a student but remained in the United\n\nStates without obtaining a new visa.1           In 2000, Wang received a\n\nNotice to Appear alleging that she was removable because she failed\n\nto maintain her student status.\n\n            At a hearing in 2005 before an Immigration Judge (IJ),\n\nshe conceded removability and applied for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval,    protection   under   the    CAT,   and,   in   the   alternative,\n\nvoluntary departure.     When Wang declined to designate a country of\n\nremoval, the IJ designated China – the only country in which Wang\n\n\n     1\n        She applied for asylum in 1994 claiming that she feared\nbeing persecuted for her anti-communist beliefs. She has since\nrepudiated her statements in the 1994 asylum application, most\nnotably her assertions that her father was accused by the Laotian\ngovernment of being a spy for the Chinese government, that he was\nsent to re-education camps in Laos for seven years, and that Wang,\nherself, has a Laotian passport.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fhas citizenship.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(f).   Wang testified that\n\nshe feared going to China because of its coercive population\n\ncontrol measures.    Wang already has one daughter – born in 2003 as\n\na United States citizen – and testified that she would like to have\n\nmore children.     She worries that if she were forced to live in\n\nChina, she would be unable to have more children because of China's\n\n\"one-child\" policy.\n\n          Wang submitted evidence to the IJ that included U.S.\n\nState Department Reports.      These reports characterized Chinese\n\npopulation control policies as restrictive, but also as highly\n\nparticularized.    The 2004 Report, entitled Country Report on Human\n\nRights Practices, noted that enforcement of the population and\n\nfamily planning laws \"continued to vary from place to place\" and\n\nallowed \"eligible couples to apply for permission to have a second\n\nchild if they met conditions stipulated in local and provincial\n\nregulations.\"     According to the 2004 Report, physical coercion was\n\nformally prohibited as a method of enforcing family planning\n\npolicies, but economic and social penalties were allowed and\n\nfrequently used.\n\n          Based on all of the evidence presented, the IJ found that\n\nthe \"Chinese government does persecute Chinese nationals who break\n\nthe coercive family planning policy of China by having more than\n\none child without the permission of the Chinese government.\"    Yet,\n\nthe IJ decided that given the particularized nature of these\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fpolicies, Wang did not demonstrate that she or someone similarly\n\nsituated would face persecution.      The IJ noted that Wang had not\n\nshown that with a foreign-born child she would be subject to the\n\none-child policy or that she would be persecuted for being single\n\nand having a child.\n\n          The IJ thus concluded that the evidence provided was\n\ninsufficient to establish that (1) Wang had a well founded fear of\n\npersecution, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A), (2) she would be more\n\nlikely than not to have her life or freedom threatened if she were\n\nremoved to China, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2), or (3) she would be\n\nmore likely than not to be tortured by the Chinese government or\n\nits agents,   8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2).   Accordingly, the IJ denied\n\nWang's petition for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.\n\nThe IJ did, however, grant her request for voluntary departure.\n\n          In an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\n\nWang argued that the record clearly demonstrated that she would be\n\nsubject to China's coercive population control measures in spite of\n\nher daughter's American citizenship.       Wang also asserted that\n\nbecause she is a single woman, she would be even more susceptible\n\nto these coercive measures.\n\n          The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision on the ground that\n\nWang has only one child, who was born in the United States, and she\n\ntherefore would not presently be subject to persecution for having\n\nmore than one child.    The BIA also found that the evidence was\n\n\n                                -4-\n\finsufficient to support Wang's contention that single women are\n\npersecuted in China for having children out of wedlock. It further\n\ncharacterized as \"speculative at present\" Wang's claim that she\n\nwould be persecuted if she had additional children while living in\n\nChina.\n\n          This petition for review followed.    In it, Wang argues\n\nthat the BIA erred in determining that she did not have the\n\nrequisite well founded fear of persecution to establish eligibility\n\nfor asylum.    She also claims that the BIA should have found her\n\neligible for withholding of removal and for relief under the CAT.\n\nIn addition, Wang argues that she is entitled to a remand based on\n\nchanged conditions in China with respect to foreign-born children.\n\nTherefore, she asks us to direct the BIA to consider this new\n\ninformation.\n\n                               II.\n\n          The BIA adopted the IJ's opinion and also addressed the\n\nunderlying bases for the denial of asylum.     We therefore review\n\nboth the IJ's and BIA's decisions.   Ouk v. Gonzalez, 464 F.3d 108,\n\n110 (1st Cir. 2006)(finding that \"we have authority to review both\n\nthe IJ's and the BIA's opinions\" when the BIA adopts the IJ's\n\nopinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision).   We\n\nreview legal issues de novo and apply the substantial evidence\n\nstandard to the factual determinations.    Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft,\n\n390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).    Under the highly deferential\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fsubstantial evidence standard, we consider whether the agency's\n\nruling is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"                     Lopez de Hincapie\n\nv. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).                   We will not upset the\n\nBIA's   determination         unless   the    record      compels     the    contrary\n\nconclusion.       Id.\n\nA. Asylum\n\n            To qualify for asylum, an alien needs to demonstrate that\n\nshe is a refugee by virtue of her previous persecution or her well\n\nfounded    fear    of   future    persecution        based    on    race,    religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.    8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales, 460\n\nF.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir. 2006).           We need not discuss the standard\n\nfor a finding of past persecution because Wang makes no such claim.\n\nWith regard to a fear of future persecution, the applicant must\n\ndemonstrate   that      she    objectively     has    a   well     founded       fear   of\n\npersecution on a protected ground and that this fear is genuine.\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999)(proving the\n\nobjective and subjective components of a well founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution requires the petitioner to show her fear is\n\n\"both   genuine     and   objectively        reasonable\").          Fear    of    forced\n\nabortion or sterilization is categorized as fear of persecution on\n\naccount of political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(\"A person who\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fhas a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo [a\n\nforced abortion or sterilization] procedure or [is] subject to\n\npersecution for failure, refusal, or resistance [to undergoing such\n\na procedure] shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of political opinion.\"); Zheng v. Gonzales,\n\n475 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          Wang contends that the BIA erred by relying on the IJ's\n\ndetermination that her fear of persecution was unreasonable solely\n\nbecause she had not been subject to past persecution.   The IJ did\n\nnot base its decision exclusively on the determination that Wang\n\nhad not been subject to past persecution and, therefore, the BIA\n\ndid not err when it relied on the IJ's findings.   As required, the\n\nBIA considered the evidence in the record in order to determine\n\nwhether Wang's fear of future persecution was reasonable.    After\n\nexamining the record, the BIA justifiably concluded that the State\n\nDepartment's 2004 Report \"indicates that only social compensation\n\nfees have been levied on unwed mothers and that in some instances\n\nthese fees have been abolished and relaxed in other instances.\"\n\n          Wang also argues that the IJ and BIA erred in not giving\n\ngreater weight to her expressed intentions to have additional\n\nchildren and by dismissing these intentions as \"speculative.\"   She\n\nrelies on the Second Circuit's decision in Lin v. Gonzales, 445\n\nF.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2007), for the proposition that the IJ is\n\nrequired to provide \"specific, cogent reasons for discounting an\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fapplicant's claim [that she plans to have additional children] as\n\nspeculative\" when the asserted fear of persecution is based on the\n\napplicant's intention to have children.              Id. at 136.    We need not\n\ndecide whether Wang's reading of Lin is correct or whether we agree\n\nwith that reading; this principle is not at stake here.\n\n             Neither the IJ nor the BIA dismissed Wang's plans to have\n\nadditional children as speculative.            Rather, both the IJ and BIA\n\nfocused on China's family planning policies and the likelihood they\n\nwould be applied in Wang's particular circumstances.               The IJ said:\n\n\"[I] find that the respondent's testimony concerning wishing to\n\nhave further children if she were to go to China and that she will\n\nbe prohibited from having more children in China because of Chinese\n\ncoercive family planning policy in China, is at best speculative\n\nand based on surmise.\"       Similarly, the BIA determined that \"to the\n\nextent   that      the   respondent   claims       that   she   wishes   to   have\n\nadditional children in the future and that she would be persecuted\n\nin   China   for    such   births,    we    find    the   respondent's    claims\n\nspeculative at present.\"         We understand the IJ and BIA to have\n\nfound that persecution based on additional births was speculative,\n\nnot the births themselves.            Thus, Wang's claim falters on the\n\nobjective prong of the well founded fear of future prosecution\n\nanalysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fB. Withholding of Removal and Convention Against Torture\n\n          Wang, having failed to establish her eligibility for\n\nasylum, necessarily fails in her claim for withholding of removal.\n\nBerrio-Barrera, 460 F.3d at 168; Rodriquez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398\n\nF.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005) (finding that because the burden of\n\nproof necessary to establish an asylum claim is lower than the\n\nburden of proof required to prevail on a withholding of removal\n\nclaim, \"the BIA's rejection of the petitioner's asylum claim, if\n\nsustainable, sounds the death knell for his counterpart claim for\n\nwithholding of removal\").   Similarly, the BIA rightly concluded\n\nthat it had no basis for finding that Wang was eligible for relief\n\nunder the CAT because she had not proven that she was more likely\n\nthan not to be tortured upon being removed to China.   See 8 C.F.R.\n\n1208.16(c); Jiang v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nC. Remanding for Consideration of Changed Circumstances\n\n          In an unusual request, Wang asks in the alternative that\n\nwe remand her case to the BIA for consideration of two Second\n\nCircuit cases that, according to Wang, conclude that parents of\n\nforeign-born children are subject to the same rules as parents of\n\nnative-born children under Chinese family planning policies.2   The\n\ngovernment argues that this request is not properly before us\n\n\n     2\n       Wang cites Guo v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 2006), and\nTin Ming Lin v. United States Dep't of Justice, 473 F.3d 48, 52 (2d\nCir. 2007), as \"new\" evidence in support of her position that\nparents with two or more children are being forcibly sterilized in\nChina irrespective of whether the children are foreign-born.\n\n                               -9-\n\fbecause Wang should have brought before the BIA a motion to reopen\n\npursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2.            Wang does not explain why she did\n\nnot file a motion to reopen with the BIA nor does she support her\n\nunusual request with any developed argument that we have the\n\nauthority to consider on appeal changed circumstances that might be\n\nthe basis for a remand.3          Thus, we deem this argument for a remand\n\nwaived.      Smilow v. Sw. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 2003)(\"Issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner (or not\n\nat all) are waived.\").\n\n                                         III.\n\n                 We   conclude   that   the   BIA   justifiably   denied   Wang's\n\npetitions for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT, and that\n\nWang       has    waived   her    argument      that   we   should   remand   for\n\nconsideration of changed circumstances.\n\n                 Petition denied.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       In Tian Ming Lin, the Second Circuit concluded that \"there\nis no statutory mechanism by which a party may move this Court to\nremand to the BIA . . . . Nonetheless, we believe that we possess\nthe inherent equitable power to remand cases to administrative\nagencies for further proceedings in sufficiently compelling\ncircumstances.\"   473 F.3d at 52.   We take no position on this\nconclusion.\n\n                                         -10-\n\f",

She also requests that we remand the case for reconsideration based on changed country conditions. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Wang was born on February 10, 1974 in Laos and lived there until July 5, 1990, when she arrived in Chicago, Illinois on a tourist visa. On July 5, 1992, Wang received a student visa. As of June 1995, she ceased to be a student but remained in the United States without obtaining a new visa.<sup>[1]</sup> In 2000, Wang received a Notice to Appear alleging that she was removable because she failed to maintain her student status.</p>\n<p>At a hearing in 2005 before an Immigration Judge (IJ), she conceded removability and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the CAT, and, in the alternative, voluntary departure. When Wang declined to designate a country of removal, the IJ designated China  the only country in which Wang has citizenship. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(f). Wang testified that she feared going to China because of its coercive population control measures. Wang already has one daughter  born in 2003 as a United States citizen  and testified that she would like to have more children. She worries that if she were forced to live in China, she would be unable to have more children because of China's \"one-child\" policy.</p>\n<p>Wang submitted evidence to the IJ that included U.S. State Department Reports. These reports characterized Chinese population control policies as restrictive, but also as highly particularized. The 2004 Report, entitled <i>Country Report on Human Rights Practices,</i> noted that enforcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> of the population and family planning laws \"continued to vary from place to place\" and allowed \"eligible couples to apply for permission to have a second child if they met conditions stipulated in local and provincial regulations.\" According to the 2004 Report, physical coercion was formally prohibited as a method of enforcing family planning policies, but economic and social penalties were allowed and frequently used.</p>\n<p>Based on all of the evidence presented, the IJ found that the \"Chinese government does persecute Chinese nationals who break the coercive family planning policy of China by having more than one child without the permission of the Chinese government.\" Yet, the IJ decided that given the particularized nature of these policies, Wang did not demonstrate that she or someone similarly situated would face persecution. The IJ noted that Wang had not shown that with a foreign-born child she would be subject to the one-child policy or that she would be persecuted for being single and having a child.</p>\n<p>The IJ thus concluded that the evidence provided was insufficient to establish that (1) Wang had a well founded fear of persecution, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A), (2) she would be more likely than not to have her life or freedom threatened if she were removed to China, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2), or (3) she would be more likely than not to be tortured by the Chinese government or its agents, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). Accordingly, the IJ denied Wang's petition for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ did, however, grant her request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>In an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Wang argued that the record clearly demonstrated that she would be subject to China's coercive population control measures in spite of her daughter's American citizenship. Wang also asserted that because she is a single woman, she would be even more susceptible to these coercive measures.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision on the ground that Wang has only one child, who was born in the United States, and she therefore would not presently be subject to persecution for having more than one child. The BIA also found that the evidence was insufficient to support Wang's contention that single women are persecuted in China for having children out of wedlock. It further characterized as \"speculative at present\" Wang's claim that she would be persecuted if she had additional children while living in China.</p>\n<p>This petition for review followed. In it, Wang argues that the BIA erred in determining that she did not have the requisite well founded fear of persecution to establish eligibility for asylum. She also claims that the BIA should have found her eligible for withholding of removal and for relief under the CAT. In addition, Wang argues that she is entitled to a remand based on changed conditions in China with respect to foreign-born children. Therefore, she asks us to direct the BIA to consider this new information.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The BIA adopted the IJ's opinion and also addressed the underlying bases for the denial of asylum. We therefore review both the IJ's and BIA's decisions. <i>Ouk v. Gonzales,</i> 464 F.3d 108, 110 (1st Cir.2006)(finding that \"we have authority to review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions\" when the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision). We review legal issues de novo and apply the substantial evidence standard to the factual determinations. <i>Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft,</i> 390 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir.2004). Under the highly deferential substantial evidence standard, we consider whether the agency's ruling is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Lopez de Hincapie v. Gonzales,</i> 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We will not upset the BIA's determination unless the record compels the contrary conclusion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>A. Asylum</p>\n<p>To qualify for asylum, an alien needs to demonstrate that she is a refugee by virtue of her previous persecution or her well founded fear of future persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); <i>Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales,</i> 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir.2006). We need not discuss the standard for a finding of past persecution because Wang makes no such claim. With regard to a fear of future persecution, the applicant must demonstrate that she objectively has a well founded fear of persecution on a protected ground and that this fear is genuine. <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir.1999)(proving the objective and subjective components of a well founded fear of future persecution requires the petitioner to show her fear is \"both genuine and objectively reasonable\"). Fear of forced abortion or sterilization is categorized as fear of persecution on account of political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(\"A person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo [a forced abortion or sterilization] procedure or [is] subject to persecution for failure, refusal, or resistance [to undergoing such a procedure] shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.\"); <i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> 475 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Wang contends that the BIA erred by relying on the IJ's determination that her fear of persecution was unreasonable solely because she had not been subject to past persecution. The IJ did not base its decision exclusively on the determination that Wang had not been subject to past persecution and, therefore, the BIA did not err when it relied on the IJ's findings. As required, the BIA considered the evidence in the record in order to determine whether Wang's fear of future persecution was reasonable. After examining the record, the BIA justifiably concluded that the State Department's 2004 Report \"indicates that only social compensation fees have been levied on unwed mothers and that in some instances these fees have been abolished and relaxed in other instances.\"</p>\n<p>Wang also argues that the IJ and BIA erred in not giving greater weight to her expressed intentions to have additional children and by dismissing these intentions as \"speculative.\" She relies on the Second Circuit's decision in <i>Lin v. Gonzales,</i> 445 F.3d 127 (2d Cir.2007), for the proposition that the IJ is required to provide \"specific, cogent reasons for discounting an applicant's claim [that she plans to have additional children] as speculative\" when the asserted fear of persecution is based on the applicant's intention to have children. <i>Id.</i> at 136. We need not decide whether Wang's reading of <i>Lin</i> is correct or whether we agree with that reading; this principle is not at stake here.</p>\n<p>Neither the IJ nor the BIA dismissed Wang's plans to have additional children as speculative. Rather, both the IJ and BIA focused on China's family planning policies and the likelihood they would be applied in Wang's particular circumstances. The IJ said: \"[I] find that the respondent's testimony concerning wishing to have further <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> children if she were to go to China and that she will be prohibited from having more children in China because of Chinese coercive family planning policy in China, is at best speculative and based on surmise.\" Similarly, the BIA determined that \"to the extent that the respondent claims that she wishes to have additional children in the future and that she would be persecuted in China for such births, we find the respondent's claims speculative at present.\" We understand the IJ and BIA to have found that persecution based on additional births was speculative, not the births themselves. Thus, Wang's claim falters on the objective prong of the well founded fear of future prosecution analysis.</p>\n<p>B. Withholding of Removal and Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p>Wang, having failed to establish her eligibility for asylum, necessarily fails in her claim for withholding of removal. <i>Berrio-Barrera,</i> 460 F.3d at 168; <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir.2005) (finding that because the burden of proof necessary to establish an asylum claim is lower than the burden of proof required to prevail on a withholding of removal claim, \"the BIA's rejection of the petitioner's asylum claim, if sustainable, sounds the death knell for his counterpart claim for withholding of removal\"). Similarly, the BIA rightly concluded that it had no basis for finding that Wang was eligible for relief under the CAT because she had not proven that she was more likely than not to be tortured upon being removed to China. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. 1208.16(c); <i>Jiang v. Gonzales,</i> 474 F.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>C. Remanding for Consideration of Changed Circumstances</p>\n<p>In an unusual request, Wang asks in the alternative that we remand her case to the BIA for consideration of two Second Circuit cases that, according to Wang, conclude that parents of foreign-born children are subject to the same rules as parents of native-born children under Chinese family planning policies.<sup>[2]</sup> The government argues that this request is not properly before us because Wang should have brought before the BIA a motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. Wang does not explain why she did not file a motion to reopen with the BIA nor does she support her unusual request with any developed argument that we have the authority to consider on appeal changed circumstances that might be the basis for a remand.<sup>[3]</sup> Thus, we deem this argument for a remand waived. <i>Smilow v. Sw. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> 323 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir.2003)(\"Issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner (or not at all) are waived.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We conclude that the BIA justifiably denied Wang's petitions for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT, and that Wang has waived her argument that we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> should remand for consideration of changed circumstances.</p>\n<p>Petition denied.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed.

She also requests that we remand the case for reconsideration based on changed country conditions. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Wang was born on February 10, 1974 in Laos and lived there until July 5, 1990, when she arrived in Chicago, Illinois on a tourist visa. On July 5, 1992, Wang received a student visa. As of June 1995, she ceased to be a student but remained in the United States without obtaining a new visa.<sup>[1]</sup> In 2000, Wang received a Notice to Appear alleging that she was removable because she failed to maintain her student status.</p>\n<p>At a hearing in 2005 before an Immigration Judge (IJ), she conceded removability and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the CAT, and, in the alternative, voluntary departure. When Wang declined to designate a country of removal, the IJ designated China  the only country in which Wang has citizenship. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(f). Wang testified that she feared going to China because of its coercive population control measures. Wang already has one daughter  born in 2003 as a United States citizen  and testified that she would like to have more children. She worries that if she were forced to live in China, she would be unable to have more children because of China's \"one-child\" policy.</p>\n<p>Wang submitted evidence to the IJ that included U.S. State Department Reports. These reports characterized Chinese population control policies as restrictive, but also as highly particularized. The 2004 Report, entitled <i>Country Report on Human Rights Practices,</i> noted that enforcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> of the population and family planning laws \"continued to vary from place to place\" and allowed \"eligible couples to apply for permission to have a second child if they met conditions stipulated in local and provincial regulations.\" According to the 2004 Report, physical coercion was formally prohibited as a method of enforcing family planning policies, but economic and social penalties were allowed and frequently used.</p>\n<p>Based on all of the evidence presented, the IJ found that the \"Chinese government does persecute Chinese nationals who break the coercive family planning policy of China by having more than one child without the permission of the Chinese government.\" Yet, the IJ decided that given the particularized nature of these policies, Wang did not demonstrate that she or someone similarly situated would face persecution. The IJ noted that Wang had not shown that with a foreign-born child she would be subject to the one-child policy or that she would be persecuted for being single and having a child.</p>\n<p>The IJ thus concluded that the evidence provided was insufficient to establish that (1) Wang had a well founded fear of persecution, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A), (2) she would be more likely than not to have her life or freedom threatened if she were removed to China, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2), or (3) she would be more likely than not to be tortured by the Chinese government or its agents, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). Accordingly, the IJ denied Wang's petition for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ did, however, grant her request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>In an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Wang argued that the record clearly demonstrated that she would be subject to China's coercive population control measures in spite of her daughter's American citizenship. Wang also asserted that because she is a single woman, she would be even more susceptible to these coercive measures.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision on the ground that Wang has only one child, who was born in the United States, and she therefore would not presently be subject to persecution for having more than one child. The BIA also found that the evidence was insufficient to support Wang's contention that single women are persecuted in China for having children out of wedlock. It further characterized as \"speculative at present\" Wang's claim that she would be persecuted if she had additional children while living in China.</p>\n<p>This petition for review followed. In it, Wang argues that the BIA erred in determining that she did not have the requisite well founded fear of persecution to establish eligibility for asylum. She also claims that the BIA should have found her eligible for withholding of removal and for relief under the CAT. In addition, Wang argues that she is entitled to a remand based on changed conditions in China with respect to foreign-born children. Therefore, she asks us to direct the BIA to consider this new information.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The BIA adopted the IJ's opinion and also addressed the underlying bases for the denial of asylum. We therefore review both the IJ's and BIA's decisions. <i>Ouk v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202443\"><a href=\"/opinion/202443/ouk-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.2006)(finding that \"we have authority to review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions\" when the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision). We review legal issues de novo and apply the substantial evidence standard to the factual determinations. <i>Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft,</i> 390 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir.2004). Under the highly deferential substantial evidence standard, we consider whether the agency's ruling is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Lopez de Hincapie v.

Asylum</p>\n<p>To qualify for asylum, an alien needs to demonstrate that she is a refugee by virtue of her previous persecution or her well founded fear of future persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); <i>Berrio-Barrera v.

We need not discuss the standard for a finding of past persecution because Wang makes no such claim. With regard to a fear of future persecution, the applicant must demonstrate that she objectively has a well founded fear of persecution on a protected ground and that this fear is genuine. <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.1999)(proving the objective and subjective components of a well founded fear of future persecution requires the petitioner to show her fear is \"both genuine and objectively reasonable\"). Fear of forced abortion or sterilization is categorized as fear of persecution on account of political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(\"A person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo [a forced abortion or sterilization] procedure or [is] subject to persecution for failure, refusal, or resistance [to undergoing such a procedure] shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.\"); <i>Zheng v.
