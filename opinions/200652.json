Daniel Richard Howard petitions this court\n\nfor review of an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n(\"SEC\") sustaining a disciplinary action taken against him by the\n\nNational Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (\"NASD\"). We have\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. ยง 78y.       The SEC's findings as to\n\nthe facts are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. ยง\n\n78y(4). \"[This court's] function is not to independently weigh the\n\nfacts . . . . Rather, after reviewing the record considered as a\n\nwhole, including the evidence opposed to the S.E.C. view, [it is]\n\nto determine whether substantial evidence supports the Commission's\n\ndecision.\" Todd & Co., Inc. v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n, 557\n\nF.2d 1008, 1013 (3d Cir. 1977).\n\n          Following   a   two-day    hearing,   a   NASD   Hearing   Panel\n\ndetermined that Howard had violated NASD Conduct Rules 2110 and\n\n2310, by making unsuitable recommendations for the purchase and\n\nsale of speculative securities to an elderly customer and filing an\n\ninaccurate Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration\n\nForm (Form U-4), falsely denying that he was the subject of a NASD\n\ninvestigation.1   The findings were affirmed by the NASD National\n\n\n     1\n       NASD Conduct Rule 2110 provides as follows:\n          A member, in the conduct of his business, shall\n     observe high standards of commercial honor and just and\n     equitable principles of trade.\n\n     NASD Conduct Rule 2310 provides, in relevant part, as\n     follows:\n          (a) In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale\n     or exchange of any security, a member shall have\n\n                                    -2-\n\fAdjudicatory Council (\"NAC\") and Howard was fined $25,000 and\n\nsuspended from NASD for two years.         Based upon an independent\n\nreview of the record, the SEC affirmed NASD's disciplinary action.\n\nSee In re: Daniel Richard Howard, Securities Exchange Act Rel. No.\n\n46269, 78 SEC Docket 427, 2002 SEC Lexis 1909 (July 26, 2002).      The\n\nSEC   denied   Howard's   motion   for   reconsideration   and   Howard\n\npetitioned this court for review of the SEC's decision.\n\n           In his pro se brief submitted in support of his petition,\n\nHoward focuses almost exclusively on a series of procedural claims\n\nfound by the NAC and the SEC to be entirely without merit.          His\n\nsole reference to the merits of the rule violations is as follows:\n\n\"Petitioner denies each and every allegation of unsuitability and\n\nchurning and denies falsifying his U-4.\"        By failing to make a\n\ndeveloped argument, Howard has waived any objection to the SEC's\n\nfindings on the merits. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that arguments that are undeveloped\n\non appeal are deemed waived).\n\n           Even if there had not been a waiver, however, there is\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the SEC's findings.         The SEC's\n\nfindings that Howard's recommendations to his elderly customer,\n\n\n      reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation\n      is suitable for such customer upon the basis of the\n      facts, if any, disclosed by such customer as to his other\n      security holdings and as to his financial situation and\n      needs.\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fJohn B. Meeker, were unsuitable are supported by substantial\n\nevidence.     The    actual   trading   activity   is   undisputed.     The\n\ncharacterization of the recommended securities as \"speculative\" is\n\nsupported by research reports prepared by H.J. Meyers & Co., Inc.\n\n(\"H.J. Meyers\") (where Howard was employed as a general securities\n\nrepresentative during the relevant period) and by SEC filings, as\n\ninterpreted by a NASD investigator.        Howard himself characterized\n\nthe Meeker account as \"speculative\" in his testimony at the hearing\n\nbefore the NASD panel.        The SEC's findings about the level of\n\ntrading activity are also supported by the record.           And the case\n\nlaw supports the SEC's characterization of these turnover rates and\n\ncost-to-equity ratios as reflecting excessive trading.          See In re\n\nPeter C. Bucchieri, 52 S.E.C. 800, 805 (1996).\n\n            The record as a whole also supports the SEC's finding\n\nthat \"Meeker was an elderly man in poor health whose primary need\n\nwas additional income and who sought investments that carried\n\nminimum risk.\"      In re Howard, 2002 SEC Lexis 1909, at *5.         Given\n\nthese facts known to Howard, substantial evidence supports the\n\nSEC's conclusion that \"both the nature of the securities that\n\nHoward recommended to Meeker and the level of trading activity were\n\nunsuitable,\" in violation of NASD Conduct Rules 2110 and 2310.\n\nId., at *9.\n\n            Similarly, there is substantial support in the record for\n\nthe SEC's finding that Howard violated Conduct Rule 2110 by filing\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fan   inaccurate   U-4   form   and    failing   to   amend    it   thereafter.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC found that Howard admitted that he had\n\nreceived NASD's letter of October 15, 1998, informing him of his\n\nobligation to disclose NASD's pending investigation in his Form U-4\n\nwhen answering Question 22I.         In re Howard, 2002 SEC Lexis 1909, at\n\n*11. It further found that after Howard joined Moors & Cabot, Inc.\n\nin October 1998, the firm filed a Form U-4 on his behalf, which\n\nHoward signed, that gave a negative answer to Question 22I.                Id.\n\nThe SEC found that \"Howard did not amend his Form U-4 to correct\n\nthat misstatement.\"     Id.    The SEC's conclusion that it was \"clear\n\nthat Howard was responsible for the false statement on his Form U-\n\n4,\" id., at *12, is supported by substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord.   The case law supports the conclusion that such conduct\n\nviolates \"just and equitable principles of trade.\"                  See In re\n\nThomas R. Alton, 52 S.E.C. 380, 382 (1995);                  In re Robert E.\n\nKauffman, 51 S.E.C. 838, 839 (1993).\n\n           With respect to Howard's procedural claims, substantial\n\nevidence in the record also supports the SEC's findings as to those\n\nclaims.   For the reasons articulated by the SEC, we agree with its\n\nconclusion that the procedural claims are without merit.              Howard's\n\ncentral claim in his petition to this court is that he was the\n\nvictim of selective prosecution by NASD because he is Hispanic and\n\n\"fall[s] outside t[he] preferred ethnic group\" of the NASD and the\n\nSEC. A successful selective prosecution claim would require Howard\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fto   show that he \"'was prosecuted while others similarly situated\n\nwere not'\" and \"that the government's prosecution was in bad\n\nfaith.\"   United States v. Peterson, 233 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (citation omitted).   Howard identified two non-Hispanic H.J.\n\nMeyers brokers who were investigated by NASD because of customer\n\ncomplaints and as to whom NASD had determined that \"no action is\n\nwarranted.\"    This alone is not sufficient to show that the other\n\nnon-Hispanic   brokers   were   \"similarly   situated\"   to   Howard   for\n\npurposes of his selective prosecution claim.        We agree with the\n\nSEC's determination that there is insufficient support in the\n\nrecord to substantiate Howard's claims that the NASD attorney\n\nvoiced racial or religious slurs and insults.       The SEC's findings\n\nthat Howard's procedural claims are without merit are substantially\n\nsupported by the record.\n\n           The SEC's opinion dated July 26, 2002, sustaining the\n\nNASD's findings of conduct rule violations and the sanctions\n\nimposed, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
