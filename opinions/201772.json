Mark L. Wolf,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin Chief Judge,\n                Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Michael R. Schneider, Ryan M. Schiff, and Salsberg & Schneider\non brief for appellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Patrick M.\nHamilton, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                           August 17, 2005\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.         Defendant-appellant José Guzmán\n\nasserts that the Supreme Court's decision in United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), entitles him to resentencing under\n\nnon-mandatory sentencing guidelines.           Employing the plain error\n\nanalysis applicable to unpreserved claims of Booker error, we\n\nconclude   that   the   appellant   suffered    no   cognizable   prejudice\n\nresulting from the application of a mandatory guidelines system.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm his sentence.\n\n                                    I.\n\n                               Background\n\n           On November 10, 1994, a federal grand jury handed up a\n\nmulti-count indictment charging the appellant with one count of\n\nconspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute, seven\n\ncounts of possessing with intent to distribute, distributing, and\n\naiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine base, and one count\n\nof conspiracy to acquire firearms in exchange for illegal drugs.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 371.                These\n\ncharges stemmed from the appellant's alleged participation, with\n\nfour codefendants, in       the sale of crack cocaine to undercover\n\nofficers on eleven separate occasions and the coconspirators' plan\n\nto acquire weapons from those officers in exchange for drugs.\n\n           After negotiating a plea agreement, the appellant pleaded\n\nguilty to all counts.      The district court convened a disposition\n\nhearing on February 9, 1996, and sentenced the appellant to a 240-\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmonth incarcerative term (a term that was within the applicable\n\nguideline sentencing range of 210 to 262 months).                   The appellant\n\nchallenged that sentence but, after some procedural skirmishing\n\n(not relevant here), a panel of this court affirmed it.                      United\n\nStates v. Guzmán, 132 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 1997) (unpublished table\n\ndecision).\n\n             On   October    7,    1998,    the    appellant   filed     a   habeas\n\npetition, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255, in which he claimed, among other\n\nthings, that his sentence had been illegally imposed. The district\n\ncourt wisely appointed counsel, who filed an amended section 2255\n\npetition. On June 4, 2002, the court granted the amended petition;\n\nit found that defense counsel's failure at sentencing to present\n\nhumanizing evidence and to argue for a sentence at the low end of\n\nthe guideline sentencing range constituted ineffective assistance.\n\nSee Guzmán v. United States, No. 98-12086, slip op. at 1 (D. Mass.\n\nJune 4, 2004) (unpublished).              Accordingly, the court vacated the\n\nappellant's sentence.\n\n             The district court convened a new sentencing hearing on\n\nJune   18,   2004.     This       time,    the    court   imposed    a   210-month\n\nincarcerative term.         That term was at the nadir of the guideline\n\nsentencing range.      This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f                                II.\n\n                              Analysis\n\n            In this venue, the appellant challenges his 210-month\n\nsentence.     This challenge devolves from Booker, in which the\n\nSupreme Court held that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to\n\ntrial by jury is violated when his sentence is imposed under a\n\nmandatory guidelines system that gives decretory significance to\n\njudge-found facts.   125 S. Ct. at 756.   The appellant argues that\n\nbecause he was resentenced prior to the Booker decision and under\n\nthe mandatory guidelines system then in effect, his sentence is\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n            The appellant did not make anything resembling a Sixth\n\nAmendment objection at the time of his resentencing, so his claim\n\nof error is unpreserved. The appellant concedes that point, but he\n\nmounts an aggressive attack on this court's standard of review for\n\nunpreserved claims of Booker error.   In the course of   that attack,\n\nhe maintains both that the articulation of the plain error test, as\n\nset forth in United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), and its progeny, should not apply to him and that, in\n\nall events, the application of that test violates due process.    In\n\nhis view, we ought to abandon Antonakopoulos and instead adopt one\n\nof two alternate approaches.     We first repulse the appellant's\n\nassault on Antonakopoulos and then, applying our wonted standard of\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\freview, determine whether he is entitled to the relief that he\n\nseeks.\n\n                                  A.\n\n                        Standard of Review\n\n          Where, as here, a claim of Booker error has not been\n\npreserved, it is deemed forfeited and we must apply the plain error\n\nstandard, as articulated in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n732 (1993).     See Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 745; United States v.\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 223-24 (1st Cir. 2005).        In order to\n\nestablish entitlement to relief under that stringent test, an\n\nappellant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear\n\nor obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial\n\nrights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"       United States v.\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          In Antonakopoulos, this court addressed the application\n\nof the plain error test in the context of unpreserved claims of\n\nBooker error.   399 F.3d at 75.    We explained that a Booker error\n\noccurs not when the judge finds facts necessary to the sentencing\n\ndetermination but, rather, when the defendant is sentenced under a\n\nmandatory guidelines system that gives decretory significance to\n\njudge-found facts. Id. Thus, in the hindsight provided by Booker,\n\nthe first two prongs of the plain error test are met when the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fdefendant shows that the sentencing court treated the guidelines as\n\nmandatory rather than advisory.         Id.\n\n          With    respect    to   the    third   plain   error   prong,    the\n\ndefendant bears the burden of showing that, had the error not\n\noccurred, there is a \"reasonable probability\" that he would have\n\nreceived a lesser sentence.             Id.   Under that standard, \"the\n\nprobability of a different result is sufficient to undermine\n\nconfidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\"            Id. at 78 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 124 S. Ct. 2333, 2340 (2004)).\n\nThis means that the defendant must persuade the court that were it\n\nnot for the then-mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines, it\n\nis reasonably likely that the district court would have imposed a\n\nmore lenient sentence.\n\n          The appellant makes a twofold rejoinder to this format.\n\nFirst, even though he did not preserve his claim of Booker error,\n\nhe nonetheless asseverates that the Duarte plain error test,\n\nadopted in Antonakopoulos, should not apply to his case because he\n\ncould not reasonably have anticipated the \"dramatic transformation\n\nin   sentencing    law\"     wrought      by   Booker.      Requiring      such\n\n\"clairvoyance,\" the appellant says, violates his due process rights\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment.\n\n          We reject these importunings.            As a general rule, \"a\n\ncriminal defendant must seasonably advance an objection to a\n\npotential constitutional infirmity in order to preserve the point.\"\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fDerman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir. 2002).     While a\n\nnarrow exception to this principle applies where \"objections or\n\ndefenses . . . were not known to be available at the time they\n\ncould first have been made,\" Bennett v. City of Holyoke, 362 F.3d\n\n1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), that\n\nexception is pertinent only if \"(i) at the time of the procedural\n\ndefault, a prior authoritative decision indicated that the defense\n\nwas unavailable, and (ii) the defense became available thereafter\n\nby way of supervening authority.\"     Id.   Alternatively stated, the\n\nexception applies only when the futility of raising an objection or\n\ndefense was unequivocally apparent at the time in question.\n\n           That is clearly not the case here.     At the time of the\n\nappellant's resentencing, the constitutionality of the sentencing\n\nguidelines was a hot-button issue in criminal law circles.       The\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466,\n\n490 (2000), had paved the way for a Sixth Amendment challenge to\n\nthe federal sentencing guidelines.      Moreover, a closely related\n\nissue, involving state sentencing guidelines, was pending before\n\nthe Supreme Court — an issue that the Court resolved, favorably to\n\nthe defendant, in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).     The\n\nbottom line is that, at the time the district court resentenced the\n\nappellant, the constitutionality of the guidelines was very much in\n\nplay.   Under these circumstances, there is no principled basis for\n\nexcusing the appellant's procedural default.     See United States v.\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fDel Rosario, 388 F.3d 1, 13-14 & n.8 (1st Cir. 2004) (rebuffing a\n\nsimilar argument).\n\n           The second facet of the appellant's rejoinder is equally\n\nunavailing.   He entreats us to modify our approach to forfeited\n\nerrors in the Booker context and adopt either the presumption-of-\n\nprejudice approach, see United States v. Barnett, 398 F.3d 516,\n\n526-28 (6th Cir. 2005), or the automatic-remand approach, see\n\nUnited States v. Crosby, 397 F.3d 103, 117-18 (2d Cir. 2005).           We\n\ndecline this invitation.\n\n           We recognize that the courts of appeals have taken a\n\nvariety of approaches to the treatment of unpreserved claims of\n\nBooker error. In a multi-panel circuit, however, newly constituted\n\npanels ordinarily are constrained by prior panel decisions directly\n\n(or even closely) on point.     See Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386\n\nF.3d 344, 349-50 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing the law-of-the circuit\n\ndoctrine); United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (similar).    So it is here:   we are firmly bound by this\n\ncourt's prior panel opinions, such as Heldeman and Antonakopoulos.\n\n           To be sure, there are two narrow exceptions to this\n\niteration of the law-of-the-circuit principle.      Under the first of\n\nthese exceptions, \"[a]n existing panel decision may be undermined\n\nby   controlling   authority,   subsequently   announced,   such   as   an\n\nopinion of the Supreme Court, an en banc opinion of the circuit\n\ncourt, or a statutory overruling.\"      Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995).                Under the second exception,\n\nwhich operates in instances that fairly may be described as hen's-\n\nteeth   rare,     authority    that    postdates      the   original   decision,\n\nalthough    not   directly     controlling,       may   nevertheless      offer   a\n\ncompelling reason for believing that the former panel, in light of\n\nnew developments, would change its collective mind.                       See id.\n\nNeither of these exceptions is apposite here. See United States v.\n\nVillafane-Jimenez, 410 F.3d 74, 85 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam)\n\n(rejecting a similar entreaty to revisit Antonakopoulos); United\n\nStates v. Bailey, 405 F.3d 102, 114 (1st Cir. 2005) (same).                 Thus,\n\nthere is no justification for this panel to reconsider the recent\n\ndecisions in the Heldeman-Antonakopoulos line of cases.\n\n                               B.     The Merits.\n\n            Because a forfeited Booker error engenders review for\n\nplain error, the four-part Duarte test applies.               See United States\n\nv.   González-Mercado,        402     F.3d     294,   302   (1st   Cir.    2005);\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.              The Booker error that transpired\n\nhere constitutes a clear and obvious sentencing error; thus, the\n\nfirst two prongs of the plain error test are satisfied.                See United\n\nStates v. Martins, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2005) [No. 04-1474,\n\nslip op. at 26]; Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.\n\n            Turning to the third prong, we must inquire whether the\n\nappellant   has    pointed    to    circumstances       creating   a   reasonable\n\nprobability that the district court would have levied a more\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\flenient sentence had it not been constrained by the then-mandatory\n\nguidelines system.       We have said that we will not be overly\n\nstringent in assessing a defendant's attempt to make that showing.\n\nSee Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224.    Still, the defendant must point to\n\nsomething concrete, whether or not in the sentencing record itself,\n\nthat provides a plausible basis for such a finding.1\n\n             The appellant essays two arguments in support of a\n\nfinding of prejudice.     He first notes that a district court, post-\n\nBooker, is required to account for all the factors enumerated in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a).2    See Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 764-67.   Building on\n\n\n     1\n      The government relies heavily on the district court's remarks\nat the original sentencing (in 1996) to reflect the court's\nattitude (and, thus, the likelihood of a lower sentence).        In\nordinary circumstances, that information would be relevant. Here,\nhowever, the district court subsequently found that the appellant's\ncounsel at the original sentencing hearing was constitutionally\nineffective in presenting the appellant's side of the story. See\nGuzmán, No. 98-12086, slip op. at 1. Because the court's ability\nto assess the situation was compromised at that time, we think that\nthe course of prudence is to refrain from attributing any\nsignificance to the court's 1996 comments.\n     2\n         These factors include:\n\n     (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the\n     history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the\n     need for the sentence imposed — (A) to reflect the\n     seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the\n     law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B)\n     to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to\n     protect the public from further crimes of the defendant;\n     and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational\n     or   vocational   training,  medical   care,   or   other\n     correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3)\n     the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of\n     sentence and the sentencing range established for — (A)\n     the applicable category of offense committed by the\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthis foundation, he posits that his sentence \"would have looked\n\nquite different\" had this been done.\n\n            This argument misapprehends a defendant's burden on plain\n\nerror review.     It is not enough for a defendant to show that he was\n\nnot given the benefit of a sentence fashioned under advisory\n\nguidelines; rather, he must offer some reasonable indication that\n\nthe sentencing court, freed of the shackles forged by mandatory\n\nguidelines, would have fashioned a more favorable sentence.              See\n\nHeldeman,   402   F.3d   at   224;   Antonakopoulos,   399   F.3d   at   75.\n\nTherefore, the inherent uncertainty about how the sentencing court\n\nwould have exercised its newfound discretion when weighing the\n\nsection 3553(a) factors under an advisory guidelines system is not\n\nenough to enable a defendant to carry his burden.\n\n            That reality disposes of the appellant's argument. While\n\nhe describes at some length the vistas that the district court is\n\nnow permitted to explore, he points to no specific circumstances\n\nsignaling that the court's deliberations with respect to the\n\nsection 3553(a) factors would likely have yielded a lower sentence.\n\nThus, his argument falls short of passing the third prong of the\n\nplain error test.\n\n\n     applicable category of defendant as set forth in the\n     guidelines . . .; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted\n     sentence disparities among defendants with similar\n     records . . .; and (7) the need to provide restitution to\n     any victims of the offense.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n                                     -11-\n\f           The appellant next contends that had the district court\n\nsentenced him     under an advisory guidelines system, it probably\n\nwould have given him a lower sentence based on the poverty and the\n\ndifficulties with cultural assimilation that he faced as a child,\n\nhis current family circumstances, and the likelihood that he will\n\nbe deported upon the completion of his sentence.             In support of\n\nthis contention, the appellant cites the fact that the district\n\ncourt sentenced him at the bottom of the applicable guideline range\n\nand argues that the court might have granted a further reduction\n\nhad it not been constrained by a mandatory guidelines system.\n\n           The fact that the district court imposed a sentence at\n\nthe bottom of the guideline sentencing range, standing alone, does\n\nnot give rise to a reasonable probability that, under advisory\n\nguidelines, it would have imposed a sentence lower than what the\n\nguidelines prescribed.      See United States v. Figuereo, 404 F.3d\n\n537, 542 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Cacho-Bonilla, 404 F.3d\n\n84, 95 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d\n\n50, 55 (1st Cir. 2005).     A defendant who is sentenced at the bottom\n\nof the guideline range must show some additional basis for a\n\nfinding   that   the   district   court   would   have   been   inclined   to\n\ndisregard the range and sentence below it.         See Figuereo, 404 F.3d\n\nat 542; Serrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d at 55.\n\n           The appellant has failed to make such a showing.                He\n\nalludes several times to a comment made by the district court\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fduring the resentencing, but that comment is ambiguous at best.3\n\nWhile the appellant reads this statement to indicate the court's\n\nview       that    the    drug   laws   are   the   source    of   \"terrible    human\n\nconsequences\" and to signal the court's sympathy for the fact that\n\nthe appellant will spend so much time apart from his family, an\n\nequally plausible interpretation is that the court was expressing\n\nits belief that \"terrible human consequences\" result from \"people\n\nin this country dealing drugs\" (such as the appellant).                        In all\n\nevents,       this       generalized,    matter-of-fact      statement   about    the\n\nconsequences of drug crimes does not indicate that the court felt\n\nthat       the     appellant,    given    his     individualized    circumstances,\n\ndeserved a lesser sentence.                Thus, we cannot conclude that the\n\nstatement furnishes the missing link and gives rise to a reasonable\n\nprobability that the district court, under an advisory guidelines\n\nsystem, would have been inclined to impose a more lenient sentence.\n\n                  To cinch matters, we note that the court's statements in\n\nrefusing to grant the appellant's requests for downward departures\n\nat the time of resentencing are suggestive of the fact that the\n\ncourt deemed the case quite ordinary. Referring to the appellant's\n\n\n\n       3\n           The court stated:\n\n            Of course, none of us would be here if you hadn't\n       been in this country dealing drugs, and the drug laws in\n       this country provide for long sentences in cases like\n       yours, and it does have terrible human consequences. I\n       know that you really do miss all those people, including\n       those that you mentioned today.\n\n                                           -13-\n\ffamilial    circumstances,      the   court   stated    that   there    was    \"no\n\nevidence supporting the claim that his family relationship [was]\n\nunique or extraordinary.\"        Guzmán, No. 98-12086, slip op. at 43.\n\nThe court further found the appellant's arguments relating to the\n\ndifficulties of cultural assimilation to be utterly unpersuasive.\n\nId. at 44.     And, finally, the court discerned nothing about the\n\nappellant's     forecasted      deportation      that    would   \"take        [the\n\nappellant's] situation outside of the ordinary.\"                  Id.        These\n\nresponses     indicate   that     the   court    was    not    moved    by     the\n\ncircumstances of the case and strongly suggest that the court would\n\nhave had little inclination to reduce the 210-month sentence.                  See\n\nMartins, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 26-27].\n\n            To sum up, the appellant committed a serious offense.\n\nThe record indicates that he was at ease in his role as a drug\n\ndealer who peddled substantial volumes of crack cocaine.                There is\n\nnothing in the record to suggest any hesitation or discomfiture on\n\nthe district court's part in meting out a 210-month sentence.                  It\n\nfollows that the appellant has failed to carry his burden of\n\nshowing prejudice tied to the use of a mandatory guidelines regime.\n\n            We need go no further.           Our standard plain error test\n\napplies to the appellant's unpreserved claim of Booker error.\n\nBecause the appellant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability\n\nthat he would have received a lower sentence under an advisory\n\nguidelines system, he fails that test.\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fThe appellant's sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                    -15-\n\f",

Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), entitles him to resentencing under non-mandatory sentencing guidelines. Employing the plain error analysis applicable to unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error, we conclude that the appellant suffered no cognizable prejudice resulting from the application of a mandatory guidelines system. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 10, 1994, a federal grand jury handed up a multi-count indictment charging the appellant with one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute, seven counts of possessing with intent to distribute, distributing, and aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine base, and one count of conspiracy to acquire firearms in exchange for illegal drugs. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 371. These charges stemmed from the appellant's alleged participation, with four codefendants, in the sale of crack cocaine to undercover officers on eleven separate occasions and the coconspirators' plan to acquire weapons from those officers in exchange for drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After negotiating a plea agreement, the appellant pleaded guilty to all counts. The district court convened a disposition hearing on February 9, 1996, and sentenced the appellant to a 240-month incarcerative term (a term that was within the applicable guideline sentencing range of 210 to 262 months). The appellant challenged that sentence but, after some procedural skirmishing (not relevant here), a panel of this court affirmed it. <i>United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> 132 F.3d 31 (1st Cir.1997) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 7, 1998, the appellant filed a habeas petition, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, in which he claimed, among other things, that his sentence had been illegally imposed. The district court wisely appointed counsel, who filed an amended section 2255 petition. On June 4, 2002, the court granted the amended petition; it found that defense counsel's failure at sentencing to present humanizing evidence and to argue for a sentence at the low end of the guideline sentencing range constituted ineffective assistance. <i>See Guzm&#225;n v. United States,</i> No. 98-12086, slip op. at 1 (D. Mass. June 4, 2004) (unpublished). Accordingly, the court vacated the appellant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened a new sentencing hearing on June 18, 2004. This time, the court imposed a 210-month incarcerative term. That term was at the nadir of the guideline sentencing range. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant challenges his 210-month sentence. This challenge devolves from <i>Booker,</i> in which the Supreme Court held that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated when his sentence is imposed under a mandatory guidelines system that gives decretory significance to judge-found facts. 125 S.Ct. at 756. The appellant argues that because he was resentenced prior to the <i>Booker</i> decision and under the mandatory guidelines system then in effect, his sentence is unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant did not make anything resembling a Sixth Amendment objection at the time of his resentencing, so his claim of error is unpreserved. The appellant concedes that point, but he mounts an aggressive attack on this court's standard of review for unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error. In the course of that attack, he maintains both that the articulation of the plain error test, as set forth in <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005), and its progeny, should not apply to him and that, in all events, the application of that test violates due process. In his view, we ought to abandon <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and instead adopt one of two alternate approaches. We first repulse the appellant's assault on <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and then, applying our wonted standard of review, determine whether he is entitled to the relief that he seeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a claim of <i>Booker</i> error has not been preserved, it is deemed forfeited and we must apply the plain error standard, as articulated in <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 745; <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 223-24 (1st Cir.2005). In order to establish entitlement to relief under that stringent test, an appellant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> this court addressed the application of the plain error test in the context of unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error. 399 F.3d at 75. We explained that a <i>Booker</i> error occurs not when the judge finds facts necessary to the sentencing determination but, rather, when the defendant is sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system that gives decretory significance to judge-found facts. <i>Id.</i> Thus, in the hindsight provided by <i>Booker,</i> the first two prongs of the plain error test are met when the defendant shows that the sentencing court treated the guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the third plain error prong, the defendant bears the burden of showing that, had the error not occurred, there is a \"reasonable probability\" that he would have received a lesser sentence. <i>Id.</i> Under that standard, \"the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 78 (quoting <i>United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. 74, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004)). This means that the defendant must persuade the court that were it not for the then-mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines, it is reasonably likely that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant makes a twofold rejoinder to this format. First, even though he did not preserve his claim of <i>Booker</i> error, he nonetheless asseverates that the <i>Duarte</i> plain error test, adopted in <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> should not apply to his case because he could not reasonably have anticipated the \"dramatic transformation in sentencing law\" wrought by <i>Booker.</i> Requiring such \"clairvoyance,\" the appellant says, violates his due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject these importunings. As a general rule, \"a criminal defendant must seasonably advance an objection to a potential constitutional infirmity in order to preserve the point.\" <i>Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.2002). While a narrow exception to this principle applies where \"objections or defenses ... were not known to be available at the time they could first have been made,\" <i>Bennett v. City of Holyoke,</i> 362 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), that exception is pertinent only if \"(i) at the time of the procedural default, a prior authoritative decision indicated that the defense was unavailable, and (ii) the defense became available thereafter by way of supervening authority.\" <i>Id.</i> Alternatively stated, the exception applies only when the futility of raising an objection or defense was unequivocally apparent at the time in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is clearly not the case here. At the time of the appellant's resentencing, the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines was a hot-button issue in criminal law circles. The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), had paved the way for a Sixth Amendment challenge to the federal sentencing guidelines. Moreover, a closely related issue, involving state sentencing guidelines, was pending before the Supreme Court &#8212; an issue that the Court resolved, favorably to the defendant, in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The bottom line is that, at the time the district court resentenced the appellant, the constitutionality of the guidelines was very much in play. Under these circumstances, there is no principled basis for excusing the appellant's procedural default. <i>See United States v. Del Rosario,</i> 388 F.3d 1, 13-14 &amp; n. 8 (1st Cir.2004) (rebuffing a similar argument).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second facet of the appellant's rejoinder is equally unavailing. He entreats us to modify our approach to forfeited errors in the <i>Booker</i> context and adopt either the presumption-of-prejudice approach, <i>see United States v. Barnett,</i> 398 F.3d 516, 526-28 (6th Cir.2005), or the automatic-remand approach, <i>see United States v. Crosby,</i> 397 F.3d 103, 117-18 (2d Cir.2005). We decline this invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the courts of appeals have taken a variety of approaches to the treatment of unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error. In a multi-panel circuit, however, newly constituted panels ordinarily are constrained by prior panel decisions directly (or even closely) on point. <i>See Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 349-50 (1st Cir.2004) (discussing the law-of-the circuit doctrine); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir.2002) (similar). So it is here: we are firmly bound by this court's prior panel opinions, such as <i>Heldeman</i> and <i>Antonakopoulos.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there are two narrow exceptions to this iteration of the law-of-the-circuit principle. Under the first of these exceptions, \"[a]n existing panel decision may be undermined by controlling authority, subsequently announced, such as an opinion of the Supreme Court, an en banc opinion of the circuit court, or a statutory overruling.\" <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir.1995). Under the second exception, which operates in instances that fairly may be described as hen's-teeth rare, authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, may nevertheless offer a compelling reason for believing that the former panel, in light of new developments, would change its collective mind. <i>See id.</i> Neither of these exceptions is apposite here. <i>See United States v. Villafane-Jimenez,</i> 410 F.3d 74, 85 (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam) (rejecting a similar entreaty to revisit <i>Antonakopoulos</i>); <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 405 F.3d 102, 114 (1st Cir.2005) (same). Thus, there is no justification for this panel to reconsider the recent decisions in the <i>Heldeman-Antonakopoulos</i> line of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Merits.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a forfeited <i>Booker</i> error engenders review for plain error, the four-part <i>Duarte</i> test applies. <i>See United States v. Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d 294, 302 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. The <i>Booker</i> error that transpired here constitutes a clear and obvious sentencing error; thus, the first two prongs of the plain error test are satisfied. <i>See United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 153 (1st Cir.2005) [slip op. at 26]; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the third prong, we must inquire whether the appellant has pointed to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would have levied a more lenient sentence had it not been constrained by the then-mandatory guidelines system. We have said that we will not be overly stringent in assessing a defendant's attempt to make that showing. <i>See Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 224. Still, the defendant must point to something concrete, whether or not in the sentencing record itself, that provides a plausible basis for such a finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant essays two arguments in support of a finding of prejudice. He first notes that a district court, post-<i>Booker,</i> is required to account for all the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 764-67. Building on this foundation, he posits that his sentence \"would have looked quite different\" had this been done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument misapprehends a defendant's burden on plain error review. It is not enough for a defendant to show that he was not given the benefit of a sentence fashioned under advisory guidelines; rather, he must offer some reasonable indication that the sentencing court, freed of the shackles forged by mandatory guidelines, would have fashioned a more favorable sentence. <i>See Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 224; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. Therefore, the inherent uncertainty about how the sentencing court would have exercised its newfound discretion when weighing the section 3553(a) factors under an advisory guidelines system is not enough to enable a defendant to carry his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That reality disposes of the appellant's argument. While he describes at some length the vistas that the district court is now permitted to explore, he points to no specific circumstances signaling that the court's deliberations with respect to the section 3553(a) factors would likely have yielded a lower sentence. Thus, his argument falls short of passing the third prong of the plain error test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next contends that had the district court sentenced him under an advisory guidelines system, it probably would have given him a lower sentence based on the poverty and the difficulties with cultural assimilation that he faced as a child, his current family circumstances, and the likelihood that he will be deported upon the completion of his sentence. In support of this contention, the appellant cites the fact that the district court sentenced him at the bottom of the applicable guideline range and argues that the court might have granted a further reduction had it not been constrained by a mandatory guidelines system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guideline sentencing range, standing alone, does not give rise to a reasonable probability that, under advisory guidelines, it would have imposed a sentence lower than what the guidelines prescribed. <i>See United States v. Figuereo,</i> 404 F.3d 537, 542 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Cacho-Bonilla,</i> 404 F.3d 84, 95 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> 400 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2005). A defendant who is sentenced at the bottom of the guideline range must show some additional basis for a finding that the district court would have been inclined to disregard the range and sentence below it. <i>See Figuereo,</i> 404 F.3d at 542; <i>Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> 400 F.3d at 55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has failed to make such a showing. He alludes several times to a comment made by the district court during the resentencing, but that comment is ambiguous at best.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While the appellant reads this statement to indicate the court's view that the drug laws are the source of \"terrible human consequences\" and to signal the court's sympathy for the fact that the appellant will spend so much time apart from his family, an equally plausible interpretation is that the court was expressing its belief that \"terrible human consequences\" result from \"people in this country dealing drugs\" (such as the appellant). In all events, this generalized, matter-of-fact statement about the consequences of drug crimes does not indicate that the court felt that the appellant, given his individualized circumstances, deserved a lesser sentence. Thus, we cannot conclude that the statement furnishes the missing link and gives rise to a reasonable probability that the district court, under an advisory guidelines system, would have been inclined to impose a more lenient sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, we note that the court's statements in refusing to grant the appellant's requests for downward departures at the time of resentencing are suggestive of the fact that the court deemed the case quite ordinary. Referring to the appellant's familial circumstances, the court stated that there was \"no evidence supporting the claim that his family relationship [was] unique or extraordinary.\" <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> No. 98-12086, slip op. at 43. The court further found the appellant's arguments relating to the difficulties of cultural assimilation to be utterly unpersuasive. <i>Id.</i> at 44. And, finally, the court discerned nothing about the appellant's forecasted deportation that would \"take [the appellant's] situation outside of the ordinary.\" <i>Id.</i> These responses indicate that the court was not moved by the circumstances of the case and strongly suggest that the court would have had little inclination to reduce the 210-month sentence. <i>See Martins,</i> 413 F.3d at 154 [slip op. at 26-27].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the appellant committed a serious offense. The record indicates that he was at ease in his role as a drug dealer who peddled substantial volumes of crack cocaine. There is nothing in the record to suggest any hesitation or discomfiture on the district court's part in meting out a 210-month sentence. It follows that the appellant has failed to carry his burden of showing prejudice tied to the use of a mandatory guidelines regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Our standard plain error test applies to the appellant's unpreserved claim of <i>Booker</i> error. Because the appellant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines system, he fails that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The appellant's sentence is affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government relies heavily on the district court's remarks at the original sentencing (in 1996) to reflect the court's attitude (and, thus, the likelihood of a lower sentence). In ordinary circumstances, that information would be relevant.

Employing the plain error analysis applicable to unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error, we conclude that the appellant suffered no cognizable prejudice resulting from the application of a mandatory guidelines system. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 10, 1994, a federal grand jury handed up a multi-count indictment charging the appellant with one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute, seven counts of possessing with intent to distribute, distributing, and aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine base, and one count of conspiracy to acquire firearms in exchange for illegal drugs. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 371. These charges stemmed from the appellant's alleged participation, with four codefendants, in the sale of crack cocaine to undercover officers on eleven separate occasions and the coconspirators' plan to acquire weapons from those officers in exchange for drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After negotiating a plea agreement, the appellant pleaded guilty to all counts. The district court convened a disposition hearing on February 9, 1996, and sentenced the appellant to a 240-month incarcerative term (a term that was within the applicable guideline sentencing range of 210 to 262 months). The appellant challenged that sentence but, after some procedural skirmishing (not relevant here), a panel of this court affirmed it. <i>United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span> (1st Cir.1997) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 7, 1998, the appellant filed a habeas petition, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, in which he claimed, among other things, that his sentence had been illegally imposed. The district court wisely appointed counsel, who filed an amended section 2255 petition. On June 4, 2002, the court granted the amended petition; it found that defense counsel's failure at sentencing to present humanizing evidence and to argue for a sentence at the low end of the guideline sentencing range constituted ineffective assistance. <i>See Guzm&#225;n v. United States,</i> No. 98-12086, slip op. at 1 (D. Mass. June 4, 2004) (unpublished). Accordingly, the court vacated the appellant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened a new sentencing hearing on June 18, 2004. This time, the court imposed a 210-month incarcerative term. That term was at the nadir of the guideline sentencing range. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant challenges his 210-month sentence. This challenge devolves from <i>Booker,</i> in which the Supreme Court held that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated when his sentence is imposed under a mandatory guidelines system that gives decretory significance to judge-found facts. 125 S.Ct. at 756. The appellant argues that because he was resentenced prior to the <i>Booker</i> decision and under the mandatory guidelines system then in effect, his sentence is unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant did not make anything resembling a Sixth Amendment objection at the time of his resentencing, so his claim of error is unpreserved. The appellant concedes that point, but he mounts an aggressive attack on this court's standard of review for unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error. In the course of that attack, he maintains both that the articulation of the plain error test, as set forth in <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2005), and its progeny, should not apply to him and that, in all events, the application of that test violates due process. In his view, we ought to abandon <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and instead adopt one of two alternate approaches. We first repulse the appellant's assault on <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and then, applying our wonted standard of review, determine whether he is entitled to the relief that he seeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a claim of <i>Booker</i> error has not been preserved, it is deemed forfeited and we must apply the plain error standard, as articulated in <i>United States v.

In order to establish entitlement to relief under that stringent test, an appellant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v.

We explained that a <i>Booker</i> error occurs not when the judge finds facts necessary to the sentencing determination but, rather, when the defendant is sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system that gives decretory significance to judge-found facts. <i>Id.</i> Thus, in the hindsight provided by <i>Booker,</i> the first two prongs of the plain error test are met when the defendant shows that the sentencing court treated the guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the third plain error prong, the defendant bears the burden of showing that, had the error not occurred, there is a \"reasonable probability\" that he would have received a lesser sentence. <i>Id.</i> Under that standard, \"the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 78 (quoting <i>United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span> (2004)). This means that the defendant must persuade the court that were it not for the then-mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines, it is reasonably likely that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant makes a twofold rejoinder to this format. First, even though he did not preserve his claim of <i>Booker</i> error, he nonetheless asseverates that the <i>Duarte</i> plain error test, adopted in <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> should not apply to his case because he could not reasonably have anticipated the \"dramatic transformation in sentencing law\" wrought by <i>Booker.</i> Requiring such \"clairvoyance,\" the appellant says, violates his due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject these importunings. As a general rule, \"a criminal defendant must seasonably advance an objection to a potential constitutional infirmity in order to preserve the point.\" <i>Derman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200045\"><a href=\"/opinion/200045/derman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2002). While a narrow exception to this principle applies where \"objections or defenses ... were not known to be available at the time they could first have been made,\" <i>Bennett v. City of Holyoke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200925\"><a href=\"/opinion/200925/bennett-v-city-of-holyoke/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), that exception is pertinent only if \"(i) at the time of the procedural default, a prior authoritative decision indicated that the defense was unavailable, and (ii) the defense became available thereafter by way of supervening authority.\" <i>Id.</i> Alternatively stated, the exception applies only when the futility of raising an objection or defense was unequivocally apparent at the time in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is clearly not the case here. At the time of the appellant's resentencing, the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines was a hot-button issue in criminal law circles. The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000), had paved the way for a Sixth Amendment challenge to the federal sentencing guidelines. Moreover, a closely related issue, involving state sentencing guidelines, was pending before the Supreme Court &#8212; an issue that the Court resolved, favorably to the defendant, in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004). The bottom line is that, at the time the district court resentenced the appellant, the constitutionality of the guidelines was very much in play. Under these circumstances, there is no principled basis for excusing the appellant's procedural default. <i>See United States v. Del Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788222\"><a href=\"/opinion/788222/united-states-v-nelson-j-del-rosario-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 13-14 &amp; n. 8 (1st Cir.2004) (rebuffing a similar argument).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second facet of the appellant's rejoinder is equally unavailing. He entreats us to modify our approach to forfeited errors in the <i>Booker</i> context and adopt either the presumption-of-prejudice approach, <i>see United States v. Barnett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789276\"><a href=\"/opinion/789276/united-states-v-yervin-k-barnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 526-28 (6th Cir.2005), or the automatic-remand approach, <i>see United States v. Crosby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789140\"><a href=\"/opinion/789140/united-states-v-jerome-crosby/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 117-18 (2d Cir.2005). We decline this invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the courts of appeals have taken a variety of approaches to the treatment of unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error. In a multi-panel circuit, however, newly constituted panels ordinarily are constrained by prior panel decisions directly (or even closely) on point. <i>See Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201301\"><a href=\"/opinion/201301/eulitt-v-me-dept-of-edu/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 349-50 (1st Cir.2004) (discussing the law-of-the circuit doctrine); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200202\"><a href=\"/opinion/200202/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 438-39 (1st Cir.2002) (similar). So it is here: we are firmly bound by this court's prior panel opinions, such as <i>Heldeman</i> and <i>Antonakopoulos.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there are two narrow exceptions to this iteration of the law-of-the-circuit principle. Under the first of these exceptions, \"[a]n existing panel decision may be undermined by controlling authority, subsequently announced, such as an opinion of the Supreme Court, an en banc opinion of the circuit court, or a statutory overruling.\" <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 592 (1st Cir.1995). Under the second exception, which operates in instances that fairly may be described as hen's-teeth rare, authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, may nevertheless offer a compelling reason for believing that the former panel, in light of new developments, would change its collective mind. <i>See id.</i> Neither of these exceptions is apposite here. <i>See United States v. Villafane-Jimenez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201627\"><a href=\"/opinion/201627/united-states-v-villafane-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam) (rejecting a similar entreaty to revisit <i>Antonakopoulos</i>); <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201561\"><a href=\"/opinion/201561/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 114 (1st Cir.2005) (same). Thus, there is no justification for this panel to reconsider the recent decisions in the <i>Heldeman-Antonakopoulos</i> line of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Merits.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a forfeited <i>Booker</i> error engenders review for plain error, the four-part <i>Duarte</i> test applies. <i>See United States v. Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201515\"><a href=\"/opinion/201515/united-states-v-gonzalez-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 302 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. The <i>Booker</i> error that transpired here constitutes a clear and obvious sentencing error; thus, the first two prongs of the plain error test are satisfied. <i>See United States v. Martins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201656\"><a href=\"/opinion/201656/united-states-v-martins/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 153 (1st Cir.2005) [slip op. at 26]; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the third prong, we must inquire whether the appellant has pointed to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would have levied a more lenient sentence had it not been constrained by the then-mandatory guidelines system. We have said that we will not be overly stringent in assessing a defendant's attempt to make that showing. <i>See Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 224. Still, the defendant must point to something concrete, whether or not in the sentencing record itself, that provides a plausible basis for such a finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant essays two arguments in support of a finding of prejudice. He first notes that a district court, post-<i>Booker,</i> is required to account for all the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 764-67. Building on this foundation, he posits that his sentence \"would have looked quite different\" had this been done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument misapprehends a defendant's burden on plain error review. It is not enough for a defendant to show that he was not given the benefit of a sentence fashioned under advisory guidelines; rather, he must offer some reasonable indication that the sentencing court, freed of the shackles forged by mandatory guidelines, would have fashioned a more favorable sentence. <i>See Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 224; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. Therefore, the inherent uncertainty about how the sentencing court would have exercised its newfound discretion when weighing the section 3553(a) factors under an advisory guidelines system is not enough to enable a defendant to carry his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That reality disposes of the appellant's argument. While he describes at some length the vistas that the district court is now permitted to explore, he points to no specific circumstances signaling that the court's deliberations with respect to the section 3553(a) factors would likely have yielded a lower sentence. Thus, his argument falls short of passing the third prong of the plain error test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next contends that had the district court sentenced him under an advisory guidelines system, it probably would have given him a lower sentence based on the poverty and the difficulties with cultural assimilation that he faced as a child, his current family circumstances, and the likelihood that he will be deported upon the completion of his sentence. In support of this contention, the appellant cites the fact that the district court sentenced him at the bottom of the applicable guideline range and argues that the court might have granted a further reduction had it not been constrained by a mandatory guidelines system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guideline sentencing range, standing alone, does not give rise to a reasonable probability that, under advisory guidelines, it would have imposed a sentence lower than what the guidelines prescribed. <i>See United States v. Figuereo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201542\"><a href=\"/opinion/201542/united-states-v-figuereo/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 542 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Cacho-Bonilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201676\"><a href=\"/opinion/201676/united-states-v-cacho-bonilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201470\"><a href=\"/opinion/201470/united-states-v-serrano-beauvaix/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2005). A defendant who is sentenced at the bottom of the guideline range must show some additional basis for a finding that the district court would have been inclined to disregard the range and sentence below it. <i>See Figuereo,</i> 404 F.3d at 542; <i>Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> 400 F.3d at 55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has failed to make such a showing. He alludes several times to a comment made by the district court during the resentencing, but that comment is ambiguous at best.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While the appellant reads this statement to indicate the court's view that the drug laws are the source of \"terrible human consequences\" and to signal the court's sympathy for the fact that the appellant will spend so much time apart from his family, an equally plausible interpretation is that the court was expressing its belief that \"terrible human consequences\" result from \"people in this country dealing drugs\" (such as the appellant). In all events, this generalized, matter-of-fact statement about the consequences of drug crimes does not indicate that the court felt that the appellant, given his individualized circumstances, deserved a lesser sentence. Thus, we cannot conclude that the statement furnishes the missing link and gives rise to a reasonable probability that the district court, under an advisory guidelines system, would have been inclined to impose a more lenient sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, we note that the court's statements in refusing to grant the appellant's requests for downward departures at the time of resentencing are suggestive of the fact that the court deemed the case quite ordinary. Referring to the appellant's familial circumstances, the court stated that there was \"no evidence supporting the claim that his family relationship [was] unique or extraordinary.\" <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> No. 98-12086, slip op. at 43. The court further found the appellant's arguments relating to the difficulties of cultural assimilation to be utterly unpersuasive. <i>Id.</i> at 44. And, finally, the court discerned nothing about the appellant's forecasted deportation that would \"take [the appellant's] situation outside of the ordinary.\" <i>Id.</i> These responses indicate that the court was not moved by the circumstances of the case and strongly suggest that the court would have had little inclination to reduce the 210-month sentence. <i>See Martins,</i> 413 F.3d at 154 [slip op. at 26-27].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the appellant committed a serious offense. The record indicates that he was at ease in his role as a drug dealer who peddled substantial volumes of crack cocaine. There is nothing in the record to suggest any hesitation or discomfiture on the district court's part in meting out a 210-month sentence. It follows that the appellant has failed to carry his burden of showing prejudice tied to the use of a mandatory guidelines regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Our standard plain error test applies to the appellant's unpreserved claim of <i>Booker</i> error. Because the appellant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines system, he fails that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The appellant's sentence is affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government relies heavily on the district court's remarks at the original sentencing (in 1996) to reflect the court's attitude (and, thus, the likelihood of a lower sentence). In ordinary circumstances, that information would be relevant. Here, however, the district court subsequently found that the appellant's counsel at the original sentencing hearing was constitutionally ineffective in presenting the appellant's side of the story<i>See Guzm&#225;n,</i> No. 98-12086, slip op. at 1. Because the court's ability to assess the situation was compromised at that time, we think that the course of prudence is to refrain from attributing any significance to the court's 1996 comments.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> These factors include:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed &#8212; (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for &#8212; (A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines ...; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records ...; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The court stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Of course, none of us would be here if you hadn't been in this country dealing drugs, and the drug laws in this country provide for long sentences in cases like yours, and it does have terrible human consequences.
