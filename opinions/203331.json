Smith with whom Law Office of Pamela A. Smith was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Marissa I. Delinks with whom CharCretia V. Di Bartolo, William\nP.

This dispute arises from an\n\nemployment   negotiation   gone   awry.    Christopher   Phillips,   an\n\nophthalmologist who lived at the time in Massachusetts, interviewed\n\nin Illinois for a job with Prairie Eye Center, a full service\n\nophthalmology practice.    After both parties signed an employment\n\ncontract for Phillips to go work for Prairie Eye in Illinois, the\n\nrelationship between the two deteriorated.     Phillips never went to\n\nwork for Prairie Eye.\n\n          He filed suit against Prairie Eye in Massachusetts state\n\ncourt asserting personal jurisdiction over the defendant pursuant\n\nto the Massachusetts long-arm statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A,\n\n§ 3.   After Prairie Eye removed the case to federal court, the\n\ndistrict court found that Prairie Eye lacked the requisite minimum\n\ncontacts with Massachusetts and dismissed the case.      We agree and\n\naffirm the dismissal.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          We accept the allegations in the complaint as true and\n\nconstrue the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as\n\nwe are reviewing a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\nDaynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole, P.A., 290\n\nF.3d 42, 51 (1st Cir. 2002).      The facts relevant to determining\n\npersonal jurisdiction are not in dispute.\n\n          Phillips resided in Massachusetts until 2007.       In June\n\n2006, Phillips, who was seeking a new job, posted his résumé on the\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fjob placement section of the American Academy of Ophthalmology\n\nwebsite.   Soon thereafter, he received an e-mail invitation for an\n\ninterview from Sandra Yeh, the owner and president of Prairie Eye\n\nCenter, located in Springfield, Illinois.\n\n           On August 11, 2006, Phillips flew to Springfield to\n\ninterview with Yeh and other doctors at Prairie Eye.    Afterwards,\n\nPrairie Eye sent an unsigned employment contract via first class\n\nmail to Phillips in Massachusetts.       The contract specifically\n\ndetailed the terms of employment, including duration, compensation,\n\nand duties.     The parties dispute how much negotiation of the\n\ncontract occurred while Phillips was in Illinois, but plaintiff\n\ndoes not contest that the unsigned contract he received contained\n\nenough material terms that it could be accepted.\n\n           On August 20, Yeh sent Phillips an e-mail, which Phillips\n\nreceived in Massachusetts, asking whether Phillips had received the\n\nemployment contract and asking him if there was anything she could\n\ndo to help his decisionmaking process.   This is the first of Yeh's\n\nthree e-mail contacts with Massachusetts that Phillips put in the\n\nrecord.1   A few hours later, Phillips sent Yeh an e-mail, which Yeh\n\n\n     1\n          We describe the case in terms of the plaintiff's\nsubmissions because the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing\njurisdiction. Adelson v. Hananel, 510 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2007).\nIn its Motion To Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, Prairie\nEye attached seven additional e-mails from Yeh to Phillips, most of\nthem dealing with the scheduling of Phillips's August 11 interview.\nEven if we were to consider the defendant's submissions, they do\nnot create sufficient contacts to satisfy jurisdictional due\n\n                                 -3-\n\freceived in Illinois, noting that \"[n]early everything [in the\n\ncontract] looks great, but I [have] just a couple of minor requests\n\nto ask of you.\"     Yeh, via an e-mail later that day (and the second\n\nof   the   proffered      e-mail      contacts),   agreed    in    principle    to\n\nPhillips's proposed changes and asked him to modify the contract\n\nwith his changes and mail the contract back to Yeh.                Phillips then\n\ntyped   his    changes    into   an    addendum,   signed    the   contract    and\n\naddendum, and the following day, mailed the signed contract and\n\naddendum to Yeh in Illinois.\n\n              A couple of weeks later, on September 10, Yeh e-mailed\n\nPhillips again, in the third and last of the proffered e-mail\n\ncontacts.      Yeh noted that she had made a change to the addendum\n\n(specifically with regards to the timing of the partnership offer),\n\nand needed Phillips to initial the change and send it back to her.\n\nTwo days later, Phillips e-mailed Yeh saying, \"I will initial the\n\ncontract and get the original right out to you.\"              He then e-mailed\n\na scanned copy of the initialed contract back to Yeh.\n\n              A copy of the contract, executed by both parties, is in\n\nthe record.      The contract, however, was never performed.                   Soon\n\nafter   the    Phillips    e-mailed      the   contract     back   to   Yeh,    the\n\nrelationship between the two fell apart, and Phillips never went to\n\nwork for Yeh at Prairie Eye Center.            How and why the relationship\n\n\n\n\nprocess requirements.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fsoured is not relevant to the jurisdictional question presented to\n\nus.\n\n          About a month later, on October 20, 2006, Phillips filed\n\nsuit against Prairie Eye Center in state court in Massachusetts\n\nasserting breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing and seeking a declaratory\n\njudgment that the contract was null and void.        The defendant\n\nremoved the action to federal court and filed a motion to dismiss\n\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction.      After allowing extensive\n\nbriefing and holding a motion hearing, the district court dismissed\n\nthe case for lack of personal jurisdiction by a docket notation.\n\n          While this case was on appeal, the defendant, Prairie Eye\n\nCenter, filed a breach of contract action against Phillips in U.S.\n\nDistrict Court for the Central District of Illinois seeking damages\n\nand declaratory relief. Phillips, who has since moved to the state\n\nof Washington, moved for a stay of that proceeding because of the\n\npending appeal in this case.      The federal district court in\n\nIllinois denied the stay, and Phillips has asserted the claims he\n\nmakes here as counterclaims in that case.\n\n                               II.\n\nA.        Standard of Review and Burden of Proof\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f            We review de novo a district court's decision to dismiss\n\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction.         Adelson v. Hananel, 510 F.3d\n\n43, 48 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The district court \"may choose from among several methods\n\nfor determining whether the plaintiff has met [its] burden.\"              Id.\n\n(quoting Daynard, 290 F.3d at 50-51) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Because the district court did not hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing but credited the plaintiff's evidentiary submissions, we\n\nconstrue the court's ruling as employing the prima facie method.2\n\nThis is \"the least taxing of these standards from a plaintiff's\n\nstandpoint.\"      Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., 115 F.3d 81, 83-\n\n84 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Under the prima facie standard, the inquiry is whether\n\nthe   plaintiff    has   proffered   evidence   which,   if   credited,    is\n\nsufficient to support findings of all facts essential to personal\n\njurisdiction.      Daynard, 290 F.3d at 51.     In order to make a prima\n\nfacie showing of jurisdiction, \"the plaintiff ordinarily cannot\n\nrest upon the pleadings but is obliged to adduce evidence of\n\nspecific facts.\"      Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Canada,\n\n46 F.3d 138, 145 (1st Cir. 1995).           The court \"must accept the\n\nplaintiff's (properly documented) evidentiary proffers as true for\n\n\n      2\n          The other two methods, the preponderance method and the\nlikelihood method, usually require an evidentiary hearing.    See\nFoster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d 138, 146\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthe   purpose   of    determining   the   adequacy     of    the    prima     facie\n\njurisdictional       showing,\"   Daynard,    290     F.3d    at     51   (quoting\n\nFoster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145) (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\nand \"construe them in the light most congenial to the plaintiff's\n\njurisdictional claim,\" id. (quoting Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover,\n\nInc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 1998)) (internal\n\nquotation mark omitted).\n\nB.         Jurisdictional Analysis\n\n           There is no claim here of general jurisdiction.                       See\n\nHarlow v. Children's Hosp., 432 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(describing the difference between general jurisdiction, which\n\nrequires that the defendant have continuous and systematic contacts\n\nwith the state, and specific jurisdiction, where the claim must be\n\nrelated to the defendant's contacts).            Phillips bases his claim of\n\nspecific   personal      jurisdiction       over     Prairie       Eye   on      the\n\nMassachusetts    long-arm    statute.       We     proceed   directly       to   the\n\nconstitutional analysis, \"because the Supreme Judicial Court of\n\nMassachusetts has interpreted the state's long-arm statute 'as an\n\nassertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by\n\nthe Constitution of the United States.'\"             Daynard, 290 F.3d at 52\n\n(quoting 'Automatic' Sprinkler Corp. of Am. v. Seneca Foods Corp.,\n\n280 N.E.2d 423, 424 (Mass. 1972)).\n\n           The Due Process Clause requires that \"in order to subject\n\na defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fthe territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with\n\nit such that maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional\n\nnotions of fair play and substantial justice.'\"         Int'l Shoe Co. v.\n\nWashington, 326 U.S. 310, 319 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer,\n\n311   U.S.    457,   463   (1940)).   For   specific   jurisdiction,   the\n\nconstitutional       analysis   is    divided   into   three   categories:\n\nrelatedness, purposeful availment, and reasonableness.\n\n             First, the claim underlying the litigation\n             must directly arise out of, or relate to, the\n             defendant's forum-state activities. Second,\n             the   defendant's   in-state   contacts   must\n             represent a purposeful availment of the\n             privilege of conducting activities in the\n             forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and\n             protections of that state's laws and making\n             the defendant's involuntary presence before\n             the state's courts foreseeable. Third, the\n             exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the\n             Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\n\nAdelson, 510 F.3d at 49 (quoting Daynard, 290 F.3d at 60).             The\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate that each of these three requirements is\n\nsatisfied.\n\n             1.      Relatedness\n\n             \"The evidence produced to support specific jurisdiction\n\nmust show that the cause of action either arises directly out of,\n\nor is related to, the defendant's forum-based contacts.\"          Harlow,\n\n432 F.3d at 60-61 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Adelson, 510 F.3d at\n\n49.   There must be more than just an attenuated connection between\n\nthe contacts and the claim; \"the defendant's in-state conduct must\n\nform an 'important, or [at least] material, element of proof' in\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe plaintiff's case.\"         Harlow, 432 F.3d at 61 (quoting United\n\nElec., Radio & Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d\n\n1080, 1089 (1st Cir. 1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Phillips brings both a contract claim, breach of the\n\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and a tort claim,\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty.          Although the standard for relatedness\n\nfor a tort claim is typically different from that of a contract\n\nclaim, Jet Wine & Spirits, Inc. v. Bacardi & Co., 298 F.3d 1, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 2002), here the two claims are sufficiently connected\n\nthat the difference is of no concern.            Phillips's claim for breach\n\nof   fiduciary      duty   concerns   the   formation      of    his    employment\n\ncontract.       See,   e.g.,   id.    (noting     that    when    \"the    tort     is\n\nintentional interference with a contractual . . . relationship, the\n\ntwo inquiries begin to resemble each other\").              Thus, here, we look\n\nto   whether    \"the   defendant's    activity     in    the    forum    state    was\n\n'instrumental either in the formation of the contract or its\n\nbreach.'\"      Adelson, 510 F.3d at 49 (quoting Phillips Exeter Acad.\n\nv. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 289 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n            Phillips's case does not contain the typical factors\n\nwhich have led us to conclude there is sufficient relatedness.\n\nThis is unlike cases where the specific terms of an employment\n\ncontract were \"formalized and entered into\" in the forum state, and\n\nwhere the employee was subject to \"substantial control and ongoing\n\nconnection     to   [the   forum   state]   in    the    performance      of     this\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fcontract.\"       Id.     Here, Phillips provided no evidence that any\n\nnegotiations took place in Massachusetts.              In fact, the unsigned\n\nemployment contract sent to Phillips shortly after his interview in\n\nIllinois is both definite and detailed, and it precedes the three\n\ne-mails from Yeh to Phillips.           Still, Phillips's claim does arise\n\nout of his contractual relationship with Prairie Eye Center and,\n\naccepting    his       allegations     as   true,   Yeh's   communications    to\n\nPhillips, which he received in Massachusetts, were in bad faith.\n\nSee Daynard, 290 F.3d at 61.            That said, we will assume arguendo\n\nthat the plaintiff established sufficient relatedness.\n\n            2.          Purposeful Availment\n\n            Phillips must also show that Prairie Eye purposefully\n\navailed itself of \"the privilege of conducting activities in the\n\nforum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that\n\nstate's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before\n\nthe state's courts foreseeable.\"               Id. (quoting Foster-Miller, 46\n\nF.3d at 144) (internal quotation mark omitted). As the formulation\n\nsuggests, purposeful availment involves both voluntariness and\n\nforeseeability.           Id.;   see    also    Adelson,    510   F.3d   at   50.\n\nVoluntariness requires that the defendant's contacts with the forum\n\nstate \"proximately result from actions by the defendant himself.\"\n\nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 475 (1985).                     The\n\ncontacts must be deliberate, and \"not based on the unilateral\n\nactions of another party.\"           Adelson, 510 F.3d at 50 (citing Burger\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fKing, 471 U.S. at 475).   Foreseeability requires that the contacts\n\nalso must be of a nature that the defendant could \"reasonably\n\nanticipate being haled into court there.\"   Id. (quoting World-Wide\n\nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n          Prairie Eye's contacts with Massachusetts are plainly\n\nvoluntary.3   Prairie Eye knew that Phillips said he was a resident\n\nof Massachusetts and mailed the unsigned employment contract to\n\nPhillips in Massachusetts.    Prairie Eye does not contest that it\n\nknew Phillips was in Massachusetts when Yeh wrote the e-mails.\n\n          Phillips relies on these facts to argue that because he\n\naccepted the contract in Massachusetts, Prairie Eye should have\n\nforeseen that it could be haled into court in Massachusetts.     We\n\nhave held, however, in a variety of contexts, that the defendant's\n\nawareness of the location of the plaintiff is not, on its own,\n\n\n\n     3\n          At oral argument, we raised the question as to whether\nthe voluntariness inquiry should be different for an e-mail contact\nthan for a landline telephone, postal, or face-to-face contact.\nFor the latter types of contacts, voluntariness is clear as the\noriginator of the communication must know its destination before\ninitiating the communication.     For example, someone mailing a\nletter must write a physical address, which exists in some\njurisdiction, on the envelope.      With an e-mail, however, the\noriginator sends a message to an e-mail address, which does not\nsignal the physical location of the recipient.      Generally, the\nrecipient can open the e-mail anywhere in the world. In this case,\nvoluntariness may be ambiguous because the originator of the\ncommunication may not know in which jurisdiction the communication\nwill be received. This case does not turn on these issues, though.\n\n                                -11-\n\fenough to create personal jurisdiction over a defendant.         When a\n\npatient argued that jurisdiction in Maine over a Massachusetts\n\nhospital was proper because the defendant knew plaintiff resided in\n\nMaine, we noted: \"Jurisdiction cannot be created by and does not\n\ntravel with the plaintiff patient wherever she goes.\"      Harlow, 432\n\nF.3d at 63; see also Sawtelle v. Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381, 1392 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (finding no purposeful availment when \"the [defendants']\n\nonly connection with [the forum state] was the [plaintiffs']\n\nresidence there\").   When a plaintiff tire manufacturer argued that\n\na defendant rim manufacturer was subject to personal jurisdiction\n\nin Puerto Rico, we noted that even if the defendant had specific\n\nknowledge that the stream of commerce would move its tire rims into\n\nPuerto Rico, \"awareness alone would not be enough to constitute the\n\npurposeful availment which is necessary for a showing of minimum\n\ncontacts.\"   Rodriguez, 115 F.3d at 85 (citing Asahi Metal Indus.\n\nCo. v. Superior Ct., 480 U.S. 102, 112 (1987) (plurality opinion)).\n\n          There is little besides awareness here. It stretches too\n\nfar to say that Prairie Eye, by mailing a contract with full terms\n\nto Massachusetts for signature and following up with three e-mails\n\nconcerning the logistics of signing the contract, should have known\n\nthat it was rendering itself liable to suit in Massachusetts.        The\n\nMassachusetts   Supreme   Judicial   Court   recently   found   personal\n\njurisdiction over nonresident plaintiffs did not comport with due\n\nprocess where the only contacts consisted of a purchase of an\n\n\n                                -12-\n\finsurance policy from a Massachusetts insurer and the mailing of\n\npremium payments to Massachusetts.

Smith with whom Law Office of Pamela A. Smith was on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Marissa I. Delinks with whom CharCretia V. Di Bartolo, William P. Hardy, and Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson LLP were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, MERRITT,<sup>[*]</sup> Senior Circuit Judge, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This dispute arises from an employment negotiation gone awry. Christopher Phillips, an ophthalmologist who lived at the time in Massachusetts, interviewed in Illinois for a job with Prairie Eye Center, a full service ophthalmology practice. After both parties signed an employment contract for Phillips to go work for Prairie Eye in Illinois, the relationship between the two deteriorated. Phillips never went to work for Prairie Eye.</p>\n<p>He filed suit against Prairie Eye in Massachusetts state court asserting personal jurisdiction over the defendant pursuant to the Massachusetts long-arm statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3. After Prairie Eye removed the case to federal court, the district court found that Prairie Eye lacked the requisite minimum contacts with Massachusetts and dismissed the case. We agree and affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We accept the allegations in the complaint as true and construe the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as we are reviewing a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. <i>Daynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &amp; Poole, P.A.,</i> 290 F.3d 42, 51 (1st Cir.2002). The facts relevant to determining personal jurisdiction are not in dispute.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> Phillips resided in Massachusetts until 2007. In June 2006, Phillips, who was seeking a new job, posted his résumé on the job placement section of the American Academy of Ophthalmology website. Soon thereafter, he received an e-mail invitation for an interview from Sandra Yeh, the owner and president of Prairie Eye Center, located in Springfield, Illinois.</p>\n<p>On August 11, 2006, Phillips flew to Springfield to interview with Yeh and other doctors at Prairie Eye. Afterwards, Prairie Eye sent an unsigned employment contract via first class mail to Phillips in Massachusetts. The contract specifically detailed the terms of employment, including duration, compensation, and duties. The parties dispute how much negotiation of the contract occurred while Phillips was in Illinois, but plaintiff does not contest that the unsigned contract he received contained enough material terms that it could be accepted.</p>\n<p>On August 20, Yeh sent Phillips an e-mail, which Phillips received in Massachusetts, asking whether Phillips had received the employment contract and asking him if there was anything she could do to help his decisionmaking process. This is the first of Yeh's three e-mail contacts with Massachusetts that Phillips put in the record.<sup>[1]</sup> A few hours later, Phillips sent Yeh an e-mail, which Yeh received in Illinois, noting that \"[n]early everything [in the contract] looks great, but I [have] just a couple of minor requests to ask of you.\" Yeh, via an e-mail later that day (and the second of the proffered e-mail contacts), agreed in principle to Phillips's proposed changes and asked him to modify the contract with his changes and mail the contract back to Yeh. Phillips then typed his changes into an addendum, signed the contract and addendum, and the following day, mailed the signed contract and addendum to Yeh in Illinois.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks later, on September 10, Yeh e-mailed Phillips again, in the third and last of the proffered e-mail contacts. Yeh noted that she had made a change to the addendum (specifically with regards to the timing of the partnership offer), and needed Phillips to initial the change and send it back to her. Two days later, Phillips e-mailed Yeh saying, \"I will initial the contract and get the original right out to you.\" He then e-mailed a scanned copy of the initialed contract back to Yeh.</p>\n<p>A copy of the contract, executed by both parties, is in the record. The contract, however, was never performed. Soon after the Phillips e-mailed the contract back to Yeh, the relationship between the two fell apart, and Phillips never went to work for Yeh at Prairie Eye Center. How and why the relationship soured is not relevant to the jurisdictional question presented to us.</p>\n<p>About a month later, on October 20, 2006, Phillips filed suit against Prairie Eye Center in state court in Massachusetts asserting breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and seeking a declaratory judgment that the contract was null and void. The defendant removed the action to federal court and filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. After allowing extensive briefing and holding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> a motion hearing, the district court dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction by a docket notation.</p>\n<p>While this case was on appeal, the defendant, Prairie Eye Center, filed a breach of contract action against Phillips in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois seeking damages and declaratory relief. Phillips, who has since moved to the state of Washington, moved for a stay of that proceeding because of the pending appeal in this case. The federal district court in Illinois denied the stay, and Phillips has asserted the claims he makes here as counterclaims in that case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Standard of Review and Burden of Proof</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. <i>Adelson v. Hananel,</i> 510 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The district court \"may choose from among several methods for determining whether the plaintiff has met [its] burden.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 50-51) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing but credited the plaintiff's evidentiary submissions, we construe the court's ruling as employing the prima facie method.<sup>[2]</sup> This is \"the least taxing of these standards from a plaintiff's standpoint.\" <i>Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp.,</i> 115 F.3d 81, 83-84 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>Under the prima facie standard, the inquiry is whether the plaintiff has proffered evidence which, if credited, is sufficient to support findings of all facts essential to personal jurisdiction. <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 51. In order to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction, \"the plaintiff ordinarily cannot rest upon the pleadings but is obliged to adduce evidence of specific facts.\" <i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada,</i> 46 F.3d 138, 145 (1st Cir.1995). The court \"must accept the plaintiff's (properly documented) evidentiary proffers as true for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the prima facie jurisdictional showing,\" <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 51 (quoting <i>Foster-Miller,</i> 46 F.3d at 145) (internal quotation marks omitted), and \"construe them in the light most congenial to the plaintiff's jurisdictional claim,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir.1998)) (internal quotation mark omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Jurisdictional Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is no claim here of general jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Harlow v. Children's Hosp.,</i> 432 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir.2005) (describing the difference between general jurisdiction, which requires that the defendant have continuous and systematic contacts with the state, and specific jurisdiction, where the claim must be related to the defendant's contacts). Phillips bases his claim of specific personal jurisdiction over Prairie Eye on the Massachusetts long-arm statute. We proceed directly to the constitutional analysis, \"because the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted the state's long-arm statute `as an assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.'\" <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 52 (quoting <i>\"</i><i>Automatic\" Sprinkler Corp. of Am. v. Seneca Foods Corp.,</i> 361 Mass. 441, 280 N.E.2d 423, 424 (1972)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> The Due Process Clause requires that \"in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that maintenance of the suit does not offend `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\" <i>Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington,</i> 326 U.S. 310, 319, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945) (quoting <i>Milliken v. Meyer,</i> 311 U.S. 457, 463, 61 S.Ct. 339, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940)). For specific jurisdiction, the constitutional analysis is divided into three categories: relatedness, purposeful availment, and reasonableness.</p>\n<blockquote>First, the claim underlying the litigation must directly arise out of, or relate to, the defendant's forum-state activities. Second, the defendant's in-state contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable. Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 49 (quoting <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 60). The plaintiff must demonstrate that each of these three requirements is satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Relatedness</i>\n</h2>\n<p>\"The evidence produced to support specific jurisdiction must show that the cause of action either arises directly out of, or is related to, the defendant's forum-based contacts.\" <i>Harlow,</i> 432 F.3d at 60-61 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 49. There must be more than just an attenuated connection between the contacts and the claim; \"the defendant's in-state conduct must form an `important, or [at least] material, element of proof' in the plaintiff's case.\" <i>Harlow,</i> 432 F.3d at 61 (quoting <i>United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp.,</i> 960 F.2d 1080, 1089 (1st Cir.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Phillips brings both a contract claim, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and a tort claim, breach of fiduciary duty. Although the standard for relatedness for a tort claim is typically different from that of a contract claim, <i>Jet Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc. v. Bacardi &amp; Co.,</i> 298 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2002), here the two claims are sufficiently connected that the difference is of no concern. Phillips's claim for breach of fiduciary duty concerns the formation of his employment contract. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> (noting that when \"the tort is intentional interference with a contractual ... relationship, the two inquiries begin to resemble each other\"). Thus, here, we look to whether \"the defendant's activity in the forum state was `instrumental either in the formation of the contract or its breach.'\" <i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 49 (quoting <i>Phillips Exeter Acad. v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc.,</i> 196 F.3d 284, 289 (1st Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p>Phillips's case does not contain the typical factors which have led us to conclude there is sufficient relatedness. This is unlike cases where the specific terms of an employment contract were \"formalized and entered into\" in the forum state, and where the employee was subject to \"substantial control and ongoing connection to [the forum state] in the performance of this contract.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, Phillips provided no evidence that any negotiations took place in Massachusetts. In fact, the unsigned employment contract sent to Phillips shortly after his interview in Illinois is both definite and detailed, and it precedes the three e-mails from Yeh to Phillips. Still, Phillips's claim does arise out of his contractual relationship with Prairie Eye Center and, accepting his allegations as true, Yeh's communications to Phillips, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> which he received in Massachusetts, were in bad faith. <i>See </i><i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 61. That said, we will assume arguendo that the plaintiff established sufficient relatedness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Purposeful Availment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Phillips must also show that Prairie Eye purposefully availed itself of \"the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Foster-Miller,</i> 46 F.3d at 144) (internal quotation mark omitted). As the formulation suggests, purposeful availment involves both voluntariness and foreseeability. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 50. Voluntariness requires that the defendant's contacts with the forum state \"proximately result from actions by the defendant <i>himself.\" </i><i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,</i> 471 U.S. 462, 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985). The contacts must be deliberate, and \"not based on the unilateral actions of another party.\" <i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 50 (citing <i>Burger King,</i> 471 U.S. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174). Foreseeability requires that the contacts also must be of a nature that the defendant could \"reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,</i> 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Prairie Eye's contacts with Massachusetts are plainly voluntary.<sup>[3]</sup> Prairie Eye knew that Phillips said he was a resident of Massachusetts and mailed the unsigned employment contract to Phillips in Massachusetts. Prairie Eye does not contest that it knew Phillips was in Massachusetts when Yeh wrote the e-mails.</p>\n<p>Phillips relies on these facts to argue that because he accepted the contract in Massachusetts, Prairie Eye should have foreseen that it could be haled into court in Massachusetts. We have held, however, in a variety of contexts, that the defendant's awareness of the location of the plaintiff is not, on its own, enough to create personal jurisdiction over a defendant. When a patient argued that jurisdiction in Maine over a Massachusetts hospital was proper because the defendant knew plaintiff resided in Maine, we noted: \"Jurisdiction cannot be created by and does not travel with the plaintiff patient wherever she goes.\" <i>Harlow,</i> 432 F.3d at 63; <i>see also </i><i>Sawtelle v. Farrell,</i> 70 F.3d 1381, 1392 (1st Cir.1995) (finding no purposeful availment when \"the [defendants'] only connection with [the forum state] was the [plaintiffs'] residence there\"). When a plaintiff tire manufacturer argued that a defendant rim manufacturer was subject to personal jurisdiction in Puerto Rico, we noted that even if the defendant had specific knowledge that the stream of commerce would move its tire rims into Puerto Rico, \"awareness alone would not be enough to constitute the purposeful availment which is necessary for a showing of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> minimum contacts.\" <i>Rodriguez,</i> 115 F.3d at 85 (citing <i>Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Ct.,</i> 480 U.S. 102, 112, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987) (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p>There is little besides awareness here. It stretches too far to say that Prairie Eye, by mailing a contract with full terms to Massachusetts for signature and following up with three e-mails concerning the logistics of signing the contract, should have known that it was rendering itself liable to suit in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently found personal jurisdiction over nonresident plaintiffs did not comport with due process where the only contacts consisted of a purchase of an insurance policy from a Massachusetts insurer and the mailing of premium payments to Massachusetts. <i>Moelis v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> 451 Mass. 483, 887 N.E.2d 214, 2008 WL 2122417, at *3 (2008); <i>see also </i><i>N.H. Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Markem Corp.,</i> 424 Mass. 344, 676 N.E.2d 809, 812 (1997) (no personal jurisdiction over policyholder defendants where insurance contracts were drafted in New Hampshire, insured activity did not occur in Massachusetts, and only relevant contacts were plaintiff's mailing of policy from Massachusetts to defendant, defendant's mailing of payment to insurer in Massachusetts, and defendant's submission of claims to Massachusetts); <i>\"</i><i>Automatic\" Sprinkler Corp.,</i> 280 N.E.2d at 425 (no personal jurisdiction over New York defendant that signed purchase order to buy goods from Massachusetts seller, mailed purchase order to Massachusetts, received invoice from Massachusetts, and sent check to Massachusetts).</p>\n<p>The contract was for Phillips to be employed in Illinois, and never for him to be employed in Massachusetts. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Harlow,</i> 432 F.3d at 63 (\"In the case of personal services focus must be on the place where the services are rendered, since this is the place of the receiver's ... need.\" (quoting <i>Wright v. Yackley,</i> 459 F.2d 287, 289 (9th Cir.1972)) (block quotation)).</p>\n<p>Defendant did not initiate the contact with plaintiff in Massachusetts; rather, it was the other way around. Phillips posted his résumé on a national website, and was actively seeking employment outside of Massachusetts. Yeh never entered Massachusetts herself: it was the plaintiff who physically went to Illinois to be interviewed and to discuss a job.</p>\n<p>A purpose of the foreseeability requirement is that \"personal jurisdiction over nonresidents ... is a quid for a quo that consists of the state's extending protection or other services to the nonresident.\" <i>Sawtelle,</i> 70 F.3d at 1392 (quoting <i>Coté v. Wadel,</i> 796 F.2d 981, 984 (7th Cir.1986)) (alteration omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Moelis,</i> 451 Mass. 483, 887 N.E.2d 214, 219 (noting that jurisdiction is more appropriate \"where nonresidents more intentionally take advantage of favorable State policies\"). There is no indication nor even an allegation that Prairie Eye availed itself of any of the protections of Massachusetts law or any other services provided by the state. <i>See </i><i>Phillips Exeter Acad.,</i> 196 F.3d at 292. Hence, Prairie Eye's contacts with Massachusetts do not constitute sufficiently purposeful availment to allow for the exercise of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Reasonableness</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In addition, the Gestalt factors weigh strongly against the exercise of jurisdiction here. The Gestalt factors measure reasonableness: even \"if such [requisite] contacts exist,\" the court's exercise of jurisdiction \"must comport with `fair play and substantial justice.'\" <i>U.S.S. Yachts, Inc. v. Ocean Yachts, Inc.,</i> 894 F.2d 9, 11 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> (1st Cir.1990) (quoting <i>Burger King,</i> 471 U.S. at 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174).</p>\n<p>We think it would be unfair to subject Prairie Eye to suit in Massachusetts. First, the burden on the defendant is disproportionate. The defendant's principal place of business is in Illinois, and it has no ongoing connection to Massachusetts. As the defendant informed the district court, it plans to call multiple Illinois witnesses in support of its case, all of whom are outside of the jurisdiction of Massachusetts courts.</p>\n<p>Second, while we normally give deference to the plaintiff's choice of forum, <i>see </i><i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 52, as the plaintiff no longer lives in Massachusetts, it is hard to see why it would be less burdensome for him to appear in Illinois than in Massachusetts, save that he has retained a Massachusetts lawyer. In addition, efficient administration of justice can easily be accomplished in Illinois, where the plaintiff has already asserted his claims as counterclaims in the civil action that is currently proceeding against him. <i>See </i><i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 62-63.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, exercising personal jurisdiction over Prairie Eye in Massachusetts would \"offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\" <i>Int'l Shoe,</i> 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154 (quoting <i>Milliken,</i> 311 U.S. at 463, 61 S.Ct. 339) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We describe the case in terms of the plaintiff's submissions because the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction. <i>Adelson v. Hananel,</i> 510 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2007). In its Motion To Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, Prairie Eye attached seven additional e-mails from Yeh to Phillips, most of them dealing with the scheduling of Phillips's August 11 interview. Even if we were to consider the defendant's submissions, they do not create sufficient contacts to satisfy jurisdictional due process requirements.</p>\n<p>[2]  The other two methods, the preponderance method and the likelihood method, usually require an evidentiary hearing. <i>See </i><i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada,</i> 46 F.3d 138, 146 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>[3]  At oral argument, we raised the question as to whether the voluntariness inquiry should be different for an e-mail contact than for a landline telephone, postal, or face-to-face contact. For the latter types of contacts, voluntariness is clear as the originator of the communication must know its destination before initiating the communication. For example, someone mailing a letter must write a physical address, which exists in some jurisdiction, on the envelope. With an e-mail, however, the originator sends a message to an e-mail address, which does not signal the physical location of the recipient. Generally, the recipient can open the e-mail anywhere in the world. In this case, voluntariness may be ambiguous because the originator of the communication may not know in which jurisdiction the communication will be received.

Christopher Phillips, an ophthalmologist who lived at the time in Massachusetts, interviewed in Illinois for a job with Prairie Eye Center, a full service ophthalmology practice. After both parties signed an employment contract for Phillips to go work for Prairie Eye in Illinois, the relationship between the two deteriorated. Phillips never went to work for Prairie Eye.</p>\n<p>He filed suit against Prairie Eye in Massachusetts state court asserting personal jurisdiction over the defendant pursuant to the Massachusetts long-arm statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3. After Prairie Eye removed the case to federal court, the district court found that Prairie Eye lacked the requisite minimum contacts with Massachusetts and dismissed the case. We agree and affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We accept the allegations in the complaint as true and construe the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as we are reviewing a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. <i>Daynard v.

The facts relevant to determining personal jurisdiction are not in dispute.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> Phillips resided in Massachusetts until 2007. In June 2006, Phillips, who was seeking a new job, posted his résumé on the job placement section of the American Academy of Ophthalmology website. Soon thereafter, he received an e-mail invitation for an interview from Sandra Yeh, the owner and president of Prairie Eye Center, located in Springfield, Illinois.</p>\n<p>On August 11, 2006, Phillips flew to Springfield to interview with Yeh and other doctors at Prairie Eye. Afterwards, Prairie Eye sent an unsigned employment contract via first class mail to Phillips in Massachusetts. The contract specifically detailed the terms of employment, including duration, compensation, and duties. The parties dispute how much negotiation of the contract occurred while Phillips was in Illinois, but plaintiff does not contest that the unsigned contract he received contained enough material terms that it could be accepted.</p>\n<p>On August 20, Yeh sent Phillips an e-mail, which Phillips received in Massachusetts, asking whether Phillips had received the employment contract and asking him if there was anything she could do to help his decisionmaking process. This is the first of Yeh's three e-mail contacts with Massachusetts that Phillips put in the record.<sup>[1]</sup> A few hours later, Phillips sent Yeh an e-mail, which Yeh received in Illinois, noting that \"[n]early everything [in the contract] looks great, but I [have] just a couple of minor requests to ask of you.\" Yeh, via an e-mail later that day (and the second of the proffered e-mail contacts), agreed in principle to Phillips's proposed changes and asked him to modify the contract with his changes and mail the contract back to Yeh. Phillips then typed his changes into an addendum, signed the contract and addendum, and the following day, mailed the signed contract and addendum to Yeh in Illinois.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks later, on September 10, Yeh e-mailed Phillips again, in the third and last of the proffered e-mail contacts. Yeh noted that she had made a change to the addendum (specifically with regards to the timing of the partnership offer), and needed Phillips to initial the change and send it back to her. Two days later, Phillips e-mailed Yeh saying, \"I will initial the contract and get the original right out to you.\" He then e-mailed a scanned copy of the initialed contract back to Yeh.</p>\n<p>A copy of the contract, executed by both parties, is in the record. The contract, however, was never performed. Soon after the Phillips e-mailed the contract back to Yeh, the relationship between the two fell apart, and Phillips never went to work for Yeh at Prairie Eye Center. How and why the relationship soured is not relevant to the jurisdictional question presented to us.</p>\n<p>About a month later, on October 20, 2006, Phillips filed suit against Prairie Eye Center in state court in Massachusetts asserting breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and seeking a declaratory judgment that the contract was null and void. The defendant removed the action to federal court and filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. After allowing extensive briefing and holding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> a motion hearing, the district court dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction by a docket notation.</p>\n<p>While this case was on appeal, the defendant, Prairie Eye Center, filed a breach of contract action against Phillips in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois seeking damages and declaratory relief. Phillips, who has since moved to the state of Washington, moved for a stay of that proceeding because of the pending appeal in this case. The federal district court in Illinois denied the stay, and Phillips has asserted the claims he makes here as counterclaims in that case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Standard of Review and Burden of Proof</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. <i>Adelson v. Hananel,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The district court \"may choose from among several methods for determining whether the plaintiff has met [its] burden.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 50-51) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing but credited the plaintiff's evidentiary submissions, we construe the court's ruling as employing the prima facie method.<sup>[2]</sup> This is \"the least taxing of these standards from a plaintiff's standpoint.\" <i>Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197406\"><a href=\"/opinion/197406/alers-rodriguez-v-national-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83-84 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>Under the prima facie standard, the inquiry is whether the plaintiff has proffered evidence which, if credited, is sufficient to support findings of all facts essential to personal jurisdiction. <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 51.

Phillips bases his claim of specific personal jurisdiction over Prairie Eye on the Massachusetts long-arm statute. We proceed directly to the constitutional analysis, \"because the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted the state's long-arm statute `as an assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.'\" <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 52 (quoting <i>\"</i><i>Automatic\" Sprinkler Corp. of Am. v.

For specific jurisdiction, the constitutional analysis is divided into three categories: relatedness, purposeful availment, and reasonableness.</p>\n<blockquote>First, the claim underlying the litigation must directly arise out of, or relate to, the defendant's forum-state activities. Second, the defendant's in-state contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable. Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 49 (quoting <i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 60). The plaintiff must demonstrate that each of these three requirements is satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Relatedness</i>\n</h2>\n<p>\"The evidence produced to support specific jurisdiction must show that the cause of action either arises directly out of, or is related to, the defendant's forum-based contacts.\" <i>Harlow,</i> 432 F.3d at 60-61 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 49. There must be more than just an attenuated connection between the contacts and the claim; \"the defendant's in-state conduct must form an `important, or [at least] material, element of proof' in the plaintiff's case.\" <i>Harlow,</i> 432 F.3d at 61 (quoting <i>United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580868\"><a href=\"/opinion/580868/united-electrical-radio-and-machine-workers-of-america-v-163-pleasant/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1080</span></a></span>, 1089 (1st Cir.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Phillips brings both a contract claim, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and a tort claim, breach of fiduciary duty. Although the standard for relatedness for a tort claim is typically different from that of a contract claim, <i>Jet Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc. v. Bacardi &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200035\"><a href=\"/opinion/200035/jet-wine-spirits-v-bacardi-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2002), here the two claims are sufficiently connected that the difference is of no concern. Phillips's claim for breach of fiduciary duty concerns the formation of his employment contract. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> (noting that when \"the tort is intentional interference with a contractual ... relationship, the two inquiries begin to resemble each other\"). Thus, here, we look to whether \"the defendant's activity in the forum state was `instrumental either in the formation of the contract or its breach.'\" <i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 49 (quoting <i>Phillips Exeter Acad. v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766721\"><a href=\"/opinion/766721/phillips-exeter-academy-v-howard-phillips-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 289 (1st Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p>Phillips's case does not contain the typical factors which have led us to conclude there is sufficient relatedness. This is unlike cases where the specific terms of an employment contract were \"formalized and entered into\" in the forum state, and where the employee was subject to \"substantial control and ongoing connection to [the forum state] in the performance of this contract.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, Phillips provided no evidence that any negotiations took place in Massachusetts. In fact, the unsigned employment contract sent to Phillips shortly after his interview in Illinois is both definite and detailed, and it precedes the three e-mails from Yeh to Phillips. Still, Phillips's claim does arise out of his contractual relationship with Prairie Eye Center and, accepting his allegations as true, Yeh's communications to Phillips, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> which he received in Massachusetts, were in bad faith. <i>See </i><i>Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 61. That said, we will assume arguendo that the plaintiff established sufficient relatedness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Purposeful Availment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Phillips must also show that Prairie Eye purposefully availed itself of \"the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Foster-Miller,</i> 46 F.3d at 144) (internal quotation mark omitted). As the formulation suggests, purposeful availment involves both voluntariness and foreseeability. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 50. Voluntariness requires that the defendant's contacts with the forum state \"proximately result from actions by the defendant <i>himself.\" </i><i>Burger King Corp. v.

The contacts must be deliberate, and \"not based on the unilateral actions of another party.\" <i>Adelson,</i> 510 F.3d at 50 (citing <i>Burger King,</i> 471 U.S. at 475, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Foreseeability requires that the contacts also must be of a nature that the defendant could \"reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

Prairie Eye does not contest that it knew Phillips was in Massachusetts when Yeh wrote the e-mails.</p>\n<p>Phillips relies on these facts to argue that because he accepted the contract in Massachusetts, Prairie Eye should have foreseen that it could be haled into court in Massachusetts. We have held, however, in a variety of contexts, that the defendant's awareness of the location of the plaintiff is not, on its own, enough to create personal jurisdiction over a defendant. When a patient argued that jurisdiction in Maine over a Massachusetts hospital was proper because the defendant knew plaintiff resided in Maine, we noted: \"Jurisdiction cannot be created by and does not travel with the plaintiff patient wherever she goes.\" <i>Harlow,</i> 432 F.3d at 63; <i>see also </i><i>Sawtelle v.

When a plaintiff tire manufacturer argued that a defendant rim manufacturer was subject to personal jurisdiction in Puerto Rico, we noted that even if the defendant had specific knowledge that the stream of commerce would move its tire rims into Puerto Rico, \"awareness alone would not be enough to constitute the purposeful availment which is necessary for a showing of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> minimum contacts.\" <i>Rodriguez,</i> 115 F.3d at 85 (citing <i>Asahi Metal Indus.

It stretches too far to say that Prairie Eye, by mailing a contract with full terms to Massachusetts for signature and following up with three e-mails concerning the logistics of signing the contract, should have known that it was rendering itself liable to suit in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently found personal jurisdiction over nonresident plaintiffs did not comport with due process where the only contacts consisted of a purchase of an insurance policy from a Massachusetts insurer and the mailing of premium payments to Massachusetts. <i>Moelis v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span> (quoting <i>Milliken,</i> 311 U.S. at 463, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></span>) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We describe the case in terms of the plaintiff's submissions because the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction. <i>Adelson v. Hananel,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span>, 48 (1st Cir. 2007). In its Motion To Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, Prairie Eye attached seven additional e-mails from Yeh to Phillips, most of them dealing with the scheduling of Phillips's August 11 interview. Even if we were to consider the defendant's submissions, they do not create sufficient contacts to satisfy jurisdictional due process requirements.</p>\n<p>[2]  The other two methods, the preponderance method and the likelihood method, usually require an evidentiary hearing. <i>See </i><i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195899\"><a href=\"/opinion/195899/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 146 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>[3]  At oral argument, we raised the question as to whether the voluntariness inquiry should be different for an e-mail contact than for a landline telephone, postal, or face-to-face contact. For the latter types of contacts, voluntariness is clear as the originator of the communication must know its destination before initiating the communication. For example, someone mailing a letter must write a physical address, which exists in some jurisdiction, on the envelope. With an e-mail, however, the originator sends a message to an e-mail address, which does not signal the physical location of the recipient. Generally, the recipient can open the e-mail anywhere in the world. In this case, voluntariness may be ambiguous because the originator of the communication may not know in which jurisdiction the communication will be received. This case does not turn on these issues, though.</p>\n\n</div>",
