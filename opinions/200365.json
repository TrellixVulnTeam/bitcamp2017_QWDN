D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n          Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Andrew J. Gallogly with whom Margolis Edelstein was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Catherine R. Connors with whom Louise K. Thomas and Pierce\nAtwood were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 4, 2003\n\f        COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.             A Maine company, Auto Europe,\n\nLLC, brought this diversity action against Connecticut Indemnity\n\nCompany (\"CI\"), seeking a declaratory judgment that the insurance\n\ncompany has a duty to defend Auto Europe in a pending consumer\n\nfraud suit.     The district court, over CI's objection, concluded\n\nthat Maine is the proper venue for the coverage dispute, Maine\n\nsubstantive law governs it, and CI has a duty to defend Auto\n\nEurope.      After careful review of the law and the record, we\n\nconclude     that    CI's    challenges          to    those     determinations      are\n\nunavailing.         We   also     affirm    the       district    court's    award    of\n\nattorney's fees against the insurer.1\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n      Auto Europe is a defendant in a lawsuit (\"the Harter action\")\n\nfiled in June 2001 by four Illinois residents who claim that the\n\nMaine     company    and    two    other    travel       businesses     \"deceptively\n\nconcealed\" an \"add-on\" to their charges for foreign car rentals.\n\nThe   Harter   plaintiffs         contend   that       the   defendants     calculated\n\nforeign sales tax on a car rental base price that included a non-\n\ntaxable broker's fee, effectively increasing the brokers' fees in\n\nthe guise of a charge they claimed was a foreign tax.                                The\n\n\n      1\n       Auto Europe's complaint contained a second count for breach\nof contract, which, as the magistrate judge noted, was subsidiary\nto the primary count seeking a declaratory judgment on the duty to\ndefend: \"[I]t necessarily follows that, if a duty to defend exists\nand the insurer has refused to provide a defense, the contract has\nbeen breached.\"     Recommended Decision at 12.     We agree and\ntherefore do not separately discuss the contract claim.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fcomplaint alleged that the price information given to consumers was\n\n\"designed to mislead and conceal\" the nature of the additional\n\ncharge, and it accused the defendants of engaging in a \"fraudulent\n\nscheme of overcharges.\"     The complaint alleged various violations\n\nof federal and state law, including both the Maine and Illinois\n\nconsumer fraud acts.\n\n      CI coincidentally insured all three Harter defendants under\n\nseparate policies, each of which provided the same coverage.          Auto\n\nEurope's policy promises payment for all sums that the insured\n\nbecomes obligated to pay because of \"any negligent act, error or\n\nomission of the 'insured' . . . in the conduct of 'travel agency\n\noperations' by the 'named insured.'\" The policy excludes coverage,\n\nhowever, for \"liability arising out of any act, error or omission\n\nwhich is wilfully dishonest, fraudulent or malicious, or in wilful\n\nviolation of any penal or criminal statute or ordinances, and is\n\ncommitted (or omitted) by or with the knowledge or consent of the\n\n'insured.'\"\n\n      Based on the exclusion, CI refused to defend Auto Europe in\n\nthe Harter action, and Auto Europe thereafter filed this suit.2\n\nCI   filed   a   counterclaim   in   the   Maine   litigation,   seeking   a\n\n\n      2\n       Auto Europe also sought defense from another of its\ninsurers, Commercial Union, based on a different policy.\nCommercial Union sought a declaratory judgment in Illinois on its\nduty to defend, and after rejecting Auto Europe's attempt to\ntransfer that action to Maine, the Illinois court ruled that\nCommercial Union did not have a duty to defend based on an\nexclusion not contained in the CI policy.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdeclaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend, and it filed\n\nsuit in Illinois against all three Harter defendants, seeking that\n\nsame relief.    It also filed a motion in Maine to transfer venue of\n\nAuto Europe's action to Illinois.\n\n     The magistrate judge in Maine denied the transfer motion,\n\ndetermined that Maine law applied to the action, and concluded that\n\nCI had a duty to defend Auto Europe.        The district court, after a\n\nde novo review that included oral argument, affirmed the decision\n\ndenying transfer of venue and adopted the magistrate judge's\n\nrecommendation that summary judgment be granted for Auto Europe on\n\nthe duty to defend.        Under Maine law authorizing an award of\n\nattorney's fees to an insured when the insurer's duty to defend was\n\n\"clear,\" the district court awarded reasonable fees and costs to\n\nAuto Europe.3\n\n     Subsequently, the district court in Illinois also ruled, in\n\nthe lawsuit filed by CI, that the insurer had a duty to defend in\n\nthe Harter action.       That ruling, applying Illinois law, was not\n\ndirectly applicable to Auto Europe, however, because the Maine\n\ncompany had been dismissed from the Illinois proceedings.\n\n     In its appeal of the Maine decision, CI argues that the\n\ndistrict   court,   as   reflected    in   the   decisions   of   both   the\n\nmagistrate judge and district judge, erred on the procedural issues\n\n\n     3\n       The district court also dismissed without prejudice, as\npremature,   CI's  request  for  a   declaratory  judgment  on\nindemnification.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fof venue and choice of law as well as in finding a duty to defend\n\nunder Maine law.    The insurer further objects to the imposition of\n\nattorney's fees and costs.      We address each issue in turn.\n\n                   II. The Motion to Transfer Venue4\n\n     The propriety of the venue ruling warrants little discussion.\n\nThe magistrate judge fully considered and discussed CI's motion and\n\nits judgment, particularly when affirmed by the district court, is\n\nentitled to considerable deference.           See Osband v. Woodford, 290\n\nF.3d 1036, 1041 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting that magistrate judge's\n\npretrial order is reversible by the district court, under 28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 636(b)(1)(A), only if it is \"'clearly erroneous or contrary to\n\nlaw,'\" and that same standard applies to appellate review); Phinney\n\nv. Wentworth Douglas Hosp., 199 F.3d 1, 4 (lst Cir. 1999) (same);\n\nsee also Coady v. Ashcraft & Gerel, 223 F.3d 1, 11 (lst Cir. 2000)\n\n(appellate    standard   of   review    for   venue   motion   is   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion).\n\n     Although it may have been more efficient to determine CI's\n\nduty to defend with respect to all three Harter defendants in the\n\nsame forum, we do not agree that the district court was obliged to\n\ntransfer the case to Illinois.         Its reasons for declining to do so\n\n\n\n     4\n         The motion invoked 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a), which states:\n\n          For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the\n     interest of justice, a district court may transfer any\n     civil action to any other district or division where it\n     might have been brought.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwere sound and appropriate, focusing on the weight accorded to\n\nplaintiff's choice of the forum in which it is located, the\n\nunlikelihood   of    any   witness     inconvenience     because    of     the\n\nprobability of a document-based determination of the duty to\n\ndefend, and    the   absence   of   any    compelling   reason   related    to\n\njudicial economy. We therefore find no error in the court's denial\n\nof the transfer motion.\n\n                           III. Choice of Law\n\n     CI next challenges the district court's decision to apply\n\nMaine law to the coverage dispute.           A federal court sitting in\n\ndiversity jurisdiction must employ the choice-of-law principles of\n\nthe forum state, Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S.\n\n487, 491 (1941); Crellin Techs., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., 18\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (lst Cir. 1994), and the district court's choice of law\n\npursuant to the state framework is reviewed de novo, Crellin\n\nTechs., 18 F.3d at 4.\n\n     Under Maine law, when an insurance contract does not specify\n\nthe jurisdiction that should govern disputes arising under it,\n\n     the rights and duties of the parties . . . are to be\n     determined at the forum level by the local law of the\n     state which, with respect to that particular issue, has\n     the most significant relationship to the transaction and\n     the parties. Specifically, in a casualty insurance\n     contract . . . the validity of the contract and the\n     rights and duties created thereby, are to be determined\n     . . . by the local law of the state which the parties\n     understood was to be the principal location of the\n     insured risk during the term of the policy, unless with\n     respect to the particular issue involved, some state has\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f     a more significant relationship to the transaction and\n     the parties . . . .\n\nBaybutt Constr. Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 455 A.2d 914,\n\n918 (Me. 1983), overruled on other grounds, Peerless Ins. Co. v.\n\nBrennon, 564 A.2d 383 (Me. 1989) (adopting Restatement (Second) of\n\nthe Law, Conflict of Laws 2d (1971) [hereinafter \"Restatement\"], ยงยง\n\n188, 193).\n\n     As with the venue ruling, the magistrate judge offered a\n\nthoughtful assessment of the choice of law question.   Noting that\n\nthe underlying complaint purported to assert the claims of a\n\nnationwide class against Auto Europe, he rejected the relevance of\n\nthe location of the named plaintiffs' individual transactions\n\nbecause \"an unknown number of plaintiffs in an unknown number of\n\nlocations may have claims that fit within the purported class.\" He\n\nalso noted that the complaint alleged that Auto Europe's principal\n\nplace of business was in Portland, Maine, and because no other\n\nbusiness location is identified, \"[b]y terms of the complaint Auto\n\nEurope could only have acted in Maine.\" Recommended Decision at 7.\n\nThe magistrate judge thus viewed Maine as \"the principal location\n\nof the insured risk,\" and ruled that, under Baybutt, Maine law\n\nshould apply.\n\n     CI contends that the law of either Florida or Illinois would\n\nbe more appropriate than Maine law because both \"would appear to\n\nhave more significant interests in this coverage litigation and\n\ngreater contacts with the transactions underlying the dispute than\n\n                               -7-\n\fdoes Maine.\"   According to CI, Florida is significant because the\n\ncontract that provides the insurance coverage at issue in this case\n\nwas negotiated and delivered there to Auto Europe's corporate\n\nparent.    The policy insured more than two dozen affiliates or\n\nsubsidiaries in a variety of locations, and Auto Europe apparently\n\nwas the only one located in Maine.    CI also cites Illinois' central\n\nimportance to this case as the home state of the named plaintiffs\n\nin the Harter litigation. The two plaintiffs who did business with\n\nAuto Europe booked their rental cars through local travel agents in\n\nChicago, and Illinois is also where the underlying lawsuit is\n\npending.\n\n     We can easily eliminate the law of Florida as more appropriate\n\nthan Maine law for resolving the coverage issue.      Our reading of\n\nthe authorities indicates that a policy covering numerous related\n\ncompanies located in different states would be deemed a multiple\n\nrisk policy that, for Maine choice of law purposes, would be viewed\n\nin a particular case as if a separate policy had been issued to\n\ncover each entity.   See Baybutt, 455 A.2d at 919; Restatement, ยง\n\n193, comment f.   Because Florida's status stems only from its role\n\nwith respect to the overall policy, its significance in this case\n\nthus drops away, and the question becomes whether Maine โ Auto\n\nEurope's principal location โ should provide the substantive legal\n\nprinciples, or whether, \"with respect to the particular issue\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\finvolved, [Illinois] has a more significant relationship to the\n\ntransaction and the parties,\" Baybutt, 455 A.2d at 918.\n\n     We think the district court got it right.     Auto Europe, a\n\nMaine business with offices only in Maine, is alleged to have\n\ncommitted consumer fraud by its conduct in Maine.5    Although the\n\nnamed plaintiffs live in Illinois, and presumably for that reason\n\nfound it convenient to file their lawsuit there, Illinois cannot be\n\nsaid to have a more significant relationship to the parties and\n\ntransaction than does Maine.    To be sure, the plaintiffs' home\n\nstate has a substantial interest in ensuring that its citizens are\n\nnot defrauded by out-of-state companies operating through local\n\nagents.   Under Maine's choice of law principles, however, its own\n\nsubstantial interests take precedence because, as Auto Europe's\n\nhome base, Maine is \"the principal location of the insured risk.\"6\n\n\n\n     5\n       Paragraph 82 of the amended complaint alleges that \"the\ndeceptive pricing and other deceptive acts took place at the Auto\nEurope's principal place of business which is Maine . . . .\"\n     6\n       We recognize that the location of the risk in Baybutt and\nsimilar cases, see, e.g., Gates Formed Fibre Prods., Inc. v.\nPlasti-Vac, Inc., 687 F. Supp. 688 (Me. 1988), differs from the\nscenario here because the underlying plaintiffs in those cases were\nphysically located where the insured activity โ the alleged harm โ\noccurred.   This is not a difference that affects our analysis,\nhowever.   An insured risk is \"'the object or activity which is the\nsubject matter of the insurance,' and 'has its principal location\n. . . in the state where it will be during at least the major\nportion of the insurance period.'\"          Id. at 690 (quoting\nRestatement, ยง 193, comment b).     The insured risk here was the\nconduct of a travel agency whose only business location was in\nMaine; the physical location of its customers does not change the\nlocation of the risk.\n\n                               -9-\n\fThe district court therefore correctly ruled that Maine law governs\n\nthe coverage dispute.7\n\n                         IV. Duty to Defend\n\n     Under Maine law, the duty to defend is determined by means of\n\nthe comparison test: the complaint in the underlying lawsuit is\n\ncompared with the insurance policy to ascertain if \"'there exists\n\nany legal or factual basis which could be developed at trial which\n\nwould obligate the insurers to pay under the policy.'\" United Bank\n\nv. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 168 F.3d 37, 39 (lst Cir. 1999) (quoting\n\nNE Props., Inc. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 660 A.2d 926, 927 (Me.\n\n1995)); see also Me. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Gervais, 715 A.2d 938,\n\n940 (Me. 1998).\n\n     If the complaint shows even a possibility that the events\n     giving rise to it are within the policy coverage, the\n     insurer must defend the suit.     Any ambiguity must be\n     resolved in favor of a duty to defend.\n\nMass. Bay Ins. Co. v. Ferraiolo Constr. Co., 584 A.2d 608, 609 (Me.\n\n1990); see also York Ins. Group of Maine v. Lambert, 740 A.2d 984,\n\n985 (Me. 1999).\n\n\n\n     7\n       We offer two passing thoughts. First, as the magistrate\njudge observed and our discussion reveals, CI's complaint about\ninadequate opportunity for discovery is without force; the\ninformation it sought to obtain, regarding other insureds on the\npolicy with Auto Europe, was unnecessary for the choice-of-law\ninquiry because the information already available showed that the\ncovered businesses were located in various states. Second, on the\nprimary substantive issue โ the duty to defend โ the choice of law\nis likely of no consequence because the relevant law in Maine and\nIllinois, and probably Florida as well, appears to be the same.\nSee infra at 11-13.\n\n                               -10-\n\f     The magistrate judge, affirmed by the district court, found a\n\nduty to defend based on the possibility that the proof at trial\n\nwould establish a non-intentional violation of the Maine Unfair\n\nTrade Practices Act (UTPA), Me. Rev. St. Ann. tit. 5, ยงยง 205-A-214\n\n(West 2002).8     CI contends that the district court erred because\n\nthe Harter complaint alleges only intentional fraud, bringing it\n\nwithin the policy exclusion for willfully dishonest or fraudulent\n\nacts.    CI   cites   caselaw     from    Illinois     and   Florida    for   the\n\nproposition that coverage is unavailable under exclusions similar\n\nto the one here when the complaint is limited to allegations of\n\nintentional     conduct,   even   if     the   facts   would   have    permitted\n\nrecovery based on theories not covered by the exclusion.                      See,\n\ne.g., Fed. Ins. Co. v. Applestein, 377 So.2d 229, 231 (Fla. App.\n\n1979) (holding that, notwithstanding policy coverage for libel and\n\nslander generally, allegations that comments were made \"'with\n\nmalice'\" and \"in a specific 'attempt to discredit'\" the underlying\n\nplaintiff \"completely negate coverage by conclusively establishing\n\nthat the exclusion applies\"); United Fire & Cas. Co. v. Jim Maloof\n\nRealty, Inc., 435 N.E.2d 496, 498-99 (Ill. App. 1982) (\"[S]ince the\n\nfactual allegations of the complaint are premised upon only one\n\ntheory of recovery, that of intentional fraud, and do not fall\n\nwithin the potential coverage of the insurance policy, United has\n\n\n     8\n       An act may be deceptive under the statute \"even though the\ndefendant had no purpose to deceive and acted in good faith.\"\nBinette v. Dyer Library Ass'n, 688 A.2d 898, 906 (Me. 1996).\n\n                                       -11-\n\fno duty to defend its insureds.\").           CI argues that the Maine\n\ncomparison test requires the same result, although it notes that no\n\nMaine    cases   have   explicitly   addressed   the   circumstance   of   a\n\ncomplaint alleging only intentional conduct where recovery based on\n\nless-than-intentional conduct also could have been sought.\n\n     Although we doubt that CI could prevail even under the law of\n\nFlorida or Illinois where, as here, the relevant cause of action\n\ndoes not require intentional conduct for recovery,9 we are certain\n\nthat, under Maine law, CI's argument is without merit.          We simply\n\nnote, in passing, that some of the cases relied upon by CI are\n\ndistinguishable because they involved either underlying causes of\n\naction limited to intentional conduct, see, e.g., Ill. Farmers Ins.\n\n\n\n     9\n       In the action filed by CI in Illinois against the other\nHarter defendants, the district court observed that Maine and\nIllinois law are \"analogous . . . on an insurer's duty to defend,\"\nConn. Indem. Co. v. Auto Europe, LLC, 2002 WL 1806891 (N.D. Ill.),\nat *5, and, applying Illinois law, the court found a duty to defend\nthe claim brought under the Illinois consumer fraud statute, noting\nthat \"[t]he complaint does not clearly preclude . . . liability\nunder a reckless or negligence standard, or even through proof of\nan innocent misrepresentation,\" id. at *4. See also Knoll Pharm.\nCo. v. Auto. Ins. Co. of Hartford, 152 F. Supp.2d 1026, 1034 (N.D.\nIll. 2001) (\"If the underlying complaint alleges facts that fall\nwithin, or even potentially within, the coverage outlined in the\nrelevant policy, the insurer owes a duty to defend.\"). Florida\ncases also impose a duty when there is a \"potential\" for coverage.\nSee, e.g., Lime Tree Vill. Cmty. Club Ass'n, Inc. v. State Farm\nGen. Ins. Co., 980 F.2d 1402, 1406 (11th Cir. 1993) (\"The insurer\nmust defend when the complaint alleges facts which fairly and\npotentially bring the suit within policy coverage.\"); Cabezas v.\nFla. Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co., 830 So.2d 156, 158 (Fla. App. 2002)\n(\"If the allegations in a complaint when fairly read[] allege facts\nwhich create potential coverage under the policy, the insurer must\ndefend the lawsuit.\")(emphasis omitted).\n\n                                     -12-\n\fCo. v. Preston, 505 N.E.2d 1343, 1347 (Ill. App. 1987) (noting that\n\nthe claim assertedly within the policy's coverage was based on 42\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1983, which offers \"no remedy . . . based upon the mere\n\nnegligence of the defendant\"); Jim Maloof Realty, Inc., 435 N.E.2d\n\nat 498-99 (observing that underlying complaint \"essentially states\n\none cause of action, that of intentional fraud\"), or factual\n\nsituations   that   foreclosed   the     possibility   of     unintentional\n\nconduct, see, e.g.,   Rubloff, Inc. v. Am. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co., 1997\n\nWL 264327, at *6 (N.D. Ill.) (\"negligent conduct is not even a\n\ntheoretical possibility under [the] complaint\").            In other words,\n\nin these cases, the theory of relief chosen by the underlying\n\nplaintiff depended upon a showing of deliberate conduct, placing\n\nany possible recovery outside the policy's coverage, and leaving\n\nthe insurer with no duty to defend.\n\n     Here, by contrast, not only does the cause of action at issue\n\nโ the Maine UTPA โ permit liability in the absence of an intent to\n\ndeceive, but Maine law also broadly extends the duty to defend to\n\nclaims that could be developed either legally or factually at trial\n\nso as to fall within the policy's coverage.            Like the district\n\ncourt, we think it certainly possible in this case that the facts\n\nas developed at trial would reveal an improper practice that was\n\nunaccompanied by an intent to deceive.             Thus, even if a jury\n\nrejected   the   Harter   plaintiffs'    precise   theory    of   deliberate\n\nmisrepresentation, they would retain the possibility of recovery\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\funder the UTPA.         CI consequently is obliged to defend the Harter\n\nlawsuit.    See, e.g., Me. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 715 A.2d at 942\n\n(\"[B]ecause      [the    underlying   defendant]    may    be    found   to   have\n\nintentionally inflicted emotional distress without subjectively\n\nintending or foreseeing the alleged distress suffered by [the\n\nplaintiff], the exclusion for intended or expected bodily injury is\n\ninapplicable.\").\n\n     In sum, when the cause of action alleged as the basis for\n\nliability does not include elements that would foreclose coverage,\n\nand where the events giving rise to the complaint may be shown at\n\ntrial to fall within the policy's coverage, Maine law entitles the\n\ninsured to a defense.         See id.    Indeed, we suspect that Maine's\n\ninclusive approach to the duty to defend is designed precisely for\n\ncircumstances such as these โ where a narrow reading of the\n\ncomplaint's factual allegations might preclude coverage, but the\n\nalleged cause of action is sufficiently broad that a modified\n\nversion of the facts could be developed at trial to show liability.\n\n    The district court therefore properly ruled that CI has a duty\n\nto defend the Harter lawsuit.\n\n                              V.

Our review of the district court's decision is de novo.             Id.\n\n      Without elaborating, the district court concluded that Auto\n\nEurope was entitled to fees \"because the duty to defend was and is\n\nclear.\"     We   agree    with   that   conclusion.     Although   CI   might\n\nlegitimately     have    entertained    some   doubts   about   whether   the\n\ncomparison test inevitably required a defense in all three relevant\n\njurisdictions,10 the case law in each is unequivocal in directing\n\nthat any lack of clarity must be resolved in favor of the insured.\n\nSee Ferraiolo Constr.

The district court, over CI's objection, concluded that Maine is the proper venue for the coverage dispute, Maine substantive law governs it, and CI has a duty to defend Auto Europe. After careful review of the law and the record, we conclude that CI's challenges to those determinations are unavailing. We also affirm the district court's award of attorney's fees against the insurer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Auto Europe is a defendant in a lawsuit (\"the Harter action\") filed in June 2001 by four Illinois residents who claim that the Maine company and two other travel businesses \"deceptively concealed\" an \"add-on\" to their charges for foreign car rentals. The Harter plaintiffs contend that the defendants calculated foreign sales tax on a car rental base price that included a nontaxable broker's fee, effectively increasing the brokers' fees in the guise of a charge they claimed was a foreign tax. The complaint alleged that the price information given to consumers was \"designed to mislead and conceal\" the nature of the additional charge, and it accused the defendants of engaging in a \"fraudulent scheme of overcharges.\" The complaint alleged various violations of federal and state law, including both the Maine and Illinois consumer fraud acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CI coincidentally insured all three Harter defendants under separate policies, each of which provided the same coverage. Auto Europe's policy promises payment for all sums that the insured becomes obligated to pay because of \"any negligent act, error or omission of the `insured' ... in the conduct of `travel agency operations' by the `named insured.'\" The policy excludes coverage, however, for \"liability arising out of any act, error or omission which is wilfully dishonest, fraudulent or malicious, or in wilful violation of any penal or criminal statute or ordinances, and is committed (or omitted) by or with the knowledge or consent of the `insured.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the exclusion, CI refused to defend Auto Europe in the Harter action, and Auto Europe thereafter filed this suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> CI filed a counterclaim in the Maine litigation, seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend, and it filed suit in Illinois against all three Harter defendants, seeking that same relief. It also filed a motion in Maine to transfer venue of Auto Europe's action to Illinois.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge in Maine denied the transfer motion, determined that Maine law applied to the action, and concluded that CI had a duty to defend Auto Europe. The district court, after a de novo review that included oral argument, affirmed the decision denying transfer of venue and adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that summary judgment be granted for Auto Europe on the duty to defend. Under Maine law authorizing an award of attorney's fees to an insured when the insurer's duty to defend was \"clear,\" the district court awarded reasonable fees and costs to Auto Europe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the district court in Illinois also ruled, in the lawsuit filed by CI, that the insurer had a duty to defend in the Harter action. That ruling, applying Illinois law, was not directly applicable to Auto Europe, however, because the Maine company had been dismissed from the Illinois proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its appeal of the Maine decision, CI argues that the district court, as reflected in the decisions of both the magistrate judge and district judge, erred on the procedural issues of venue and choice of law as well as in finding a duty to defend under Maine law. The insurer further objects to the imposition of attorney's fees and costs. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>The Motion to Transfer Venue</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The propriety of the venue ruling warrants little discussion. The magistrate judge fully considered and discussed CI's motion and its judgment, particularly when affirmed by the district court, is entitled to considerable deference. <i>See Osband v. Woodford,</i> 290 F.3d 1036, 1041 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting that magistrate judge's pretrial order is reversible by the district court, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(A), only if it is \"`clearly erroneous or contrary to law,'\" and that same standard applies to appellate review); <i>Phinney v. Wentworth Douglas Hosp.,</i> 199 F.3d 1, 4 (lst Cir.1999) (same); <i>see also Coady v. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel,</i> 223 F.3d 1, 11 (lst Cir.2000) (appellate standard of review for venue motion is abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it may have been more efficient to determine CI's duty to defend with respect to all three Harter defendants in the same forum, we do not agree that the district court was obliged to transfer the case to Illinois. Its reasons for declining to do so were sound and appropriate, focusing on the weight accorded to plaintiff's choice of the forum in which it is located, the unlikelihood of any witness inconvenience because of the probability of a document-based determination of the duty to defend, and the absence of any compelling reason related to judicial economy. We therefore find no error in the court's denial of the transfer motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Choice of Law</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CI next challenges the district court's decision to apply Maine law to the coverage dispute. A federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must employ the choice-of-law principles of the forum state, <i>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co.,</i> 313 U.S. 487, 491, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941); <i>Crellin Techs., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp.,</i> 18 F.3d 1, 4 (lst Cir.1994), and the district court's choice of law pursuant to the state framework is reviewed <i>de novo, Crellin Techs.,</i> 18 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, when an insurance contract does not specify the jurisdiction that should govern disputes arising under it,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the rights and duties of the parties ... are to be determined at the forum level by the local law of the state which, with respect to that particular issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties. Specifically, in a casualty insurance contract ... the validity of the contract and the rights and duties created thereby, are to be determined ... by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy, unless with respect to the particular issue involved, some state has a more significant relationship to the transaction and the parties .... <i>Baybutt Constr. Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> 455 A.2d 914, 918 (Me.1983), <i>overruled on other grounds, Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon,</i> 564 A.2d 383 (Me.1989) (adopting Restatement (Second) of the Law, Conflict of Laws 2d (1971) [hereinafter \"Restatement\"], &#167;&#167; 188, 193).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with the venue ruling, the magistrate judge offered a thoughtful assessment of the choice of law question. Noting that the underlying complaint purported to assert the claims of a nationwide class against Auto Europe, he rejected the relevance of the location of the named plaintiffs' individual transactions because \"an unknown number of plaintiffs in an unknown number of locations may have claims that fit within the purported class.\" He also noted that the complaint alleged that Auto Europe's principal place of business was in Portland, Maine, and because no other business location is identified, \"[b]y terms of the complaint Auto Europe could only have acted in Maine.\" Recommended Decision at 7. The magistrate judge thus viewed Maine as \"the principal location of the insured risk,\" and ruled that, under <i>Baybutt,</i> Maine law should apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CI contends that the law of either Florida or Illinois would be more appropriate than Maine law because both \"would appear to have more significant interests in this coverage litigation and greater contacts with the transactions underlying the dispute than does Maine.\" According to CI, Florida is significant because the contract that provides the insurance coverage at issue in this case was negotiated and delivered there to Auto Europe's corporate parent. The policy insured more than two dozen affiliates or subsidiaries in a variety of locations, and Auto Europe apparently was the only one located in Maine. CI also cites Illinois' central importance to this case as the home state of the named plaintiffs in the Harter litigation. The two plaintiffs who did business with Auto Europe booked their rental cars through local travel agents in Chicago, and Illinois is also where the underlying lawsuit is pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can easily eliminate the law of Florida as more appropriate than Maine law for resolving the coverage issue. Our reading of the authorities indicates that a policy covering numerous related companies located in different states would be deemed a multiple risk policy that, for Maine choice of law purposes, would be viewed in a particular case as if a separate policy had been issued to cover each entity. <i>See Baybutt,</i> 455 A.2d at 919; Restatement, &#167; 193, comment f. Because Florida's status stems only from its role with respect to the overall policy, its significance in this case thus drops away, and the question becomes whether Maine &#8212; Auto Europe's principal location &#8212; should provide the substantive legal principles, or whether, \"with respect to the particular issue involved, [Illinois] has a more significant relationship to the transaction and the parties,\" <i>Baybutt,</i> 455 A.2d at 918.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the district court got it right. Auto Europe, a Maine business with offices only in Maine, is alleged to have committed consumer fraud by its conduct in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Although the named plaintiffs live in Illinois, and presumably for that reason found it convenient to file their lawsuit there, Illinois cannot be said to have a more significant relationship to the parties and transaction than does Maine. To be sure, the plaintiffs' home state has a substantial interest in ensuring that its citizens are not defrauded by out-of-state companies operating through local agents. Under Maine's choice of law principles, however, its own substantial interests take precedence because, as Auto Europe's home base, Maine is \"the principal location of the insured risk.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court therefore correctly ruled that Maine law governs the coverage dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>Duty to Defend</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, the duty to defend is determined by means of the comparison test: the complaint in the underlying lawsuit is compared with the insurance policy to ascertain if \"`there exists any legal or factual basis which could be developed at trial which would obligate the insurers to pay under the policy.'\" <i>United Bank v.

St. Ann. tit. 5, &#167;&#167; 205-A-214 (West 2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> CI contends that the district court erred because the Harter complaint alleges only intentional fraud, bringing it within the policy exclusion for willfully dishonest or fraudulent acts. CI cites caselaw from Illinois and Florida for the proposition that coverage is unavailable under exclusions similar to the one here when the complaint is limited to allegations of intentional conduct, even if the facts would have permitted recovery based on theories not covered by the exclusion. <i>See, e.g., Fed. Ins. Co. v. Applestein,</i> 377 So.2d 229, 231 (Fla.App.1979) (holding that, notwithstanding policy coverage for libel and slander generally, allegations that comments were made \"`with malice'\" and \"in a specific `attempt to discredit'\" the underlying plaintiff \"completely negate coverage by conclusively establishing that the exclusion applies\"); <i>United Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Jim Maloof Realty, Inc.,</i> 105 Ill.App.3d 1048, 61 Ill.Dec. 799, 435 N.E.2d 496, 498-99 (1982) (\"[S]ince the factual allegations of the complaint are premised upon only one theory of recovery, that of intentional fraud, and do not fall within the potential coverage of the insurance policy, United has no duty to defend its insureds.\"). CI argues that the Maine comparison test requires the same result, although it notes that no Maine cases have explicitly addressed the circumstance of a complaint alleging only intentional conduct where recovery based on less-than-intentional conduct also could have been sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we doubt that CI could prevail even under the law of Florida or Illinois where, as here, the relevant cause of action does not require intentional conduct for recovery,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> we are certain that, under Maine law, CI's argument is without merit. We simply note, in passing, that some of the cases relied upon by CI are distinguishable because they involved either underlying causes of action limited to intentional conduct, <i>see, e.g., Ill. Farmers Ins. Co. v. Preston,</i> 153 Ill.App.3d 644, 106 Ill.Dec. 552, 505 N.E.2d 1343, 1347 (1987) (noting that the claim assertedly within the policy's coverage was based on 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, which offers \"no remedy ... based upon the mere negligence of the defendant\"); <i>Jim Maloof Realty, Inc.,</i> 61 Ill. Dec. 799, 435 N.E.2d at 498-99 (observing that underlying complaint \"essentially states one cause of action, that of intentional fraud\"), or factual situations that foreclosed the possibility of unintentional conduct, <i>see, e.g., Rubloff, Inc. v. Am. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 1997 WL 264327, at *6 (N.D.Ill.) (\"negligent conduct is not even a theoretical possibility under [the] complaint\"). In other words, in these cases, the theory of relief chosen by the underlying plaintiff depended upon a showing of deliberate conduct, placing any possible recovery outside the policy's coverage, and leaving the insurer with no duty to defend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by contrast, not only does the cause of action at issue &#8212; the Maine UTPA &#8212; permit liability in the absence of an intent to deceive, but Maine law also broadly extends the duty to defend to claims that could be developed either legally or factually at trial so as to fall within the policy's coverage. Like the district court, we think it certainly possible in this case that the facts as developed at trial would reveal an improper practice that was unaccompanied by an intent to deceive. Thus, even if a jury rejected the Harter plaintiffs' precise theory of deliberate misrepresentation, they would retain the possibility of recovery under the UTPA. CI consequently is obliged to defend the Harter lawsuit. <i>See, e.g., Me. Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 715 A.2d at 942 (\"[B]ecause [the underlying defendant] may be found to have intentionally inflicted emotional distress without subjectively intending or foreseeing the alleged distress suffered by [the plaintiff], the exclusion for intended or expected bodily injury is inapplicable.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, when the cause of action alleged as the basis for liability does not include elements that would foreclose coverage, and where the events giving rise to the complaint may be shown at trial to fall within the policy's coverage, Maine law entitles the insured to a defense. <i>See id.</i> Indeed, we suspect that Maine's inclusive approach to the duty to defend is designed precisely for circumstances such as these &#8212; where a narrow reading of the complaint's factual allegations might preclude coverage, but the alleged cause of action is sufficiently broad that a modified version of the facts could be developed at trial to show liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court therefore properly ruled that CI has a duty to defend the Harter lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">V. <i>Attorney's Fees</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Auto Europe sought reimbursement of the attorney's fees incurred in pursuing this declaratory judgment action, and following the district court's grant of that request, the parties stipulated to the amount of $42,675.91.

Although CI might legitimately have entertained some doubts about whether the comparison test inevitably required a defense in all three relevant jurisdictions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> the case law in each is unequivocal in directing that any lack of clarity must be resolved in favor of the insured. <i>See Ferraiolo Const.

The district court, over CI's objection, concluded that Maine is the proper venue for the coverage dispute, Maine substantive law governs it, and CI has a duty to defend Auto Europe. After careful review of the law and the record, we conclude that CI's challenges to those determinations are unavailing. We also affirm the district court's award of attorney's fees against the insurer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Auto Europe is a defendant in a lawsuit (\"the Harter action\") filed in June 2001 by four Illinois residents who claim that the Maine company and two other travel businesses \"deceptively concealed\" an \"add-on\" to their charges for foreign car rentals. The Harter plaintiffs contend that the defendants calculated foreign sales tax on a car rental base price that included a nontaxable broker's fee, effectively increasing the brokers' fees in the guise of a charge they claimed was a foreign tax. The complaint alleged that the price information given to consumers was \"designed to mislead and conceal\" the nature of the additional charge, and it accused the defendants of engaging in a \"fraudulent scheme of overcharges.\" The complaint alleged various violations of federal and state law, including both the Maine and Illinois consumer fraud acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CI coincidentally insured all three Harter defendants under separate policies, each of which provided the same coverage. Auto Europe's policy promises payment for all sums that the insured becomes obligated to pay because of \"any negligent act, error or omission of the `insured' ... in the conduct of `travel agency operations' by the `named insured.'\" The policy excludes coverage, however, for \"liability arising out of any act, error or omission which is wilfully dishonest, fraudulent or malicious, or in wilful violation of any penal or criminal statute or ordinances, and is committed (or omitted) by or with the knowledge or consent of the `insured.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the exclusion, CI refused to defend Auto Europe in the Harter action, and Auto Europe thereafter filed this suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> CI filed a counterclaim in the Maine litigation, seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend, and it filed suit in Illinois against all three Harter defendants, seeking that same relief. It also filed a motion in Maine to transfer venue of Auto Europe's action to Illinois.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge in Maine denied the transfer motion, determined that Maine law applied to the action, and concluded that CI had a duty to defend Auto Europe. The district court, after a de novo review that included oral argument, affirmed the decision denying transfer of venue and adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that summary judgment be granted for Auto Europe on the duty to defend. Under Maine law authorizing an award of attorney's fees to an insured when the insurer's duty to defend was \"clear,\" the district court awarded reasonable fees and costs to Auto Europe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the district court in Illinois also ruled, in the lawsuit filed by CI, that the insurer had a duty to defend in the Harter action. That ruling, applying Illinois law, was not directly applicable to Auto Europe, however, because the Maine company had been dismissed from the Illinois proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its appeal of the Maine decision, CI argues that the district court, as reflected in the decisions of both the magistrate judge and district judge, erred on the procedural issues of venue and choice of law as well as in finding a duty to defend under Maine law. The insurer further objects to the imposition of attorney's fees and costs. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>The Motion to Transfer Venue</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The propriety of the venue ruling warrants little discussion. The magistrate judge fully considered and discussed CI's motion and its judgment, particularly when affirmed by the district court, is entitled to considerable deference. <i>See Osband v.

Its reasons for declining to do so were sound and appropriate, focusing on the weight accorded to plaintiff's choice of the forum in which it is located, the unlikelihood of any witness inconvenience because of the probability of a document-based determination of the duty to defend, and the absence of any compelling reason related to judicial economy. We therefore find no error in the court's denial of the transfer motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Choice of Law</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CI next challenges the district court's decision to apply Maine law to the coverage dispute.

Noting that the underlying complaint purported to assert the claims of a nationwide class against Auto Europe, he rejected the relevance of the location of the named plaintiffs' individual transactions because \"an unknown number of plaintiffs in an unknown number of locations may have claims that fit within the purported class.\" He also noted that the complaint alleged that Auto Europe's principal place of business was in Portland, Maine, and because no other business location is identified, \"[b]y terms of the complaint Auto Europe could only have acted in Maine.\" Recommended Decision at 7. The magistrate judge thus viewed Maine as \"the principal location of the insured risk,\" and ruled that, under <i>Baybutt,</i> Maine law should apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CI contends that the law of either Florida or Illinois would be more appropriate than Maine law because both \"would appear to have more significant interests in this coverage litigation and greater contacts with the transactions underlying the dispute than does Maine.\" According to CI, Florida is significant because the contract that provides the insurance coverage at issue in this case was negotiated and delivered there to Auto Europe's corporate parent. The policy insured more than two dozen affiliates or subsidiaries in a variety of locations, and Auto Europe apparently was the only one located in Maine. CI also cites Illinois' central importance to this case as the home state of the named plaintiffs in the Harter litigation. The two plaintiffs who did business with Auto Europe booked their rental cars through local travel agents in Chicago, and Illinois is also where the underlying lawsuit is pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can easily eliminate the law of Florida as more appropriate than Maine law for resolving the coverage issue. Our reading of the authorities indicates that a policy covering numerous related companies located in different states would be deemed a multiple risk policy that, for Maine choice of law purposes, would be viewed in a particular case as if a separate policy had been issued to cover each entity. <i>See Baybutt,</i> 455 A.2d at 919; Restatement, &#167; 193, comment f. Because Florida's status stems only from its role with respect to the overall policy, its significance in this case thus drops away, and the question becomes whether Maine &#8212; Auto Europe's principal location &#8212; should provide the substantive legal principles, or whether, \"with respect to the particular issue involved, [Illinois] has a more significant relationship to the transaction and the parties,\" <i>Baybutt,</i> 455 A.2d at 918.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the district court got it right. Auto Europe, a Maine business with offices only in Maine, is alleged to have committed consumer fraud by its conduct in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Although the named plaintiffs live in Illinois, and presumably for that reason found it convenient to file their lawsuit there, Illinois cannot be said to have a more significant relationship to the parties and transaction than does Maine. To be sure, the plaintiffs' home state has a substantial interest in ensuring that its citizens are not defrauded by out-of-state companies operating through local agents. Under Maine's choice of law principles, however, its own substantial interests take precedence because, as Auto Europe's home base, Maine is \"the principal location of the insured risk.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court therefore correctly ruled that Maine law governs the coverage dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>Duty to Defend</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, the duty to defend is determined by means of the comparison test: the complaint in the underlying lawsuit is compared with the insurance policy to ascertain if \"`there exists any legal or factual basis which could be developed at trial which would obligate the insurers to pay under the policy.'\" <i>United Bank v.

We simply note, in passing, that some of the cases relied upon by CI are distinguishable because they involved either underlying causes of action limited to intentional conduct, <i>see, e.g., Ill.

(\"negligent conduct is not even a theoretical possibility under [the] complaint\"). In other words, in these cases, the theory of relief chosen by the underlying plaintiff depended upon a showing of deliberate conduct, placing any possible recovery outside the policy's coverage, and leaving the insurer with no duty to defend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by contrast, not only does the cause of action at issue &#8212; the Maine UTPA &#8212; permit liability in the absence of an intent to deceive, but Maine law also broadly extends the duty to defend to claims that could be developed either legally or factually at trial so as to fall within the policy's coverage. Like the district court, we think it certainly possible in this case that the facts as developed at trial would reveal an improper practice that was unaccompanied by an intent to deceive. Thus, even if a jury rejected the Harter plaintiffs' precise theory of deliberate misrepresentation, they would retain the possibility of recovery under the UTPA. CI consequently is obliged to defend the Harter lawsuit. <i>See, e.g., Me. Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 715 A.2d at 942 (\"[B]ecause [the underlying defendant] may be found to have intentionally inflicted emotional distress without subjectively intending or foreseeing the alleged distress suffered by [the plaintiff], the exclusion for intended or expected bodily injury is inapplicable.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, when the cause of action alleged as the basis for liability does not include elements that would foreclose coverage, and where the events giving rise to the complaint may be shown at trial to fall within the policy's coverage, Maine law entitles the insured to a defense. <i>See id.</i> Indeed, we suspect that Maine's inclusive approach to the duty to defend is designed precisely for circumstances such as these &#8212; where a narrow reading of the complaint's factual allegations might preclude coverage, but the alleged cause of action is sufficiently broad that a modified version of the facts could be developed at trial to show liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court therefore properly ruled that CI has a duty to defend the Harter lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">V. <i>Attorney's Fees</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Auto Europe sought reimbursement of the attorney's fees incurred in pursuing this declaratory judgment action, and following the district court's grant of that request, the parties stipulated to the amount of $42,675.91.

This is not a difference that affects our analysis, however. An insured risk is \"`the object or activity which is the subject matter of the insurance,' and `has its principal location ... in the state where it will be during at least the major portion of the insurance period.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 690 (quoting Restatement, &#167; 193, comment b).

First, as the magistrate judge observed and our discussion reveals, CI's complaint about inadequate opportunity for discovery is without force; the information it sought to obtain, regarding other insureds on the policy with Auto Europe, was unnecessary for the choice-of-law inquiry because the information already available showed that the covered businesses were located in various states. Second, on the primary substantive issue &#8212; the duty to defend &#8212; the choice of law is likely of no consequence because the relevant law in Maine and Illinois, and probably Florida as well, appears to be the same<i>See infra</i> at 66-68.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> An act may be deceptive under the statute \"even though the defendant had no purpose to deceive and acted in good faith.\"<i>Binette v.
