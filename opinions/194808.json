Paul Kirvan  appeals from a jury\n                          \n\nverdict finding  him  guilty  on  one  count  of  armed  bank\n\nrobbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C.    2113(d).  The jury also\n\nconvicted Kirvan of carrying  a firearm during the commission\n\nof a crime of violence, in  violation of 18 U.S.C.    924(c),\n\nbut  the district court set that conviction aside.  On cross-\n\nappeal,  the government argues that  the trial judge erred in\n\ngranting  a judgment of acquittal  on this second  count.  We\n\naffirm the  bank  robbery conviction,  reinstate the  firearm\n\nconviction and remand for resentencing. \n\n     The facts, limited  to those pertinent to the  issues on\n\nappeal, can be briefly stated.  A lone masked  robber held up\n\na savings  bank in  Lowell,  Massachusetts, at  3:25 p.m.  on\n\nAugust 20,  1991.   The surveillance  photographs taken  by a\n\nbank camera showed the robber wearing a distinctive  rain hat\n\nand holding what  appeared to  be a large  handgun.   Several\n\npersons  in the bank saw the same robber and the gun.  At one\n\npoint the  gun fell  to the  floor with a  loud thump  as the\n\nrobber climbed over  a counter.   The  robber collected  cash\n\nfrom several drawers, stuffed  the money into a bag  and fled\n\nfrom the bank with the cash and his gun.\n\n     At about  3 p.m.,  before  the robbery,  an FBI  special\n                              \n\nagent  named Gerald  Mohan happened  to be  driving out  of a\n\nparking  lot not far from  the bank.   For plausible reasons,\n\nunrelated  to  the bank  robbery,  Mohan began  to  follow an\n\n                             -4-\n\nOldsmobile that turned out to be registered to Kirvan.  Soon,\n\nthe  Oldsmobile stopped, and  a passenger wearing  a rain hat\n\nleft  the car, transferred to a Chevrolet, and both cars were\n\ndriven back toward the bank.  Mohan briefly lost contact with\n\nthe  cars and  then located  the Chevrolet  leaving the  bank\n\nparking  lot.  As Mohan's  car passed the  Chevrolet going in\n\nthe opposite direction,  he saw  in the driver's  seat a  man\n\nwearing a rain hat.\n\n     Mohan  later selected Kirvan's  photograph from an array\n\nas the man whom  Mohan had seen in the  Chevrolet leaving the\n\nbank.  Through  other witnesses, there was evidence  that the\n\ndriver and another man had abandoned the Chevrolet (which was\n\nstolen)  around 3:30  p.m. and switched  to another  car; one\n\nyoung witness to the switch of cars testified that one of the\n\nindividuals who left the  Chevrolet looked \"Portuguese.\"  The\n\npolice later discovered a bag and a police-band radio scanner\n\nin Kirvan's Oldsmobile.\n\n     On  October  3,  1991, the  grand  jury  handed  down an\n\nindictment charging Kirvan with  armed bank robbery and using\n\nor  carrying a firearm  during a crime of  violence.  After a\n\nsix-day  trial, the  jury  returned guilty  verdicts on  both\n\ncounts.  Pursuant  to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c),  Kirvan filed a\n\nmotion for judgment  of acquittal.  The  district court judge\n\ndenied the  motion as to the bank robbery count but granted a\n\njudgment of acquittal on  the firearms count.  On  the latter\n\n                             -5-\n\ncount,  the trial  judge  ruled that  there was  insufficient\n\nevidence  for a jury to  conclude that a  genuine firearm was\n\ncarried during the robbery.\n\n     Kirvan's first  argument on  appeal is that  a statement\n\nmade by  the prosecutor during  summation was improper.   The\n\nstatement concerned Mohan's ability to identify the driver of\n\nthe oncoming Chevrolet where the distance between Mohan's car\n\nand the other car was approximately 3 to 4 feet and both cars\n\nwere  travelling in  opposite  directions between  30 and  35\n\nmiles  per hour.  The  prosecutor said to  the jury, \"I'm not\n\ngoing to talk in terms of feet or seconds or milliseconds.  I\n\nwant you to put yourselves in the place that [Mohan] was in.\"\n\nAs defense counsel  did not object  to this statement  during\n\ntrial, the question is whether allowing it to stand was plain\n\nerror.  United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 240-41\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n     Kirvan's brief relies primarily on cases that forbid so-\n\ncalled   \"golden  rule\"  arguments  in  which  plaintiffs  or\n\nprosecutors ask the jury  to put itself in  the place of  the\n\nvictim.   E.g., Forrestal  v. Magendantz, 848  F.2d 303,  309\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).  But \"golden rule\" cases do not apply where,\n\nas here,  the jury is asked to put itself  in the place of an\n\neyewitness.   In  this situation,  the invitation  is not  an\n          \n\nimproper  appeal to the jury to base its decision on sympathy\n\nfor  the victim  but rather  a means  of asking  the jury  to\n\n                             -6-\n\nreconstruct  the  situation  in  order to  decide  whether  a\n\nwitness' testimony is plausible.\n\n     Kirvan  also  asserts  that  the  prosecutor  engaged in\n\nimpermissible vouching  for the credibility of  Mohan.  Mohan\n\nhad  been  attacked  vigorously  on   cross-examination  with\n\nquestions designed to suggest  that his reasons for following\n\nthe Oldsmobile were fictitious,  that he had not had  time to\n\nsee Kirvan's  face,  and that  in  other respects  he  lacked\n\ncredibility.  In summation, the prosecutor spoke favorably of\n\nMohan, saying to the jury:\n\n          \"  . . . It tells you something about his\n          professional  instincts; they  turned out\n          to be right.   Tells you something  about\n          his  sense  of duty.    It  tells you  he\n          cared, that  he gave a damn,  that he got\n          himself involved.\n\n          He  didn't wait or let someone else worry\n          about  it.   You  saw  him  on the  stand\n          cross-examined  for how many  hours.  You\n          saw   the  attempt  to  condemn  him,  to\n          criticize  him,  to  embarrass   him,  to\n          humiliate him, to imply  incompetency, to\n          imply deceit.\n\n             I  suggest  to  you  that  Gerry Mohan\n          should  not  be condemned;  he  should be\n          commended.      That   he  shouldn't   be\n          criticized; he should be applauded.   And\n          he    shouldn't    be   embarrassed    or\n          humiliated.  He should  be proud, and you\n          should be proud of him.\" \n\n     This argument does not constitute improper vouching; the\n\nprosecutor did not assert his own opinion of Mohan's veracity\n\nas a witness.  If any criticism could be made, it is that the\n\n\"let  someone else  worry\" and  \"commended .  . .  applauded\"\n\n                             -7-\n\ncommentary by the  prosecutor is inappropriate  cheerleading;\n\nbut this is  hardly plain  error, and, given  the assault  on\n\nMohan's  integrity, the remarks may be fair comment.1  As for\n\nthe   prosecutor's  argument   that  events   proved  Mohan's\n\ninstincts  to be  sound, it  may well  be false logic  from a\n\nphilosopher's standpoint but it is perfectly good folk wisdom\n\nand is neither an appeal to emotion nor personal vouching.\n\n     Finally, Kirvan argues  that the  prosecutor engaged  in\n\nimpermissible  conduct in recounting  testimony.   As already\n\nnoted, a young witness,  actually one called by  the defense,\n\ndescribed  the   driver  of   the   Chevrolet  as   appearing\n\n\"Portuguese.\"  During closing  argument, the prosecutor  told\n\nthe jury:\n\n          \"[The witness] also said that the man, to\n          him,   looked   like  his   ancestry  was\n          Portuguese.   I ask  you to look  at Paul\n          Kirvan.    Imagine  him with  his  hair a\n          little  longer like it  is in the photos.\n          Imagine him  with his skin a  little more\n          tanned like it is in this photo.  Imagine\n          him with a mustache, and imagine him with\n          a beard  that you can see  from your jury\n          box.  Imagine him with  a growth of a day\n          or so of beard and ask yourselves whether\n          [the witness'] characterization--although\n          it   may   not   have  been   technically\n          accurate, ask yourselves  whether it  was\n          descriptively accurate.\"\n\n                    \n\n     1In his  summation, defense counsel called  Mohan a liar\nand deceptive, stupid or both.  While these  remarks followed\nthe  prosecutor's,   they  reflect  the   thrust  of  defense\ncounsel's earlier cross-examination of Mohan.\n\n                             -8-\n\nNo objection to these comments was made at trial.  On appeal,\n\nKirvan does not claim that allowing the witness' response was\n\nerror.  However, Kirvan contends that prosecutor's  statement\n\n(quoted above)  during closing  argument  either invited  the\n\njury to speculate  about identity based on  a vague criterion\n\nor was racially inflammatory and deprived the defendant  of a\n\nfair trial in violation of the United States Constitution.\n\n     There   may   be  some   force   to   the  notion   that\n\n\"look[ing] . . . Portuguese\"  is not much of  a criterion for\n\nidentification, although the description came from a  defense\n\nwitness.    But  defense  counsel had  ample  opportunity  in\n\nclosing argument to point out this weakness to the jury.  The\n\ndefense brief on appeal imaginatively refers us to cases that\n\npreclude  a   jury  from  viewing  an   infant  to  determine\n\npaternity; but that rule is not followed everywhere and rests\n\nin part on considerations  of policy.  In any  event, counsel\n\ndid not object to  the prosecutor's statement at the  time it\n\nwas made, and the statement is not so vague or misleading  as\n\nto constitute plain error.\n\n     The claim that the  statement was a racial slur  is more\n\nserious in that  the \"[r]acial  fairness of the  trial is  an\n\nindispensable ingredient of due process and racial equality a\n\nhallmark of justice.\"  United States v. Doe, 903  F.2d 16, 25\n                                           \n\n(D.C. Cir.  1990).   However, the prosecutor's  statement was\n\nnot  in  fact  a  racially  inflammatory  remark;  it  was  a\n\n                             -9-\n\npermissible, \"unembellished reference to evidence of race [or\n\nethnicity]  simply  as  a  factor  bolstering  an  eyewitness\n\nidentification of a  culprit.\"   Id.  Indeed,  we think  that\n                                   \n\nthis charge against the prosecutor should not even have  been\n\nmade.\n\n     The  government's  cross-appeal   presents  a  far  more\n\ndifficult  question.  Following the  jury verdict of guilt on\n\nthe  second  count  (carrying  a firearm  during  a  crime of\n\nviolence), the court granted  a judgment of acquittal finding\n\n\"no evidence that  the defendant actually  carried a firearm,\n\nas opposed to a toy gun.\"  On appeal, we examine the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the government.  If a rational\n\ntrier  of  fact could  have  concluded  that every  essential\n\nelement of the  crime charged was proved  beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt,  then the  issue should  have been  left to  the jury.\n\nUnited States  v. Medina-Garcia,  918 F.2d  4, 6-7 (1st  Cir.\n                               \n\n1990).\n\n     The  firearm statute,  18 U.S.C.    924(c),  provides in\n\nrelevant  part  that whoever  carries  a  firearm during  the\n\ncommission  of a crime of  violence shall be  sentenced to an\n\nadditional five years' imprisonment (or more if the weapon is\n\nof  a type here not involved).   It is common ground that the\n\ngun need not be proved  to be loaded or operable in  order to\n\nconvict, United  States v. Gonzalez,  800 F.2d 895,  899 (9th\n                                   \n\nCir. 1986),  but that a toy  or replica will not  do.  United\n                                                             \n\n                             -10-\n\nStates v. Westerdahl,  945 F.2d 1083,  1088 (9th Cir.  1991).\n                    \n\nThe district  court  summed  up  the  evidence  and  held  it\n\ninadequate  to permit  a reasonable  jury to  find, beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt,  that Kirvan carried a real  gun as opposed\n\nto a toy.\n\n     The government's riposte is to point to a square holding\n\nby  then Circuit Judge Scalia in Parker v. United States, 801\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1382, 1385 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1070\n                                              \n\n(1987), that  non-expert  testimony affirming  that a  robber\n\nused  a gun is enough.  The holding was followed without much\n\ndiscussion by  the  Fourth  Circuit  in  a  case  where  five\n\nwitnesses had described the  object as a gun.   United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Jones,  907 F.2d 456 (4th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 683  (1991).  Kirvan in turn points us to cases which, in\n\nupholding  convictions   under  this  or   similar  statutes,\n\nrecounted or relied  upon testimony from a firearms expert or\n\nat least a  witness who saw the  robbery and claimed to  know\n\nabout weapons.  E.g.,  United States v. Buggs, 904  F.2d 1070\n                                             \n\n(7th Cir. 1990); Westerdahl, 945 F.2d at 1088.\n                           \n\n     If  fake   guns  were   extraordinarily  rare   in  bank\n\nrobberies, it might be fairly easy, absent affirmative proof,\n\nto dismiss the possibility that the gun was a toy.   The jury\n\nhad  no  actual data,  which  might  be inadmissible  in  any\n\n                             -11-\n\nevent,2  although  it  does  have  considerable  latitude  in\n\nmaking intuitive judgments about how the world works.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

Nor  does policy\n                   \n\ntilt the  balance, as it might if we faced an issue where the\n\ngovernment had ready access to direct evidence (e.g., whether\n                                                    \n\na  bank is federally insured)  and no excuse  for leaving the\n\nmatter in doubt.   Of course, Kirvan has  such access but  we\n\nwill not decide  the matter  by relying upon  his failure  to\n\nproduce the gun for inspection.3  \n\n     We need not decide  here whether the government's burden\n\ncould be met merely by  unembellished lay testimony that \"the\n\nrobber  carried a  gun.\"   In this  instance, the  object was\n\nidentified by  two witnesses as a  gun; one said that  it was\n\nblack and  had a  five  inch barrel  and the  other, who  was\n\ncloser,  supplied  more detail:    he said  that  it appeared\n\n\"shiny,  silver\" in color;  that it was  \"[l]arge, very large\n\n                    \n\n     2See 1  McCormack, Evidence    210,  at 949-50  (4th ed.\n                                \n1992)  (cases discourage  mathematical proof  and probability\ndata  in  criminal  cases).   Such  data  may  exist.   E.g.,\n                                                            \nWashington  Post, October 2, 1986, p.

Heavy object hitting the floor.\"\n\n     Without deciding  whether less  would do, we  think that\n\nthis detail  permitted a rational jury to  conclude that this\n\nwas a  \"real\" gun:  it  was a plausible size,  colored like a\n\nreal gun, and quite heavy.  One witness could easily describe\n\ngun metal as black and another as silver.  Although some  toy\n\nguns might be  of similar  size and color,  the heavy  weight\n\ncertainly would not be as common in a toy.  And while  a good\n\nreplica might still fool a witness at a distance, the chances\n\nof error decline  where, as  here, the witness  saw the  gun,\n\nstationary  and at  a  close distance,  for  a least  half  a\n\nminute.4\n\n     In sum, we think that the jury, which concluded that the\n\nobject was  a real gun \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" cannot be\n\ndeemed irrational.  We understand why the trial judge came to\n\nthe opposite view.  But judgments of acquittal are subject to\n\nde novo review,  United States v.

These inferences,  if\nthey do not precisely cancel out, are not conclusive.\n\n                             -13-\n\ndecision  is for  the  jurors to  make.\"   Curley  v.

Paul Kirvan  appeals from a jury\n                          \n\nverdict finding  him  guilty  on  one  count  of  armed  bank\n\nrobbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C.    2113(d).  The jury also\n\nconvicted Kirvan of carrying  a firearm during the commission\n\nof a crime of violence, in  violation of 18 U.S.C.    924(c),\n\nbut  the district court set that conviction aside.  On cross-\n\nappeal,  the government argues that  the trial judge erred in\n\ngranting  a judgment of acquittal  on this second  count.  We\n\naffirm the  bank  robbery conviction,  reinstate the  firearm\n\nconviction and remand for resentencing. \n\n     The facts, limited  to those pertinent to the  issues on\n\nappeal, can be briefly stated.  A lone masked  robber held up\n\na savings  bank in  Lowell,  Massachusetts, at  3:25 p.m.  on\n\nAugust 20,  1991.   The surveillance  photographs taken  by a\n\nbank camera showed the robber wearing a distinctive  rain hat\n\nand holding what  appeared to  be a large  handgun.   Several\n\npersons  in the bank saw the same robber and the gun.  At one\n\npoint the  gun fell  to the  floor with a  loud thump  as the\n\nrobber climbed over  a counter.   The  robber collected  cash\n\nfrom several drawers, stuffed  the money into a bag  and fled\n\nfrom the bank with the cash and his gun.\n\n     At about  3 p.m.,  before  the robbery,  an FBI  special\n                              \n\nagent  named Gerald  Mohan happened  to be  driving out  of a\n\nparking  lot not far from  the bank.   For plausible reasons,\n\nunrelated  to  the bank  robbery,  Mohan began  to  follow an\n\n                             -4-\n\nOldsmobile that turned out to be registered to Kirvan.  Soon,\n\nthe  Oldsmobile stopped, and  a passenger wearing  a rain hat\n\nleft  the car, transferred to a Chevrolet, and both cars were\n\ndriven back toward the bank.  Mohan briefly lost contact with\n\nthe  cars and  then located  the Chevrolet  leaving the  bank\n\nparking  lot.  As Mohan's  car passed the  Chevrolet going in\n\nthe opposite direction,  he saw  in the driver's  seat a  man\n\nwearing a rain hat.\n\n     Mohan  later selected Kirvan's  photograph from an array\n\nas the man whom  Mohan had seen in the  Chevrolet leaving the\n\nbank.  Through  other witnesses, there was evidence  that the\n\ndriver and another man had abandoned the Chevrolet (which was\n\nstolen)  around 3:30  p.m. and switched  to another  car; one\n\nyoung witness to the switch of cars testified that one of the\n\nindividuals who left the  Chevrolet looked \"Portuguese.\"  The\n\npolice later discovered a bag and a police-band radio scanner\n\nin Kirvan's Oldsmobile.\n\n     On  October  3,  1991, the  grand  jury  handed  down an\n\nindictment charging Kirvan with  armed bank robbery and using\n\nor  carrying a firearm  during a crime of  violence.  After a\n\nsix-day  trial, the  jury  returned guilty  verdicts on  both\n\ncounts.  Pursuant  to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c),  Kirvan filed a\n\nmotion for judgment  of acquittal.  The  district court judge\n\ndenied the  motion as to the bank robbery count but granted a\n\njudgment of acquittal on  the firearms count.  On  the latter\n\n                             -5-\n\ncount,  the trial  judge  ruled that  there was  insufficient\n\nevidence  for a jury to  conclude that a  genuine firearm was\n\ncarried during the robbery.\n\n     Kirvan's first  argument on  appeal is that  a statement\n\nmade by  the prosecutor during  summation was improper.   The\n\nstatement concerned Mohan's ability to identify the driver of\n\nthe oncoming Chevrolet where the distance between Mohan's car\n\nand the other car was approximately 3 to 4 feet and both cars\n\nwere  travelling in  opposite  directions between  30 and  35\n\nmiles  per hour.  The  prosecutor said to  the jury, \"I'm not\n\ngoing to talk in terms of feet or seconds or milliseconds.  I\n\nwant you to put yourselves in the place that [Mohan] was in.\"\n\nAs defense counsel  did not object  to this statement  during\n\ntrial, the question is whether allowing it to stand was plain\n\nerror.  United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516169\"><a href=\"/opinion/516169/united-states-v-manuel-l-mateos-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240-41\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n     Kirvan's brief relies primarily on cases that forbid so-\n\ncalled   \"golden  rule\"  arguments  in  which  plaintiffs  or\n\nprosecutors ask the jury  to put itself in  the place of  the\n\nvictim.   E.g., Forrestal  v. Magendantz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507078\"><a href=\"/opinion/507078/jesse-forrestal-etc-v-henry-g-magendantz/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  309\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).  But \"golden rule\" cases do not apply where,\n\nas here,  the jury is asked to put itself  in the place of an\n\neyewitness.   In  this situation,  the invitation  is not  an\n          \n\nimproper  appeal to the jury to base its decision on sympathy\n\nfor  the victim  but rather  a means  of asking  the jury  to\n\n                             -6-\n\nreconstruct  the  situation  in  order to  decide  whether  a\n\nwitness' testimony is plausible.\n\n     Kirvan  also  asserts  that  the  prosecutor  engaged in\n\nimpermissible vouching  for the credibility of  Mohan.  Mohan\n\nhad  been  attacked  vigorously  on   cross-examination  with\n\nquestions designed to suggest  that his reasons for following\n\nthe Oldsmobile were fictitious,  that he had not had  time to\n\nsee Kirvan's  face,  and that  in  other respects  he  lacked\n\ncredibility.  In summation, the prosecutor spoke favorably of\n\nMohan, saying to the jury:\n\n          \"  . . . It tells you something about his\n          professional  instincts; they  turned out\n          to be right.   Tells you something  about\n          his  sense  of duty.    It  tells you  he\n          cared, that  he gave a damn,  that he got\n          himself involved.\n\n          He  didn't wait or let someone else worry\n          about  it.   You  saw  him  on the  stand\n          cross-examined  for how many  hours.  You\n          saw   the  attempt  to  condemn  him,  to\n          criticize  him,  to  embarrass   him,  to\n          humiliate him, to imply  incompetency, to\n          imply deceit.\n\n             I  suggest  to  you  that  Gerry Mohan\n          should  not  be condemned;  he  should be\n          commended.      That   he  shouldn't   be\n          criticized; he should be applauded.   And\n          he    shouldn't    be   embarrassed    or\n          humiliated.  He should  be proud, and you\n          should be proud of him.\" \n\n     This argument does not constitute improper vouching; the\n\nprosecutor did not assert his own opinion of Mohan's veracity\n\nas a witness.  If any criticism could be made, it is that the\n\n\"let  someone else  worry\" and  \"commended .  . .  applauded\"\n\n                             -7-\n\ncommentary by the  prosecutor is inappropriate  cheerleading;\n\nbut this is  hardly plain  error, and, given  the assault  on\n\nMohan's  integrity, the remarks may be fair comment.1  As for\n\nthe   prosecutor's  argument   that  events   proved  Mohan's\n\ninstincts  to be  sound, it  may well  be false logic  from a\n\nphilosopher's standpoint but it is perfectly good folk wisdom\n\nand is neither an appeal to emotion nor personal vouching.\n\n     Finally, Kirvan argues  that the  prosecutor engaged  in\n\nimpermissible  conduct in recounting  testimony.   As already\n\nnoted, a young witness,  actually one called by  the defense,\n\ndescribed  the   driver  of   the   Chevrolet  as   appearing\n\n\"Portuguese.\"  During closing  argument, the prosecutor  told\n\nthe jury:\n\n          \"[The witness] also said that the man, to\n          him,   looked   like  his   ancestry  was\n          Portuguese.   I ask  you to look  at Paul\n          Kirvan.    Imagine  him with  his  hair a\n          little  longer like it  is in the photos.\n          Imagine him  with his skin a  little more\n          tanned like it is in this photo.  Imagine\n          him with a mustache, and imagine him with\n          a beard  that you can see  from your jury\n          box.  Imagine him with  a growth of a day\n          or so of beard and ask yourselves whether\n          [the witness'] characterization--although\n          it   may   not   have  been   technically\n          accurate, ask yourselves  whether it  was\n          descriptively accurate.\"\n\n                    \n\n     1In his  summation, defense counsel called  Mohan a liar\nand deceptive, stupid or both.  While these  remarks followed\nthe  prosecutor's,   they  reflect  the   thrust  of  defense\ncounsel's earlier cross-examination of Mohan.\n\n                             -8-\n\nNo objection to these comments was made at trial.  On appeal,\n\nKirvan does not claim that allowing the witness' response was\n\nerror.  However, Kirvan contends that prosecutor's  statement\n\n(quoted above)  during closing  argument  either invited  the\n\njury to speculate  about identity based on  a vague criterion\n\nor was racially inflammatory and deprived the defendant  of a\n\nfair trial in violation of the United States Constitution.\n\n     There   may   be  some   force   to   the  notion   that\n\n\"look[ing] . . . Portuguese\"  is not much of  a criterion for\n\nidentification, although the description came from a  defense\n\nwitness.    But  defense  counsel had  ample  opportunity  in\n\nclosing argument to point out this weakness to the jury.  The\n\ndefense brief on appeal imaginatively refers us to cases that\n\npreclude  a   jury  from  viewing  an   infant  to  determine\n\npaternity; but that rule is not followed everywhere and rests\n\nin part on considerations  of policy.  In any  event, counsel\n\ndid not object to  the prosecutor's statement at the  time it\n\nwas made, and the statement is not so vague or misleading  as\n\nto constitute plain error.\n\n     The claim that the  statement was a racial slur  is more\n\nserious in that  the \"[r]acial  fairness of the  trial is  an\n\nindispensable ingredient of due process and racial equality a\n\nhallmark of justice.\"  United States v.

Following the  jury verdict of guilt on\n\nthe  second  count  (carrying  a firearm  during  a  crime of\n\nviolence), the court granted  a judgment of acquittal finding\n\n\"no evidence that  the defendant actually  carried a firearm,\n\nas opposed to a toy gun.\"  On appeal, we examine the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the government.  If a rational\n\ntrier  of  fact could  have  concluded  that every  essential\n\nelement of the  crime charged was proved  beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt,  then the  issue should  have been  left to  the jury.\n\nUnited States  v.

Nor  does policy\n                   \n\ntilt the  balance, as it might if we faced an issue where the\n\ngovernment had ready access to direct evidence (e.g., whether\n                                                    \n\na  bank is federally insured)  and no excuse  for leaving the\n\nmatter in doubt.   Of course, Kirvan has  such access but  we\n\nwill not decide  the matter  by relying upon  his failure  to\n\nproduce the gun for inspection.3  \n\n     We need not decide  here whether the government's burden\n\ncould be met merely by  unembellished lay testimony that \"the\n\nrobber  carried a  gun.\"   In this  instance, the  object was\n\nidentified by  two witnesses as a  gun; one said that  it was\n\nblack and  had a  five  inch barrel  and the  other, who  was\n\ncloser,  supplied  more detail:    he said  that  it appeared\n\n\"shiny,  silver\" in color;  that it was  \"[l]arge, very large\n\n                    \n\n     2See 1  McCormack, Evidence    210,  at 949-50  (4th ed.\n                                \n1992)  (cases discourage  mathematical proof  and probability\ndata  in  criminal  cases).

One witness could easily describe\n\ngun metal as black and another as silver.
