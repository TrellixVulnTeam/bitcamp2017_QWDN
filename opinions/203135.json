App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey has been substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzales as the responded herein.\n\n     **\n          *Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f      SILER, Senior Circuit Judge.                 Petitioners Klotilda Vasilia\n\n(“Vasilia”) and her minor son, Todi Vasilia, challenge the denial\n\nby the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) of a motion to reopen\n\ntheir immigration proceedings.               Their untimely motion to reopen\n\nasserted both ineffective assistance of counsel and changed country\n\nconditions.       The BIA denied the motion.               Vasilia then filed this\n\npetition for review.        We deny the petition.\n\n                                            I.\n\n      Klotilda and Todi Vasilia are citizens of Albania.                       They\n\nattempted to enter the United States in 2001 without valid travel\n\ndocuments.       The Department of Homeland Security charged them with\n\nbeing removable.         When they appeared before the immigration judge\n\n(“IJ”), the petitioners conceded removability and sought asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (“CAT”).\n\n      In her asylum application, Vasilia stated that she and her\n\nfamily suffered past persecution based on their involvement in pro-\n\ndemocracy activities.         Most of her family resettled in Greece in\n\n1991,    where    they    continue    to     reside    as    permanent   residents.\n\nVasilia chose to remain in Albania with her husband and his family.\n\nShe claimed that in 1997, her husband was kidnapped and mistreated\n\nfor     approximately      three     days        because    of   his   pro-democracy\n\nactivities.      About two days after his release, a gunshot was fired\n\nthrough a window of the family’s apartment, and her husband’s\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fparents, who shared the apartment, received a threatening letter.\n\nFollowing these events, the family went to Greece.                 From August\n\n1997 until Vasilia’s attempt to enter the United States in 2001,\n\nshe and her family moved between Greece and Albania at various\n\ntimes.\n\n       The       IJ   denied   the   petitioners’   applications   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT relief.             The IJ found that Vasilia\n\nfailed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.            The IJ also emphasized the fact that neither\n\nVasilia nor her husband attempted to obtain resident status in\n\nGreece, although they could have done so.\n\n       Vasilia appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA.              On April 9,\n\n2003, the BIA denied her appeal.                 The BIA also held that the\n\npetitioners were not entitled to a derivative claim of relief from\n\nVasilia’s husband because the BIA had separately dismissed his\n\nclaims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.                  The\n\npetitioners did not seek this court’s review of the BIA’s decision.\n\n       Instead, on December 26, 2006, the petitioners filed a motion\n\nwith       the   BIA   to   reopen    their   immigration   proceedings.    The\n\npetitioners moved the BIA to reopen their proceedings based on\n\nineffective assistance of counsel and changed country conditions.1\n\nVasilia asserts that her attorney did not adequately present her\n\n\n       1\n      The petitioners also raised Todi Vasilia’s health problems as\na humanitarian concern.    However, the BIA correctly found that\nTodi’s condition is not relevant to the asylum claim.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fcase to the IJ.      Specifically, Vasilia’s affidavit recounts an\n\nincident from 2001 in which she was kidnapped and raped on account\n\nof being a democratic activist.       Vasilia claims that her attorney\n\n“unilaterally” decided not to present this information before the\n\nIJ.   At the IJ hearing, Vasilia did not testify about any harm\n\ncoming to her or her husband after his kidnapping in 1997.\n\n      In 2007, the BIA declined to exercise its sua sponte authority\n\nto reopen the proceedings based on the ineffective assistance claim\n\nand also denied the motion to reopen based on changed country\n\nconditions, finding that the petitioners failed to establish a\n\nreasonable likelihood of success on the merits.          This petition for\n\njudicial review followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n      The   petitioners’   motion   to     reopen   based   on    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel was untimely because it was filed more than\n\nthree years after the BIA rendered its decision.                 See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§   1003.2(c)(2)   (allowing   90   days   to   file   motion    to   reopen).\n\nAlthough equitable tolling of the 90-day deadline is possible, it\n\n“is unavailable where a party fails to exercise due diligence.”\n\nJobe v. INS, 283 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2001) (en banc).              The BIA\n\nfound that Vasilia failed to show due diligence where the motion to\n\nreopen was filed three years after the BIA’s order of dismissal.\n\nWe do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA’s decision that\n\nequitable tolling is unavailable where that decision was based “on\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fa factual determination that [the petitioner] had not exercised due\n\ndiligence.”      Boakai v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n      Thus, the motion to reopen could be granted only if the BIA\n\nexercised its sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings.                    8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (“The Board may at any time reopen or reconsider\n\non its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.”).\n\nThe BIA noted that it will take such action only in “exceptional\n\ncircumstances,” and it declined to do so here.                      Because the\n\ndecision   to    sua   sponte    reopen     a    case   is   committed    to    the\n\n“unfettered discretion” of the BIA,             it is not subject to review by\n\nthis court.       Zhang v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n      The 90-day time limitation for motions to reopen does not\n\napply where the motion is based on changed country conditions, if\n\nthe   evidence    of   changed   conditions       “is   material    and   was   not\n\navailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the\n\nprevious hearing.”       8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).              We review the\n\nBIA’s denial of the motion based on changed country conditions for\n\nan abuse of discretion.         Raza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).      The evidence submitted in support of the motion to\n\nreopen “must, at a bare minimum, establish a prima facie case\n\nsufficient to ground a claim of eligibility for the underlying\n\nsubstantive relief.”      Id. at 128.     Thus, in this case, Vasilia must\n\nestablish prima facie eligibility for asylum or withholding of\n\nremoval.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f      Vasilia argues that the BIA abused its discretion because it\n\ndenied   her        motion     without    considering            or     discussing      the\n\n“substantial documentation submitted in support of the motion.”\n\nHowever, much of the documentation submitted by Vasilia does not\n\nmeet the criteria set forth in the regulation because it was\n\navailable or could have been discovered at the original hearing.\n\nThis is true of the information in Vasilia’s affidavit regarding\n\nthe   attack   and     rape    that    allegedly         took    place    in   2001,    the\n\ndocuments relating to her family’s political participation, and the\n\nstatements     regarding       treatment      of    her       husband    after    he    was\n\nkidnapped. Additionally, some of the submitted documents appear to\n\nbe totally irrelevant, particularly those about the sentencing of\n\nher husband’s uncle in 1948 by a military court.\n\n      The proffered documentation regarding conditions in Albania\n\nincludes the 2005 State Department Report on Human Rights Practices\n\nin Albania and several newspaper articles.                      The newspaper articles\n\nare largely irrelevant to Vasilia’s case because they involve\n\nhostility between members of the Albanian parliament, a reported\n\nmissile attack on a prominent pro-democracy family, and poor\n\nconditions in Albanian prisons.                 None of these news stories is\n\nsufficient     to    show     that    Vasilia      has    a     well-founded     fear    of\n\npersecution     if     she    returns    to     Albania.           Further,      the    BIA\n\nconsidered the State Department Report for 2005 and mentioned its\n\nfindings that “human rights were generally respected, and citizens\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fexercised their rights to change government peacefully.”2 The only\n\nother piece of relevant new evidence was a letter from Vasilia’s\n\nfather-in-law discussing recently-made threats to Vasilia’s husband\n\nand son.     This letter, written on November 20, 2006, presents\n\nobvious credibility concerns; however, the BIA failed to mention\n\nthe letter at all.\n\n     Rather than addressing the petitioners’ documentation, the\n\nBIA’s decision relies upon the 2005 State Department Report and\n\nother cases wherein this court found that conditions in Albania had\n\nimproved since 2001.    In Tota v. Gonzales, we cited the 2004 State\n\nDepartment    Report   on   Albania     and   found   “greatly   improved\n\nconditions” for “individuals who suffered past persecution on\n\npolitical grounds at the hands of the former Communist regime, and\n\nwho would be returning to Albania after having fled abroad.”         457\n\nF.3d 161, 167 (1st Cir. 2006).    Similarly, in Alibeaj v. Gonzales,\n\nwe discussed the 2003 State Department Report and noted that “the\n\nclimate for political oppositionists in Albania has fundamentally\n\nimproved since 2001.”   469 F.3d 188, 193 (1st Cir. 2006).       Thus, in\n\nboth Tota and Alibeaj, this court relied on State Department\n\nreports in affirming BIA determinations that petitioners failed to\n\ndemonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The 2006 State Department Report also makes these findings,\nand it generally supports the BIA’s determination that conditions\nin Albania have improved since 2001.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f     Vasilia argues that the BIA is required to consider and\n\naddress all the evidence she submitted.    She refers to a Second\n\nCircuit decision that said,\n\n     When an applicant moves to reopen his case based on\n     worsened country conditions, and introduces previously\n     unavailable reports that materially support his original\n     application, the BIA has a duty to consider these reports\n     and issue a reasoned decision based thereon, whether or\n     not these reports are clearly determinative.\n\nPoradisova v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir. 2005) (emphasis in\n\noriginal). The Poradisova case, however, seems most concerned with\n\nBIA decisions that ignore State Department reports, rather than\n\ndecisions that fail to consider other evidence.     See id. at 79\n\n(noting “the IJ should have taken into account, as apparently she\n\ndid not . . . the State Department reports”).    In this case, the\n\nBIA clearly did consider the 2005 State Department Report and fully\n\nexplained its basis for denying the motion to reopen.   Therefore,\n\ndespite the failure to discuss the documentation submitted by\n\nVasilia, the BIA’s decision was not arbitrary or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n     PETITION DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Petitioners Klotilda Vasilia\n\n(“Vasilia”) and her minor son, Todi Vasilia, challenge the denial\n\nby the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) of a motion to reopen\n\ntheir immigration proceedings.               Their untimely motion to reopen\n\nasserted both ineffective assistance of counsel and changed country\n\nconditions.       The BIA denied the motion.               Vasilia then filed this\n\npetition for review.        We deny the petition.\n\n                                            I.\n\n      Klotilda and Todi Vasilia are citizens of Albania.                       They\n\nattempted to enter the United States in 2001 without valid travel\n\ndocuments.       The Department of Homeland Security charged them with\n\nbeing removable.         When they appeared before the immigration judge\n\n(“IJ”), the petitioners conceded removability and sought asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (“CAT”).\n\n      In her asylum application, Vasilia stated that she and her\n\nfamily suffered past persecution based on their involvement in pro-\n\ndemocracy activities.         Most of her family resettled in Greece in\n\n1991,    where    they    continue    to     reside    as    permanent   residents.\n\nVasilia chose to remain in Albania with her husband and his family.\n\nShe claimed that in 1997, her husband was kidnapped and mistreated\n\nfor     approximately      three     days        because    of   his   pro-democracy\n\nactivities.

From August\n\n1997 until Vasilia’s attempt to enter the United States in 2001,\n\nshe and her family moved between Greece and Albania at various\n\ntimes.\n\n       The       IJ   denied   the   petitioners’   applications   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT relief.             The IJ found that Vasilia\n\nfailed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.            The IJ also emphasized the fact that neither\n\nVasilia nor her husband attempted to obtain resident status in\n\nGreece, although they could have done so.\n\n       Vasilia appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA.              On April 9,\n\n2003, the BIA denied her appeal.                 The BIA also held that the\n\npetitioners were not entitled to a derivative claim of relief from\n\nVasilia’s husband because the BIA had separately dismissed his\n\nclaims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.                  The\n\npetitioners did not seek this court’s review of the BIA’s decision.\n\n       Instead, on December 26, 2006, the petitioners filed a motion\n\nwith       the   BIA   to   reopen    their   immigration   proceedings.    The\n\npetitioners moved the BIA to reopen their proceedings based on\n\nineffective assistance of counsel and changed country conditions.1\n\nVasilia asserts that her attorney did not adequately present her\n\n\n       1\n      The petitioners also raised Todi Vasilia’s health problems as\na humanitarian concern.    However, the BIA correctly found that\nTodi’s condition is not relevant to the asylum claim.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fcase to the IJ.

Because the\n\ndecision   to    sua   sponte    reopen     a    case   is   committed    to    the\n\n“unfettered discretion” of the BIA,             it is not subject to review by\n\nthis court.       Zhang v.

We review the\n\nBIA’s denial of the motion based on changed country conditions for\n\nan abuse of discretion.         Raza v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202713\"><a href=\"/opinion/202713/raza-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 127 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).      The evidence submitted in support of the motion to\n\nreopen “must, at a bare minimum, establish a prima facie case\n\nsufficient to ground a claim of eligibility for the underlying\n\nsubstantive relief.”      Id. at 128.     Thus, in this case, Vasilia must\n\nestablish prima facie eligibility for asylum or withholding of\n\nremoval.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f      Vasilia argues that the BIA abused its discretion because it\n\ndenied   her        motion     without    considering            or     discussing      the\n\n“substantial documentation submitted in support of the motion.”\n\nHowever, much of the documentation submitted by Vasilia does not\n\nmeet the criteria set forth in the regulation because it was\n\navailable or could have been discovered at the original hearing.\n\nThis is true of the information in Vasilia’s affidavit regarding\n\nthe   attack   and     rape    that    allegedly         took    place    in   2001,    the\n\ndocuments relating to her family’s political participation, and the\n\nstatements     regarding       treatment      of    her       husband    after    he    was\n\nkidnapped. Additionally, some of the submitted documents appear to\n\nbe totally irrelevant, particularly those about the sentencing of\n\nher husband’s uncle in 1948 by a military court.\n\n      The proffered documentation regarding conditions in Albania\n\nincludes the 2005 State Department Report on Human Rights Practices\n\nin Albania and several newspaper articles.                      The newspaper articles\n\nare largely irrelevant to Vasilia’s case because they involve\n\nhostility between members of the Albanian parliament, a reported\n\nmissile attack on a prominent pro-democracy family, and poor\n\nconditions in Albanian prisons.                 None of these news stories is\n\nsufficient     to    show     that    Vasilia      has    a     well-founded     fear    of\n\npersecution     if     she    returns    to     Albania.           Further,      the    BIA\n\nconsidered the State Department Report for 2005 and mentioned its\n\nfindings that “human rights were generally respected, and citizens\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fexercised their rights to change government peacefully.”2 The only\n\nother piece of relevant new evidence was a letter from Vasilia’s\n\nfather-in-law discussing recently-made threats to Vasilia’s husband\n\nand son.     This letter, written on November 20, 2006, presents\n\nobvious credibility concerns; however, the BIA failed to mention\n\nthe letter at all.\n\n     Rather than addressing the petitioners’ documentation, the\n\nBIA’s decision relies upon the 2005 State Department Report and\n\nother cases wherein this court found that conditions in Albania had\n\nimproved since 2001.    In Tota v. Gonzales, we cited the 2004 State\n\nDepartment    Report   on   Albania     and   found   “greatly   improved\n\nconditions” for “individuals who suffered past persecution on\n\npolitical grounds at the hands of the former Communist regime, and\n\nwho would be returning to Albania after having fled abroad.”         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (1st Cir. 2006).    Similarly, in Alibeaj v. Gonzales,\n\nwe discussed the 2003 State Department Report and noted that “the\n\nclimate for political oppositionists in Albania has fundamentally\n\nimproved since 2001.”   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202521\"><a href=\"/opinion/202521/alibeaj-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1st Cir. 2006).       Thus, in\n\nboth Tota and Alibeaj, this court relied on State Department\n\nreports in affirming BIA determinations that petitioners failed to\n\ndemonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The 2006 State Department Report also makes these findings,\nand it generally supports the BIA’s determination that conditions\nin Albania have improved since 2001.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f     Vasilia argues that the BIA is required to consider and\n\naddress all the evidence she submitted.    She refers to a Second\n\nCircuit decision that said,\n\n     When an applicant moves to reopen his case based on\n     worsened country conditions, and introduces previously\n     unavailable reports that materially support his original\n     application, the BIA has a duty to consider these reports\n     and issue a reasoned decision based thereon, whether or\n     not these reports are clearly determinative.\n\nPoradisova v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791568\"><a href=\"/opinion/791568/tatiana-poradisova-pavel-poradisov-and-gennadi-poradisov-v-alberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (2d Cir. 2005) (emphasis in\n\noriginal). The Poradisova case, however, seems most concerned with\n\nBIA decisions that ignore State Department reports, rather than\n\ndecisions that fail to consider other evidence.     See id. at 79\n\n(noting “the IJ should have taken into account, as apparently she\n\ndid not . . . the State Department reports”).    In this case, the\n\nBIA clearly did consider the 2005 State Department Report and fully\n\nexplained its basis for denying the motion to reopen.   Therefore,\n\ndespite the failure to discuss the documentation submitted by\n\nVasilia, the BIA’s decision was not arbitrary or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n     PETITION DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f</pre>",
