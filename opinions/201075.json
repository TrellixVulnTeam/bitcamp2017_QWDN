Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jordan L. Shapiro, with whom Edward J. Collins, Eric L.\nShwartz, and Shapiro & Hender were on brief, for appellant.\n\n     Laura D'Amato, with whom Adrienne M. Markham, Kevin P.\nO'Flaherty, Pamela L. Signorello, Ellen C. Meyer, and Goulston &\nStorrs, P.C. were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         June 22, 2004\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. On July 1, 1993, a federal jury in\n\nthe district of Massachusetts awarded Jennifer Hoult a $500,000\n\nverdict against her father, David Hoult, for sexually abusing her\n\nthroughout her childhood.         The verdict was affirmed on appeal in\n\nHoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995).             This case arises\n\nfrom Jennifer's attempt to collect on that judgment, which, almost\n\neleven years later, has still not been paid in full.\n\n            On May 13, 2002, the district court found that David had\n\nfraudulently conveyed over $130,000 in assets to avoid paying the\n\njudgment.     Two weeks later, on May 30, it entered an order\n\nrequiring    him   to   deposit    all     his   income   in   a   designated\n\nMassachusetts bank account and to limit his withdrawals from that\n\naccount to $2,900 per month, a sum meant to cover his reasonable\n\nliving expenses.    David did not appeal from that order.            He later\n\nmoved in the district court to strike from the order social\n\nsecurity benefits and Employee Retirement Income Security Act\n\n(ERISA) pension benefits that he receives, arguing principally that\n\nfederal statutes prohibit the alienation of each of those benefits.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 407(a) (social security); 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(1)\n\n(ERISA).    The court denied his motion.         David, who has since been\n\nfound in civil and criminal contempt for refusing to comply with\n\nthe order, now appeals from that denial.\n\n            We find that the district court properly denied the\n\nmotion to strike as to ERISA benefits.             ERISA's anti-alienation\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fprovision does not apply where, as here, the funds have already\n\nbeen disbursed to the plan beneficiary.          In so holding, we join\n\nfour other circuits and disagree with one.\n\n            More   difficult   questions   are   raised   by    the   court's\n\nrefusal to strike social security benefits from the order, but we\n\nneed not resolve those questions here.        The parties stated to the\n\ndistrict court that neither had any objection to an arrangement\n\nthat would exempt David's social security benefits from the order\n\nbut would reduce his $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit by the amount\n\nof his monthly social security check (about $1,400 per month).             We\n\nconfirmed this at oral argument.           We affirm the denial of the\n\nmotion to    strike   the   ERISA   pension   benefits    and   remand   with\n\ninstructions to modify the order as to social security benefits.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            On July 29, 1993, four weeks after the verdict, Jennifer\n\nmoved for a preliminary injunction barring David and his current\n\nwife (not Jennifer's mother) from transferring David's assets\n\nexcept as necessary for ordinary living expenses. Jennifer alleged\n\nthat she had discovered that after she had filed suit in July 1988,\n\nDavid had started transferring his assets to protect them from a\n\npotential judgment.     The district court granted the injunction on\n\nAugust 4.    David did not appeal that order.\n\n            On September 7, 1994, Jennifer filed a supplemental\n\ncomplaint against David and his wife for fraudulent conveyance and\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcivil contempt.      A five-day bench trial was held on the fraudulent\n\nconveyance claims in January 1996.1\n\n              In November 1996, before judgment had entered in the\n\nfraudulent     conveyance      trial,   Jennifer    learned     that      David   had\n\nretired from his position as a senior research associate at the\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and had begun receiving\n\napproximately $4,800 in ERISA pension benefits from MIT each\n\nmonth.2      On January 27, 1997, she moved to modify the August 4,\n\n1993 preliminary injunction to require, inter alia, that David\n\ndeposit his monthly ERISA pension check in a designated bank\n\naccount and limit his withdrawals from that account to $1,700 per\n\nmonth      (which,   according    to    his   testimony    in   the       fraudulent\n\nconveyance trial, was the amount that he contributed each month to\n\nhis and his wife's living expenses).              Her motion did not mention\n\nsocial security benefits.         The district court said that it would\n\nallow the      motion    and   requested      Jennifer's   counsel        to   file   a\n\nproposed form of order.\n\n              Before the order was issued and before judgment entered\n\nin   the    fraudulent    conveyance     trial,    David   filed      a    voluntary\n\npetition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101\n\n\n\n      1\n       The court deferred its consideration of the contempt count\nto a later date and eventually dismissed it.\n      2\n          Starting in April 1994, the court had garnished a portion\nof David's wages each month to pay the judgment, but those payments\nstopped when David retired in the fall of 1996.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fet seq., which automatically stayed the fraudulent conveyance\n\nproceedings.   See 11 U.S.C. § 362.            The bankruptcy court ruled on\n\nJuly 2, 1999 that David's MIT pension was not the property of his\n\nbankruptcy estate.        It also held on October 29, 1999 that David's\n\njudgment   debt     to    Jennifer   and       interest    on   that    debt     were\n\nnondischargeable.        David appealed both rulings.           His appeals were\n\ndismissed for lack of prosecution.\n\n           On November 22, 1999, Jennifer alerted the district court\n\nto the bankruptcy court's rulings and renewed her request to modify\n\nthe August 4, 1993 order.            She again did not mention social\n\nsecurity benefits in her motion. David opposed the motion. First,\n\nhe argued that Florida, not Massachusetts, law applied because he\n\nwas a Florida resident and maintained a Florida residence in\n\naddition to his home in Massachusetts.                He contended that Fla.\n\nStat. chs. 222.21(2)(a) and 222.14 exempted his ERISA pension\n\nbenefits from the claims of all creditors.                Second, he argued that\n\nthe order would effectively be an execution of judgment and that\n\nunder   Fed.   R.    Civ.    P.   4.1,     a    district     court     sitting     in\n\nMassachusetts did not have the authority to execute on the assets\n\nof a Florida resident.       Finally, he argued that the proposed order\n\nwould violate ERISA's anti-alienation provision, which states that\n\n\"[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the\n\nplan may not be assigned or alienated.\"              29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            On May 13, 2002, the court entered its findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law as to the fraudulent conveyance claims,\n\nfinding that David had fraudulently conveyed over $130,000 in\n\nassets.3 Two weeks later, on May 30, 2002, the court inserted the\n\nfollowing language into the August 4, 1993 preliminary injunction:\n\n            1. David Hoult shall place all monies, income and funds\n            he receives from any source in a single Massachuestts's\n            [sic] bank account in his name only (the \"Account\") on or\n            before June 14, 2002;\n\n            2. David Hoult shall not make any withdrawals from the\n            Account except for $2,900 per month; and\n\n            3. David Hoult shall provide Plaintiff's attorney . . .\n            with (i) the name of the bank and the account number of\n            the Account; (ii) a copy of each check or receipt which\n            documents monies or income he receives; and (iii) a copy\n            of the monthly statement of activity (the \"Monthly\n            Statement\") relative to the Account.\n\nThe order made no exception for either David's social security or\n\nhis ERISA pension benefits.    Indeed, social security benefits may\n\nhave been included without the court being aware that \"all income\"\n\nincluded social security payments.\n\n            David did not appeal the May 30 order.     Initially, he\n\nsimply refused to comply with the order and was held in contempt.\n\nAfter he began to comply on July 3, 2002, the court purged him of\n\nthat contempt.   Then, on July 20, 2002, twenty days after the time\n\nfor filing an interlocutory appeal from the May 30 order had\n\nexpired, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), David filed a motion with\n\n\n     3\n            The court entered final judgment to this effect on March\n24, 2003.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe district court to strike social security and ERISA pension\n\nbenefits from the order.      In that motion, he stated, \"The instant\n\nmotion is directed only to social security and pension benefits.\n\nDefendant recognizes that the [May 30 order] remains effective with\n\nrespect to all other 'monies, income or funds' he receives from any\n\nother source.\"    As to his ERISA benefits, David reiterated his\n\nearlier   arguments   under   Florida    law   and   under   ERISA's   anti-\n\nalienation provision.4   He also argued that, as written, the order\n\nviolated the anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act,\n\nwhich provides that \"none of the moneys paid or payable or rights\n\nexisting under this title shall be subject to execution, levy,\n\nattachment,   garnishment,    or   other   legal     process,    or   to   the\n\noperation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\"                 42 U.S.C. §\n\n407(a).   This was the first time the issue of social security\n\nbenefits was argued to the court.\n\n           Jennifer defended the order as to the ERISA benefits,\n\narguing, inter alia, that ERISA's anti-alienation provision does\n\nnot prevent alienation of benefits after they have been distributed\n\nto beneficiaries and that David's citation to Florida law was\n\ninapposite because Massachusetts law, rather than Florida law,\n\n\n     4\n          David also raised a new argument that Jennifer had taken\nthe position before the bankruptcy court that his ERISA benefits\nshould be excluded from his estate based on ERISA's anti-alienation\nprovision and, hence, that she should be judicially estopped from\nseeking the order at issue in this case. David's counsel stated in\noral argument before us that he has abandoned this argument on\nappeal.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fapplied.   As to the social security benefits, Jennifer argued that\n\nthe order did not violate the Social Security Act's anti-alienation\n\nprovision because it did not \"attach\" David's social security\n\nincome but merely required him to deposit it in a designated bank\n\naccount for monitoring.       She said that she \"would not object,\n\nhowever, if concrete proof of the amount of his social security\n\npayment is provided, to excluding that amount from the required\n\nincome deposit and, concomitantly, reducing the monthly amount\n\nDavid may withdraw by that same amount.\"           David's social security\n\npayment is about $1,400 per month; the May 30 order allowed him to\n\nwithdraw $2,900 per month.\n\n            At a hearing on David's motion on August 2, 2002, the\n\ndistrict    court   asked   David's    counsel    whether   David   had   any\n\nobjection to Jennifer's proposal.           He said that David did not.    In\n\nthe end, though, the court decided that it was not necessary to\n\nadopt Jennifer's proposal and, instead, simply denied David's\n\nmotion.    The court ruled that the order did not need to be altered\n\nas to social security benefits, reasoning that David's disposal of\n\nhis social security benefits was not restrained in any way because\n\nhis $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit far exceeded the $1,400 he\n\nreceived in social security benefits. Nor did the order, the court\n\nruled, have to be amended as to the ERISA benefits.          The court held\n\nthat ERISA's anti-alienation provision presented no bar once the\n\nfunds had been distributed to David.          The court further determined\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthat even if Florida law applied, it did not help David because its\n\nrelevant provisions applied only to honest debtors and David, based\n\non his history of fraudulent conveyances, was not such a debtor.\n\nDavid filed this appeal from the denial of his motion to strike on\n\nSeptember 3, 2002.\n\n            While this appeal was pending, David stopped complying\n\nwith the May 30 order.   On May 14, 2003, Jennifer filed a motion to\n\nhold David in civil contempt, alleging that David had not produced\n\nany of the monthly statements required under the May 30 order since\n\nJanuary 2003.   A grand jury indicted David on August 27, 2003 for\n\nthree counts of felony criminal contempt.    The indictment alleged\n\nthat in January 2003 David stopped depositing his income in the\n\ndesignated Massachusetts account and started putting it in a\n\nFlorida account instead; that David exceeded his $2,900 withdrawal\n\nlimit virtually every month since November 2002; and that, by March\n\n2003, there was only about $23 left in the Massachusetts account.\n\nOn January 16, 2004, the district court granted Jennifer's motion\n\nfor civil contempt and awarded $46,676 in damages. On February 24,\n\n2004, David pleaded guilty to all three counts of felony criminal\n\ncontempt.\n\n                                 II.\n\n            David does not appeal from the issuance of the May 30,\n\n2002 order but instead from the denial of his motion to strike\n\nERISA and social security benefits from that order.   We review the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdenial of a motion to modify a preliminary injunction for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   See Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Patch, 202 F.3d 29, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); 16 Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure § 3924.2 (West 1996).    Under that standard, pure issues\n\nof law are reviewed de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and\n\njudgment calls with considerable deference.    See Nieves-Marquez v.\n\nPuerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 120 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           David raises three sets of arguments on appeal.   First,\n\nhe argues that the May 30, 2002 order constitutes an improper\n\nexecution of judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a).       Second, he\n\nargues that the application of the May 30 order to his ERISA\n\npension benefits violates (1) Florida statutes that he reads as\n\nexempting such benefits from creditors' claims, see Fla. Stat. chs.\n\n222.21(2)(a), 222.14; and (2) the anti-alienation provision of\n\nERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(1).    Third, he argues that the order's\n\napplication to his social security benefits violates the anti-\n\nalienation provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n407(a).   We consider each argument in turn.\n\nA.   Authority to enter the May 30 order\n\n           David argues that the May 30 order is effectively an\n\nattempt to execute on the judgment and that, on his reading of Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 69(a), a writ of execution is required.5    Fed. R. Civ.\n\n\n     5\n          Rule 69(a) provides that \"[p]rocess to enforce a judgment\nfor the payment of money shall be a writ of execution, unless the\ncourt directs otherwise.\"    David argues that the exception for\n\n                                 -10-\n\fP. 4.1 requires such writs to be served within the territorial\n\nlimits of the state in which the district court sits (here,\n\nMassachusetts).    David claims that he is a Florida resident and\n\nthat the district court in Massachusetts therefore does not have\n\nauthority to execute the judgment against him.\n\n            This argument comes too late.   On appeal from the denial\n\nof a motion to modify an injunction, \"review does not extend to the\n\npropriety of the original order.\"   16 Federal Practice & Procedure\n\n§ 3924.2; see also Lichtenberg v. Besicorp Group, Inc., 204 F.3d\n\n397, 401 (2d Cir. 2000).       This argument is an attack on the\n\ndistrict court's authority to issue the May 30 order (and, indeed,\n\non its power to issue the original August 4, 1993 order), not the\n\ncourt's refusal to strike ERISA and social security benefits from\n\nthat order.   Accordingly, it is beyond the scope of our review.   If\n\nDavid wished to make such a challenge, he should have appealed\n\ndirectly from the May 30 order within the thirty-day appeals\n\nperiod.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) (interlocutory appeals may be\n\ntaken from preliminary injunctions); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A)\n\n(allowing thirty days from the entry of the order to file an\n\nappeal).\n\nB.   ERISA benefits\n\n\n\n\nsituations in which \"the court directs otherwise\" applies only when\nexecution is an inadequate remedy and says that no such showing has\nbeen made here.\n\n                                -11-\n\f          We turn to the court's refusal to strike ERISA benefits\n\nfrom the order.    We first clear away the issue of whether state law\n\npresents any barrier to the May 30 order.            The parties dispute\n\nwhether the order was issued under Fed. R. Civ. P. 69 (post-\n\njudgment executions) or Fed. R. Civ. P. 64 (pre-judgment orders).\n\nUnder either rule, the order must comport with the law of the state\n\nin which the district court is held (here, Massachusetts), except\n\nthat any federal statute governs to the extent applicable.6\n\n          David raises a belated argument that the order violates\n\nMassachusetts law, which requires that \"amounts held by a trustee\n\nfor a defendant in a pension shall be reserved in the hands of the\n\ntrustee and shall be exempt from attachment.\"          Mass. Gen. L. ch.\n\n246, § 28 (defining \"pension\" as including all ERISA pensions).\n\nThis argument has been waived, as it was made for the first time in\n\nDavid's reply brief.      Andresen v. Diorio, 349 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   Moreover, even were it not waived, the argument fails on\n\nthe merits.   Section 28 is not applicable because the order does\n\nnot affect amounts held in trust for David by a third-party; the\n\norder directs     David   himself   to   deposit   pension   funds   in   the\n\ndesignated bank account after those funds reach his hands.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          David argues that Florida law exempts pension money from\nall claims of creditors and from all legal process, citing Fla.\nStat. chs. 222.21(2)(a), 222.14. But under both Rule 64 and Rule\n69, the relevant law is that of Massachusetts, not that of Florida.\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           David's primary argument is that the order violates\n\nfederal law: namely, ERISA's anti-alienation provision, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§   1056(d)(1).     Jennifer   responds   that   §   1056(d)(1)   does   not\n\nrestrict alienation of pension benefits that have already been\n\ndistributed to plan beneficiaries. If Jennifer is correct, the May\n\n30 order does not violate § 1056(d)(1) because the order applies\n\nonly after the pension benefits are disbursed to David each month.\n\n           Four of the five courts of appeals to consider the\n\nquestion have construed     § 1056(d)(1) as applying to benefits only\n\nwhile held by the plan administrator and not after they reach the\n\nhands of the beneficiary. Wright v. Riveland, 219 F.3d 905, 919-21\n\n(9th Cir. 2000); Robbins v. DeBuono, 218 F.3d 197, 203 (2d Cir.\n\n2000); Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat'l Pension Fund, 39 F.3d\n\n1078, 1081-83 (10th Cir. 1994) (en banc); Trucking Employees of\n\nNorth Jersey Welfare Fund, Inc. v. Colville, 16 F.3d 52, 54-56 (3d\n\nCir. 1994).    One court has held that § 1056(d)(1) bars alienation\n\nof benefits after distribution to the beneficiary if those benefits\n\nare post-retirement annuity payments (but not if they are pre-\n\nretirement lump sum payments).       United States v. Smith, 47 F.3d\n\n681, 682-84 (4th Cir. 1995).      We join the majority view.\n\n           The plain language of § 1056(d)(1) is that \"[e]ach\n\npension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan\n\nmay not be assigned or alienated.\"        That language governs only the\n\nplan itself.      Standing alone, it \"does not read comfortably as a\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fprohibition against creditors reaching pension benefits once they\n\nhave left the hands of the administrator.\"             Robbins, 218 F.3d at\n\n203.       If Congress had intended § 1056(d)(1) to reach that far, it\n\ncould easily have employed the type of language found, for example,\n\nin the Veterans Benefits Act, 38 U.S.C. § 5301(a), which prohibits\n\nattachment of benefits \"either before or after receipt by the\n\nbeneficiary.\"         That Congress chose not to do so is significant.\n\n               The regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Treasury,\n\nwho has the authority to implement § 1056(d) of ERISA,7 further\n\nreinforce      our    interpretation.       Those   regulations,    which   are\n\nentitled to deference under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def.\n\nCouncil,      Inc.,    467   U.S.   837,   844   (1984),   define   the   terms\n\n\"assignment\" and \"alienation\" to cover:\n\n               (i)     Any arrangement providing for the payment to the\n                       employer of plan benefits which otherwise would\n                       be due the participant under the plan, and\n\n               (ii)    Any direct or indirect arrangement (whether\n                       revocable or irrevocable) whereby a party\n                       acquires from a participant or beneficiary a\n                       right or interest enforceable against the plan\n                       in, or to, all or any part of a plan benefit\n\n\n\n       7\n          Congress originally delegated this power to the Secretary\nof Labor. 29 U.S.C. § 1135 (1974). In 1978, President Carter,\npursuant to the Reorganization Act of 1977, 5 U.S.C. §§ 901-12,\ntransferred   that    authority   to   the   Treasury    Secretary,\nReorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n9814, 9815, and Congress ratified that transfer in 1984, Pub. L.\nNo. 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705 (1984). The Supreme Court has recognized\nthe Treasury regulations as the \"applicable administrative\nregulations\" for § 1056(d). Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat'l\nPension Fund, 493 U.S. 365, 371-72 (1990).\n\n                                      -14-\n\f                   payment which is, or may become, payable to the\n                   participant or beneficiary.\n\n26 C.F.R. § 1.401(a)-13(c)(1) (emphasis added).        Once benefits are\n\ndistributed to the beneficiary, a creditor's rights are enforceable\n\nagainst the beneficiary, not against the plan itself; accordingly,\n\nunder the regulations, § 1056(d)(1) does not apply.         The Treasury\n\nSecretary's interpretation is a reasonable one, and given that\n\nChevron deference applies, we decline to disturb it.\n\n            The only court to have disagreed with this interpretation\n\nis the Fourth Circuit in Smith.    There, the majority held, over a\n\ndissent, that § 1056(d)(1) prohibits alienation of pension funds\n\nafter the funds are distributed when those funds are received as\n\nannuity payments during retirement, but not when those funds are\n\nreceived as a lump sum payment before retirement.        47 F.3d at 683.\n\nThe Smith majority relied primarily on Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo,\n\n439 U.S. 572 (1979), which held that the anti-alienation provision\n\nof the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), 45 U.S.C. § 231m(a), covers\n\nbenefits after they are disbursed to beneficiaries.             439 U.S. at\n\n583; see also Smith, 47 F.3d at 683-84.\n\n            We read the statute differently.     Nothing in ERISA or in\n\nthe regulations supports a distinction in the anti-alienation\n\nprovision   between   pre-retirement    lump   sum   payments    and   post-\n\nretirement annuity payments.       And Hisquierdo is not a useful\n\nanalogy because of differences in language between the anti-\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\falienation provision of the RRA and that of ERISA.         The RRA\n\nprovides, in relevant part, that:\n\n          Notwithstanding any other law of the United States, or of\n          any State, territory, or the District of Columbia, no\n          annuity or supplemental annuity shall be assignable or be\n          subject to any tax or to garnishment, attachment, or\n          other legal process under any circumstances whatsoever,\n          nor shall the payment thereof be anticipated.\n\n45 U.S.C. § 231m(a) (emphasis added).   In concluding that Congress\n\nintended § 231m to reach benefits after distribution, the Supreme\n\nCourt emphasized the fact that the statute was written broadly to\n\nprohibit creditors from subjecting the annuity to any \"legal\n\nprocess under any circumstances whatsoever.\"   Hisquierdo, 439 U.S.\n\nat 586.   No similarly sweeping language exists in ERISA's anti-\n\nalienation provision.8\n\nC.   Social security benefits\n\n          David also argues that the district court's refusal to\n\nstrike social security benefits from the order violates the anti-\n\nalienation provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n407(a), which provides that\n\n          The right of any person to any future payment under this\n          subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at\n          law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable\n          or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject\n          to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other\n\n\n\n     8\n          Indeed, since Hisquierdo, the Supreme Court has expressly\nreserved judgment on whether ERISA benefits may be alienated after\ndistribution, see Boggs v. Boggs, 520 U.S. 833, 845 (1997),\nsuggesting that the Court itself does not view Hisquierdo as\ncontrolling on that issue.\n\n                                -16-\n\f            legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or\n            insolvency law.\n\nThere is no question that § 407(a), unlike § 1056(d)(1), applies to\n\nbenefits    after    they   have   been   distributed   to   beneficiaries.\n\nSee Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Bd., 409 U.S. 413, 414-16\n\n(1973).\n\n            Jennifer argues, nonetheless, that the May 30 order does\n\nnot violate § 407(a) because it does not constitute an \"execution,\n\nlevy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process\" within the\n\nmeaning of § 407(a).         She contends that the order imposes no\n\nrestraint on David's ability to dispose of his monthly social\n\nsecurity check because it allows him to withdraw the full amount of\n\nthe social security check after depositing it in the designated\n\nbank account.       His social security check is approximately $1,400\n\nper month; he is allowed to withdraw $2,900 per month.            The only\n\neffect of the order, Jennifer contends, is to track David's income\n\neach month.\n\n            David, citing Robbins, 218 F.3d at 201, responds that the\n\nterm \"other legal process\" is construed expansively to cover all\n\nexpress or implied threats to resort to legal processes such as\n\ncontempt.   He points out that the order requires him, under threat\n\nof contempt, to deposit his benefits in a bank account effectively\n\ncontrolled by the court and to report those deposits to Jennifer.\n\nThat, he argues, is restraint enough to trigger § 407.\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            The Supreme Court has recently provided some guidance on\n\nthe interpretation of \"other legal process\" in § 407.      The Court\n\nstated that\n\n            \"other legal process\" should be understood to be process\n            much like the processes of execution, levy, attachment,\n            and garnishment, and at a minimum, would seem to require\n            utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism,\n            though not necessarily an elaborate one, by which control\n            over property passes from one person to another in order\n            to discharge or secure discharge of an allegedly existing\n            or anticipated liability.\n\nWash. State Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs. v. Keffeler, 537 U.S.\n\n371, 385 (2003).     The question whether the May 30 order \"passes\n\ncontrol\" over David's social security check to the court is a\n\ndifficult one.\n\n            That question, however, is not one that we need to\n\nresolve. Both Jennifer and David stated to the district court that\n\nthey would have no objection to an arrangement that exempted\n\nDavid's social security benefits from the May 30 order, required\n\nDavid to report the amount of his monthly social security benefits,\n\nand reduced his $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit by that amount.\n\nJennifer's counsel reiterated this position to us during oral\n\nargument.     In light of the parties' mutual amenability, we think\n\nthe best solution is to remand with instructions to adopt that\n\narrangement.\n\n            We anticipate that David may claim that he should not be\n\nrequired under § 407 even to report the amount of his social\n\nsecurity benefits. Any such argument would fail. David has waived\n\n                                 -18-\n\fthe argument and, even had it been preserved, such a reporting\n\nrequirement would not violate § 407.     The arrangement to which\n\nDavid has agreed depends on his accurate reporting of the amount of\n\nhis benefits.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We vacate the denial of the motion to strike as to social\n\nsecurity benefits and remand with instructions to modify the order\n\nto exempt social security benefits, to require David Hoult to\n\nreport the amount of his social security benefits each month, and\n\nto reduce the monthly withdrawal limit by that amount.   We affirm\n\nthe denial of the motion to strike in all other respects.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

The verdict was affirmed on appeal in <i>Hoult v. Hoult,</i> 57 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1995). This case arises from Jennifer's attempt to collect on that judgment, which, almost eleven years later, has still not been paid in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, 2002, the district court found that David had fraudulently conveyed over $130,000 in assets to avoid paying the judgment. Two weeks later, on May 30, it entered an order requiring him to deposit all his income in a designated Massachusetts bank account and to limit his withdrawals from that account to $2,900 per month, a sum meant to cover his reasonable living expenses. David did not appeal from that order. He later moved in the district court to strike from the order social security benefits and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pension benefits that he receives, arguing principally that federal statutes prohibit the alienation of each of those benefits. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 407(a) (social security); 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1) (ERISA). The court denied his motion. David, who has since been found in civil and criminal contempt for refusing to comply with the order, now appeals from that denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court properly denied the motion to strike as to ERISA benefits. ERISA's anti-alienation provision does not apply where, as here, the funds have already been disbursed to the plan beneficiary. In so holding, we join four other circuits and disagree with one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More difficult questions are raised by the court's refusal to strike social security benefits from the order, but we need not resolve those questions here. The parties stated to the district court that neither had any objection to an arrangement that would exempt David's social security benefits from the order but would reduce his $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit by the amount of his monthly social security check (about $1,400 per month). We confirmed this at oral argument. We affirm the denial of the motion to strike the ERISA pension benefits and remand with instructions to modify the order as to social security benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 29, 1993, four weeks after the verdict, Jennifer moved for a preliminary injunction barring David and his current wife (not Jennifer's mother) from transferring David's assets except as necessary for ordinary living expenses. Jennifer alleged that she had discovered that after she had filed suit in July 1988, David had started transferring his assets to protect them from a potential judgment. The district court granted the injunction on August 4. David did not appeal that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 1994, Jennifer filed a supplemental complaint against David and his wife for fraudulent conveyance and civil contempt. A five-day bench trial was held on the fraudulent conveyance claims in January 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1996, before judgment had entered in the fraudulent conveyance trial, Jennifer learned that David had retired from his position as a senior research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and had begun receiving approximately $4,800 in ERISA pension benefits from MIT each month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On January 27, 1997, she moved to modify the August 4, 1993 preliminary injunction to require, inter alia, that David deposit his monthly ERISA pension check in a designated bank account and limit his withdrawals from that account to $1,700 per month (which, according to his testimony in the fraudulent conveyance trial, was the amount that he contributed each month to his and his wife's living expenses). Her motion did not mention social security benefits. The district court said that it would allow the motion and requested Jennifer's counsel to file a proposed form of order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the order was issued and before judgment entered in the fraudulent conveyance trial, David filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101 <i>et seq.,</i> which automatically stayed the fraudulent conveyance proceedings. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362. The bankruptcy court ruled on July 2, 1999 that David's MIT pension was not the property of his bankruptcy estate. It also held on October 29, 1999 that David's judgment debt to Jennifer and interest on that debt were nondischargeable. David appealed both rulings. His appeals were dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1999, Jennifer alerted the district court to the bankruptcy court's rulings and renewed her request to modify the August 4, 1993 order. She again did not mention social security benefits in her motion. David opposed the motion. First, he argued that Florida, not Massachusetts, law applied because he was a Florida resident and maintained a Florida residence in addition to his home in Massachusetts. He contended that Fla. Stat. chs. 222.21(2)(a) and 222.14 exempted his ERISA pension benefits from the claims of all creditors. Second, he argued that the order would effectively be an execution of judgment and that under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4.1, a district court sitting in Massachusetts did not have the authority to execute on the assets of a Florida resident. Finally, he argued that the proposed order would violate ERISA's anti-alienation provision, which states that \"[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, 2002, the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the fraudulent conveyance claims, finding that David had fraudulently conveyed over $130,000 in assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Two weeks later, on May 30, 2002, the court inserted the following language into the August 4, 1993 preliminary injunction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. David Hoult shall place all monies, income and funds he receives from any source in a single Massachusetts's [sic] bank account in his name only (the \"Account\") on or before June 14, 2002;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. David Hoult shall not make any withdrawals from the Account except for $2,900 per month; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. David Hoult shall provide Plaintiff's attorney ... with (i) the name of the bank and the account number of the Account; (ii) a copy of each check or receipt which documents monies or income he receives; and (iii) a copy of the monthly statement of activity (the \"Monthly Statement\") relative to the Account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order made no exception for either David's social security or his ERISA pension benefits. Indeed, social security benefits may have been included without the court being aware that \"all income\" included social security payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David did not appeal the May 30 order. Initially, he simply refused to comply with the order and was held in contempt. After he began to comply on July 3, 2002, the court purged him of that contempt. Then, on July 20, 2002, twenty days after the time for filing an interlocutory appeal from the May 30 order had expired, <i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), David filed a motion with the district court to strike social security and ERISA pension benefits from the order. In that motion, he stated, \"The instant motion is directed only to social security and pension benefits. Defendant recognizes that the [May 30 order] remains effective with respect to all other `monies, income or funds' he receives from any other source.\" As to his ERISA benefits, David reiterated his earlier arguments under Florida law and under ERISA's anti-alienation provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> He also argued that, as written, the order violated the anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act, which provides that \"none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 407(a). This was the first time the issue of social security benefits was argued to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jennifer defended the order as to the ERISA benefits, arguing, inter alia, that ERISA's anti-alienation provision does not prevent alienation of benefits after they have been distributed to beneficiaries and that David's citation to Florida law was inapposite because Massachusetts law, rather than Florida law, applied. As to the social security benefits, Jennifer argued that the order did not violate the Social Security Act's anti-alienation provision because it did not \"attach\" David's social security income but merely required him to deposit it in a designated bank account for monitoring. She said that she \"would not object, however, if concrete proof of the amount of his social security payment is provided, to excluding that amount from the required income deposit and, concomitantly, reducing the monthly amount David may withdraw by that same amount.\" David's social security payment is about $1,400 per month; the May 30 order allowed him to withdraw $2,900 per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on David's motion on August 2, 2002, the district court asked David's counsel whether David had any objection to Jennifer's proposal. He said that David did not. In the end, though, the court decided that it was not necessary to adopt Jennifer's proposal and, instead, simply denied David's motion. The court ruled that the order did not need to be altered as to social security benefits, reasoning that David's disposal of his social security benefits was not restrained in any way because his $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit far exceeded the $1,400 he received in social security benefits. Nor did the order, the court ruled, have to be amended as to the ERISA benefits. The court held that ERISA's anti-alienation provision presented no bar once the funds had been distributed to David. The court further determined that even if Florida law applied, it did not help David because its relevant provisions applied only to honest debtors and David, based on his history of fraudulent conveyances, was not such a debtor. David filed this appeal from the denial of his motion to strike on September 3, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this appeal was pending, David stopped complying with the May 30 order. On May 14, 2003, Jennifer filed a motion to hold David in civil contempt, alleging that David had not produced any of the monthly statements required under the May 30 order since January 2003. A grand jury indicted David on August 27, 2003 for three counts of felony criminal contempt. The indictment alleged that in January 2003 David stopped depositing his income in the designated Massachusetts account and started putting it in a Florida account instead; that David exceeded his $2,900 withdrawal limit virtually every month since November 2002; and that, by March 2003, there was only about $23 left in the Massachusetts account. On January 16, 2004, the district court granted Jennifer's motion for civil contempt and awarded $46,676 in damages. On February 24, 2004, David pleaded guilty to all three counts of felony criminal contempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David does not appeal from the issuance of the May 30, 2002 order but instead from the denial of his motion to strike ERISA and social security benefits from that order. We review the denial of a motion to modify a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <i>See Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v.

Under that standard, pure issues of law are reviewed de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and judgment calls with considerable deference. <i>See Nieves Marquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 120 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David raises three sets of arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the May 30, 2002 order constitutes an improper execution of judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a). Second, he argues that the application of the May 30 order to his ERISA pension benefits violates (1) Florida statutes that he reads as exempting such benefits from creditors' claims, <i>see</i> Fla. Stat. chs. 222.21(2)(a), 222.14; and (2) the anti-alienation provision of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1). Third, he argues that the order's application to his social security benefits violates the anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 407(a). We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Authority to enter the May 30 order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David argues that the May 30 order is effectively an attempt to execute on the judgment and that, on his reading of Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a), a writ of execution is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4.1 requires such writs to be served within the territorial limits of the state in which the district court sits (here, Massachusetts). David claims that he is a Florida resident and that the district court in Massachusetts therefore does not have authority to execute the judgment against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument comes too late. On appeal from the denial of a motion to modify an injunction, \"review does not extend to the propriety of the original order.\" 16 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 3924.2; <i>see also Lichtenberg v. Besicorp Group, Inc.,</i> 204 F.3d 397, 401 (2d Cir.2000). This argument is an attack on the district court's authority to issue the May 30 order (and, indeed, on its power to issue the original August 4, 1993 order), not the court's refusal to strike ERISA and social security benefits from that order. Accordingly, it is beyond the scope of our review. If David wished to make such a challenge, he should have appealed directly from the May 30 order within the thirty-day appeals period. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1) (interlocutory appeals may be taken from preliminary injunctions); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (allowing thirty days from the entry of the order to file an appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. ERISA benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the court's refusal to strike ERISA benefits from the order. We first clear away the issue of whether state law presents any barrier to the May 30 order. The parties dispute whether the order was issued under Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 (post-judgment executions) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 64 (pre-judgment orders). Under either rule, the order must comport with the law of the state in which the district court is held (here, Massachusetts), except that any federal statute governs to the extent applicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David raises a belated argument that the order violates Massachusetts law, which requires that \"amounts held by a trustee for a defendant in a pension shall be reserved in the hands of the trustee and shall be exempt from attachment.\" Mass. Gen. L. ch. 246, &#167; 28 (defining \"pension\" as including all ERISA pensions). This argument has been waived, as it was made for the first time in David's reply brief. <i>Andresen v. Diorio,</i> 349 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.2003). Moreover, even were it not waived, the argument fails on the merits. Section 28 is not applicable because the order does not affect amounts held in trust for David by a third-party; the order directs David himself to deposit pension funds in the designated bank account after those funds reach his hands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David's primary argument is that the order violates federal law: namely, ERISA's anti-alienation provision, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1). Jennifer responds that &#167; 1056(d)(1) does not restrict alienation of pension benefits that have already been distributed to plan beneficiaries. If Jennifer is correct, the May 30 order does not violate &#167; 1056(d)(1) because the order applies only after the pension benefits are disbursed to David each month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four of the five courts of appeals to consider the question have construed &#167; 1056(d)(1) as applying to benefits only while held by the plan administrator and not after they reach the hands of the beneficiary. <i>Wright v. Riveland,</i> 219 F.3d 905, 919-21 (9th Cir.2000); <i>Robbins v. DeBuono,</i> 218 F.3d 197, 203 (2d Cir.2000); <i>Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat'l Pension Fund,</i> 39 F.3d 1078, 1081-83 (10th Cir.1994) (en banc); <i>Trucking Employees of North Jersey Welfare Fund, Inc. v. Colville,</i> 16 F.3d 52, 54-56 (3d Cir.1994). One court has held that &#167; 1056(d)(1) bars alienation of benefits after distribution to the beneficiary if those benefits are post-retirement annuity payments (but not if they are pre-retirement lump sum payments). <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 47 F.3d 681, 682-84 (4th Cir.1995). We join the majority view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of &#167; 1056(d)(1) is that \"[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\" That language governs only the plan itself. Standing alone, it \"does not read comfortably as a prohibition against creditors reaching pension benefits once they have left the hands of the administrator.\" <i>Robbins,</i> 218 F.3d at 203. If Congress had intended &#167; 1056(d)(1) to reach that far, it could easily have employed the type of language found, for example, in the Veterans Benefits Act, 38 U.S.C. &#167; 5301(a), which prohibits attachment of benefits \"either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\" That Congress chose not to do so is significant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Treasury, who has the authority to implement &#167; 1056(d) of ERISA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> further reinforce our interpretation. Those regulations, which are entitled to deference under <i>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), define the terms \"assignment\" and \"alienation\" to cover:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Any arrangement providing for the payment to the employer of plan benefits which otherwise would be due the participant under the plan, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Any direct or indirect arrangement (whether revocable or irrevocable) whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest <i>enforceable against the plan</i> in, or to, all or any part of a plan benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to the participant or beneficiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.401(a)-13(c)(1) (emphasis added). Once benefits are distributed to the beneficiary, a creditor's rights are enforceable against the <i>beneficiary,</i> not against the <i>plan</i> itself; accordingly, under the regulations, &#167; 1056(d)(1) does not apply. The Treasury Secretary's interpretation is a reasonable one, and given that <i>Chevron</i> deference applies, we decline to disturb it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only court to have disagreed with this interpretation is the Fourth Circuit in <i>Smith.</i> There, the majority held, over a dissent, that &#167; 1056(d)(1) prohibits alienation of pension funds after the funds are distributed when those funds are received as annuity payments during retirement, but not when those funds are received as a lump sum payment before retirement. 47 F.3d at 683. The <i>Smith</i> majority relied primarily on <i>Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo,</i> 439 U.S. 572, 99 S.Ct. 802, 59 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979), which held that the anti-alienation provision of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), 45 U.S.C. &#167; 231m(a), covers benefits after they are disbursed to beneficiaries. 439 U.S. at 583, 99 S.Ct. 802; <i>see also Smith,</i> 47 F.3d at 683-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We read the statute differently. Nothing in ERISA or in the regulations supports a distinction in the anti-alienation provision between pre-retirement lump sum payments and post-retirement annuity payments. And <i>Hisquierdo</i> is not a useful analogy because of differences in language between the anti-alienation provision of the RRA and that of ERISA. The RRA provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other law of the United States, or of any State, territory, or the District of Columbia, no annuity or supplemental annuity shall be assignable or be subject to any tax or to garnishment, attachment, or other legal process <i>under any circumstances whatsoever,</i> nor shall the payment thereof be anticipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">45 U.S.C. &#167; 231m(a) (emphasis added). In concluding that Congress intended &#167; 231m to reach benefits after distribution, the Supreme Court emphasized the fact that the statute was written broadly to prohibit creditors from subjecting the annuity to any \"legal process under any circumstances whatsoever.\" <i>Hisquierdo,</i> 439 U.S. at 586, 99 S.Ct. 802. No similarly sweeping language exists in ERISA's anti-alienation provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Social security benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David also argues that the district court's refusal to strike social security benefits from the order violates the anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 407(a), which provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that &#167; 407(a), unlike &#167; 1056(d)(1), applies to benefits after they have been distributed to beneficiaries. <i>See Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Bd.,</i> 409 U.S. 413, 414-16, 93 S.Ct. 590, 34 L.Ed.2d 608 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jennifer argues, nonetheless, that the May 30 order does not violate &#167; 407(a) because it does not constitute an \"execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process\" within the meaning of &#167; 407(a). She contends that the order imposes no restraint on David's ability to dispose of his monthly social security check because it allows him to withdraw the full amount of the social security check after depositing it in the designated bank account. His social security check is approximately $1,400 per month; he is allowed to withdraw $2,900 per month. The only effect of the order, Jennifer contends, is to track David's income each month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David, citing <i>Robbins,</i> 218 F.3d at 201, responds that the term \"other legal process\" is construed expansively to cover all express or implied threats to resort to legal processes such as contempt. He points out that the order requires him, under threat of contempt, to deposit his benefits in a bank account effectively controlled by the court and to report those deposits to Jennifer. That, he argues, is restraint enough to trigger &#167; 407.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recently provided some guidance on the interpretation of \"other legal process\" in &#167; 407. The Court stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"other legal process\" should be understood to be process much like the processes of execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment, and at a minimum, would seem to require utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, though not necessarily an elaborate one, by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge or secure discharge of an allegedly existing or anticipated liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Wash. State Dep't of Soc. &amp; Health Servs. v. Estate of Keffeler,</i> 537 U.S. 371, 385, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003). The question whether the May 30 order \"passes control\" over David's social security check to the court is a difficult one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That question, however, is not one that we need to resolve. Both Jennifer and David stated to the district court that they would have no objection to an arrangement that exempted David's social security benefits from the May 30 order, required David to report the amount of his monthly social security benefits, and reduced his $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit by that amount. Jennifer's counsel reiterated this position to us during oral argument. In light of the parties' mutual amenability, we think the best solution is to remand with instructions to adopt that arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We anticipate that David may claim that he should not be required under &#167; 407 even to report the amount of his social security benefits. Any such argument would fail. David has waived the argument and, even had it been preserved, such a reporting requirement would not violate &#167; 407. The arrangement to which David has agreed depends on his accurate reporting of the amount of his benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>vacate</i> the denial of the motion to strike as to social security benefits and <i>remand</i> with instructions to modify the order to exempt social security benefits, to require David Hoult to report the amount of his social security benefits each month, and to reduce the monthly withdrawal limit by that amount.

The verdict was affirmed on appeal in <i>Hoult v. Hoult,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196077\"><a href=\"/opinion/196077/hoult-v-hoult/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1995). This case arises from Jennifer's attempt to collect on that judgment, which, almost eleven years later, has still not been paid in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, 2002, the district court found that David had fraudulently conveyed over $130,000 in assets to avoid paying the judgment. Two weeks later, on May 30, it entered an order requiring him to deposit all his income in a designated Massachusetts bank account and to limit his withdrawals from that account to $2,900 per month, a sum meant to cover his reasonable living expenses. David did not appeal from that order. He later moved in the district court to strike from the order social security benefits and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pension benefits that he receives, arguing principally that federal statutes prohibit the alienation of each of those benefits. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 407(a) (social security); 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1) (ERISA). The court denied his motion. David, who has since been found in civil and criminal contempt for refusing to comply with the order, now appeals from that denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court properly denied the motion to strike as to ERISA benefits. ERISA's anti-alienation provision does not apply where, as here, the funds have already been disbursed to the plan beneficiary. In so holding, we join four other circuits and disagree with one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More difficult questions are raised by the court's refusal to strike social security benefits from the order, but we need not resolve those questions here. The parties stated to the district court that neither had any objection to an arrangement that would exempt David's social security benefits from the order but would reduce his $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit by the amount of his monthly social security check (about $1,400 per month). We confirmed this at oral argument. We affirm the denial of the motion to strike the ERISA pension benefits and remand with instructions to modify the order as to social security benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 29, 1993, four weeks after the verdict, Jennifer moved for a preliminary injunction barring David and his current wife (not Jennifer's mother) from transferring David's assets except as necessary for ordinary living expenses. Jennifer alleged that she had discovered that after she had filed suit in July 1988, David had started transferring his assets to protect them from a potential judgment. The district court granted the injunction on August 4. David did not appeal that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 1994, Jennifer filed a supplemental complaint against David and his wife for fraudulent conveyance and civil contempt. A five-day bench trial was held on the fraudulent conveyance claims in January 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1996, before judgment had entered in the fraudulent conveyance trial, Jennifer learned that David had retired from his position as a senior research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and had begun receiving approximately $4,800 in ERISA pension benefits from MIT each month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On January 27, 1997, she moved to modify the August 4, 1993 preliminary injunction to require, inter alia, that David deposit his monthly ERISA pension check in a designated bank account and limit his withdrawals from that account to $1,700 per month (which, according to his testimony in the fraudulent conveyance trial, was the amount that he contributed each month to his and his wife's living expenses). Her motion did not mention social security benefits. The district court said that it would allow the motion and requested Jennifer's counsel to file a proposed form of order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the order was issued and before judgment entered in the fraudulent conveyance trial, David filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101 <i>et seq.,</i> which automatically stayed the fraudulent conveyance proceedings. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362. The bankruptcy court ruled on July 2, 1999 that David's MIT pension was not the property of his bankruptcy estate. It also held on October 29, 1999 that David's judgment debt to Jennifer and interest on that debt were nondischargeable. David appealed both rulings. His appeals were dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1999, Jennifer alerted the district court to the bankruptcy court's rulings and renewed her request to modify the August 4, 1993 order. She again did not mention social security benefits in her motion. David opposed the motion. First, he argued that Florida, not Massachusetts, law applied because he was a Florida resident and maintained a Florida residence in addition to his home in Massachusetts. He contended that Fla. Stat. chs. 222.21(2)(a) and 222.14 exempted his ERISA pension benefits from the claims of all creditors. Second, he argued that the order would effectively be an execution of judgment and that under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4.1, a district court sitting in Massachusetts did not have the authority to execute on the assets of a Florida resident. Finally, he argued that the proposed order would violate ERISA's anti-alienation provision, which states that \"[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, 2002, the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the fraudulent conveyance claims, finding that David had fraudulently conveyed over $130,000 in assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Two weeks later, on May 30, 2002, the court inserted the following language into the August 4, 1993 preliminary injunction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

David Hoult shall provide Plaintiff's attorney ... with (i) the name of the bank and the account number of the Account; (ii) a copy of each check or receipt which documents monies or income he receives; and (iii) a copy of the monthly statement of activity (the \"Monthly Statement\") relative to the Account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order made no exception for either David's social security or his ERISA pension benefits. Indeed, social security benefits may have been included without the court being aware that \"all income\" included social security payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David did not appeal the May 30 order. Initially, he simply refused to comply with the order and was held in contempt. After he began to comply on July 3, 2002, the court purged him of that contempt. Then, on July 20, 2002, twenty days after the time for filing an interlocutory appeal from the May 30 order had expired, <i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), David filed a motion with the district court to strike social security and ERISA pension benefits from the order. In that motion, he stated, \"The instant motion is directed only to social security and pension benefits. Defendant recognizes that the [May 30 order] remains effective with respect to all other `monies, income or funds' he receives from any other source.\" As to his ERISA benefits, David reiterated his earlier arguments under Florida law and under ERISA's anti-alienation provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> He also argued that, as written, the order violated the anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act, which provides that \"none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 407(a). This was the first time the issue of social security benefits was argued to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jennifer defended the order as to the ERISA benefits, arguing, inter alia, that ERISA's anti-alienation provision does not prevent alienation of benefits after they have been distributed to beneficiaries and that David's citation to Florida law was inapposite because Massachusetts law, rather than Florida law, applied. As to the social security benefits, Jennifer argued that the order did not violate the Social Security Act's anti-alienation provision because it did not \"attach\" David's social security income but merely required him to deposit it in a designated bank account for monitoring. She said that she \"would not object, however, if concrete proof of the amount of his social security payment is provided, to excluding that amount from the required income deposit and, concomitantly, reducing the monthly amount David may withdraw by that same amount.\" David's social security payment is about $1,400 per month; the May 30 order allowed him to withdraw $2,900 per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on David's motion on August 2, 2002, the district court asked David's counsel whether David had any objection to Jennifer's proposal. He said that David did not. In the end, though, the court decided that it was not necessary to adopt Jennifer's proposal and, instead, simply denied David's motion. The court ruled that the order did not need to be altered as to social security benefits, reasoning that David's disposal of his social security benefits was not restrained in any way because his $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit far exceeded the $1,400 he received in social security benefits. Nor did the order, the court ruled, have to be amended as to the ERISA benefits. The court held that ERISA's anti-alienation provision presented no bar once the funds had been distributed to David. The court further determined that even if Florida law applied, it did not help David because its relevant provisions applied only to honest debtors and David, based on his history of fraudulent conveyances, was not such a debtor. David filed this appeal from the denial of his motion to strike on September 3, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this appeal was pending, David stopped complying with the May 30 order. On May 14, 2003, Jennifer filed a motion to hold David in civil contempt, alleging that David had not produced any of the monthly statements required under the May 30 order since January 2003. A grand jury indicted David on August 27, 2003 for three counts of felony criminal contempt. The indictment alleged that in January 2003 David stopped depositing his income in the designated Massachusetts account and started putting it in a Florida account instead; that David exceeded his $2,900 withdrawal limit virtually every month since November 2002; and that, by March 2003, there was only about $23 left in the Massachusetts account. On January 16, 2004, the district court granted Jennifer's motion for civil contempt and awarded $46,676 in damages. On February 24, 2004, David pleaded guilty to all three counts of felony criminal contempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David does not appeal from the issuance of the May 30, 2002 order but instead from the denial of his motion to strike ERISA and social security benefits from that order. We review the denial of a motion to modify a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <i>See Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v.

First, he argues that the May 30, 2002 order constitutes an improper execution of judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a). Second, he argues that the application of the May 30 order to his ERISA pension benefits violates (1) Florida statutes that he reads as exempting such benefits from creditors' claims, <i>see</i> Fla. Stat. chs. 222.21(2)(a), 222.14; and (2) the anti-alienation provision of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1). Third, he argues that the order's application to his social security benefits violates the anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 407(a). We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Authority to enter the May 30 order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David argues that the May 30 order is effectively an attempt to execute on the judgment and that, on his reading of Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a), a writ of execution is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4.1 requires such writs to be served within the territorial limits of the state in which the district court sits (here, Massachusetts). David claims that he is a Florida resident and that the district court in Massachusetts therefore does not have authority to execute the judgment against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument comes too late. On appeal from the denial of a motion to modify an injunction, \"review does not extend to the propriety of the original order.\" 16 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 3924.2; <i>see also Lichtenberg v. Besicorp Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767726\"><a href=\"/opinion/767726/james-lichtenberg-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span>, 401 (2d Cir.2000). This argument is an attack on the district court's authority to issue the May 30 order (and, indeed, on its power to issue the original August 4, 1993 order), not the court's refusal to strike ERISA and social security benefits from that order. Accordingly, it is beyond the scope of our review. If David wished to make such a challenge, he should have appealed directly from the May 30 order within the thirty-day appeals period. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1) (interlocutory appeals may be taken from preliminary injunctions); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (allowing thirty days from the entry of the order to file an appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. ERISA benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the court's refusal to strike ERISA benefits from the order. We first clear away the issue of whether state law presents any barrier to the May 30 order. The parties dispute whether the order was issued under Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 (post-judgment executions) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 64 (pre-judgment orders). Under either rule, the order must comport with the law of the state in which the district court is held (here, Massachusetts), except that any federal statute governs to the extent applicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David raises a belated argument that the order violates Massachusetts law, which requires that \"amounts held by a trustee for a defendant in a pension shall be reserved in the hands of the trustee and shall be exempt from attachment.\" Mass. Gen. L. ch. 246, &#167; 28 (defining \"pension\" as including all ERISA pensions). This argument has been waived, as it was made for the first time in David's reply brief. <i>Andresen v. Diorio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200750\"><a href=\"/opinion/200750/andresen-v-diorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2003). Moreover, even were it not waived, the argument fails on the merits. Section 28 is not applicable because the order does not affect amounts held in trust for David by a third-party; the order directs David himself to deposit pension funds in the designated bank account after those funds reach his hands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David's primary argument is that the order violates federal law: namely, ERISA's anti-alienation provision, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1056(d)(1). Jennifer responds that &#167; 1056(d)(1) does not restrict alienation of pension benefits that have already been distributed to plan beneficiaries. If Jennifer is correct, the May 30 order does not violate &#167; 1056(d)(1) because the order applies only after the pension benefits are disbursed to David each month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four of the five courts of appeals to consider the question have construed &#167; 1056(d)(1) as applying to benefits only while held by the plan administrator and not after they reach the hands of the beneficiary. <i>Wright v.

We join the majority view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of &#167; 1056(d)(1) is that \"[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\" That language governs only the plan itself. Standing alone, it \"does not read comfortably as a prohibition against creditors reaching pension benefits once they have left the hands of the administrator.\" <i>Robbins,</i> 218 F.3d at 203. If Congress had intended &#167; 1056(d)(1) to reach that far, it could easily have employed the type of language found, for example, in the Veterans Benefits Act, 38 U.S.C. &#167; 5301(a), which prohibits attachment of benefits \"either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\" That Congress chose not to do so is significant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Treasury, who has the authority to implement &#167; 1056(d) of ERISA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> further reinforce our interpretation.

Once benefits are distributed to the beneficiary, a creditor's rights are enforceable against the <i>beneficiary,</i> not against the <i>plan</i> itself; accordingly, under the regulations, &#167; 1056(d)(1) does not apply.

Nothing in ERISA or in the regulations supports a distinction in the anti-alienation provision between pre-retirement lump sum payments and post-retirement annuity payments. And <i>Hisquierdo</i> is not a useful analogy because of differences in language between the anti-alienation provision of the RRA and that of ERISA. The RRA provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other law of the United States, or of any State, territory, or the District of Columbia, no annuity or supplemental annuity shall be assignable or be subject to any tax or to garnishment, attachment, or other legal process <i>under any circumstances whatsoever,</i> nor shall the payment thereof be anticipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">45 U.S.C. &#167; 231m(a) (emphasis added). In concluding that Congress intended &#167; 231m to reach benefits after distribution, the Supreme Court emphasized the fact that the statute was written broadly to prohibit creditors from subjecting the annuity to any \"legal process under any circumstances whatsoever.\" <i>Hisquierdo,</i> 439 U.S. at 586, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109976\"><a href=\"/opinion/109976/hisquierdo-v-hisquierdo/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

She contends that the order imposes no restraint on David's ability to dispose of his monthly social security check because it allows him to withdraw the full amount of the social security check after depositing it in the designated bank account. His social security check is approximately $1,400 per month; he is allowed to withdraw $2,900 per month. The only effect of the order, Jennifer contends, is to track David's income each month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David, citing <i>Robbins,</i> 218 F.3d at 201, responds that the term \"other legal process\" is construed expansively to cover all express or implied threats to resort to legal processes such as contempt. He points out that the order requires him, under threat of contempt, to deposit his benefits in a bank account effectively controlled by the court and to report those deposits to Jennifer. That, he argues, is restraint enough to trigger &#167; 407.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recently provided some guidance on the interpretation of \"other legal process\" in &#167; 407. The Court stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"other legal process\" should be understood to be process much like the processes of execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment, and at a minimum, would seem to require utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, though not necessarily an elaborate one, by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge or secure discharge of an allegedly existing or anticipated liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Wash.

The question whether the May 30 order \"passes control\" over David's social security check to the court is a difficult one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That question, however, is not one that we need to resolve. Both Jennifer and David stated to the district court that they would have no objection to an arrangement that exempted David's social security benefits from the May 30 order, required David to report the amount of his monthly social security benefits, and reduced his $2,900 monthly withdrawal limit by that amount. Jennifer's counsel reiterated this position to us during oral argument. In light of the parties' mutual amenability, we think the best solution is to remand with instructions to adopt that arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We anticipate that David may claim that he should not be required under &#167; 407 even to report the amount of his social security benefits. Any such argument would fail. David has waived the argument and, even had it been preserved, such a reporting requirement would not violate &#167; 407. The arrangement to which David has agreed depends on his accurate reporting of the amount of his benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>vacate</i> the denial of the motion to strike as to social security benefits and <i>remand</i> with instructions to modify the order to exempt social security benefits, to require David Hoult to report the amount of his social security benefits each month, and to reduce the monthly withdrawal limit by that amount.

David's counsel stated in oral argument before us that he has abandoned this argument on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Rule 69(a) provides that \"[p]rocess to enforce a judgment for the payment of money shall be a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise.\" David argues that the exception for situations in which \"the court directs otherwise\" applies only when execution is an inadequate remedy and says that no such showing has been made here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> David argues that Florida law exempts pension money from all claims of creditors and from all legal process, citing Fla. Stat. chs. 222.21(2)(a), 222.14. But under both Rule 64 and Rule 69, the relevant law is that of Massachusetts, not that of Florida</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Congress originally delegated this power to the Secretary of Labor. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1135 (1974).
