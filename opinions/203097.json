This   interlocutory\n\nappeal     comes    before     us    via     Fed.     R.   Civ.     P.   54(b)\n\ncertification.       In the underlying diversity action, movant-\n\nappellee    Newport       Bonding     (appellee       Newport)      issued     a\n\nprejudgment surety bond on behalf of defendant Puerto Ven\n\nQuarry    (defendant       PVQ).      After    defendant      PVQ    declared\n\nbankruptcy, the district court issued an order declaring the\n\nprejudgment bond null.             Plaintiff-appellant Veronica Lee-\n\nBarnes (appellant Lee-Barnes) sought immediate appeal, and\n\nthe district court certified its ruling pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 54(b).           We hold that, in so doing, the district\n\ncourt    abused    its   discretion    and,    accordingly,       vacate     its\n\nRule 54(b) certification.           Further, because we conclude that\n\nthe collateral-order doctrine is inapplicable, we dismiss\n\nthe instant appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n                                      I.\n\n    We recount only those underlying and procedural facts\n\nmaterial to resolving the instant appeal (i.e., those facts\n\nrelated to appellate jurisdiction).                  Appellant Lee-Barnes\n\nsued to recover monies she invested with defendants after\n\nseveral business ventures failed.                   See 28 U.S.C. § 1332.\n\nConcerned that defendants might not be able to satisfy a\n\nfuture judgment entered in her favor, appellant Lee-Barnes\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fsought prejudgment attachment of defendants’ property. 1                         To\n\navoid attachment, defendants proposed, and appellant Lee-\n\nBarnes agreed, that defendant PVQ would obtain a $200,000\n\nsurety   bond.         Accordingly,    defendant     PVQ    posted        a    bond\n\nissued     by    appellee    Newport,       which   the    district           court\n\neventually approved.\n\n    Subsequently,         defendant     PVQ     filed     for     Chapter        11\n\nbankruptcy and moved to stay appellant Lee-Barnes’s lawsuit.\n\nThe district court denied the motion, finding defendant PVQ\n\nentitled    to    an   automatic   stay,      but   not   the     eight       other\n\ndefendants.        Accordingly,       the   district      court    dismissed,\n\nwithout prejudice, all claims against defendant PVQ.                            The\n\ndistrict court also entered a partial judgment, in light of\n\ndefendant PVQ’s bankruptcy proceedings, which provided in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n            This dismissal will not affect in any manner\n\n\n    1\n       Puerto Rico law provides for prejudgment attachment\nor, alternatively, the posting of a surety bond.  See P.R.\nLaws Ann. tit. 32(A), App. III, Rules 56.1, 56.3.      The\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, in turn, provide that:\n\n         At the commencement of and during the course\n    of an action, all remedies providing for seizure of\n    person or property for the purpose of securing\n    satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be\n    entered in the action are available under the\n    circumstances and in the manner provided by the law\n    of the state in which the district court is held,\n    existing at the time the remedy is sought . . . .\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 64.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f    Plaintiff's pending claims against [defendant PVQ].\n    Upon the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings,\n    Plaintiff may file a petition to reinstate the\n    proceedings in this case. Plaintiff's petition for\n    reinstatement shall not be deemed a new filing.\n    Rather, [her] petition will be effective nunc pro\n    tunc to the date of the original filing.    Partial\n    Judgment is hereby entered accordingly.\n\nLee-Barnes    v.    Puerto    Ven    Quarry     Corp.,     No.   03-2358(SEC),\n\n(D.P.R. filed Dec. 23, 2003) (Doc. 72: Partial J.).\n\n    Defendant PVQ later converted its Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nto a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.            The Chapter 7 Trustee (Trustee)\n\nmoved   the   district       court    to     compel    appellee       Newport    to\n\nrespond to several issues related to the bond, as it related\n\nto defendant PVQ’s bankruptcy estate.                  In its court-ordered\n\nresponse, appellee Newport asserted that the dismissal of\n\nappellant Lee-Barnes’s claims against defendant PVQ voided\n\nthe prejudgment bond (i.e., after the principal obligation\n\nthat the bond secured ceased to exist, the bond — which\n\nappellee Newport deems an accessory obligation — likewise\n\nwas invalid).\n\n    The district court agreed and entered an opinion and\n\norder declaring the bond null.                 On appellant Lee-Barnes’s\n\nmotion,   the      district    court       later     entered     an   order     and\n\npartial judgment certifying the earlier opinion and order as\n\nimmediately     appealable          under     Fed.    R.    Civ.      P.     54(b).\n\nAppellant Lee-Barnes appeals, contending that the district\n\ncourt’s   ruling       constituted           reversible      error         because,\n\n                                       -5-\n\fregardless       of    defendant           PVQ’s    bankruptcy        and      dismissal\n\nwithout    prejudice          from    the     case,    the     bond       —    which      she\n\ncontends is a joint and several obligation — remained valid\n\nand enforceable.\n\n                                            II.\n\n      “Because        federal    courts       are    powerless       to       act    in   the\n\nabsence     of     subject       matter           jurisdiction,        we       have       an\n\nunflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects” and\n\nto verify that appellate jurisdiction lies before addressing\n\nthe merits of any appeal.                   See Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto\n\nRico, 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir. 2003).                         Here, appellant\n\nLee-Barnes       asserts        that        appellate     jurisdiction               exists\n\npursuant     to:        (1)     the        district       court’s         Rule        54(b)\n\ncertification; and (2) in any event, the collateral-order\n\ndoctrine.        We disagree.              See ITV Direct, Inc. v. Healthy\n\nSolutions, L.L.C., 445 F.3d 66, 72 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[W]e\n\nreview decisions to grant or deny 54(b) certifications under\n\nan abuse of discretion standard.”); Rhode Island v. U.S.\n\nEnvtl.    Prot.       Agency,        378    F.3d    19,   28    (1st          Cir.    2004)\n\n(collateral-order doctrine only applies to district court\n\norders that meet the doctrine’s stringent requirements).\n\n                                             A.\n\n      This Court employs a “two part process for evaluating\n\nthe   appropriateness           of    certification          under     Rule         54(b).”\n\n                                            -6-\n\fState Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Brockrim, Inc., 87 F.3d\n\n1487, 1489 (1st Cir. 1996).               “First, we determine whether\n\nthe district court action underlying the judgment had the\n\n‘requisite     aspects    of     finality.’”     Id.       (quoting    Darr    v.\n\nMuratore, 8 F.3d 854, 862 (1st Cir. 1993)).                      Rule 54(b)\n\nfinality requires that a judgment “dispose of all the rights\n\nand liabilities of at least one party as to at least one\n\nclaim.”       Id.    (emphasis     added).      This       determination       is\n\n“governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1291.”                Id.     “A final decision\n\nunder § 1291 is one that ‘ends the litigation on the merits\n\nand leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the\n\njudgment.’”         Id. at 1490 (quoting Digital Equip. Corp. v.\n\nDesktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 867 (1994)).                      We review\n\nthe first part of the Rule 54(b) analysis de novo.                      Id. at\n\n1489.\n\n       Here, appellee Newport is not a party to the underlying\n\naction within the meaning of Rule 54(b).                    See id. at 1490\n\nn.1.      Appellee     Newport    never    formally    intervened       in    the\n\nproceeding.     Indeed, in asking the district court to declare\n\nthe bond null, appellee Newport maintained it was simply\n\nmaking    a   “special    appearance.”         In     so    doing,     appellee\n\nNewport submitted that it was neither “submitting itself to\n\nthe [district court’s] jurisdiction” nor “waiving any of its\n\nlegal defenses.”        See Lee-Barnes, No. 03-2358 SEC/GAG (Doc.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f132: Mot. in Compliance with Order).                        Appellee Newport’s\n\nsubsequent        involvement      in   the    underlying       proceeding      was\n\nstrictly limited to the viability of the bond it issued on\n\ndefendant PVQ’s behalf.\n\n     Nor did the district court’s order dispose of a claim\n\nin   the   Rule     54(b)    sense.        Rule      54(b)    expressly      limits\n\ncertification under its provision to, inter alia, instances\n\nin which “more than one claim for relief is presented in an\n\naction.”      See     Fed.    R.    Civ.      P.    54(b)    (emphasis    added).\n\nRather     than    resolving    a   cause      of    action    set   forth    in   a\n\npleading, the district court’s order exclusively pertained\n\nto the validity of the bond.                  Because the district court’s\n\norder fails to meet either Rule 54(b)’s “party” or “claim”\n\nrequirement, our analysis need not go further.                       Put simply,\n\nthe Rule 54(b) certification issued in this case constituted\n\nan abuse of discretion. 2               See State Street Bank & Trust,\n\n\n     2\n       Because the district court’s order does not espouse\nthe requisite “aspects of finality,” “we need not proceed to\nthe second step of jurisdictional analysis under Rule\n54(b).”    See id. at 1490.    We note, however, that the\ndistrict court’s order fails to satisfy those strictures as\nwell.\n     At step two of the Rule 54(b) analysis, “we review the\nsufficiency of the district court’s assessments of 1) any\ninterrelationship or overlap among the various legal and\nfactual issues involved and 2) any equities and efficiencies\nimplicated by the requested piecemeal review.”             Id.\nAppellant Lee-Barnes has not demonstrated that she will\nincur any material harm if interlocutory review is denied.\n                                                  (continued...)\n\n                                        -8-\n\fCo., 445 F.3d at 1489 (“The [d]istrict [c]ourt cannot, in\n\nthe exercise of its discretion, treat as ‘final’ that which\n\nis not ‘final’ within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291.”).\n\n                                    B.\n\n     Whether the instant appeal falls within the collateral-\n\norder    doctrine   presents   a    closer   question.     “Generally\n\nspeaking, appeals are permitted only from final judgments of\n\nthe district court.”      Asociación de Subscripción Conjunta\n\ndel Seguro de Responsibilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza,\n\n484 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1291).\n\nAs the Supreme Court recently explained, however, our 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291 authority extends “appellate jurisdiction over\n\na narrow class of decisions” that – although they do not end\n\nthe underlying proceeding – fall within the collateral-order\n\ndoctrine.    Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 347 (2006).\n\n     “The collateral order doctrine, identified with Cohen\n\n[v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949)] . . .\n\nis   best   understood   not   as    an   exception   to   the   ‘final\n\ndecision’ rule laid down by Congress in § 1291, but as a\n\n\n     2\n     (...continued)\nTo the contrary, we can assess the district court’s order\nnullifying the bond equally well if and when final judgment\nis entered in appellant Lee-Barnes’s favor. See Spiegel v.\nTrs. of Tufts College, 843 F.2d 38, 45 (1st Cir. 1988)\n(noting that the possibility that the need for an appeal\nmight become moot is considered “a major negative in the\nRule 54(b) equation”).\n\n                                   -9-\n\fpractical construction of it.”                         Will, 546 U.S. at 349.          For\n\nthe     collateral-order                doctrine   to    apply,   a    district     court\n\norder           must:      “[1]       conclusively       determine      the     disputed\n\nquestion, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate\n\nfrom        the      merits      of     the   action,     and   [3]    be   effectively\n\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” 3                              Id.   These\n\nconjunctive “conditions are stringent . . . and unless they\n\nare     kept         so,   the    underlying       doctrine     will    overpower      the\n\nsubstantial finality interests § 1291 is meant to further\n\n.   .       .   .”      Id.;      see    also   Gulfstream      Aerospace      Corp.    v.\n\nMayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 276 (1988) (“If the order at\n\nissue fails to satisfy any one of [Cohen’s] requirements, it\n\nis not appealable under the collateral-order [doctrine].”).\n\nNotably, “[t]he doctrine is applied narrowly and interpreted\n\nstrictly.”             United States v. Quintana-Aguayo, 235 F.3d 682,\n\n684 (1st Cir. 2000).                    As the Supreme Court recently stated\n\nin Will v. Hallock:\n\n        [W]e have not mentioned applying the collateral\n        order doctrine recently without emphasizing its\n        modest scope. And we have meant what we have said;\n        although the Court has been asked many times to\n        expand the ‘small class’ of collaterally appealable\n        orders, we have instead kept it narrow and\n\n        3\n        Compare Will, 546 U.S. at 349 (delineating three\nrequirements an order must meet to fall within Cohen), with\nEspinal-Dominguez, 352 F.3d at 497 (adding, as a fourth\nrequirement, that the order involve an “important and\nunsettled question of controlling law, not merely a question\nof the proper exercise of the trial court's discretion”).\n\n                                                -10-\n\f       selective in its membership.\n\nWill, 546 U.S. at 349 (emphasis added).\n\n       Turning to the doctrine’s “important issue” requirement,\n\n“[t]he Supreme Court has explained that ‘important’ in the\n\nCohen collateral order doctrine sense means ‘being weightier\n\nthan     the   societal      interests     advanced     by   the    ordinary\n\noperation      of    final    judgment      principles.’”          Gill     v.\n\nGulfstream Park Racing Assoc., Inc., 399 F.3d 391, 399 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting Digital Equip.

Chasser, 490 U.S. 495, 502\n\n(1989)    (Scalia,     J.,   concurring)       (“The   importance    of    the\n\nright asserted has always been a significant part of our\n\ncollateral order doctrine.”).              In the instant matter, the\n\nissue on appeal — i.e., whether the district court erred in\n\ndeeming the surety bond         void — simply does not “rise to the\n\nlevel    of    importance     needed     for    recognition    under      [the\n\ncollateral-order doctrine].”             See Digital Equip. Corp., 511\n\nU.S. at 878.\n\n       The issue presented in this case is highly unlikely to\n\naffect, or even be consequential to, anyone aside from the\n\nparties.       This makes our situation readily distinguishable\n\nfrom Cohen.         Unlike the ruling at bar, the Cohen district\n\ncourt order — which the Supreme Court held to be immediately\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fappealable — refused to apply a newly enacted state statute,\n\nwhich     entitled        any    defendant          corporation,          in     certain\n\nshareholder         derivative      actions,         to    require        complainant\n\nshareholders to post security.                   See Cohen, 337 U.S. at 545-\n\n46 & n.1.       Nor can the issue presented for immediate appeal\n\nhere be considered “weightier than the societal interests\n\nadvanced       by   the     ordinary       operation        of     final        judgment\n\nprinciples.”        See Digital Equip. Corp., 511 U.S. at 879.\n\n      As to the collateral-order doctrine’s third requirement,\n\nthe    First    Circuit         equates     this        factor    –    “perhaps        the\n\n[doctrine’s]         most        elemental”         –     with        “urgency”         or\n\n“irreparable harm.”             Espinal-Dominguez, 352 F.3d at 496-97.\n\nHere,    appellant        Lee-Barnes        has     not    made       the      requisite\n\n“showing of irreparable harm” (i.e., that “the postponement\n\nof    appellate      review”      will     effectively           render     the    issue\n\nunreviewable).          Rhode Island, 378 F.3d at 28.\n\n      Obtaining a final judgment against defendant PVQ is a\n\nprerequisite to appellant Lee-Barnes collecting on the bond.\n\nIn other words, even if we reversed the district court’s\n\norder declaring the bond null at this juncture, appellant\n\nLee-Barnes      could     not    collect       on   the    bond    until       entry    of\n\nfinal   judgment,         regardless      of     defendant       PVQ’s      bankruptcy\n\nstatus.        Hence,     if    appellant        Lee-Barnes       prevails        in   the\n\nunderlying proceeding she will “have ample opportunity to\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\ftest the propriety” of the district court’s ruling declaring\n\nthe   bond   null.     See     Espinal-Dominguez,               352   F.3d      at     497.\n\nThus,    because     appellant        Lee-Barnes’s            interest     is     “fully\n\nvindicable on appeal from final judgment,” it does not meet\n\nthe “urgency” requirement proscribed by the collateral-order\n\ndoctrine.       Cf. Swift & Co. Packers v. Compania Colombiana\n\ndel   Caribe,      S.A.,     339      U.S.       684,    688-89       (1950)      (order\n\nvacating     attachment        on         foreign        vessel       in   admiralty\n\nproceeding was immediately appealable because it could not\n\nbe effectively reviewed after entry of final judgement).\n\n      Hence, the district court’s order does not comport with\n\neither    the    collateral-order              doctrine’s       second       or      third\n\nrequirements.

In the underlying diversity action, movant-appellee Newport Bonding (appellee Newport) issued a prejudgment surety bond on behalf of defendant Puerto Ven Quarry (defendant PVQ). After defendant PVQ declared bankruptcy, the district court issued an order declaring the prejudgment bond null. Plaintiff-appellant Veronica Lee-Barnes (appellant Lee-Barnes) sought immediate appeal, and the district court certified its ruling pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b). We hold that, in so doing, the district court abused its discretion and, accordingly, vacate its Rule 54(b) certification. Further, because we conclude that the collateral-order doctrine is inapplicable, we dismiss the instant appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recount only those underlying and procedural facts material to resolving the instant appeal (<i>i.e.,</i> those facts related to appellate jurisdiction). Appellant Lee-Barnes sued to recover monies she invested with defendants after several business ventures failed. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Concerned that defendants might not be able to satisfy a future judgment entered in her favor, appellant Lee-Barnes sought prejudgment attachment of defendants' property.<sup>[1]</sup> To avoid attachment, defendants proposed, and appellant Lee-Barnes agreed, that defendant PVQ would obtain a $200,000 surety bond. Accordingly, defendant PVQ posted a bond issued by appellee Newport, which the district court eventually approved.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, defendant PVQ filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and moved to stay appellant Lee-Barnes's lawsuit. The district court denied the motion, finding defendant PVQ entitled to an automatic stay, but not the eight other defendants. Accordingly, the district court dismissed, without prejudice, all claims against defendant PVQ. The district court also entered a partial judgment, in light of defendant PVQ's bankruptcy proceedings, which provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>This dismissal will not affect in any manner Plaintiff's pending claims against [defendant PVQ]. Upon the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings, Plaintiff may file a petition to reinstate the proceedings in this case. Plaintiffs petition for reinstatement shall not be deemed a new filing. Rather, [her] petition will be effective nunc pro tunc to the date of the original filing. Partial Judgment is hereby entered accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Lee-Barnes v. Puerto Ven Quarry Corp.,</i> No. 03-2358(SEC), (D.P.R. filed Dec. 23, 2003) (Doc. 72: Partial J.).</p>\n<p>Defendant PVQ later converted its Chapter 11 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The Chapter 7 Trustee (Trustee) moved the district court to compel appellee Newport to respond to several <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> issues related to the bond, as it related to defendant PVQ's bankruptcy estate. In its court-ordered response, appellee Newport asserted that the dismissal of appellant Lee-Barnes's claims against defendant PVQ voided the prejudgment bond (<i>i.e.,</i> after the principal obligation that the bond secured ceased to exist, the bond-which appellee Newport deems an accessory obligation-likewise was invalid).</p>\n<p>The district court agreed and entered an opinion and order declaring the bond null. On appellant Lee-Barnes's motion, the district court later entered an order and partial judgment certifying the earlier opinion and order as immediately appealable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Appellant Lee-Barnes appeals, contending that the district court's ruling constituted reversible error because, regardless of defendant PVQ's bankruptcy and dismissal without prejudice from the case, the bondwhich she contends is a joint and several obligation remained valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"Because federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, we have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects\" and to verify that appellate jurisdiction lies before addressing the merits of any appeal. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir.2003). Here, appellant Lee-Barnes asserts that appellate jurisdiction exists pursuant to: (1) the district court's Rule 54(b) certification; and (2) in any event, the collateral-order doctrine. We disagree. <i>See </i><i>ITV Direct, Inc. v. Healthy Solutions, L.L.C.,</i> 445 F.3d 66, 72 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[W]e review decisions to grant or deny 54(b) certifications under an abuse of discretion standard.\"); <i>Rhode Island v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency,</i> 378 F.3d 19, 28 (1st Cir.2004) (collateral-order doctrine only applies to district court orders that meet the doctrine's stringent requirements).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>This Court employs a \"two part process for evaluating the appropriateness of certification under Rule 54(b).\" <i>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Brockrim, Inc.,</i> 87 F.3d 1487, 1489 (1st Cir.1996). \"First, we determine whether the district court action underlying the judgment had the `requisite aspects of finality.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Darr v. Muratore,</i> 8 F.3d 854, 862 (1st Cir.1993)). Rule 54(b) finality requires that a judgment \"dispose of all the rights and liabilities of at least one <i>party</i> as to at least one <i>claim.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). This determination is \"governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\" <i>Id.</i> \"A final decision under § 1291 is one that `ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 1490 (quoting <i>Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc.,</i> 511 U.S. 863, 867, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994)). We review the first part of the Rule 54(b) analysis de novo. <i>Id.</i> at 1489.</p>\n<p>Here, appellee Newport is not a <i>party</i> to the underlying action within the meaning of Rule 54(b). <i>See id.</i> at 1490 n. 1. Appellee Newport never formally intervened in the proceeding. Indeed, in asking the district court to declare the bond null, appellee Newport maintained it was simply making a \"special appearance.\" In so doing, appellee Newport submitted that it was neither \"submitting itself to the [district court's] jurisdiction\" nor \"waiving any of its legal defenses.\" <i>See Lee-Barnes,</i> No. 03-2358 SEC/GAG (Doc. 132: Mot. in Compliance with Order). Appellee Newport's subsequent involvement in the underlying proceeding was, strictly limited to the viability of the bond it issued on defendant PVQ's behalf.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> Nor did the district court's order dispose of a <i>claim</i> in the Rule 54(b) sense. Rule 54(b) expressly limits certification under its provision to, <i>inter alia,</i> instances in which \"more than one <i>claim for relief</i> is presented in an action.\" <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (emphasis added). Rather than resolving a cause of action set forth in a pleading, the district court's order exclusively pertained to the validity of the bond. Because the district court's order fails to meet either Rule 54(b)'s \"party\" or \"claim\" requirement, our analysis need not go further. Put simply, the Rule 54(b) certification issued in this case constituted an abuse of discretion.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>State Street Bank &amp; Trust, Co.,</i> 87 F.3d at 1489 (\"The [d]istrict [c]ourt <i>cannot,</i> in the exercise of its discretion, treat as `final' that which is not `final' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Whether the instant appeal falls within the collateral-order doctrine presents a closer question. \"Generally speaking, appeals are permitted only from final judgments of the district court.\" <i>Asociación de Subscription Conjunta del Seguro de Responsibilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2007) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1291). As the Supreme Court recently explained, however, our 28 U.S.C. § 1291 authority extends \"appellate jurisdiction over a narrow class of decisions\" that-although they do not end the underlying proceeding-fall within the collateral-order doctrine. <i>Will v. Hallock,</i> 546 U.S. 345, 347, 126 S.Ct. 952, 163 L.Ed.2d 836 (2006).</p>\n<p>\"The collateral order doctrine, identified with <i>Cohen [v. Beneficial Indus. Loan. Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949)] . . . is best understood not as an exception to the `final decision' rule laid down by Congress in § 1291, but as a practical construction of it.\" <i>Will,</i> 546 U.S. at 349, 126 S.Ct. 952. For the collateral-order doctrine to apply, a district court order must: \"[1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\"<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.</i> These conjunctive \"conditions are stringent . . . and unless they are kept so, the underlying doctrine will overpower the substantial finality interests § 1291 is meant to further. . . .\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp.,</i> 485 U.S. 271, 276, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988) (\"If the order at issue fails to satisfy any one of [<i>Cohen</i>'s] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> requirements, it is not appealable under the collateral-order [doctrine].\"). Notably, \"[t]he doctrine is applied narrowly and interpreted strictly.\" <i>United States v. Quintana-Aguayo,</i> 235 F.3d 682, 684 (1st Cir.2000). As the Supreme Court recently stated in <i>Will v. Hallock</i><i>:</i></p>\n<blockquote>[W]e have not mentioned applying the collateral order doctrine recently without emphasizing its modest scope. And we have meant what we have said; although the Court has been asked many times to expand the `small class' of collaterally appealable orders, we have instead <i>kept it narrow and selective</i> in its membership.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Will,</i> 546 U.S. at 349, 126 S.Ct. 952 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Turning to the doctrine's \"important issue\" requirement, \"[t]he Supreme Court has explained that `important' in the <i>Cohen</i> collateral order doctrine sense means `being weightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles.'\" <i>Gill v. Gulfstream Park Racing Assoc., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 391, 399 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 511 U.S. at 879, 114 S.Ct. 1992); <i>see also Lauro Lines s.r.l.v. Chasser,</i> 490 U.S. 495, 502, 109 S.Ct. 1976, 104 L.Ed.2d 548 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"The importance of the right asserted has always been a significant part of our collateral order doctrine.\"). In the instant matter, the issue on appeal<i>i.e.,</i> whether the district court erred in deeming the surety bond voidsimply does not \"rise to the level of importance needed for recognition under [the collateral-order doctrine].\" <i>See </i><i>Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 511 U.S. at 878, 114 S.Ct. 1992.</p>\n<p>The issue presented in this case is highly unlikely to affect, or even be consequential to, anyone aside from the parties. This makes our situation readily distinguishable from <i>Cohen.</i> Unlike the ruling at bar, the <i>Cohen</i> district court order which the Supreme Court held to be immediately appealablerefused to apply a newly enacted state <i>statute,</i> which <i>entitled any defendant corporation,</i> in certain shareholder derivative actions, to require complainant shareholders to post security. <i>See </i><i>Cohen,</i> 337 U.S. at 545-46 &amp; n. 1, 69 S.Ct. 1221. Nor can the issue presented for immediate appeal here be considered \"weightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles.\" <i>See </i><i>Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 511 U.S. at 879, 114 S.Ct. 1992.</p>\n<p>As to the collateral-order doctrine's third requirement, the First Circuit equates this factor\"perhaps the [doctrine's] most elemental\"with \"urgency\" or \"irreparable harm.\" <i>Espinal-Dominguez,</i> 352 F.3d at 496-97. Here, appellant Lee-Barnes has not made the requisite \"showing of irreparable harm\" (<i>i.e.,</i> that \"the postponement of appellate review\" will effectively render the issue unreviewable). <i>Rhode Island,</i> 378 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p>Obtaining a final judgment against defendant PVQ is a prerequisite to appellant Lee-Barnes collecting on the bond. In other words, even if we reversed the district court's order declaring the bond null at this juncture, appellant Lee-Barnes could not collect on the bond until entry of final judgment, regardless of defendant PVQ's bankruptcy status. Hence, if appellant Lee-Barnes prevails in the underlying proceeding she will \"have ample opportunity to test the propriety\" of the district court's ruling declaring the bond null. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez,</i> 352 F.3d at 497. Thus, because appellant Lee-Barnes's interest is \"fully vindicable on appeal from final judgment,\" it does not meet the \"urgency\" requirement proscribed by the collateral-order doctrine. <i>Cf. </i><i>Swift &amp; Co. Packers v. Compania Colombiana del Caribe, S.A.,</i> 339 U.S. 684, 688-89, 70 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> 861, 94 L.Ed. 1206 (1950) (order vacating attachment on <i>foreign vessel</i> in admiralty proceeding was immediately appealable because it <i>could not be effectively reviewed</i> after entry of final judgement).</p>\n<p>Hence, the district court's order does not comport with either the collateral-order doctrine's second or third requirements. The district court's order, quite simply: (1) does not present a sufficiently important issue to warrant immediate review; and (2) is \"effectively reviewable on appeal from final judgment.\" As such, the collateral-order doctrine does not apply. <i>See </i><i>Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard,</i> 486 U.S. 517, 524, 108 S.Ct. 1945, 100 L.Ed.2d 517 (1988); <i>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.,</i> 485 U.S. at 276, 108 S.Ct. 1133; <i>see generally </i><i>Quintana-Aguayo,</i> 235 F.3d at 684 (collateral-order doctrine only permits immediate appeal \"in limited circumstances when the important goal of the final judgment rulethe effective, efficient administration of justiceis not undermined or is counterbalanced by other weighty goals\"). Lacking any basis for appellate jurisdiction, we must dismiss the instant interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>vacate</i> the district court's underlying Rule 54(b) certification and <i>dismiss</i> the instant appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Puerto Rico law provides for prejudgment attachment or, alternatively, the posting of a surety bond. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32(A), App. III, Rules 56.1, 56.3. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in turn, provide that:\n</p>\n<p>At the commencement of and during the course of an action, all remedies providing for seizure of person or property for the purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be entered in the action are available under the circumstances and in the manner provided by the law, of the state in which the district court is held, existing at the time the remedy is sought. . . .</p>\n<p>Fed.R.Civ.P. 64.</p>\n<p>[2]  Because the district court's order does not espouse the requisite \"aspects of finality,\" \"we need not proceed to the second step of jurisdictional analysis under Rule 54(b).\" <i>See id.</i> at 1490. We note, however, that the district court's order fails to satisfy those strictures as well.\n</p>\n<p>At step two of the Rule 54(b) analysis, \"we review the sufficiency of the district court's assessments of 1) any interrelationship or overlap among the various legal and factual issues involved and 2) any equities and efficiencies implicated by the requested piecemeal review.\" <i>Id.</i> Appellant Lee-Barnes has not demonstrated that she will incur any material harm if interlocutory review is denied. To the contrary, we can assess the district court's order nullifying the bond equally well <i>if</i> and <i>when final</i> judgment is entered in appellant Lee-Barnes's favor. <i>See </i><i>Spiegel v. Trs. of Tufts College,</i> 843 F.2d 38, 45 (1st Cir.1988) (noting that the possibility that the need for an appeal might become moot is considered \"a major negative in the Rule 54(b) equation\").</p>\n<p>[3]  <i>Compare </i><i>Will,</i> 546 U.S. at 349, 126 S.Ct. 952 (delineating <i>three</i> requirements an order must meet to fall within <i>Cohen</i>), <i>with </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez,</i> 352 F.3d at 497 (adding, as a <i>fourth</i> requirement, that the order involve an \"important and unsettled question of controlling law, not merely a question of the proper exercise of the trial court's discretion\").</p>\n\n</div>",

The district court also entered a partial judgment, in light of defendant PVQ's bankruptcy proceedings, which provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>This dismissal will not affect in any manner Plaintiff's pending claims against [defendant PVQ]. Upon the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings, Plaintiff may file a petition to reinstate the proceedings in this case. Plaintiffs petition for reinstatement shall not be deemed a new filing. Rather, [her] petition will be effective nunc pro tunc to the date of the original filing. Partial Judgment is hereby entered accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Lee-Barnes v. Puerto Ven Quarry Corp.,</i> No. 03-2358(SEC), (D.P.R. filed Dec. 23, 2003) (Doc. 72: Partial J.).</p>\n<p>Defendant PVQ later converted its Chapter 11 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The Chapter 7 Trustee (Trustee) moved the district court to compel appellee Newport to respond to several <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> issues related to the bond, as it related to defendant PVQ's bankruptcy estate. In its court-ordered response, appellee Newport asserted that the dismissal of appellant Lee-Barnes's claims against defendant PVQ voided the prejudgment bond (<i>i.e.,</i> after the principal obligation that the bond secured ceased to exist, the bond-which appellee Newport deems an accessory obligation-likewise was invalid).</p>\n<p>The district court agreed and entered an opinion and order declaring the bond null. On appellant Lee-Barnes's motion, the district court later entered an order and partial judgment certifying the earlier opinion and order as immediately appealable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Appellant Lee-Barnes appeals, contending that the district court's ruling constituted reversible error because, regardless of defendant PVQ's bankruptcy and dismissal without prejudice from the case, the bondwhich she contends is a joint and several obligation remained valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"Because federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, we have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects\" and to verify that appellate jurisdiction lies before addressing the merits of any appeal. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez v.

We review the first part of the Rule 54(b) analysis de novo. <i>Id.</i> at 1489.</p>\n<p>Here, appellee Newport is not a <i>party</i> to the underlying action within the meaning of Rule 54(b). <i>See id.</i> at 1490 n. 1. Appellee Newport never formally intervened in the proceeding. Indeed, in asking the district court to declare the bond null, appellee Newport maintained it was simply making a \"special appearance.\" In so doing, appellee Newport submitted that it was neither \"submitting itself to the [district court's] jurisdiction\" nor \"waiving any of its legal defenses.\" <i>See Lee-Barnes,</i> No. 03-2358 SEC/GAG (Doc. 132: Mot. in Compliance with Order). Appellee Newport's subsequent involvement in the underlying proceeding was, strictly limited to the viability of the bond it issued on defendant PVQ's behalf.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> Nor did the district court's order dispose of a <i>claim</i> in the Rule 54(b) sense. Rule 54(b) expressly limits certification under its provision to, <i>inter alia,</i> instances in which \"more than one <i>claim for relief</i> is presented in an action.\" <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (emphasis added). Rather than resolving a cause of action set forth in a pleading, the district court's order exclusively pertained to the validity of the bond. Because the district court's order fails to meet either Rule 54(b)'s \"party\" or \"claim\" requirement, our analysis need not go further. Put simply, the Rule 54(b) certification issued in this case constituted an abuse of discretion.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>State Street Bank &amp; Trust, Co.,</i> 87 F.3d at 1489 (\"The [d]istrict [c]ourt <i>cannot,</i> in the exercise of its discretion, treat as `final' that which is not `final' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Whether the instant appeal falls within the collateral-order doctrine presents a closer question. \"Generally speaking, appeals are permitted only from final judgments of the district court.\" <i>Asociación de Subscription Conjunta del Seguro de Responsibilidad Obligatorio v.

Here, appellant Lee-Barnes has not made the requisite \"showing of irreparable harm\" (<i>i.e.,</i> that \"the postponement of appellate review\" will effectively render the issue unreviewable). <i>Rhode Island,</i> 378 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p>Obtaining a final judgment against defendant PVQ is a prerequisite to appellant Lee-Barnes collecting on the bond. In other words, even if we reversed the district court's order declaring the bond null at this juncture, appellant Lee-Barnes could not collect on the bond until entry of final judgment, regardless of defendant PVQ's bankruptcy status. Hence, if appellant Lee-Barnes prevails in the underlying proceeding she will \"have ample opportunity to test the propriety\" of the district court's ruling declaring the bond null. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez,</i> 352 F.3d at 497. Thus, because appellant Lee-Barnes's interest is \"fully vindicable on appeal from final judgment,\" it does not meet the \"urgency\" requirement proscribed by the collateral-order doctrine. <i>Cf. </i><i>Swift &amp; Co.

The district court's order, quite simply: (1) does not present a sufficiently important issue to warrant immediate review; and (2) is \"effectively reviewable on appeal from final judgment.\" As such, the collateral-order doctrine does not apply. <i>See </i><i>Van Cauwenberghe v.
