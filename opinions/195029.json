Defendant John Bichao appeals contending that\n\n(1) bias on the part of the trial  judge denied him a fair trial;\n\n(2) evidence regarding a prior disciplinary action against one of\n\nthe witnesses was  incorrectly admitted; and (3)  attorneys' fees\n\nwere  erroneously granted to plaintiffs' attorneys.  We affirm on\n\nall grounds.\n\n                                I.\n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          Walter  Deary  and  his  brother  Robert  brought  suit\n\nagainst  six Gloucester police officers,  the Mayor, the Chief of\n\nPolice, and  the City of  Gloucester, based on an  incident which\n\noccurred  on  March 29,  1986.1    The  Dearys alleged  that  the\n\ndefendant police officers physically  assaulted them and  engaged\n\nin  a cover-up  regarding the  incident.   After  the plaintiffs'\n\ncase,  the  court  directed  verdicts  for  each  of  the  police\n\nofficers, except  Officer Bichao.2   The main  issue in  the case\n\nwas an allegation  that Officer Bichao kicked  Walter Deary twice\n\nin  the  head.    The   jury  awarded  Walter  Deary  $25,000  in\n\n                    \n\n     1The claims  against the city,  the Mayor, and the  Chief of\nPolice  were  bifurcated  from   those  against  the   individual\nofficers.\n\n     2Plaintiffs  filed a cross-appeal  requesting that if  a new\ntrial were granted  to Defendant Bichao,  then this court  should\nalso  reverse the directed verdicts granted to defendants Earland\nWhortley,  David  Reardon, Howard  Maki,  John  Beaudette, Harold\nReardon, and James Hubbard, the other Gloucester police officers.\nBecause  we affirm,  we  do  not  reach  plaintiffs'  alternative\nrequest.\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\ncompensatory damages and  $75,000 in punitive damages,  and found\n\nfor Bichao  on the  claims brought  by Robert  Deary.   The court\n\ngranted $112,295 in attorneys' fees and $8,977.50 in costs to the\n\nplaintiffs' attorneys under 42 U.S.C.   1988.\n\n                               II.\n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\nA.  Allegations of Bias of Trial Judge\n                                      \n\n          Officer  Bichao requests a new trial, alleging that the\n\ntrial judge  was so biased  towards the plaintiffs as  to deprive\n\nthe defendant of  a fair trial.  Bichao  lists numerous incidents\n\nduring the trial which he contends were indicative of the bias of\n\nthe judge.   These events may be  divided into three types:   (1)\n\nclaims that the  judge made comments indicating  that defendant's\n\ncounsel was  proceeding too slowly;  (2) claims that  the judge's\n\nquestioning  of witnesses reflected  bias and partiality  for the\n\nplaintiffs;   (3)   allegations    regarding   disputes   between\n\ndefendant's counsel and the judge,  which Bichao claims created a\n\nprejudicial effect against the defendant.  \n\n          Bias  and improper  conduct  by a  trial  judge may  be\n\ngrounds for a  new trial if a party is so seriously prejudiced as\n\nto be deprived  of a  fair trial.   Aggarwal v.  Ponce School  of\n                                                                 \n\nMedicine,  837 F.2d  17, 21-22  (1st Cir.  1988).   However, mere\n        \n\nactive participation by the  judge does not create prejudice  nor\n\ndeprive  the party  of a  fair trial.   Id.   On appeal,  we must\n                                           \n\n\"consider isolated incidents in light of the entire transcript so\n\nas to 'guard  against magnification on appeal  of instances which\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nwere of  little importance  in their setting'.\"   Aggarwal  at 22\n                                                          \n\n(quoting Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60 (1984)).\n                                 \n\n          Bichao cites  several instances during the  trial where\n\nJudge  Tauro encouraged defense  counsel to  advance the  pace of\n\nquestioning, or  was  unsatisfied with  counsel's utilization  of\n\ntime.   The trial  judge has discretion  to maintain the  pace of\n\ntrial,  and indeed \"has the responsibility to oversee the conduct\n\nof  a trial so  that it moves expeditiously\".   Desjardins v. Van\n                                                                 \n\nBuren  Community Hosp.,  969  F.2d  1280,  1281 (1st  Cir.  1992)\n                      \n\n(noting that requests by the judge that counsel not be repetitive\n\nare  \"routine\").  Therefore, encouraging counsel to move forward,\n\nforbidding  counsel  from  eliciting  duplicative  testimony,  or\n\nhalting  what the  court perceived  to be  a waste  of time,  was\n\nfirmly within the discretion of the trial judge.\n\n          Next,  Bichao alleges  that the  trial  judge exhibited\n\nbias  towards the  plaintiffs  by  interjecting questions  during\n\ndefense  counsel's   direct  and  cross-examination   of  several\n\nwitnesses,  including  Bichao   himself.    The  court   has  the\n\nprerogative to interrogate witnesses, and the duty to do so where\n\nnecessary to  clarify testimony, but  the judge must  maintain an\n\nair of impartiality.   United States v. Paz Uribe,  891 F.2d 396,\n                                                 \n\n400  (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied,  495 U.S. 951 (1990).  \"Trial\n                                  \n\njudges are  constantly making judgments  about . . . the  need to\n\nclarify witness answers, and similar matters of trial management.\n\nIn this realm, the widest possible latitude is given to the judge\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\non the scene.\"   Rodr guez v. Banco  Cent. Corp., 990 F.2d  7, 13\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Bichao  argues  that  the judge's  questioning  of  the\n\nplaintiff's  medical   expert,  Dr.  Starr,   undermined  defense\n\ncounsel's credibility, and reflected bias by the judge.  A review\n\nof the transcript reveals  that the judge's questions  were meant\n\nto   clarify  the  testimony  of  the  witness.    During  cross-\n\nexamination, Dr. Starr had discussed  a number of documents which\n\nthe jury  did not have  in front of them.   The court  asked some\n\nquestions  in order  to elucidate  which  document the  questions\n\nreferred  to,  and  which  section  of  the  report  counsel  was\n\ndiscussing.  These  questions were clearly within  the discretion\n\nof the trial court.  \n\n          Bichao  also contends that the court was overzealous in\n\nits  questioning of  Officers Maki  and  Beaudette during  direct\n\nexamination, and as a result destroyed the credibility of the two\n\nwitnesses.   Officer  Maki  was  the person  who  was closest  in\n\nphysical proximity  to Walter  Deary  when the  alleged kicks  by\n\nBichao were administered.   The judge questioned him  in order to\n\nclarify Maki's statement about his lack of memory of the kicking.\n\nThis issue  was central  to the  case, and  the judge  was acting\n\nwithin his discretion to ensure that Maki's  testimony was clear.\n\nSimilarly,  the  court's  questioning of  Officer  Beaudette  was\n\nunbiased and aimed at illuminating his testimony.\n\n          Bichao  claims that when he was being cross-examined by\n\nplaintiff's counsel,  the judge  made uncivil  remarks and  asked\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nhostile questions of him.   A close examination of the transcript\n\nreveals that  the judge  occasionally instructed  the witness  to\n\nanswer  the  questions which  were  presented to  him,  and asked\n\nquestions  to elucidate Bichao's testimony.  These directions and\n\nquestions did  not rise  to the level  of partiality,  but rather\n\nwere made with the purpose  of obtaining answers to the questions\n\nposed and clarifying the answers given.     \n\n          Finally,  Bichao identifies  several  exchanges in  the\n\ntranscript which he claims reflect a certain amount of  animosity\n\nbetween the judge  and defense counsel.  Some  of these incidents\n\noccurred outside of the hearing of the jury, where they could not\n\nhave influenced the  jury decision.  However, Bichao  points to a\n\nsidebar  conference during which  the judge stated  that he found\n\ndefense counsel's cross-examination  of the medical expert  to be\n\n\"very devious\".   At the time, the  judge asked the  jury whether\n\nthey could hear the sidebar  conference and one juror stated that\n\nhe was able to hear  \"a little bit\".  This episode,  taken in the\n\ncontext  of  a   nine-day  trial,  does  not   warrant  appellate\n\nintervention.   When  the judge  questioned the  jury about  this\n\nincident, only one of the eight members stated that he could hear\n\na  little bit  of  the conference.   It  is  unclear whether  the\n\n\"devious\" comment itself  was overheard by that one  juror.  Even\n\nassuming that the one juror did hear the statement, we find that,\n\nviewing  the  trial  transcript  as  a   whole,  the  comment  is\n\ninsufficient  to sustain  a finding of  bias on  the part  of the\n\ntrial judge, or prejudicial impact on the trial.       T r i a l\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\njudges  need to maintain strict control over judicial proceedings\n\nand as  a result it would  be unrealistic to suggest  that trials\n\nshould always be models of harmony.  Although any display  by the\n\ntrial  judge  of unwarranted  irritation or  displeasure directed\n\ntowards counsel ought to  be avoided, friction between the  court\n\nand  counsel  does not  constitute  pervasive bias.    See Arthur\n                                                                 \n\nPierson &amp; Co. v. Provimi Veal Corp., 887 F.2d 837, 839  (7th Cir.\n                                   \n\n1989);  Hamm v. Board  of Regents, 708  F.2d 647,  650 (11th Cir.\n                                 \n\n1983).\n\n          Bichao contends that the judge  failed to give the jury\n\ngeneral  or specific curative instructions regarding any of these\n\nincidents.  But defendant failed to request any specific curative\n\ninstructions  during the course  of the trial.   Furthermore, the\n\njury charge instructed the jurors that they were the \"sole judges\n\nof the weight  and effect of  all of the  evidence\" and that  the\n\nevidence in the case  did not include statements of the  judge or\n\ncounsel.  The defendant was not prejudiced by any conduct of  the\n\ntrial judge, and a new trial is not warranted.\n\nB.  Evidence of Disciplinary Action\n                                   \n\n          During the  cross-examination of  Officer Reardon,  who\n\nwas the  commander on duty on  the night of the  alleged assault,\n\nthe plaintiffs'  attorney questioned Reardon about the reputation\n\nfor truthfulness of Officer Maki.  When Reardon responded that he\n\nhad  never  known Maki  to be  untruthful, counsel  asked whether\n\nReardon was  aware of an  incident in which Maki  was disciplined\n\nafter he was untruthful when  filing an overtime report.  Reardon\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\ndenied knowledge of  the event.  Plaintiffs'  counsel then called\n\nOfficer  Maki  back  to  the  stand  for  rebuttal testimony  and\n\nquestioned him  about the  incident.  Maki  admitted that  it had\n\nhappened, and  documents regarding  the event  were then  allowed\n\ninto evidence.   Maki  explained his version  of the  incident on\n\ncross-examination  by  defense  counsel.    Bichao  contends that\n\nallowing evidence  of this  event was erroneous  for a  number of\n\nreasons.  \n\n          First, Bichao argues  that it was improper  to question\n\nReardon about his  opinion of Maki's reputation  for truthfulness\n\nbecause  Maki's character  had not  been  put into  issue by  the\n\ndefense.  Under  Fed.  R.  Evid. 608,  evidence  of  the truthful\n\ncharacter of  a  witness is  only admissible  after the  witness'\n\ncharacter  has been  attacked,  but  there  is  no  corresponding\n\nlimitation  on introducing evidence about the untruthfulness of a\n\nwitness.3  Officer  Maki was the officer who  was located closest\n\n                    \n\n     3Federal Rule of Evidence 608 provides:  \n\n          (a)  The credibility  of  a  witness  may  be\n          attacked or supported by evidence in the form\n          of  opinion  or  reputation,  but subject  to\n          these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer\n          only   to  character   for  truthfulness   or\n          untruthfulness, and (2)  evidence of truthful\n          character  is   admissible  only   after  the\n          character of the witness for truthfulness has\n          been  attacked   by  opinion   or  reputation\n          evidence or otherwise.  \n\n          (b) Specific  instances of  the conduct  of a\n          witness, for  the  purpose  of  attacking  or\n          supporting  the  witness'  credibility, other\n          than conviction  of crime as provided in rule\n          609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\n          They may,  however, in the discretion  of the\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nto Officer Bichao  when the alleged kicks to  Walter Deary's head\n\ntook place.   His testimony about  the arrest was crucial  to the\n\ntrial.  By testifying to the events  of the night in question, he\n\nput his  credibility  into issue.   Questions  to his  supervisor\n\nregarding the supervisor's opinion of Officer Maki's truthfulness\n\nwere clearly proper.  \n\n          Bichao  also contends  that the disciplinary  event was\n\ntoo  remote  in  time to  allow  cross-examination  regarding the\n\nsuspension.   When a witness has testified as to the character of\n\nanother  witness, Fed.  R.  Evid.  608(b)  allows  inquiry  about\n\nspecific  instances of conduct concerning the truthfulness of the\n\nprincipal witness.  Although the time which has elapsed since the\n\nprior  bad act  is a  consideration for  the judge  to take  into\n\naccount  when  determining   whether  to  admit   such  character\n\nevidence, close proximity  in time is not required  under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 608(b).  United States v. McClintic, 570 F.2d 685 (8th Cir.\n                                         \n\n1978).  The  incident involving Maki occurred ten  years prior to\n\nthe trial.   The discipline  resulted from the fact  that Officer\n\nMaki was untruthful in filing an overtime report.   It was within\n\nthe discretion of the trial judge to allow plaintiffs' counsel to\n\n                    \n\n          court,  if   probative  of   truthfulness  or\n          untruthfulness,  be inquired  into on  cross-\n          examination of the witness (1) concerning the\n          witness'   character   for   truthfulness  or\n          untruthfulness,   or   (2)   concerning   the\n          character for truthfulness  or untruthfulness\n          of another witness as to which  character the\n          witness being cross-examined has testified.  \n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nquestion Officer Reardon about his knowledge of this event, since\n\nthe incident was relevant to Officer Maki's credibility.\n\n          Next,  Bichao argues that the admission of the rebuttal\n\ntestimony of  Maki and the  documents regarding the event  was an\n\nerror  because  each  constituted  extrinsic  evidence   used  to\n\ncontrovert Officer  Reardon's denial of  knowledge regarding  the\n\ndisciplinary  incident, in  violation of  Fed.  R. Evid.  608(b).\n\nWhile  we agree  that  the  rebuttal testimony  of  Maki and  the\n\ndocuments  should not have been admitted, we find the error to be\n\nharmless for the reasons enumerated below.\n\n          Fed.  R.  Evid.  608  prohibits   the  introduction  of\n\nextrinsic evidence to  prove specific instances of the conduct of\n\na witness for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness'\n\ncredibility.   Therefore, although  a witness  can be  questioned\n\nabout particular events, once the witness  has denied or admitted\n\nknowledge of  the occurrence  on cross-examination,  the examiner\n\nmust accept the answer given by the witness.  U.S. v. Tejada, 886\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  483,  488 (1st  Cir.  1989).   The  purpose of  the  ban on\n\nextrinsic evidence is \"to avoid holding mini-trials on irrelevant\n\nor collateral matters\".  United  States v. Beauchamp, 986 F.2d 1,\n                                                    \n\n3 n.1 (1st Cir. 1993).   Here, plaintiffs' recall of Officer Maki\n\non rebuttal was an unnecessary foray, resulting in a waste of the\n\ncourt's time.   Officer Reardon stated on  cross-examination that\n\nhe had no knowledge of the  disciplinary action involving Officer\n\nMaki.   Questioning about the  event should have been  stopped at\n\nthat juncture.  Under Fed. R. Evid. 608(b), plaintiffs could have\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nquestioned  Maki  about  the disciplinary  suspension  during his\n\noriginal  testimony, since it  was probative of  Maki's character\n\nfor truthfulness  or untruthfulness.   However,  such questioning\n\nwould not  have involved the  time expended in recalling  Maki to\n\nthe  stand, and  therefore the  original  admissibility does  not\n\nrender  the  rebuttal  questioning  acceptable.    The  documents\n\nregarding  the  disciplinary  event  provided  further  extrinsic\n\nevidence  of the suspension.   As such, they  would not even have\n\nbeen  admissible during Maki's original testimony, and should not\n\nhave been allowed during rebuttal.\n\n          Although Maki's  rebuttal testimony  and the  documents\n\nregarding the suspension should not have been admitted under Fed.\n\nR.  Evid.  608,  we  find  that the  error  was  harmless.    \"In\n\ndetermining whether  or not the  error was harmless,  a reviewing\n\ncourt must assess the record as a whole to determine the probable\n\nimpact of the improper evidence upon the  jury.

Evid.  608 was harmful, this  court has\n\nexamined such factors as whether the admission allowed completely\n\nnew evidence before the jury,  and whether the disputed  evidence\n\nwas likely to arouse undue passion or prejudice to the jury.  Id.\n                                                                \n\nIn  this case, during  the cross-examination of  Officer Reardon,\n\nplaintiffs' counsel raised  the possibility in front of  the jury\n\nthat Officer Maki  may have been involved  in an incident  on the\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\npolice   force  where  his  truthfulness  was  questioned.    The\n\ninformation about the event, while probative of untruthfulness of\n\none of  the witnesses, was not likely  to unduly inflame the jury\n\nagainst  the defense.   Furthermore, but for  counsel's omission,\n\nthe disciplinary  action would have been brought out when Officer\n\nMaki was initially testifying in  the case.  In addition, Officer\n\nMaki had  an  opportunity  to  explain  the  incident  on  cross-\n\nexamination during rebuttal.  The  error is insufficient to merit\n\nreversal. \n\nC.

We find that the\n\ndistrict  court  more  than  adequately  analyzed  the  issue  of\n\nattorneys' fees,  and explained its  reasoning for the  amount of\n\nfees granted.  \n\n                               III.\n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          In sum, we affirm the holding below.

After the plaintiffs' case, the court directed verdicts for each of the police officers, except Officer Bichao.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The main issue in the case was an allegation that Officer Bichao kicked Walter Deary twice in the head.  The jury awarded Walter Deary $25,000 in compensatory damages and $75,000 in punitive damages, and found for Bichao on the claims brought by Robert Deary.  The court granted $112,295 in attorneys' fees and $8,977.50 in costs to the plaintiffs' attorneys under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Allegations of Bias of Trial Judge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Bichao requests a new trial, alleging that the trial judge was so biased towards the plaintiffs as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.  Bichao lists numerous incidents during the trial which he contends were indicative of the bias of the judge.  These events may be divided into three types:  (1) claims that the judge made comments indicating that defendant's counsel was proceeding too slowly;  (2) claims that the judge's questioning of witnesses reflected bias and partiality for the plaintiffs;  (3) allegations regarding disputes between defendant's counsel and the judge, which Bichao claims created a prejudicial effect against the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bias and improper conduct by a trial judge may be grounds for a new trial if a party is so seriously prejudiced as to be deprived of a fair trial.  Aggarwal v. Ponce School of Medicine, 837 F.2d 17, 21-22 (1st Cir.1988).  However, mere active participation by the judge does not create prejudice nor deprive the party of a fair trial.  Id.  On appeal, we must \"consider isolated incidents in light of the entire transcript so as to 'guard against magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting'.\"  Aggarwal at 22 (quoting Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao cites several instances during the trial where Judge Tauro encouraged defense counsel to advance the pace of questioning, or was unsatisfied with counsel's utilization of time.  The trial judge has discretion to maintain the pace of trial, and indeed \"has the responsibility to oversee the conduct of a trial so that it moves expeditiously\".  Desjardins v. Van Buren Community Hosp., 969 F.2d 1280, 1281 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that requests by the judge that counsel not be repetitive are \"routine\").  Therefore, encouraging counsel to move forward, forbidding counsel from eliciting duplicative testimony, or halting what the court perceived to be a waste of time, was firmly within the discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bichao alleges that the trial judge exhibited bias towards the plaintiffs by interjecting questions during defense counsel's direct and cross-examination of several witnesses, including Bichao himself.  The court has the prerogative to interrogate witnesses, and the duty to do so where necessary to clarify testimony, but the judge must maintain an air of impartiality.  United States v. Paz Uribe, 891 F.2d 396, 400 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 951, 110 S.Ct. 2216, 109 L.Ed.2d 542 (1990).  \"Trial judges are constantly making judgments about ... the need to clarify witness answers, and similar matters of trial management.  In this realm, the widest possible latitude is given to the judge on the scene.\"  Rodriguez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 990 F.2d 7, 13 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao argues that the judge's questioning of the plaintiff's medical expert, Dr. Starr, undermined defense counsel's credibility, and reflected bias by the judge.  A review of the transcript reveals that the judge's questions were meant to clarify the testimony of the witness.  During cross-examination, Dr. Starr had discussed a number of documents which the jury did not have in front of them.  The court asked some questions in order to elucidate which document the questions referred to, and which section of the report counsel was discussing.  These questions were clearly within the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao also contends that the court was overzealous in its questioning of Officers Maki and Beaudette during direct examination, and as a result destroyed the credibility of the two witnesses.  Officer Maki was the person who was closest in physical proximity to Walter Deary when the alleged kicks by Bichao were administered.  The judge questioned him in order to clarify Maki's statement about his lack of memory of the kicking.  This issue was central to the case, and the judge was acting within his discretion to ensure that Maki's testimony was clear.  Similarly, the court's questioning of Officer Beaudette was unbiased and aimed at illuminating his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao claims that when he was being cross-examined by plaintiff's counsel, the judge made uncivil remarks and asked hostile questions of him.  A close examination of the transcript reveals that the judge occasionally instructed the witness to answer the questions which were presented to him, and asked questions to elucidate Bichao's testimony.  These directions and questions did not rise to the level of partiality, but rather were made with the purpose of obtaining answers to the questions posed and clarifying the answers given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bichao identifies several exchanges in the transcript which he claims reflect a certain amount of animosity between the judge and defense counsel.  Some of these incidents occurred outside of the hearing of the jury, where they could not have influenced the jury decision.  However, Bichao points to a sidebar conference during which the judge stated that he found defense counsel's cross-examination of the medical expert to be \"very devious\".  At the time, the judge asked the jury whether they could hear the sidebar conference and one juror stated that he was able to hear \"a little bit\".  This episode, taken in the context of a nine-day trial, does not warrant appellate intervention.  When the judge questioned the jury about this incident, only one of the eight members stated that he could hear a little bit of the conference.  It is unclear whether the \"devious\" comment itself was overheard by that one juror.  Even assuming that the one juror did hear the statement, we find that, viewing the trial transcript as a whole, the comment is insufficient to sustain a finding of bias on the part of the trial judge, or prejudicial impact on the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial judges need to maintain strict control over judicial proceedings and as a result it would be unrealistic to suggest that trials should always be models of harmony.  Although any display by the trial judge of unwarranted irritation or displeasure directed towards counsel ought to be avoided, friction between the court and counsel does not constitute pervasive bias.  See Arthur Pierson &amp; Co. v. Provimi Veal Corp., 887 F.2d 837, 839 (7th Cir.1989);  Hamm v. Board of Regents, 708 F.2d 647, 650 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao contends that the judge failed to give the jury general or specific curative instructions regarding any of these incidents.  But defendant failed to request any specific curative instructions during the course of the trial.  Furthermore, the jury charge instructed the jurors that they were the \"sole judges of the weight and effect of all of the evidence\" and that the evidence in the case did not include statements of the judge or counsel.  The defendant was not prejudiced by any conduct of the trial judge, and a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Evidence of Disciplinary Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the cross-examination of Officer Reardon, who was the commander on duty on the night of the alleged assault, the plaintiffs' attorney questioned Reardon about the reputation for truthfulness of Officer Maki.  When Reardon responded that he had never known Maki to be untruthful, counsel asked whether Reardon was aware of an incident in which Maki was disciplined after he was untruthful when filing an overtime report.  Reardon denied knowledge of the event.  Plaintiffs' counsel then called Officer Maki back to the stand for rebuttal testimony and questioned him about the incident.  Maki admitted that it had happened, and documents regarding the event were then allowed into evidence.  Maki explained his version of the incident on cross-examination by defense counsel.  Bichao contends that allowing evidence of this event was erroneous for a number of reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Bichao argues that it was improper to question Reardon about his opinion of Maki's reputation for truthfulness because Maki's character had not been put into issue by the defense.  Under Fed.R.Evid. 608, evidence of the truthful character of a witness is only admissible after the witness' character has been attacked, but there is no corresponding limitation on introducing evidence about the untruthfulness of a witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Officer Maki was the officer who was located closest to Officer Bichao when the alleged kicks to Walter Deary's head took place.  His testimony about the arrest was crucial to the trial.  By testifying to the events of the night in question, he put his credibility into issue.  Questions to his supervisor regarding the supervisor's opinion of Officer Maki's truthfulness were clearly proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao also contends that the disciplinary event was too remote in time to allow cross-examination regarding the suspension.  When a witness has testified as to the character of another witness, Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) allows inquiry about specific instances of conduct concerning the truthfulness of the principal witness.  Although the time which has elapsed since the prior bad act is a consideration for the judge to take into account when determining whether to admit such character evidence, close proximity in time is not required under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b).  United States v. McClintic, 570 F.2d 685 (8th Cir.1978).  The incident involving Maki occurred ten years prior to the trial.  The discipline resulted from the fact that Officer Maki was untruthful in filing an overtime report.  It was within the discretion of the trial judge to allow plaintiffs' counsel to question Officer Reardon about his knowledge of this event, since the incident was relevant to Officer Maki's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bichao argues that the admission of the rebuttal testimony of Maki and the documents regarding the event was an error because each constituted extrinsic evidence used to controvert Officer Reardon's denial of knowledge regarding the disciplinary incident, in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 608(b).  While we agree that the rebuttal testimony of Maki and the documents should not have been admitted, we find the error to be harmless for the reasons enumerated below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 608 prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of the conduct of a witness for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' credibility.  Therefore, although a witness can be questioned about particular events, once the witness has denied or admitted knowledge of the occurrence on cross-examination, the examiner must accept the answer given by the witness.  U.S. v. Tejada, 886 F.2d 483, 488 (1st Cir.1989).  The purpose of the ban on extrinsic evidence is \"to avoid holding mini-trials on irrelevant or collateral matters\".  United States v. Beauchamp, 986 F.2d 1, 3 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993).  Here, plaintiffs' recall of Officer Maki on rebuttal was an unnecessary foray, resulting in a waste of the court's time.  Officer Reardon stated on cross-examination that he had no knowledge of the disciplinary action involving Officer Maki.  Questioning about the event should have been stopped at that juncture.  Under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b), plaintiffs could have questioned Maki about the disciplinary suspension during his original testimony, since it was probative of Maki's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.  However, such questioning would not have involved the time expended in recalling Maki to the stand, and therefore the original admissibility does not render the rebuttal questioning acceptable.  The documents regarding the disciplinary event provided further extrinsic evidence of the suspension.  As such, they would not even have been admissible during Maki's original testimony, and should not have been allowed during rebuttal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Maki's rebuttal testimony and the documents regarding the suspension should not have been admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 608, we find that the error was harmless.  \"In determining whether or not the error was harmless, a reviewing court must assess the record as a whole to determine the probable impact of the improper evidence upon the jury.\"  United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 237 (1st Cir.1988) (citing United States v. Currier, 821 F.2d 52, 56 (1st Cir.1987).  In determining whether evidence erroneously admitted in contravention of Fed.R.Evid. 608 was harmful, this court has examined such factors as whether the admission allowed completely new evidence before the jury, and whether the disputed evidence was likely to arouse undue passion or prejudice to the jury.  Id.  In this case, during the cross-examination of Officer Reardon, plaintiffs' counsel raised the possibility in front of the jury that Officer Maki may have been involved in an incident on the police force where his truthfulness was questioned.  The information about the event, while probative of untruthfulness of one of the witnesses, was not likely to unduly inflame the jury against the defense.  Furthermore, but for counsel's omission, the disciplinary action would have been brought out when Officer Maki was initially testifying in the case.  In addition, Officer Maki had an opportunity to explain the incident on cross-examination during rebuttal.  The error is insufficient to merit reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Attorneys' fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant challenges the award of attorneys' fees to plaintiffs' attorneys granted under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988.  Bichao claims that the records submitted by the lawyers were not contemporaneous and that the billing rate requested was inflated, and seeks a reduction of the fee award to reflect the fact that only one of the plaintiffs prevailed on one of the claims.  District courts have discretion in awarding fees and costs in civil rights cases, but must carry out more than a conclusory examination of the hours and rates requested.  Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 950 (1st Cir.1984).  Normally, appellate courts should \"defer to any thoughtful rationale and decision developed by a trial court and ... avoid extensive second guessing.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to recover fees, attorneys must submit a full and precise accounting of their time, including specific information about number of hours, dates, and the nature of the work performed.  Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp., 801 F.2d 558, 560 (1st Cir.1986).  If such documentation is not submitted, fees should be reduced or even denied altogether.  Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 952.   Here, Judge Tauro noted that the attorneys submitted all of this information, and found that the records were \"essentially contemporaneous and ... reliable\".  Deary v. Gloucester, 789 F.Supp. 61, 64 (D.Mass.1992).  The attorneys submitted affidavits, as well as the actual time slips.  Following the admonition in Grendel's Den, the district court deducted hours from the total requested where the records were not sufficiently precise or were not in chronological order, and where the time slips failed to correspond with the attorney's affidavit.  The court denied seventy-eight hours out of the 699.4 hours requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court must also make a finding as to the prevailing market rate, based on evidence other than the attorneys' affidavits.  Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1168 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 820, 110 S.Ct. 75, 107 L.Ed.2d 42 (1989).  The judge here noted that counsel submitted affidavits from other Boston attorneys regarding fees in similar cases, as well as information about billing rates for Massachusetts law firms.  The court examined this information, as well as the attorneys' experience levels in assessing the correct hourly billing rate.  In addition, the court awarded lower hourly rates than those requested for pretrial work performed by counsel.  Finally, the court detailed its reasoning for refusing a reduction in fees due to the fact that only one of the plaintiffs was successful against one defendant and for refusing a request by plaintiffs' counsel for a risk factor enhancement of fees.  We find that the district court more than adequately analyzed the issue of attorneys' fees, and explained its reasoning for the amount of fees granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we affirm the holding below.  The judge did not display actionable bias against the defendant.  Although the evidence regarding Officer Maki's suspension was incorrectly admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 608 through the rebuttal testimony of Officer Maki, the error was harmless.  The district court appropriately detailed its reasoning in granting the attorneys' fees and costs, and the award will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The claims against the city, the Mayor, and the Chief of Police were bifurcated from those against the individual officers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal requesting that if a new trial were granted to Defendant Bichao, then this court should also reverse the directed verdicts granted to defendants Earland Whortley, David Reardon, Howard Maki, John Beaudette, Harold Reardon, and James Hubbard, the other Gloucester police officers.

The jury awarded Walter Deary $25,000 in compensatory damages and $75,000 in punitive damages, and found for Bichao on the claims brought by Robert Deary.  The court granted $112,295 in attorneys' fees and $8,977.50 in costs to the plaintiffs' attorneys under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Allegations of Bias of Trial Judge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Bichao requests a new trial, alleging that the trial judge was so biased towards the plaintiffs as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.  Bichao lists numerous incidents during the trial which he contends were indicative of the bias of the judge.  These events may be divided into three types:  (1) claims that the judge made comments indicating that defendant's counsel was proceeding too slowly;  (2) claims that the judge's questioning of witnesses reflected bias and partiality for the plaintiffs;  (3) allegations regarding disputes between defendant's counsel and the judge, which Bichao claims created a prejudicial effect against the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bias and improper conduct by a trial judge may be grounds for a new trial if a party is so seriously prejudiced as to be deprived of a fair trial.  Aggarwal v. Ponce School of Medicine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500041\"><a href=\"/opinion/500041/deep-aggarwal-v-ponce-school-of-medicine/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21-22 (1st Cir.1988).  However, mere active participation by the judge does not create prejudice nor deprive the party of a fair trial.  Id.  On appeal, we must \"consider isolated incidents in light of the entire transcript so as to 'guard against magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting'.\"  Aggarwal at 22 (quoting Glasser v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103597\"><a href=\"/opinion/103597/glasser-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The trial judge has discretion to maintain the pace of trial, and indeed \"has the responsibility to oversee the conduct of a trial so that it moves expeditiously\".  Desjardins v. Van Buren Community Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587241\"><a href=\"/opinion/587241/eugene-desjardins-v-van-buren-community-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span>, 1281 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that requests by the judge that counsel not be repetitive are \"routine\").  Therefore, encouraging counsel to move forward, forbidding counsel from eliciting duplicative testimony, or halting what the court perceived to be a waste of time, was firmly within the discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bichao alleges that the trial judge exhibited bias towards the plaintiffs by interjecting questions during defense counsel's direct and cross-examination of several witnesses, including Bichao himself.  The court has the prerogative to interrogate witnesses, and the duty to do so where necessary to clarify testimony, but the judge must maintain an air of impartiality.  United States v.

In this realm, the widest possible latitude is given to the judge on the scene.\"  Rodriguez v. Banco Cent.

A review of the transcript reveals that the judge's questions were meant to clarify the testimony of the witness.  During cross-examination, Dr. Starr had discussed a number of documents which the jury did not have in front of them.  The court asked some questions in order to elucidate which document the questions referred to, and which section of the report counsel was discussing.  These questions were clearly within the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao also contends that the court was overzealous in its questioning of Officers Maki and Beaudette during direct examination, and as a result destroyed the credibility of the two witnesses.  Officer Maki was the person who was closest in physical proximity to Walter Deary when the alleged kicks by Bichao were administered.  The judge questioned him in order to clarify Maki's statement about his lack of memory of the kicking.  This issue was central to the case, and the judge was acting within his discretion to ensure that Maki's testimony was clear.  Similarly, the court's questioning of Officer Beaudette was unbiased and aimed at illuminating his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao claims that when he was being cross-examined by plaintiff's counsel, the judge made uncivil remarks and asked hostile questions of him.  A close examination of the transcript reveals that the judge occasionally instructed the witness to answer the questions which were presented to him, and asked questions to elucidate Bichao's testimony.  These directions and questions did not rise to the level of partiality, but rather were made with the purpose of obtaining answers to the questions posed and clarifying the answers given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bichao identifies several exchanges in the transcript which he claims reflect a certain amount of animosity between the judge and defense counsel.  Some of these incidents occurred outside of the hearing of the jury, where they could not have influenced the jury decision.  However, Bichao points to a sidebar conference during which the judge stated that he found defense counsel's cross-examination of the medical expert to be \"very devious\".  At the time, the judge asked the jury whether they could hear the sidebar conference and one juror stated that he was able to hear \"a little bit\".  This episode, taken in the context of a nine-day trial, does not warrant appellate intervention.  When the judge questioned the jury about this incident, only one of the eight members stated that he could hear a little bit of the conference.  It is unclear whether the \"devious\" comment itself was overheard by that one juror.  Even assuming that the one juror did hear the statement, we find that, viewing the trial transcript as a whole, the comment is insufficient to sustain a finding of bias on the part of the trial judge, or prejudicial impact on the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial judges need to maintain strict control over judicial proceedings and as a result it would be unrealistic to suggest that trials should always be models of harmony.  Although any display by the trial judge of unwarranted irritation or displeasure directed towards counsel ought to be avoided, friction between the court and counsel does not constitute pervasive bias.  See Arthur Pierson &amp; Co. v. Provimi Veal Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530610\"><a href=\"/opinion/530610/arthur-pierson-company-inc-nka-pierson-flynn-inc-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 839 (7th Cir.1989);  Hamm v.

But defendant failed to request any specific curative instructions during the course of the trial.  Furthermore, the jury charge instructed the jurors that they were the \"sole judges of the weight and effect of all of the evidence\" and that the evidence in the case did not include statements of the judge or counsel.  The defendant was not prejudiced by any conduct of the trial judge, and a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Evidence of Disciplinary Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the cross-examination of Officer Reardon, who was the commander on duty on the night of the alleged assault, the plaintiffs' attorney questioned Reardon about the reputation for truthfulness of Officer Maki.  When Reardon responded that he had never known Maki to be untruthful, counsel asked whether Reardon was aware of an incident in which Maki was disciplined after he was untruthful when filing an overtime report.  Reardon denied knowledge of the event.  Plaintiffs' counsel then called Officer Maki back to the stand for rebuttal testimony and questioned him about the incident.  Maki admitted that it had happened, and documents regarding the event were then allowed into evidence.  Maki explained his version of the incident on cross-examination by defense counsel.  Bichao contends that allowing evidence of this event was erroneous for a number of reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Bichao argues that it was improper to question Reardon about his opinion of Maki's reputation for truthfulness because Maki's character had not been put into issue by the defense.  Under Fed.R.Evid. 608, evidence of the truthful character of a witness is only admissible after the witness' character has been attacked, but there is no corresponding limitation on introducing evidence about the untruthfulness of a witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Officer Maki was the officer who was located closest to Officer Bichao when the alleged kicks to Walter Deary's head took place.  His testimony about the arrest was crucial to the trial.  By testifying to the events of the night in question, he put his credibility into issue.  Questions to his supervisor regarding the supervisor's opinion of Officer Maki's truthfulness were clearly proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bichao also contends that the disciplinary event was too remote in time to allow cross-examination regarding the suspension.  When a witness has testified as to the character of another witness, Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) allows inquiry about specific instances of conduct concerning the truthfulness of the principal witness.  Although the time which has elapsed since the prior bad act is a consideration for the judge to take into account when determining whether to admit such character evidence, close proximity in time is not required under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b).  United States v. McClintic, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"353083\"><a href=\"/opinion/353083/united-states-v-glenn-arthur-mcclintic-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1978).  The incident involving Maki occurred ten years prior to the trial.  The discipline resulted from the fact that Officer Maki was untruthful in filing an overtime report.  It was within the discretion of the trial judge to allow plaintiffs' counsel to question Officer Reardon about his knowledge of this event, since the incident was relevant to Officer Maki's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bichao argues that the admission of the rebuttal testimony of Maki and the documents regarding the event was an error because each constituted extrinsic evidence used to controvert Officer Reardon's denial of knowledge regarding the disciplinary incident, in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 608(b).  While we agree that the rebuttal testimony of Maki and the documents should not have been admitted, we find the error to be harmless for the reasons enumerated below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 608 prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of the conduct of a witness for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' credibility.  Therefore, although a witness can be questioned about particular events, once the witness has denied or admitted knowledge of the occurrence on cross-examination, the examiner must accept the answer given by the witness.  U.S. v. Tejada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529942\"><a href=\"/opinion/529942/united-states-v-alberto-tejada-united-states-of-america-v-juan-ignacio/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 488 (1st Cir.1989).  The purpose of the ban on extrinsic evidence is \"to avoid holding mini-trials on irrelevant or collateral matters\".  United States v. Beauchamp, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600392\"><a href=\"/opinion/600392/united-states-v-michael-w-beauchamp/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993).  Here, plaintiffs' recall of Officer Maki on rebuttal was an unnecessary foray, resulting in a waste of the court's time.  Officer Reardon stated on cross-examination that he had no knowledge of the disciplinary action involving Officer Maki.  Questioning about the event should have been stopped at that juncture.  Under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b), plaintiffs could have questioned Maki about the disciplinary suspension during his original testimony, since it was probative of Maki's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.  However, such questioning would not have involved the time expended in recalling Maki to the stand, and therefore the original admissibility does not render the rebuttal questioning acceptable.  The documents regarding the disciplinary event provided further extrinsic evidence of the suspension.  As such, they would not even have been admissible during Maki's original testimony, and should not have been allowed during rebuttal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Maki's rebuttal testimony and the documents regarding the suspension should not have been admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 608, we find that the error was harmless.  \"In determining whether or not the error was harmless, a reviewing court must assess the record as a whole to determine the probable impact of the improper evidence upon the jury.\"  United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516169\"><a href=\"/opinion/516169/united-states-v-manuel-l-mateos-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 237 (1st Cir.1988) (citing United States v. Currier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489945\"><a href=\"/opinion/489945/united-states-v-raymond-leon-currier-united-states-of-america-v-raymond/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.1987).  In determining whether evidence erroneously admitted in contravention of Fed.R.Evid. 608 was harmful, this court has examined such factors as whether the admission allowed completely new evidence before the jury, and whether the disputed evidence was likely to arouse undue passion or prejudice to the jury.  Id.  In this case, during the cross-examination of Officer Reardon, plaintiffs' counsel raised the possibility in front of the jury that Officer Maki may have been involved in an incident on the police force where his truthfulness was questioned.  The information about the event, while probative of untruthfulness of one of the witnesses, was not likely to unduly inflame the jury against the defense.  Furthermore, but for counsel's omission, the disciplinary action would have been brought out when Officer Maki was initially testifying in the case.  In addition, Officer Maki had an opportunity to explain the incident on cross-examination during rebuttal.  The error is insufficient to merit reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Attorneys' fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant challenges the award of attorneys' fees to plaintiffs' attorneys granted under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988.  Bichao claims that the records submitted by the lawyers were not contemporaneous and that the billing rate requested was inflated, and seeks a reduction of the fee award to reflect the fact that only one of the plaintiffs prevailed on one of the claims.  District courts have discretion in awarding fees and costs in civil rights cases, but must carry out more than a conclusory examination of the hours and rates requested.  Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445233\"><a href=\"/opinion/445233/grendels-den-inc-v-john-p-larkin-cambridge-license-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span>, 950 (1st Cir.1984).  Normally, appellate courts should \"defer to any thoughtful rationale and decision developed by a trial court and ... avoid extensive second guessing.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to recover fees, attorneys must submit a full and precise accounting of their time, including specific information about number of hours, dates, and the nature of the work performed.  Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476642\"><a href=\"/opinion/476642/41-fair-emplpraccas-1515-41-empl-prac-dec-p-36554-robert-h-calhoun/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, 560 (1st Cir.1986).  If such documentation is not submitted, fees should be reduced or even denied altogether.  Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 952.   Here, Judge Tauro noted that the attorneys submitted all of this information, and found that the records were \"essentially contemporaneous and ... reliable\".  Deary v. Gloucester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1640812\"><a href=\"/opinion/1640812/deary-v-city-of-gloucester/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 64 (D.Mass.1992).  The attorneys submitted affidavits, as well as the actual time slips.  Following the admonition in Grendel's Den, the district court deducted hours from the total requested where the records were not sufficiently precise or were not in chronological order, and where the time slips failed to correspond with the attorney's affidavit.  The court denied seventy-eight hours out of the 699.4 hours requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court must also make a finding as to the prevailing market rate, based on evidence other than the attorneys' affidavits.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span> (1989).  The judge here noted that counsel submitted affidavits from other Boston attorneys regarding fees in similar cases, as well as information about billing rates for Massachusetts law firms.  The court examined this information, as well as the attorneys' experience levels in assessing the correct hourly billing rate.  In addition, the court awarded lower hourly rates than those requested for pretrial work performed by counsel.  Finally, the court detailed its reasoning for refusing a reduction in fees due to the fact that only one of the plaintiffs was successful against one defendant and for refusing a request by plaintiffs' counsel for a risk factor enhancement of fees.  We find that the district court more than adequately analyzed the issue of attorneys' fees, and explained its reasoning for the amount of fees granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we affirm the holding below.  The judge did not display actionable bias against the defendant.  Although the evidence regarding Officer Maki's suspension was incorrectly admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 608 through the rebuttal testimony of Officer Maki, the error was harmless.  The district court appropriately detailed its reasoning in granting the attorneys' fees and costs, and the award will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The claims against the city, the Mayor, and the Chief of Police were bifurcated from those against the individual officers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal requesting that if a new trial were granted to Defendant Bichao, then this court should also reverse the directed verdicts granted to defendants Earland Whortley, David Reardon, Howard Maki, John Beaudette, Harold Reardon, and James Hubbard, the other Gloucester police officers.
