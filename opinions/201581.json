In June 2003, Peter Dimmitt filed suit\n\nagainst the Town of Rockland, Maine, its police department and\n\nseveral      police    officers,        alleging      that     the   police     had   used\n\nexcessive force in effecting his arrest.                       The defendants filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, as well as the required statement of\n\nmaterial facts and supporting record citations. See Me. U.S. Dist.\n\nCt.   Local     R.    56(b).1      Dimmitt’s       counsel       submitted      a   timely\n\nopposition      to    the   motion,      but    the     accompanying      statement     of\n\nmaterial facts (setting forth his putative evidence relating to the\n\nuse of excessive force) did not comply with Local Rule 56(c), which\n\nrequires that the counterstatement expressly admit, deny or qualify\n\neach paragraph of the defendants’ statement of material facts.2\n\n              Defendants        filed    a     motion     to     strike   the       Dimmitt\n\n\n      1\n      Local Rule 56(b) requires the filing of a \"separate, short,\nand concise statement of material facts, set forth in numbered\nparagraphs, as to which the moving party contends there is no\ngenuine issue of material fact to be tried. Each fact asserted in\nthe statement shall be supported by a record citation.” Me. U.S.\nDist. Ct. Local R. 56(b).\n      2\n          Local Rule 56(c) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n      A party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall\n      submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise\n      statement of material facts.     The opposing statement\n      shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to\n      each numbered paragraph of the moving party’s statement\n      of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall\n      support each denial or qualification by a record citation\n      as required by this rule.\n\nMe. U.S. Dist. Ct. Local R. 56(c).\n\n                                             -2-\n\fcounterstatement as noncompliant with the local rules.        Dimmitt’s\n\ncounsel responded that any noncompliance was due to “excusable\n\nneglect,” see Fed. R. Civ. P. 6 (b),3 and explained:\n\n             Difficult as it may be to admit, Plaintiff’s\n             counsel’s failure to properly file an opposing\n             statement of facts in dispute is based upon\n             inexperience with the requirements of the\n             District Court and unfamiliarity with the\n             local rules. Counsel has not participated in\n             a civil case in U.S. District Court for\n             several years (but for a busy bankruptcy\n             practice) and is attempting to get up to speed\n             as soon as is humanly possible. Counsel has\n             had extreme difficulties with everything from\n             perfecting his ECF participation to keeping up\n             with the speed of the system compared to that\n             of the State court system, to which he is\n             intimately acquainted.    While his pleadings\n             may not have been set forth in the required\n             manner, Plaintiff has made a good-faith effort\n             to show the Court that there are substantial\n             disagreements regarding the facts of this case\n             through the submission of his own Statement of\n             Material Facts.\n\nThe district court granted the motion to strike.        Then, in the\n\nabsence of a timely Rule 56(c) counterstatement demonstrating\n\n\n     3\n         Rule 6(b) provides:\n\n          When by these rules or by a notice given thereunder\n     or by order of court an act is required or allowed to be\n     done at or within a specified time, the court for cause\n     shown may at any time in its discretion (1) with or\n     without motion or notice order the period enlarged if\n     request therefor is made before the expiration of the\n     period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous\n     order, or (2) upon motion made after the expiration of\n     the specified period permit the act to be done where the\n     failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 6 (b).\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fevidence of the use of excessive force, it proceeded to grant\n\nsummary judgment for the defendants. Dimmitt now appeals from that\n\njudgment insofar as it rests upon the allowance of the defendants’\n\nmotion to strike the counterstatement.4\n\n             The   district   court   ruling      that    Dimmitt     failed     to\n\ndemonstrate “excusable neglect” is reviewed only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b); Bennett v. City of Holyoke,\n\n362 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2004).            In so doing, we accord broad\n\ndeference     to    the   special   role    of    the     district     court     in\n\nadministering its local procedural rules.                See Crowley v. L.L.\n\nBean, Inc., 361 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             On appeal, Dimmitt contends that the district court\n\napplied an inflexible “excusable neglect” standard, which was\n\nexplicitly rejected in Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick\n\nAssociates     Limited     Partnership,     507    U.S.    380,      392     (1993)\n\n(describing \"excusable neglect\" as an “elastic concept”).                   Dimmitt\n\nargues that his counsel presented credible reasons for his mistake,\n\nand that there exists no evidence either that his attorney acted in\n\nbad faith or that the 18-day delay in submitting a compliant\n\ncounterstatement prejudiced the defendants’ case.              See id. at 395\n\n(enumerating       some   factors   pertinent     to     “excusable        neglect”\n\ninquiry).\n\n\n     4\n      The district court cited alternate grounds for allowing\nspecific aspects of the defendants’ summary judgment motion, but\nDimmitt does not challenge these grounds on appeal.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             It is true that the “excusable neglect” inquiry involves\n\n\"a significant equitable component and must give due regard to the\n\ntotality of the relevant circumstances surrounding the movant's\n\nlapse.”   Bennett, 362 F.3d at 5.            We can discern no abuse of\n\ndiscretion, however, in the district court’s equitable decision not\n\nto excuse the late filing by Dimmitt's counsel in the present\n\ncircumstances.\n\n             First, as we have repeatedly held, “even under the\n\nflexible standard prescribed by Pioneer,” counsels’ inattention or\n\ncarelessness, such as a failure to consult or to abide by an\n\nunambiguous court procedural rule, normally does not constitute\n\n“excusable     neglect”.         See     Pioneer,     507   U.S.     at   392\n\n(“[I]nadvertence, ignorance of the rules, or mistakes concerning\n\nconstruing    the   rules   do    not    usually     constitute    ‘excusable\n\nneglect.’”); Stonkus v. City of Brockton Sch. Dep’t, 322 F.3d 97,\n\n101 (1st Cir. 2003); Graphic Communications Int’l Union, Local 12-N\n\nv. Quebecor Printing Providence, Inc., 270 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); Hospital Del Maestro v. NLRB, 263 F.3d 173, 175 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (per curiam).\n\n          Moreover, among the factors enumerated in Pioneer, by far\n\nthe most critical is the asserted reason for the mistake.                 See\n\nHospital Del Maestro, 263 F.3d at 175.              Here, Dimmitt’s counsel\n\nproffered two reasons for the lapse: (i) he was accustomed to\n\npracticing in the state-court system, and was having difficulty\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fadapting to “the speed of the [federal-court] system”; and (ii) he\n\nwas unfamiliar with the local district court rules relating to\n\nsummary judgment.      Neither explanation warrants relief.\n\n           Had Dimmitt’s counsel been experiencing difficulty in\n\nmeeting the 21-day deadline for submitting the opposition in a\n\ncompliant manner, he need simply have moved for an extension prior\n\nto its expiration, which could have been allowed under the more\n\nliberal    “good     cause”    or   “cause    shown”     standard.         See\n\nVenegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records, 370 F.3d 183, 187 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); accord Hamby v. Thomas Realty Assocs., 617 A.2d 562, 564\n\n(Me. 1992) (noting, in analogous context, that “‘good cause’\n\nstandard is less stringent than the . . . ‘excusable neglect’\n\nstandard”); cf. Me. R. Civ. P. 6(b).          Indeed, the district court\n\nalready had demonstrated its willingness to accommodate counsel’s\n\npurported lack of familiarity with one aspect of federal-court\n\npractice – the use of the electronic filing system – by granting\n\ncounsel’s request for an exemption from it.\n\n           Further, both the state and the federal rules prescribe\n\nthe identical 21-day deadline for filing an opposition to a summary\n\njudgment motion, see Me. Local R. 7(c) (2) & (3) (“Any party\n\nopposing   any     other   motion   shall   file   a   memorandum    and   any\n\nsupporting affidavits or other documents in opposition to the\n\nmotion not later than 21 days after the filing of the motion,\n\nunless another time is set by the court. . . . A party failing to\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\ffile a timely memorandum in opposition to a motion shall be deemed\n\nto have waived all objections to the motion.”), and counsel never\n\nexplained how he could have been overwhelmed by federal summary\n\njudgment deadlines, yet not by identical state deadlines.\n\n            Finally, the requirement that the counterstatement of a\n\nparty   opposing   summary     judgment    must    reference    each   numbered\n\nparagraph of the moving party’s statement of material facts, and\n\nexpressly    admit,   deny    or   qualify   the   facts    alleged    therein,\n\nlikewise are identical in the federal rules and local state rules.\n\nThus, it is simply not plausible that counsel submitted this\n\nnoncompliant counterstatement of material facts because he would\n\nhave done so in the Maine Superior Court.\n\n            As Dimmitt’s counsel proffered no valid reason for the\n\nnoncompliance, the protestations of good faith and insistence that\n\ndefendants were not prejudiced by his mistake plainly do not\n\nsuffice     as   grounds     for   setting   aside    the      district   court\n\ndetermination that his mistake could not be considered “excusable\n\nneglect.”    See Hospital Del Maestro, 263 F.3d at 175 (noting that,\n\nsince the proffered reason for the mistake is the most pivotal\n\nfactor, a finding of bad faith is not a prerequisite to the\n\nconclusion that a party's neglect was inexcusable); Gucci Am., Inc.\n\nv. Gold Ctr. Jewelry, 158 F.3d 631, 635 (2d Cir. 1998) (same).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",

The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, as well as the required statement of material facts and supporting record citations. <i>See</i> Me. U.S. Dist. Ct. Local R. 56(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Dimmitt's counsel submitted a timely opposition to the motion, but the accompanying statement of material facts (setting forth his putative evidence relating to the use of excessive force) did not comply with Local Rule 56(c), which requires that the counterstatement expressly admit, deny or qualify each paragraph of the defendants' statement of material facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants filed a motion to strike the Dimmitt counterstatement as noncompliant with the local rules. Dimmitt's counsel responded that any noncompliance was due to \"excusable neglect,\" <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Difficult as it may be to admit, Plaintiff's counsel's failure to properly file an opposing statement of facts in dispute is based upon inexperience with the requirements of the District Court and unfamiliarity with the local rules. Counsel has not participated in a civil case in U.S. District Court for several years (but for a busy bankruptcy practice) and is attempting to get up to speed as soon as is humanly possible. Counsel has had extreme difficulties with everything from perfecting his ECF participation to keeping up with the speed of the system compared to that of the State court system, to which he is intimately acquainted. While his pleadings may not have been set forth in the required manner, Plaintiff has made a good-faith effort to show the Court that there are substantial disagreements regarding the facts of this case through the submission of his own Statement of Material Facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion to strike. Then, in the absence of a timely Rule 56(c) counterstatement demonstrating evidence of the use of excessive force, it proceeded to grant summary judgment for the defendants. Dimmitt now appeals from that judgment insofar as it rests upon the allowance of the defendants' motion to strike the counterstatement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruling that Dimmitt failed to demonstrate \"excusable neglect\" is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b); <i>Bennett v.

In so doing, we accord broad deference to the special role of the district court in administering its local procedural rules. <i>See Crowley v. L.L.

Dimmitt argues that his counsel presented credible reasons for his mistake, and that there exists no evidence either that his attorney acted in bad faith or that the 18-day delay in submitting a compliant counterstatement prejudiced the defendants' case. <i>See id.</i> at 395, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112835\"><a href=\"/opinion/112835/pioneer-investment-services-co-v-brunswick-associates-ltd-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We can discern no abuse of discretion, however, in the district court's equitable decision not to excuse the late filing by Dimmitt's counsel in the present circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as we have repeatedly held, \"even under the flexible standard prescribed by <i>Pioneer,</i>\" counsels' inattention or carelessness, such as a failure to consult or to abide by an unambiguous court procedural rule, normally does not constitute \"excusable neglect\". <i>See Pioneer,</i> 507 U.S. at 392, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112835\"><a href=\"/opinion/112835/pioneer-investment-services-co-v-brunswick-associates-ltd-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, Dimmitt's counsel proffered two reasons for the lapse: (i) he was accustomed to practicing in the state-court system, and was having difficulty adapting to \"the speed of the [federal-court] system\"; and (ii) he was unfamiliar with the local district court rules relating to summary judgment. Neither explanation warrants relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Dimmitt's counsel been experiencing difficulty in meeting the 21-day deadline for submitting the opposition in a compliant manner, he need simply have moved for an extension prior to its expiration, which could have been allowed under the more liberal \"good cause\" or \"cause shown\" standard. <i>See Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201052\"><a href=\"/opinion/201052/venegas-hernandez-v-sony/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 187 (1st Cir.2004); <i>accord Hamby v. Thomas Realty Assocs.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></span>, 564 (Me. 1992) (noting, in analogous context, that \"`good cause' standard is less stringent than the . . . `excusable neglect' standard\"); <i>cf.</i> Me. R. Civ. P. 6(b). Indeed, the district court already had demonstrated its willingness to accommodate counsel's purported lack of familiarity with one aspect of federal-court practice-the use of the electronic filing system-by granting counsel's request for an exemption from it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, both the state and the federal rules prescribe the identical 21-day deadline for filing an opposition to a summary judgment motion, <i>see</i> Me. Local R. 7(c)(2) &amp; (3) (\"Any party opposing any other motion shall file a memorandum and any supporting affidavits or other documents in opposition to the motion not later than 21 days after the filing of the motion, unless another time is set by the court.... A party failing to file a timely memorandum in opposition to a motion shall be deemed to have waived all objections to the motion.\"), and counsel never explained how he could have been overwhelmed by federal summary judgment deadlines, yet not by identical state deadlines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the requirement that the counterstatement of a party opposing summary judgment must reference each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts, and expressly admit, deny or qualify the facts alleged therein, likewise are identical in the federal rules and local state rules. Thus, it is simply not plausible that counsel submitted this noncompliant counterstatement of material facts because he would have done so in the Maine Superior Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Dimmitt's counsel proffered no valid reason for the noncompliance, the protestations of good faith and insistence that defendants were not prejudiced by his mistake plainly do not suffice as grounds for setting aside the district court determination that his mistake could not be considered \"excusable neglect.\" <i>See Hospital del Maestro,</i> 263 F.3d at 175 (noting that, since the proffered reason for the mistake is the most pivotal factor, a finding of bad faith is not a prerequisite to the conclusion that a party's neglect was inexcusable); <i>Gucci Am., Inc. v.
