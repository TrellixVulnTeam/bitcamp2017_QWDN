Thomas Bates appeals from the district\n\ncourt’s order dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244.   We affirm.\n\n               I.    Factual and Procedural History\n\n          In 1991, Bates was convicted by a Worcester Superior\n\nCourt jury on multiple charges of indecent assault and battery on\n\na child under the age of fourteen, indecent assault and battery on\n\na child over the age of fourteen, soliciting a child to pose in a\n\nstate of sexual conduct and soliciting a child to pose in a state\n\nof nudity.   Bates’s victims were his five adopted children.\n\n          Following an unsuccessful motion for new trial, Bates\n\nappealed his conviction.   The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed\n\nall but three of the charges against him, Commonwealth v. Bates, 37\n\nMass. App. Ct. 1114 (1994), and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (the “SJC”) denied Bates’s application for further appellate\n\nreview.   Commonwealth v. Bates, 419 Mass. 1103 (1995).\n\n          Bates then filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in the civil session of Worcester Superior Court. The court\n\ndismissed Bates’s petition, noting that under Massachusetts law,\n\nhabeas corpus relief is only available when the “petition . . . is\n\nbased on grounds distinct from the issues at the indictment, trial,\n\nconviction, or sentencing stage.”      Bates v. Marshall, CA No. 95-\n\n1143-C, slip op. at 3 (Mass. Super. Ct. Nov. 16, 1995) (quoting In\n\nre Averett, 404 Mass. 28, 30 (1989)).    Because the court concluded\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fthat all of Bates’s claims related directly to the indictment and\n\ntrial process, Bates was limited to relief available under Mass. R.\n\nCrim. P. 30.1     Bates moved for reconsideration, the court affirmed,\n\nand Bates appealed.\n\n              Nearly three years passed, during which it appears that\n\nthe record of Bates’s appeal was not assembled.            Tired of waiting\n\nfor a decision from the Massachusetts Appeals Court, Bates sought\n\nextraordinary relief from the Single Justice Session of the SJC\n\npursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, § 3.               He asked the court,\n\ninter alia, to nullify his conviction and sentence.                A Single\n\nJustice denied Bates’s petition, stating that extraordinary relief\n\n“is not available where the petitioner has or had adequate and\n\neffective avenues other than [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, § 3], by\n\nwhich    to    seek   and   obtain   the    requested   relief.”   Bates   v.\n\nCommonwealth, No. SJ-99-0279, Mem. & Order at 1 (Dec. 29, 1999)\n\n(quoting Hicks v. Comm’r of Corr., 425 Mass. 1014, 1014-15 (1997)).\n\n              Bates subsequently appealed to the full bench of the SJC,\n\nwhich affirmed.        Bates v. Commonwealth, 434 Mass. 1019, 1021\n\n(2001).       The SJC agreed that Chapter 211 relief should not be\n\ngranted because Bates could have sought relief through a Rule 30\n\nmotion.   Id. at 1020.      It rejected Bates’s argument that requiring\n\n\n     1\n      In addition to providing a procedure for seeking a new trial,\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30 allows a prisoner to seek relief from unlawful\nrestraint by filing a motion with the trial judge requesting\nrelease from custody or correction of his sentence. Mass. R. Crim.\nP. 30(a).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhim to seek Rule 30 relief “would effectively send him into a\n\n‘procedural maze,’” and deemed unfounded Bates’s concern that the\n\nCommonwealth might argue that dismissal of his habeas petition\n\nprecludes his bringing a Rule 30 motion on the same issues.                Id.\n\n(“The fact that Bates employed an improper means to seek review of\n\nhis claims would not by itself prevent him from now employing the\n\nproper means.”).     The SJC directed Bates “to seek relief through\n\nthe appropriate vehicle.”       Id. at 1021.\n\n            Rather than seek relief through Rule 30 as instructed by\n\nthe SJC, Bates brought his claims to federal court.                In August\n\n2001, Bates filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 2254.          Michael Grant, the respondent, moved to\n\ndismiss on the grounds that the petition was time-barred and that\n\nBates had failed to exhaust his state court remedies.               On August\n\n22, 2002,    the   district    court    denied   the   motion,   finding   the\n\npetition timely, but concluded that it was a “mixed petition”\n\ncontaining both exhausted and unexhausted claims.2               It dismissed\n\nthe unexhausted claims and stayed the petition to allow Bates an\n\nopportunity to file within six weeks an amended petition containing\n\nonly exhausted claims.        Instead of filing a new petition, Bates\n\nmoved for reconsideration.       In June 2003 the district court denied\n\n\n\n     2\n      The court found that only Bates’s claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel, which had been presented in his\napplication for leave to obtain further appellate review, was\nexhausted for the purposes of federal habeas proceedings.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthe motion.     Bates then moved for recusal of Judge Morris Lasker,\n\nthe presiding district court judge, in August 2003.     The district\n\ncourt denied the recusal motion as moot and dismissed Bates’s\n\nhabeas petition on the ground that he had failed to file an amended\n\npetition as instructed in the court’s August 2002 decision.     This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                            II.   Analysis\n\nA.        Dismissal of the Petition\n\n          The gravamen of Bates’s appeal is his contention that the\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that most of his habeas claims\n\nwere unexhausted.     He asserts that his numerous post-conviction\n\npleadings in the courts of Massachusetts satisfied the exhaustion\n\nrequirement.3    He faults the district court for failing to consider\n\nthe substance of the pleadings, and for focusing instead on how the\n\npleadings were labeled.\n\n          Despite the twists and turns in the procedural history of\n\nthis case, we think the central issue is straightforward.         In\n\nMassachusetts, one must use Rule 30 to seek post-conviction relief\n\n\n     3\n      Bates also contends that the state court system failed to\ncompile the record of his case during his appeal in the state\nhabeas corpus proceeding, causing an unjustifiable delay that\nexcused his failure to exhaust state remedies. Bates Br. at 14\n(citing Hall v. DiPaolo, 986 F.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam)).\nEven if, on the basis of Bates’s bare allegations, we were to\nconclude that the state court system caused a delay in review, this\nwould not affect our analysis. As Bates’s counsel conceded at oral\nargument, the delay was caused in part by Bates’s failure to use\nthe proper procedural vehicle to seek relief. We do not conclude\nthat the delay was unjustifiable on these facts.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fpertaining to errors in an indictment, a trial, or other issues\n\ntypically       raised     in   a   habeas          corpus     petition     in   other\n\njurisdictions.4        We do not doubt that this could cause procedural\n\nconfusion for a petitioner, particularly one who seeks relief pro\n\nse.       We   note,     however,   that       on   at   least      two   occasions   a\n\nMassachusetts court informed Bates that the relief he sought could\n\nonly be obtained through a Rule 30 motion.                   Bates never filed such\n\na motion.      Instead, Bates turned to federal habeas proceedings for\n\nrelief. On these facts, there can be no question that the district\n\ncourt properly dismissed the claims that the SJC had already\n\ndetermined to be defective.           It is not for us to recast Bates’s\n\npost-conviction        pleadings    in     a    manner       that   satisfies    state\n\nexhaustion requirements when the highest court in Massachusetts\n\ndeclined to do so.\n\n               Bates fails to argue that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in dismissing his petition because he failed to file an\n\namended petition.         Relying instead on a claim of actual innocence\n\nand a purported “showing that he is entitled to habeas corpus\n\nrelief,” Bates urges us to find that the dismissal of the petition\n\nwas the culmination of a series of erroneous actions by the\n\n\n      4\n      With the passage of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal\nProcedure in 1979, Rule 30 became the “exclusive vehicle for\npostconviction relief.” In re McCastle, 401 Mass. 105, 106 (1987).\nThe Commonwealth’s habeas corpus statute was amended to reflect\nthis change, and the remedies of writ of error and writ of habeas\ncorpus, once separate procedural mechanisms, were consolidated in\nRule 30 with the motion for new trial. See id. at 106-07.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdistrict court and was therefore incorrect.      We find no merit in\n\nthese arguments.    Nor do we discern any other error in the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal of the petition.5\n\nB.        Bates’s Other Claims\n\n          Bates presents three other challenges to the district\n\ncourt’s judgment.    We discuss each in turn.\n\n          First, Bates contends that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in allowing the respondent to file a belated motion to\n\ndismiss. The respondent, represented by the Office of the Attorney\n\nGeneral of Massachusetts, filed his motion on April 11, 2002, more\n\nthan a month after the deadline set by the district court.    In the\n\ninterim, the court had granted Bates’s motion to bar any motion to\n\ndismiss filed after March 16, 2002.        The respondent moved for\n\nacceptance of the late filing, stating in an affidavit of counsel\n\nthat counsel’s voluminous case load prevented a timely filing in\n\nthis case.   The district court acknowledged that Bates had made a\n\nstrong argument that the delay was not a product of “excusable\n\nneglect” under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b), but concluded that a failure\n\nto deal with the merits of the respondent’s defense would be\n\nirresponsible.     The court warned the respondent’s counsel that\n\nfuture delays would be subject to sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Because we conclude that the petition was properly dismissed\non the grounds stated by the district court, we do not reach the\nrespondent’s argument that the petition was also time-barred.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           Bates   alleges   that    accepting   the    late    filing     was\n\nerroneous because the respondent made no showing of “unique or\n\nunusual circumstances” justifying the delay.            But the excusable\n\nneglect standard is not so unforgiving after Pioneer Investment\n\nServices Co. v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership, 507 U.S.\n\n380 (1993).    There, the Supreme Court found that courts may accept\n\nlate filings “caused by inadvertence, mistake, or carelessness, as\n\nwell as by intervening circumstances beyond the party’s control.”\n\nPioneer, 507 U.S. at 388; see also Graphic Communications Int’l\n\nUnion v. Quebecor Printing Providence, Inc., 270 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st\n\nCir.   2001)   (acknowledging    Pioneer’s   shift     to   a   standard    of\n\nexcusable neglect that “encompasses not just unavoidable omissions,\n\nbut also negligent ones”).      Equitable considerations should inform\n\nwhether a lapse constitutes excusable neglect.          Among the factors\n\na court should consider are “the danger of prejudice to the [non-\n\nmoving party], the length of the delay and its potential impact on\n\njudicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether\n\nit was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the\n\nmovant acted in good faith.”        Graphic Communications, 270 F.3d at\n\n5 (quoting Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395).         Although critical of the\n\nrespondent’s reasons for delay, Bates has not argued that any of\n\nthe other equitable factors tip the scales in his direction.                We\n\ntherefore find no basis for concluding that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in allowing the late motion.          Cf. id. at 6-7\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f(noting, in case where trial court found delay not to have been\n\ncaused by excusable neglect, “we will not meddle unless we are\n\npersuaded that some exceptional justification exists”).\n\n            Second, Bates contends that the presiding judge erred in\n\ndeclining to recuse himself. In his motion for recusal Bates cited\n\n28 U.S.C. § 455(a), a provision that requires a judge to disqualify\n\nhimself    “in    any   proceeding    in    which   his   impartiality   might\n\nreasonably be questioned.”           The district court’s denial of his\n\nmotion will be sustained unless we find that it “cannot be defended\n\nas a rational conclusion supported by [a] reasonable reading of the\n\nrecord.”    United States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(quoting In re United States, 158 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n            Bates’s motion and supporting affidavit fall far short of\n\nthe mark.        Bates alleges that Judge Lasker had been negatively\n\ninfluenced by the underlying allegations against Bates and that\n\nthis prejudice resulted in “extended confinement of an innocent\n\nperson.” But Bates’s affidavit relies on “unsupported accusations”\n\nand “unfounded surmise,” United States, 158 F.3d at 30, and is\n\ntherefore patently insufficient.            None of the allegations in the\n\naffidavit provides a reasonable basis for doubting Judge Lasker’s\n\nimpartiality.6      See In re United States, 666 F.2d 690, 695 (1st\n\n     6\n      Bates’s examples of Judge Lasker’s purported prejudice\nincluded the court’s failure to identify “any set of facts or\ncircumstances to support the allegations” against Bates; its focus\non Bates’s procedural defaults despite “authority that procedural\nbars are to be ignored upon a claim of actual and legal innocence”;\nand its allowance of the respondent’s late motion to dismiss.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fCir. 1991)(“Were less required, . . . a litigant could avoid\n\nadverse decisions by alleging the slightest of factual bases for\n\nbias.”).\n\n             Finally, Bates alleges a catchall “global failure” of the\n\ndistrict court to “accomplish the purposes of habeas corpus” in\n\nruling on his petition.       But the only potential argument advanced\n\nin this section of Bates’s brief is the unelaborated assertion that\n\nthe district court erred in deciding the petition “in favor of\n\nprocedural considerations” because Bates had asserted his actual\n\nand legal innocence.         Giving Bates the benefit of a generous\n\nreading of his brief, we conclude that he construes Schlup v. Delo,\n\n513   U.S.   295   (1995),   to   stand   for   the    proposition   that   all\n\nprocedural defaults are to be ignored in the event one claims\n\nactual innocence. This is too expansive a reading of Schlup, which\n\napplied only to a “narrow class of cases.”            See 513 U.S. at 314-25.\n\nAnd we cannot tell whether Bates’s actual innocence claim falls\n\nwithin this class of cases because Bates has failed to brief it.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f",

Laws ch. 211, § 3], by\n\nwhich    to    seek   and   obtain   the    requested   relief.”   Bates   v.\n\nCommonwealth, No. SJ-99-0279, Mem. & Order at 1 (Dec. 29, 1999)\n\n(quoting Hicks v.

The SJC agreed that Chapter 211 relief should not be\n\ngranted because Bates could have sought relief through a Rule 30\n\nmotion.   Id. at 1020.      It rejected Bates’s argument that requiring\n\n\n     1\n      In addition to providing a procedure for seeking a new trial,\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30 allows a prisoner to seek relief from unlawful\nrestraint by filing a motion with the trial judge requesting\nrelease from custody or correction of his sentence. Mass. R.

Id.\n\n(“The fact that Bates employed an improper means to seek review of\n\nhis claims would not by itself prevent him from now employing the\n\nproper means.”).     The SJC directed Bates “to seek relief through\n\nthe appropriate vehicle.”       Id. at 1021.\n\n            Rather than seek relief through Rule 30 as instructed by\n\nthe SJC, Bates brought his claims to federal court.                In August\n\n2001, Bates filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 2254.          Michael Grant, the respondent, moved to\n\ndismiss on the grounds that the petition was time-barred and that\n\nBates had failed to exhaust his state court remedies.               On August\n\n22, 2002,    the   district    court    denied   the   motion,   finding   the\n\npetition timely, but concluded that it was a “mixed petition”\n\ncontaining both exhausted and unexhausted claims.2               It dismissed\n\nthe unexhausted claims and stayed the petition to allow Bates an\n\nopportunity to file within six weeks an amended petition containing\n\nonly exhausted claims.        Instead of filing a new petition, Bates\n\nmoved for reconsideration.       In June 2003 the district court denied\n\n\n\n     2\n      The court found that only Bates’s claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel, which had been presented in his\napplication for leave to obtain further appellate review, was\nexhausted for the purposes of federal habeas proceedings.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthe motion.     Bates then moved for recusal of Judge Morris Lasker,\n\nthe presiding district court judge, in August 2003.     The district\n\ncourt denied the recusal motion as moot and dismissed Bates’s\n\nhabeas petition on the ground that he had failed to file an amended\n\npetition as instructed in the court’s August 2002 decision.     This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                            II.   Analysis\n\nA.        Dismissal of the Petition\n\n          The gravamen of Bates’s appeal is his contention that the\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that most of his habeas claims\n\nwere unexhausted.     He asserts that his numerous post-conviction\n\npleadings in the courts of Massachusetts satisfied the exhaustion\n\nrequirement.3    He faults the district court for failing to consider\n\nthe substance of the pleadings, and for focusing instead on how the\n\npleadings were labeled.\n\n          Despite the twists and turns in the procedural history of\n\nthis case, we think the central issue is straightforward.         In\n\nMassachusetts, one must use Rule 30 to seek post-conviction relief\n\n\n     3\n      Bates also contends that the state court system failed to\ncompile the record of his case during his appeal in the state\nhabeas corpus proceeding, causing an unjustifiable delay that\nexcused his failure to exhaust state remedies. Bates Br. at 14\n(citing Hall v. DiPaolo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600393\"><a href=\"/opinion/600393/herman-hall-jr-v-superintendent-paul-l-dipaolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam)).\nEven if, on the basis of Bates’s bare allegations, we were to\nconclude that the state court system caused a delay in review, this\nwould not affect our analysis. As Bates’s counsel conceded at oral\nargument, the delay was caused in part by Bates’s failure to use\nthe proper procedural vehicle to seek relief. We do not conclude\nthat the delay was unjustifiable on these facts.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fpertaining to errors in an indictment, a trial, or other issues\n\ntypically       raised     in   a   habeas          corpus     petition     in   other\n\njurisdictions.4        We do not doubt that this could cause procedural\n\nconfusion for a petitioner, particularly one who seeks relief pro\n\nse.       We   note,     however,   that       on   at   least      two   occasions   a\n\nMassachusetts court informed Bates that the relief he sought could\n\nonly be obtained through a Rule 30 motion.                   Bates never filed such\n\na motion.      Instead, Bates turned to federal habeas proceedings for\n\nrelief. On these facts, there can be no question that the district\n\ncourt properly dismissed the claims that the SJC had already\n\ndetermined to be defective.           It is not for us to recast Bates’s\n\npost-conviction        pleadings    in     a    manner       that   satisfies    state\n\nexhaustion requirements when the highest court in Massachusetts\n\ndeclined to do so.\n\n               Bates fails to argue that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in dismissing his petition because he failed to file an\n\namended petition.         Relying instead on a claim of actual innocence\n\nand a purported “showing that he is entitled to habeas corpus\n\nrelief,” Bates urges us to find that the dismissal of the petition\n\nwas the culmination of a series of erroneous actions by the\n\n\n      4\n      With the passage of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal\nProcedure in 1979, Rule 30 became the “exclusive vehicle for\npostconviction relief.” In re McCastle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 (1987).\nThe Commonwealth’s habeas corpus statute was amended to reflect\nthis change, and the remedies of writ of error and writ of habeas\ncorpus, once separate procedural mechanisms, were consolidated in\nRule 30 with the motion for new trial. See id. at 106-07.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdistrict court and was therefore incorrect.      We find no merit in\n\nthese arguments.    Nor do we discern any other error in the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal of the petition.5\n\nB.        Bates’s Other Claims\n\n          Bates presents three other challenges to the district\n\ncourt’s judgment.    We discuss each in turn.\n\n          First, Bates contends that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in allowing the respondent to file a belated motion to\n\ndismiss. The respondent, represented by the Office of the Attorney\n\nGeneral of Massachusetts, filed his motion on April 11, 2002, more\n\nthan a month after the deadline set by the district court.    In the\n\ninterim, the court had granted Bates’s motion to bar any motion to\n\ndismiss filed after March 16, 2002.        The respondent moved for\n\nacceptance of the late filing, stating in an affidavit of counsel\n\nthat counsel’s voluminous case load prevented a timely filing in\n\nthis case.   The district court acknowledged that Bates had made a\n\nstrong argument that the delay was not a product of “excusable\n\nneglect” under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b), but concluded that a failure\n\nto deal with the merits of the respondent’s defense would be\n\nirresponsible.     The court warned the respondent’s counsel that\n\nfuture delays would be subject to sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Because we conclude that the petition was properly dismissed\non the grounds stated by the district court, we do not reach the\nrespondent’s argument that the petition was also time-barred.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           Bates   alleges   that    accepting   the    late    filing     was\n\nerroneous because the respondent made no showing of “unique or\n\nunusual circumstances” justifying the delay.            But the excusable\n\nneglect standard is not so unforgiving after Pioneer Investment\n\nServices Co. v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112835\"><a href=\"/opinion/112835/pioneer-investment-services-co-v-brunswick-associates-ltd-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).    There, the Supreme Court found that courts may accept\n\nlate filings “caused by inadvertence, mistake, or carelessness, as\n\nwell as by intervening circumstances beyond the party’s control.”\n\nPioneer, 507 U.S. at 388; see also Graphic Communications Int’l\n\nUnion v. Quebecor Printing Providence, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199646\"><a href=\"/opinion/199646/graphic-communicatio-v-quebecor-printing/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5-6 (1st\n\nCir.   2001)   (acknowledging    Pioneer’s   shift     to   a   standard    of\n\nexcusable neglect that “encompasses not just unavoidable omissions,\n\nbut also negligent ones”).      Equitable considerations should inform\n\nwhether a lapse constitutes excusable neglect.          Among the factors\n\na court should consider are “the danger of prejudice to the [non-\n\nmoving party], the length of the delay and its potential impact on\n\njudicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether\n\nit was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the\n\nmovant acted in good faith.”        Graphic Communications, 270 F.3d at\n\n5 (quoting Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395).         Although critical of the\n\nrespondent’s reasons for delay, Bates has not argued that any of\n\nthe other equitable factors tip the scales in his direction.                We\n\ntherefore find no basis for concluding that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in allowing the late motion.          Cf. id. at 6-7\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f(noting, in case where trial court found delay not to have been\n\ncaused by excusable neglect, “we will not meddle unless we are\n\npersuaded that some exceptional justification exists”).\n\n            Second, Bates contends that the presiding judge erred in\n\ndeclining to recuse himself. In his motion for recusal Bates cited\n\n28 U.S.C. § 455(a), a provision that requires a judge to disqualify\n\nhimself    “in    any   proceeding    in    which   his   impartiality   might\n\nreasonably be questioned.”           The district court’s denial of his\n\nmotion will be sustained unless we find that it “cannot be defended\n\nas a rational conclusion supported by [a] reasonable reading of the\n\nrecord.”    United States v. Snyder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(quoting In re United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198168\"><a href=\"/opinion/198168/in-re-usa-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n            Bates’s motion and supporting affidavit fall far short of\n\nthe mark.        Bates alleges that Judge Lasker had been negatively\n\ninfluenced by the underlying allegations against Bates and that\n\nthis prejudice resulted in “extended confinement of an innocent\n\nperson.” But Bates’s affidavit relies on “unsupported accusations”\n\nand “unfounded surmise,” United States, 158 F.3d at 30, and is\n\ntherefore patently insufficient.            None of the allegations in the\n\naffidavit provides a reasonable basis for doubting Judge Lasker’s\n\nimpartiality.6      See In re United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398012\"><a href=\"/opinion/398012/in-re-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 695 (1st\n\n     6\n      Bates’s examples of Judge Lasker’s purported prejudice\nincluded the court’s failure to identify “any set of facts or\ncircumstances to support the allegations” against Bates; its focus\non Bates’s procedural defaults despite “authority that procedural\nbars are to be ignored upon a claim of actual and legal innocence”;\nand its allowance of the respondent’s late motion to dismiss.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fCir. 1991)(“Were less required, . . . a litigant could avoid\n\nadverse decisions by alleging the slightest of factual bases for\n\nbias.”).\n\n             Finally, Bates alleges a catchall “global failure” of the\n\ndistrict court to “accomplish the purposes of habeas corpus” in\n\nruling on his petition.       But the only potential argument advanced\n\nin this section of Bates’s brief is the unelaborated assertion that\n\nthe district court erred in deciding the petition “in favor of\n\nprocedural considerations” because Bates had asserted his actual\n\nand legal innocence.         Giving Bates the benefit of a generous\n\nreading of his brief, we conclude that he construes Schlup v. Delo,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">295</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1995),   to   stand   for   the    proposition   that   all\n\nprocedural defaults are to be ignored in the event one claims\n\nactual innocence. This is too expansive a reading of Schlup, which\n\napplied only to a “narrow class of cases.”            See 513 U.S. at 314-25.\n\nAnd we cannot tell whether Bates’s actual innocence claim falls\n\nwithin this class of cases because Bates has failed to brief it.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f</pre>",
