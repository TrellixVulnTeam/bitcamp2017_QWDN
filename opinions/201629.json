This case is part of a\n\nlengthy   dispute   between   Plaintiff-Appellant    Diva's,   Inc.\n\n(\"Diva's\"), an adult entertainment bar located in Bangor, Maine,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant Dianne Cormier-Youngs, the owner of Diva's, and\n\nAppellee City of Bangor, Maine.        Also involved in the instant\n\naction are various Bangor government officials in their official\n\nand individual capacities (collectively, \"Individual Appellees\").\n\nWe decide today an appeal from two district court orders which\n\ntogether dismissed all of Appellants' claims, affirming in part and\n\nreversing and remanding in part.\n\n                     I.   STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n\n          There are several ordinances and statutes involved in\n\nthis dispute.    The first is Bangor City Code (\"Bangor Code\")\n\nChapter 228 on Public Morals.      Chapter 228 contains a provision\n\nthat regulates the location of commercial establishments offering\n\nnude dancing.   See Bangor Code § 228-14.     That section provides\n\nthat establishments offering nude entertainment can only be located\n\nin certain zoned districts, and that operators of a commercial\n\nestablishment offering nude entertainment must obtain a certificate\n\nof occupancy, which will not be granted if the establishment is\n\nlocated within 500 feet of a litany of establishments including:\n\nanother nude entertainment establishment, an establishment licensed\n\nto sell alcohol, a church, school, public park, public library, or\n\nresidentially-zoned district.1   Diva's cannot obtain a certificate\n\n\n     1\n        \"Nude entertainment\" is defined in the Bangor Code as \"Any\ndisplay of live persons in a state of nudity, or in a visible state\n\n                                 -2-\n\fof occupancy without a variance as it is located within 500 feet of\n\na church.2        Chapter 228 also regulates the operation of nude\n\nestablishments by prohibiting such establishments from serving\n\nalcohol.    See Bangor Code § 228-15(c).\n\n            The second provision of the Bangor Code at issue here\n\napplies to establishments that sell alcohol in conjunction with the\n\nprovision of non-nude entertainment.                See Bangor Code Chapter 61.\n\nA liquor licensee desiring to have live entertainment, that is,\n\ndancing or music performed by something other than a mechanical\n\ndevice, must apply for a special amusement permit pursuant to\n\nArticle    II    of   Chapter    61   of    the    Bangor    Code.3     Although   an\n\napplicant       may   properly   seek      a     special    amusement   permit     for\n\n\"dancing,\" the dancing cannot be \"nude entertainment,\" as defined\n\n\n\nof sexual excitement whether or not clothed.\" Bangor Code § 228-\n13(B). The Bangor Code defines \"Nudity\" as \"The showing of the\nhuman male or female genitals, pubic area or buttocks or the female\nbreast below the top of the nipple . . . .\" Bangor Code § 228-2.\nThe Bangor Code section regulating the conduct of commercial\nestablishments offering nude entertainment further provides that\n\"Nude entertainment presented in a commercial establishment shall\nnot include any showing of the male or female genitals, pubic area,\nperineum or anus of any person with less than a fully opaque\ncovering.\" Bangor Code § 228-15(G).\n     2\n      Although both parties discuss the zoning problem as arising\nbecause Diva's is next door to a church, the record indicates that\nDiva's is also located in the \"Downtown District,\" which is not one\nof the permitted zones for nude entertainment, and apparently is\nalso located within 500 feet of a residentially-zoned district and\nan establishment that sells alcohol.\n     3\n      Bangor Code section 61-17 provides: \"No licensee for the sale\nof liquor to be consumed on his or her licenses premises shall\npermit on such licensed premises . . . any music, except a radio or\nmechanical device, any dancing or entertainment of any sort unless\nthe licensee shall have first obtained a special amusement permit\napproved by the City Council.\"\n\n                                           -3-\n\fby Bangor Code Chapter 228.     This means, in essence, that female\n\ndancers in an establishment that serves alcohol must, in addition\n\nto not violating the provisions of Chapter 228, have their buttocks\n\nand the areola area of their breasts covered with an opaque\n\ncovering.4\n\n             With this background in mind, we turn to the history of\n\nDiva's.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n         Bangor Code section 61-17(c) provides:\n\nC.  Live entertainment regulated.\n     (1) No licensee shall permit entertainment on the licensed\n     premises . . . when the entertainment involves:\n           (a) The performance of acts or simulated acts of sexual\n           intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, beastiality [sic],\n           oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which\n           are prohibited by law.*\n           (b) The actual or simulated touching, caressing or\n           fondling on the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals.*\n           (c) The actual or simulated displaying of the genitals,\n           pubic hair, buttocks, anus or any portion of the female\n           breasts at or below the areola area thereof.\n           (d) The permitting by any licensee of any person to\n           remain in or upon the licensed premises who exposes to\n           any public view any portion of his or her genitals or\n           anus.\n     (2) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"displaying\"\n     or \"expose\" shall mean unclothed or uncostumed and not covered\n     by a fully opaque material.\n*It appears that nude dancing establishments operating with a\ncertificate of occupancy issued pursuant to Section 228-14 are also\nprohibited from offering entertainment involving these acts. See\nBangor Code §§ 228-2, 228-15(F).\n\n                                  -4-\n\f                         II.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND5\n\n              Diva's opened as nude dancing establishment and juice bar\n\nin 1996.      In 1999, Bangor amended Chapter 228 of the Bangor Code to\n\nadd, inter alia, the provision prohibiting nude entertainment\n\nestablishments from being located within 500 feet of a church.\n\nBecause Diva's is located next to a church, it is unable to obtain\n\na certificate of occupancy without being granted a variance.6\n\nDiva's challenged the ordinance in the Maine Superior Court and\n\nlost.       Diva's appealed the Superior Court decision, but entered\n\ninto a settlement agreement (\"settlement agreement\") before the\n\nappeal was decided.        In the settlement agreement, the City of\n\nBangor gave Diva's the right to continue to operate as a nude\n\ndancing establishment, essentially in violation of the new Section\n\n228-14, until May 31, 2001.       In return, Diva's agreed to withdraw\n\nthe appeal, cease nude dancing on its premises on or before May 31,\n\n2001, and to never challenge the constitutionality or validity of\n\nBangor Code Chapter 228 as written at the time of the settlement in\n\nany forum.\n\n              In anticipation of the May 31, 2001 deadline, Diva's\n\nbegan the process of converting into a \"bikini lounge\"; that is, an\n\nestablishment that would serve alcohol in conjunction with bikini-\n\n\n\n     5\n      The Appellants devote approximately one, double-spaced page\nin their Opening Brief to their \"Statement of Facts.\" Thus, we are\nforced to glean the pertinent facts from the complaint, the\ndistrict court's orders of dismissals, and the Appellees' Brief.\n        6\n      Neither party discusses whether the revised Chapter 228\ncontained a grandfather clause that might have applied to Diva's.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fclad dancing.7    Diva's applied for a liquor license and special\n\namusement permit which would allow it to provide live dancing and\n\nmusical entertainment in conjunction with the provision of alcohol.\n\n           On May 30, 2001, as part of the permitting process, the\n\nCity Council of Bangor (\"City Council\") held a public hearing.\n\nAlthough the City Council approved the permit for the liquor\n\nlicense, it denied the special amusement permit.             As entitled by\n\nstatute, Diva's requested a written explanation of the reasoning\n\nfor the denial of the special amusement permit, and the City\n\nCouncil responded by stating in writing that it was concerned that\n\nthe \"bikini lounge\" would soon revert back to a nude dancing\n\nestablishment in violation of Sections 228-14 and 61-17 of the\n\nBangor Code, and that granting the permit would negatively affect\n\npublic health, safety and welfare.\n\n           In   response,   Diva's    and   Cormier-Youngs    appealed   the\n\ndecision of the City Council to the Bangor Board of Appeals and\n\nfiled a federal lawsuit against the City of Bangor in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Maine (\"federal district\n\ncourt\").   On June 20, 2001, the Bangor Board of Appeals reversed\n\nthe decision of the City Council and on June 21, 2001, issued an\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      There was an issue during the permitting process as to what\nis considered a \"bikini.\" Although the generic term \"bikini\" may\nimply that a \"G-string-type\" bottom qualifies as a \"bikini,\" there\nappears to be a consensus on the part of both parties on appeal\nthat a \"bikini\" is an article of clothing that covers the entire\nbuttock area, and the portion of the female breasts at or below the\nareola area.\n\n                                     -6-\n\forder    granting    the    special       amusement     permit   for   the       \"bikini\n\nlounge.\"8\n\n             One day later, on June 22, 2001, Diva's and Cormier-\n\nYoungs    invited     the        public    to     witness   an   \"act     of      civil\n\ndisobedience.\" When the invitees arrived, they observed the Diva's\n\ndancers     performing      in    \"pasties\"      and   \"G-string\"   underwear,        in\n\nviolation of Bangor Code Section 61-17 for liquor licensees because\n\nthe dancers exposed their buttocks.\n\n             The    City    of     Bangor       responded   by   filing      a     civil\n\nenforcement action against Diva's in the State of Maine District\n\nCourt (\"state district court\") for violating Bangor Code Sections\n\n228-14 and 61-17.          Diva's moved to dismiss, arguing, inter alia,\n\nthat Bangor Code Sections 228 and 61-17 as written violated the\n\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution.                         On\n\nAugust 29, 2001, the Maine District Court denied Diva's motion.\n\n             Diva's and Cormier-Youngs subsequently were permitted to\n\namend their federal complaint (\"amended complaint\") to include as\n\ndefendants the Mayor of Bangor and the City Council members who\n\nvoted against granting Diva's a special amusement permit.                            The\n\namended complaint also asserted:                 (1) a facial challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of Bangor Code Section 61-17 and several claims\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      In making this decision, the Bangor Board of Appeals was\nrequired to find that the City Council had acted \"arbitrarily and\ncapriciously\" in its denial of the permit. See Bangor Code § 61-24\n(\"The Board of Appeals may grant or reinstate the permit only if it\nfinds that the denial, imposition of restrictions or revocation or\nsuspension was arbitrary or capricious.\").\n\n                                           -7-\n\funder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (collectively, \"Count One\")9; (2) a state\n\nlaw breach of contract claim alleging that the City of Bangor had\n\nviolated the 1999 settlement agreement by denying the special\n\namusement permit (\"Count Two\"); (3) a claim alleging tortious\n\ninterference with Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' ability to contract\n\nwith \"talent, support staff and vendors\" (\"Count Three\"); (4) a\n\nclaim that Appellees had conspired to violate Diva's and Cormier-\n\nYoungs' constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985\n\n(\"Count Four\"); and (5) an intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claim on behalf of Cormier-Youngs individually (\"Count\n\nFive\").   The claims requested monetary, declarative, punitive and\n\ninjunctive relief.\n\n      9\n       \"Count One\" provides, in relevant part:\n\"3.   That the Bangor Code sec. 61-17 as written violates the\n      plaintiffs right of free expression under the 1st Amendment to\n      the U.S. Constitution.\n 4.   That the Bangor Code sec. 61-17 as written violates the\n      plaintiffs' substantive due process rights under the 14th\n      Amendment.\n 5.   That the Bangor Code is unconstitutionally vague. . . .\n13.   That the defendant, under color and guise of Maine State law,\n      unjustifiably[,] unreasonably, and intentionally refused to\n      issue a special amusement permit in violation of the\n      plaintiffs' 14th amendment substantive and procedural due\n      process right under the U.S. Constitution.\n14.   That the defendant under color and guise of Maine State law\n      arbitrarily and capriciously denied the issuance of a special\n      amusement permit to the plaintiff in violation of the\n      plaintiffs['] 1st Amendment Rights to Freedom of Speech. . .\n      .\n16.   That the defendant's ordinances are an unlawful prior\n      restraint on Free Speech in violation of the 1st Amendment of\n      the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\nAnd, although not explicitly stated in the amended complaint, the\ndistrict court interpreted Appellants' Section 1983 claim as being\nagainst the Individual Appellees in both their official and\nindividual capacities.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f              The City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees moved to\n\ndismiss, and, while the motion to dismiss was pending in federal\n\ncourt, trial was held on October 5, 2001 in the state court civil\n\nenforcement action against Diva's.              The state district court\n\ndecided in favor of the City of Bangor, and Diva's appealed the\n\ndecision to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.             On December 20,\n\n2001, the federal district court dismissed Diva's and Cormier-\n\nYoungs' claims contained in Counts Two (breach of contract), Three\n\n(tortious interference), Four (Section 1985 conspiracy), and Five\n\n(intentional infliction of emotional distress). The district court\n\nalso dismissed Appellants' Section 1983 claims contained in Count\n\nOne   against      the   Individual     Appellees   in     their    individual\n\ncapacities, and determined that Cormier-Youngs lacked standing to\n\npursue individually the Section 1983 claim portion of Count One.\n\nThis left only Diva's and Cormier-Young's facial challenge to\n\nBangor Code Section 61-17 and Diva's Section 1983 claim against the\n\nCity of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official\n\ncapacities.\n\n              As to Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' challenge to the facial\n\nconstitutionality        of   Bangor   Code   Section   61-17,     the   federal\n\ndistrict court raised the issue of Younger10 abstention sua sponte,\n\nand concluded that principles of comity dictate that it should\n\nabstain from deciding the facial constitutionality of the Bangor\n\nCode Section 61-17 because there was an ongoing state proceeding\n\nagainst Diva's to enforce that provision.               The court also found\n\n      10\n           Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthat comity dictated that it refrain from deciding whether Diva's\n\nhad given up the right to challenge the facial constitutionality of\n\nthe Bangor Code provisions by signing the settlement agreement.11\n\nThe court then dismissed the facial challenge portion of Count One.\n\n             As to Diva's Section 1983 challenge portion of Count One\n\nagainst the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their\n\nofficial capacities, the federal district court issued a stay\n\npending the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's decision in the state\n\ncourt enforcement proceeding.\n\n             On April 15, 2003, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\n\nissued     its   decision   in   the   enforcement   action   upholding   the\n\nconstitutionality of Bangor Code Sections 228-14 and 61-17, and\n\nfinding Diva's liable for violation of those provisions.           See City\n\nof Bangor v. Diva's, Inc., 830 A.2d 898 (Me. 2003).            On April 21,\n\n2003, the federal district court issued an order requesting the\n\nparties to file a \"short written submission\" discussing the effects\n\nof the state court decision on the remaining claim--Diva's Section\n\n1983 challenge against the City of Bangor and the Individual\n\nAppellees in their official capacities. The City of Bangor and the\n\nIndividual Appellees filed a submission, but Diva's declined to do\n\nso.\n\n\n\n\n      11\n       We note that, at times, both parties and the district court\nrefer to the Appellants' claims in federal court as related or\nagainst the \"Bangor code provisions\" in the plural, implying that\nthe Appellants are challenging both Bangor Code Sections 228-14 and\n61-17.     We note, however, that the amended complaint only\nreferences Bangor Code Section 61-17, and thus our analysis is\nconfined as such.\n\n                                       -10-\n\f           On June 3, 2003, the federal district court dismissed the\n\nremaining portion of Count One.         In ruling on that motion, the\n\nfederal district court stated that \"Plaintiff's federal free speech\n\nclaim can succeed 'only to the extent that the state court wrongly\n\ndecided the issues before it,'\" and \"[t]he Rooker-Feldman doctrine12\n\nprohibits district courts from ruling on federal claims where the\n\nruling would effectively defeat or negate a state judgment to which\n\nthe federal claimant was a party.\" The federal district court went\n\non to state that \"Diva's had ample opportunity to pursue its\n\nFourteenth Amendment objection to the licensing procedures before\n\nthe state court,\" and because it did not present its claims in the\n\nstate court proceeding, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine also precludes\n\nfederal court review.\n\n           Judgment entered in favor of Appellees on June 9, 2003,\n\nand Diva's and Cormier-Youngs filed this timely appeal of both the\n\nDecember 20, 2001 and June 3, 2003 orders of dismissal.\n\n                           II.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We engage in plenary review of the district court's\n\nallowance of a motion to dismiss, accepting all well-pleaded facts\n\nas true and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nAppellants.   Rockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 255 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).    We begin our review with the district court's order of\n\ndismissal dated December 20, 2001, leaving that order's discussion\n\nof Count One for last, and then conclude with our review of the\n\n\n     12\n      See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923); D.C.\nCourt of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983).\n\n                                 -11-\n\fdismissal of the remainder of Count One as contained in the June 3,\n\n2003 order.\n\nA.            Count Two:     Breach of Contract\n\n              The substance of the Appellants' breach of contract claim\n\nis that it was a breach of the settlement agreement for the City of\n\nBangor to deny Diva's application for a special amusement permit--\n\nthat is, that the Appellees breached their \"obligation not to\n\nfrustrate, retard, or disallow the plaintiff's ability to practice\n\nher art form, consistent with the terms of the agreement.\"                      On\n\nappeal, the Appellants raise only a procedural challenge to the\n\ndistrict court's order of dismissal:           they argue that the district\n\ncourt improperly dismissed their breach of contract claim because\n\nthe second amended complaint pled all the elements necessary to\n\nstate     a    claim   for   breach   of    contract     and    that    the   court\n\n\"transcended the applicable scope of review\" when it considered the\n\nsettlement document in rendering its decision on the motion to\n\ndismiss.       The Appellants are incorrect.\n\n               The City of Bangor attached a copy of the settlement\n\nagreement to its motion to dismiss.            And, although \"[o]rdinarily,\n\na court may not consider any documents that are outside of the\n\ncomplaint, or not expressly incorporated therein, unless the motion\n\nis converted into one for summary judgment,\" Alternative Energy,\n\nInc. v.

Co., 267 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n2001),    \"[u]nder     First   Circuit     precedent,    when    'a    complaint's\n\nfactual       allegations    are   expressly    linked    to--and       admittedly\n\ndependent upon--a document (the authenticity of which is not\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fchallenged),' then the court can review it upon a motion to\n\ndismiss.\"    Id. at 34 (quoting Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust\n\nCo., 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998)).            Here, the Appellants' claim\n\nthat the Appellees breached the settlement agreement is dependent\n\non the scope of the settlement agreement, and thus, that document\n\nwas properly considered by the district court.                   Furthermore, the\n\nsettlement agreement provides only that the City of Bangor would\n\npermit Diva's to operate as a nude entertainment establishment\n\nuntil May 31, 2001, in violation of the amended Bangor Code Section\n\n228.   There is nothing in the settlement agreement that explicitly\n\nor implicitly    creates a contract between the parties with regards\n\nto a special amusement permit. The Appellants have failed to state\n\nclaim for breach of contract.\n\nB.          Counts Three and Five:         State Tort Claims\n\n            Appellants next challenge the dismissal of the two state\n\ntort   claims   against     the   City     of    Bangor    and    the    Individual\n\nAppellees:   Count Three alleging tortious interference with Diva's\n\nand Cormier-Youngs' contracts with \"talent, support staff and\n\nvendors\"; and Count Five, alleging, on behalf of Cormier-Youngs\n\nonly, intentional infliction of emotional distress.                       We do not\n\naddress   the   substance    of   either        claim,    however,      because   the\n\ndistrict court correctly determined that all of the Appellees enjoy\n\nimmunity under the Maine Tort Claims Act.            See 14 M.R.S.A. §§ 8104-\n\nB(2), 8111(1)(B).     The Maine Tort Claims Act provides statutorily\n\ncreated absolute immunity for the City of Bangor and Individual\n\nAppellees    from   suit   for    claims    \"which       result[]    from    .    .   .\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f[u]ndertaking or failing to undertake any judicial or quasi-\n\njudicial act, including, but not limited to, the granting . . . or\n\nrefusal to grant . . . [a] permit.\"        Id.     The district court's\n\ndismissal of the state tort claims is affirmed.\n\nC.        Count Four:    Violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985\n\n          Appellants    next   allege   that    Appellees   conspired   to\n\nviolate their First and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights\n\nin violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3).           Section 1985(3) creates a\n\nprivate cause of action \"for injuries occasioned when 'two or more\n\npersons . . . conspire . . . for the purpose of depriving, either\n\ndirectly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal\n\nprotection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under\n\nthe laws.'\"   Burns v. State Police Ass'n of Mass., 230 F.3d 8, 12\n\nn.3 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)).          In Griffin v.\n\nBreckenridge, 403 U.S. 88 (1971), the Supreme Court clarified that\n\nin order to state a claim under Section 1985(3), the plaintiff\n\nmust, among other requirements, allege that the \"conspiratorial\n\nconduct of which he complains is propelled by 'some racial, or\n\nperhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.'\"\n\nAulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Griffin,\n\n403 U.S. at 102).\n\n          The district court, in dismissing Appellants' Section\n\n1985(3) claim, found that \"Plaintiffs fail to state class-based\n\nanimus on the part of Defendants, and indeed, the Court does not\n\nperceive any class into which the Plaintiffs might fall.\"               The\n\ndistrict court went on to find that even if it were to assume,\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\farguendo, that \"Plaintiffs had claimed that they belonged to a\n\nclass of purveyors of adult entertainment for 1985(3) purposes,\n\nthat class would be fatally indeterminate in that it is, at best,\n\na   'vague and amorphous' grouping of individuals.\"       On appeal,\n\nAppellants do not advance the argument that their class is one of\n\npurveyors of adult entertainment, and therefore we deem that\n\nargument waived.    See Van Haaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n\n989 F.2d 1, 7 n.6 (1st Cir. 1993) ([A]rguments neither presented to\n\nthe district court nor presented in appellant's opening brief on\n\nappeal [are] deem[ed] waived.\").        Instead, Appellants state in\n\ntheir Opening Brief that:\n\n     the complaint alleges that Ms. Cormier is a woman. Women\n     are a protected class of persons under § 1985(3).\n     Because the Court is obliged to draw all reasonable\n     inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the\n     Defendants, the Court erred in finding that the Plaintiff\n     fatally excluded reference to a protectable class.\n\n(Citation omitted.) In support of this argument against dismissal,\n\nAppellants cite to paragraph 25 of their amended complaint, which\n\nstates that:\n\n     the Plaintiff enjoys a right to free speech and\n     expression in the presentation and performance of her art\n     form of semi-nude dancing recognized under the First\n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Erie v.\n     Pap's A.M., TBDA \"KANDYLAND,\" 529 U.S. 277 (2000).\n\n(Emphasis added.)    We presume that it is Appellant Cormier-Youngs'\n\ncontention that by using the feminine possessive pronoun \"her\" in\n\nparagraph 25 of the amended complaint, she has alleged that the\n\nstate class-based animus she has suffered is a result of her being\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fa member of the class of \"women\" in general.13              We find this\n\nargument unpersuasive.\n\n           First, even under the most liberal of pleading standards,\n\nusing a possessive pronoun that signals that the Appellant Cormier-\n\nYoungs is a woman is insufficient to set forth an allegation that\n\nshe suffered class-based animus because she belongs to the class of\n\nwomen. Second, Appellant has failed to allege in her complaint any\n\nfacts that the Individual Appellees conspired against her because\n\nshe was a woman (as opposed to her being, for example, a purveyor\n\nof nude entertainment, regardless of her gender).       Appellants have\n\nfailed to state a claim under Section 1985(3).\n\nD.         Count One:    Section 1983 and Facial Challenge\n\n           As previously mentioned, the district court construed the\n\nAppellants' \"Count One\" as being comprised of two separate counts:\n\na    Section   1983     claim   and    a   challenge   to    the   facial\n\nconstitutionality of Section 61-17 of the Bangor Code.             In its\n\nDecember 20, 2001 order, the district court addressed first whether\n\nCount One of the complaint stated a claim under Section 1983\n\nagainst the Individual Appellees in their individual capacities,\n\nand concluded in the negative.        The district court next addressed\n\nwhether Appellant Cormier-Youngs had standing in her personal\n\ncapacity to pursue a claim against the City of Bangor and the\n\nIndividual Appellees in their official capacities, and similarly\n\nconcluded in the negative.       This left only Diva's Section 1983\n\n\n      13\n      We also presume that Diva's has waived any argument that it\nbelongs to a protected class, as it alleges none.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fclaim against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in\n\ntheir     official   capacities   and    its   facial   challenge   to   the\n\nconstitutionality of the Bangor Code Section 61-17.\n\n             The district court then raised the issue of Younger\n\nabstention sua sponte and dismissed the facial challenge to the\n\nBangor Code under principles of comity.14            As to the remaining\n\nclaim, Diva's Section 1983 claim attacking the propriety of the\n\nCity Council's denial of its permit application, the district\n\ncourt, in its December 20, 2001 order, raised the issue of Colorado\n\nRiver abstention sua sponte,15 and stayed its decision of that claim\n\npending    the   outcome   of   the   state    enforcement   action.     The\n\nAppellants do not challenge on appeal the district court's decision\n\nto abstain from deciding the Section 1983 claim until after the\n\nstate court decision, and make no mention of the district court's\n\ndecision to exercise Younger abstention and dismiss the facial\n\nchallenge to Section 61-17.       Thus, we review de novo the district\n\n     14\n      See Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 53-54 (1971) (holding\nthat abstention was required where a plaintiff, who was defending\ncriminal charges in state court, sought to have the federal court\nenjoin the ongoing state criminal proceedings).      The principles\nbehind Younger abstention are \"grounded in notions of comity: the\nidea that the state courts should not, in certain circumstances, be\ninterfered with,\" Rio Grande Cmty Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan, 397\nF.3d 56, 68-69 (1st Cir. 2005), and the doctrine has been expanded\ninto the civil context. See Maymó-Meléndez v. Álvarez-Ramírez, 364\nF.3d, 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2004).\n     15\n      See Col. River Water Conservation Distr. v. United States,\n424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976) (holding that in \"extraordinary\ncircumstances,\" it may be appropriate for a federal court to\nabstain from exercising jurisdiction over an issue that is the\nsubject of a parallel state proceeding, for purposes of \"wise\njudicial administration, giving regard to conservation of judicial\nresources and comprehensive disposition of litigation.\") (quotation\nomitted).\n\n                                      -17-\n\fcourt's December 20, 2001 decision to (1) dismiss the claims\n\nagainst the Individual Appellants in their individual capacities;\n\n(2) dismiss Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff for lack of standing; and\n\nits June 3, 2003 decision to (3) dismiss the remaining Section 1983\n\nclaims under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.         We treat as waived any\n\nchallenges   Appellants   may   have   to   the   district   court's   (1)\n\ndismissal of the facial challenge to Section 61-17 under principles\n\nof Younger abstention and (2) the district court's decision to stay\n\nits decision on the Section 1983 claim until the Maine Supreme\n\nJudicial Court decided the City of Bangor's enforcement action\n\nagainst Diva's.    See, e.g., Smilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile\n\nSys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Issues raised on\n\nappeal in a perfunctory manner (or not at all) are waived.\").\n\n1.        Individual Appellees in their Individual Capacities\n\n          The district court found that the Individual Appellees\n\nenjoyed both absolute and qualified immunity for their actions\n\nduring the permitting process.    The district court's justification\n\nfor finding absolute immunity was that the City Council members had\n\nacted in both a quasi-judicial and legislative capacity.        We agree\n\nthat the officials enjoy absolute immunity from personal liability\n\nbecause they were acting in a quasi-judicial capacity when they\n\ndenied the special amusement permit, and thus, we do not need to\n\ndetermine whether the officials are qualifiedly immune for their\n\nactions or whether they are absolutely immune because their actions\n\nwere also legislative in nature.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f           We must take a \"functional approach\" to determining\n\nwhether the City Council members are absolutely immune from suit\n\nfor their denial of the special amusement permit.                  See Desetek\n\nGroup, Inc. v. State of N.H. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 318 F.3d 32, 40-41.\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).       And, even though the City Council members \"at\n\nvarious times may perform legislative, executive and judicial\n\nfunctions, each of which may entitle the official to a different\n\nlevel of immunity, the functional approach to immunity requires\n\nthat actions taken in the performance of a particular function are\n\nto be accorded the level of immunity appropriate to that function.\"\n\nBettencourt v. Bd. of Registration, 904 F.2d 772, 782 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (citing Scott v. Cent. Me. Power Co., 709 F. Supp. 1176, 1187\n\n(D. Me. 1989)) (emphasis in Scott).\n\n           In    Bettencourt,    904    F.2d    at   783,   we   described   the\n\nanalysis for determining whether an official has engaged in a\n\nquasi-judicial act:\n\n     Proper analysis involves answering three questions, each\n     designed to determine how closely analogous the\n     adjudicatory experience of a Board member is to that of\n     a judge.    First, does a Board member, like a judge,\n     perform a traditional \"adjudicatory\" function, in that he\n     decides facts, applies law, and otherwise resolves\n     disputes on the merits (free from direct political\n     influence)? Second, does a Board member, like a judge,\n     decide cases sufficiently controversial that, in the\n     absence of absolute immunity, he would be subject to\n     numerous damages actions? Third, does a Board member,\n     like a judge, adjudicate disputes against a backdrop of\n     multiple safeguards designed to protect [the complaining\n     party's] rights?\n\nHere,   first,   the   Council   members       performed    an   \"adjudicatory\"\n\nfunction when they reviewed and voted on Diva's special amusement\n\npermit:   they held a hearing, heard testimony, asked questions,\n\n                                       -19-\n\fdiscussed the matter, made their decision, and then provided a\n\nwritten explanation of their reasoning. Second, the act of denying\n\na special amusement permit can be controversial, and can prompt\n\nlitigation, as it did in this case.        Without the proper protection\n\nfrom personal liability, it would be extremely difficult to get\n\npeople to serve as City Council members.             Cf. Bogan v. Scott-\n\nHarris, 523 U.S. 44, 52 (1998) (\"[T]he threat of liability may\n\nsignificantly deter service in local government, where prestige and\n\npecuniary rewards may pale in comparison to the threat of civil\n\nliability.\"). Lastly, there are procedural safeguards that operate\n\nto protect a special amusement permit applicant from the violation\n\nof its constitutional rights. Indeed, this case presents a perfect\n\nexample:   Diva's exercised its statutory right to (1) request a\n\nwritten explanation of the reasons justifying the Council's denial\n\nof the special amusement permit, see Bangor Code § 61-21, and (2)\n\nappeal the decision to the Bangor Board of Appeals, see Bangor Code\n\n§ 61-24.   As a result of the appeal, the faulty decision of the\n\nCity   Council   was    reversed,   and    Diva's   received   its   special\n\namusement permit.      The process worked.    And, if Diva's had lost its\n\nappeal to the Bangor Board of Appeals, it had recourse to the Maine\n\nstate courts, see Bangor Code § 23-3H.\n\n           To the extent that the Appellants' amended complaint\n\nraises a claim against the Individual Appellees in their individual\n\ncapacities, the district court was correct to grant their motion to\n\ndismiss, because the City Council members are absolutely immune in\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\ftheir personal capacities from a suit arising from their denial of\n\nthe special amusement permit.\n\n2.        Corimer-Youngs' Lack of Standing\n\n          The district court next dismissed Cormier-Youngs as a\n\nplaintiff in the remaining Section 1983 claims.    \"Article III of\n\nthe Constitution confines the federal courts to deciding actual\n\ncases and controversies.\"   Cotter v. City of Boston, 323 F.3d 160,\n\n166 (1st Cir. 2003).   In order to establish Article III standing,\n\na plaintiff must have a \"personal stake in the outcome of the\n\ncontroversy.\"   Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962).       And,\n\n\"[a]ctions to enforce corporate rights or redress injuries to [a]\n\ncorporation cannot be maintained by a stockholder in his own name\n\n. . . even though the injury to the corporation may incidentally\n\nresult in the depreciation or destruction of the value of the\n\nstock.\"   Pignato v. Dein Host, Inc., 835 F.2d 402, 406 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (quoting Brictson v. Woodrough, 164 F.2d 107, 109 (8th Cir.\n\n1947)).   This standing rule applies even when there is only one\n\nshareholder in a corporation.   See id.   And, although we have not\n\nyet had the opportunity to explicitly state, we join the circuits\n\nwho have already addressed the issue to hold that this standing\n\nrequirement also applies to actions brought to redress injuries to\n\na corporation under Section 1983.   See Potthoff v. Morin, 245 F.3d\n\n710, 717 (8th Cir. 2001) (holding that the shareholder standing\n\nrule applies to civil rights actions brought pursuant to § 1983);\n\nFlynn v. Merrick, 881 F.2d 446, 450 (7th Cir. 1989) (holding that\n\n\"filing suit under § 1983 does not diminish the requirement that\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fthe shareholder suffer some individual, direct injury.\"); Gregory\n\nv.   Mitchell,   634   F.2d   199,   202    (5th   Cir.    1981)   (extending\n\nshareholder standing rule to civil rights actions under § 1983);\n\nErlich v. Glasner, 418 F.2d 226, 228 (9th Cir. 1969) (finding\n\n\"nothing in the Civil Rights Act\" which would permit a plaintiff-\n\nstockholder to circumvent the rule that \"even though a stockholder\n\nowns all, or practically all, of the stock in a corporation, such\n\na fact of itself does not authorize him to sue as an individual\").\n\n            Here,   Appellant   Cormier-Youngs      does    not    allege   any\n\ninjury, separate from the injury to Diva's, resulting from her\n\nclaim that the Appellees violated Section 1983 when they acted\n\nunder color of state law to deny Diva's the special amusement\n\npermit in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. As the\n\ndistrict court correctly determined, once it dismissed all but the\n\nSection 1983 claim of the second amended complaint, Appellant\n\nCormier-Youngs no longer had Article III standing.            We affirm the\n\ndismissal of Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff in the remaining Section\n\n1983 claim.\n\n3.          Section 1983 Claims\n\n            After the Maine Supreme Judicial Court rendered its\n\ndecision, the federal district court requested submissions on the\n\neffect of the decision on the pending federal case, and then\n\ndismissed the remaining Section 1983 claim under the Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine.   The federal district court held that the Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine prevented it from ruling on Diva's federal claim because\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fa decision in favor of Diva's would \"effectively defeat or negate\n\na state judgment to which the federal claimant was a party.\"\n\n            After this court heard argument and took this case under\n\nadvisement, the Supreme Court decided Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi\n\nBasic Indus. Corp., 125 S. Ct. 1517 (2005).                In Exxon Mobil, the\n\nSupreme   Court     cautioned   that    the     Rooker-Feldman      doctrine    \"is\n\nconfined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its\n\nname:    cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries\n\ncaused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court\n\nproceedings    commenced     and   inviting      district   court     review    and\n\nrejection of those judgments.\"            Id. at 1521-22.        And, the Court\n\nheld that \"neither Rooker nor Feldman supports the notion that\n\nproperly invoked concurrent jurisdiction vanishes if a state court\n\nreaches judgment on the same or related question while the case\n\nremains sub judice in a federal court.\"             Id. at 1527.\n\n            The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not apply in this case\n\nbecause    Diva's    filed   its   case    in    federal    court    before     the\n\nenforcement action was filed against it in state court.                        And,\n\nDiva's was not seeking an \"appeal\" of a state court judgment in\n\nfederal district court, but instead was, among other things,\n\nseeking redress for the City Council's arbitrary and capricious\n\ndenial of the special amusement permit for impermissible reasons.\n\nThus, it was an error for the district court to invoke the Rooker-\n\nFeldman doctrine to dismiss Appellant Diva's remaining Section 1983\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f            Our inquiry does not end, however, with the determination\n\nthat the federal district court erroneously invoked the Rooker-\n\nFeldman doctrine, as we may uphold the dismissal on any ground\n\nsupported by the record.    See Wilson v. Town of Mendon, 294 F.3d 1,\n\n10 n.23 (1st Cir. 2002).      In our review of whether there is an\n\nalternate    ground   to   support   the   dismissal,   we     find   our\n\njurisprudence on damages resulting from delays caused by the\n\nimproper denial of building permits instructive.              In Chiplin\n\nEnters. v. City of Lebanon, 712 F.2d 1524, 1526-28 (1st Cir. 1983),\n\nwe held that a building developer who had to wait five years\n\nbetween the denial of a building permit and the determination that\n\nthe permit had been improperly denied, could not state a Section\n\n1983 claim for deprivation of either substantive or procedural due\n\nprocess.     Taking all facts alleged as true, even though the\n\nplaintiff \"had met all legal requirements for the permit\" and \"the\n\ntown had no valid reason to reject the application\" and that\n\ndefendants \"maliciously den[ied] [plaintiff] a building permit for\n\ninvalid and illegal reasons and in bad faith,\" we held that the\n\nplaintiff could not state a valid Section 1983 claim.        Id. at 1526.\n\nWe found that even though the conduct complained of was concededly\n\ncarried out under the color of state law, the plaintiff could not\n\n\"identify a constitutional right of which [he] ha[d] been denied.\"\n\nId. at 1527.    This is because \"property is not denied without due\n\nprocess simply because a local planning board rejects a proposed\n\ndevelopment for erroneous reasons or makes demands which arguably\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fexceed its authority under the relevant state statutes.\"                   Creative\n\nEnv'ts, Inc. v. Estabrook, 680 F.2d 822, 832 n.9 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n            But, although an erroneous denial of a permit for the use\n\nof property does not amount to a denial of due process, it may, in\n\ncertain    circumstances,   \"give    rise       to       genuine    constitutional\n\nissues.\"   Chiplin, 712 F.2d at 1527.       In Packish v. McMurtrie, 697\n\nF.2d 23, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1983), we held that a firefighter who had\n\ninitially been denied reimbursement for medical expenses, allegedly\n\nin retaliation for his published criticism of town officials, and\n\nwho sought damages for the delay in receiving the reimbursement,\n\ncould not state a claim for denial of due process, but \"might have\n\nviable claims if [he] could in fact demonstrate that [he] was\n\ndenied indemnification in retaliation\" for his exercise of his\n\nFirst Amendment rights.        Similarly, in Manego v. Cape Cod Five\n\nCents Sav. Bank, 692 F.2d 174, 177 (1st Cir. 1982), we found that\n\nthe plaintiff had stated a claim under Section 1983 because he\n\nalleged that the reason for the denial of an entertainment license\n\nwas based on race--even though this was a claim the plaintiff\n\nultimately could not prove.      Furthermore, in Nestor Colon Medina &\n\nSucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 1992), we\n\nconsidered    \"whether   the    denial     of        a    land     use   permit   in\n\nunjustifiable retaliation for the applicant's expressions of his\n\npolitical views is a First Amendment violation,\" and found, at\n\nleast with respect to one of the plaintiff's claims, that summary\n\njudgment was inappropriate because plaintiff had \"stated a prima\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\ffacie case of denial in retaliation for his political expressions.\"\n\nId. at 41.\n\n             Here, even though Bangor Code Section 61-17 has been\n\ndetermined by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to be constitutional\n\non its face, and, even though Diva's cannot state a claim for a\n\nviolation of procedural or substantive due process, we believe that\n\nDiva's    has   stated   a    claim   that   the   City   of   Bangor   and   the\n\nIndividual Appellees in their official capacities acted under color\n\nof state law to deprive Diva's of its First Amendment right to\n\nfreedom of speech.       We caution, however, that the First Amendment\n\nright that is implicated here is not the right for Diva's to allow\n\nnude dancers on its premises,16 but for Diva's right, if any, to\n\noffer dancing that is consistent with the type of dancing permitted\n\nunder Section 61-17.         We also caution that if the district court on\n\nremand determines that the City Council did act arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously with the intent of depriving Diva's of its First\n\nAmendment right to free speech, the only available damages are\n\nthose incurred by Appellant Diva's during the three week period\n\nfrom when the City Council denied the permit, to when the Bangor\n\nBoard of Appeals reversed that decision and granted the permit. We\n\n\n\n\n     16\n      The   Maine   Supreme  Judicial   Court   has  upheld   the\nconstitutionality of Section 228-14 as a valid time, place, and\nmanner restriction on establishments offering nude entertainment,\nand, it appears that Diva's gave up the right to challenge the\nconstitutionality of Bangor Code Section 228-14 when it executed\nthe settlement agreement.     In any event, Diva's conceded at\nargument that it could not challenge the constitutionality of\nChapter 228 in this forum.\n\n                                      -26-\n\fexpress no opinion on whether Diva's can ultimately prove her\n\nclaim.\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n           The district court's order of dismissal of Appellant\n\nDiva's, Inc. and Appellant Cormier-Young's claims for (1) breach of\n\ncontract, (2) conspiracy to deprive under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), (3)\n\ntortious   interference     with   contractual    relations,   and   (4)\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress is AFFIRMED.            The\n\ndistrict court's order dismissing all claims against the Mayor and\n\nthe City Council members in their individual capacities and the\n\ndismissal of Appellant Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff in the Section\n\n1983 claims is AFFIRMED.     The district court's order of dismissal\n\nof Appellants' challenge to the facial constitutionality of Bangor\n\nCode Section 61-17 is AFFIRMED.           The district court's order of\n\ndismissal of Appellant Diva's claim that Appellees violated Section\n\n1983 by depriving it of its Fourteenth Amendment right to due\n\nprocess is AFFIRMED.      The district court's order of dismissal of\n\nAppellant Diva's claim that Appellees violated Section 1983 by\n\ndepriving it of its First Amendment right to free speech under\n\ncolor of state law is REVERSED and REMANDED to determine whether\n\nAppellant Diva's can show that the City Council members denied the\n\nspecial amusement permit with the intent to curtail Diva's First\n\nAmendment right to free speech.      And, as noted above, although we\n\ndo not express any opinion on the viability of Diva's claim, the\n\npotential damages, if any, are limited to the three-week period\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fbetween the denial of the permit by the City Council, and the\n\nreversal of that denial by the Bangor Board of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                              -28-\n\f",

(\"Diva's\"), an adult entertainment bar located in Bangor, Maine, Plaintiff-Appellant Dianne Cormier-Youngs, the owner of Diva's, and Appellee City of Bangor, Maine. Also involved in the instant action are various Bangor government officials in their official and individual capacities (collectively, \"Individual Appellees\"). We decide today an appeal from two district court orders which together dismissed all of Appellants' claims, affirming in part and reversing and remanding in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several ordinances and statutes involved in this dispute. The first is Bangor City Code (\"Bangor Code\") Chapter 228 on Public Morals. Chapter 228 contains a provision that regulates the location of commercial establishments offering nude dancing. <i>See</i> Bangor Code &#167; 228-14. That section provides that establishments offering nude entertainment can only be located in certain zoned districts, and that operators of a commercial establishment offering nude entertainment must obtain a certificate of occupancy, which will not be granted if the establishment is located within 500 feet of a litany of establishments including: another nude entertainment establishment, an establishment licensed to sell alcohol, a church, school, public park, public library, or residentially-zoned district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Diva's cannot obtain a certificate of occupancy without a variance as it is located within 500 feet of a church.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Chapter 228 also regulates the operation of nude establishments by prohibiting such establishments from serving alcohol. <i>See</i> Bangor Code &#167; 228-15(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second provision of the Bangor Code at issue here applies to establishments that sell alcohol in conjunction with the provision of non-nude entertainment. <i>See</i> Bangor Code Chapter 61. A liquor licensee desiring to have live entertainment, that is, dancing or music performed by something other than a mechanical device, must apply for a special amusement permit pursuant to Article II of Chapter 61 of the Bangor Code.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although an applicant may properly seek a special amusement permit for \"dancing,\" the dancing cannot be \"nude entertainment,\" as defined by Bangor Code Chapter 228. This means, in essence, that female dancers in an establishment that serves alcohol must, in addition to not violating the provisions of Chapter 228, have their buttocks and the areola area of their breasts covered with an opaque covering.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this background in mind, we turn to the history of Diva's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diva's opened as nude dancing establishment and juice bar in 1996. In 1999, Bangor amended Chapter 228 of the Bangor Code to add, <i>inter alia,</i> the provision prohibiting nude entertainment establishments from being located within 500 feet of a church. Because Diva's is located next to a church, it is unable to obtain a certificate of occupancy without being granted a variance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Diva's challenged the ordinance in the Maine Superior Court and lost. Diva's appealed the Superior Court decision, but entered into a settlement agreement (\"settlement agreement\") before the appeal was decided. In the settlement agreement, the City of Bangor gave Diva's the right to continue to operate as a nude dancing establishment, essentially in violation of the new Section 228-14, until May 31, 2001. In return, Diva's agreed to withdraw the appeal, cease nude dancing on its premises on or before May 31, 2001, and to never challenge the constitutionality or validity of Bangor Code Chapter 228 as written at the time of the settlement in any forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In anticipation of the May 31, 2001 deadline, Diva's began the process of converting into a \"bikini lounge\"; that is, an establishment that would serve alcohol in conjunction with bikini-clad dancing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Diva's applied for a liquor license and special amusement permit which would allow it to provide live dancing and musical entertainment in conjunction with the provision of alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2001, as part of the permitting process, the City Council of Bangor (\"City Council\") held a public hearing. Although the City Council approved the permit for the liquor license, it denied the special amusement permit. As entitled by statute, Diva's requested a written explanation of the reasoning for the denial of the special amusement permit, and the City Council responded by stating in writing that it was concerned that the \"bikini lounge\" would soon revert back to a nude dancing establishment in violation of Sections 228-14 and 61-17 of the Bangor Code, and that granting the permit would negatively affect public health, safety and welfare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Diva's and Cormier-Youngs appealed the decision of the City Council to the Bangor Board of Appeals and filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Bangor in the United States District Court for the District of Maine (\"federal district court\"). On June 20, 2001, the Bangor Board of Appeals reversed the decision of the City Council and on June 21, 2001, issued an order granting the special amusement permit for the \"bikini lounge.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One day later, on June 22, 2001, Diva's and Cormier-Youngs invited the public to witness an \"act of civil disobedience.\" When the invitees arrived, they observed the Diva's dancers performing in \"pasties\" and \"G-string\" underwear, in violation of Bangor Code Section 61-17 for liquor licensees because the dancers exposed their buttocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Bangor responded by filing a civil enforcement action against Diva's in the State of Maine District Court (\"state district court\") for violating Bangor Code Sections 228-14 and 61-17. Diva's moved to dismiss, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that Bangor Code Sections 228 and 61-17 as written violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. On August 29, 2001, the Maine District Court denied Diva's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diva's and Cormier-Youngs subsequently were permitted to amend their federal complaint (\"amended complaint\") to include as defendants the Mayor of Bangor and the City Council members who voted against granting Diva's a special amusement permit. The amended complaint also asserted: (1) a facial challenge to the constitutionality of Bangor Code Section 61-17 and several claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (collectively, \"Count One\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>; (2) a state law breach of contract claim alleging that the City of Bangor had violated the 1999 settlement agreement by denying the special amusement permit (\"Count Two\"); (3) a claim alleging tortious interference with Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' ability to contract with \"talent, support staff and vendors\" (\"Count Three\"); (4) a claim that Appellees had conspired to violate Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985 (\"Count Four\"); and (5) an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim on behalf of Cormier-Youngs individually (\"Count Five\"). The claims requested monetary, declarative, punitive and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees moved to dismiss, and, while the motion to dismiss was pending in federal court, trial was held on October 5, 2001 in the state court civil enforcement action against Diva's. The state district court decided in favor of the City of Bangor, and Diva's appealed the decision to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. On December 20, 2001, the federal district court dismissed Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' claims contained in Counts Two (breach of contract), Three (tortious interference), Four (Section 1985 conspiracy), and Five (intentional infliction of emotional distress). The district court also dismissed Appellants' Section 1983 claims contained in Count One against the Individual Appellees in their individual capacities, and determined that Cormier-Youngs lacked standing to pursue individually the Section 1983 claim portion of Count One. This left only Diva's and Cormier-Young's facial challenge to Bangor Code Section 61-17 and Diva's Section 1983 claim against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' challenge to the facial constitutionality of Bangor Code Section 61-17, the federal district court raised the issue of <i>Younger</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> abstention <i>sua sponte,</i> and concluded that principles of comity dictate that it should abstain from deciding the facial constitutionality of the Bangor Code Section 61-17 because there was an ongoing state proceeding against Diva's to enforce that provision. The court also found that comity dictated that it refrain from deciding whether Diva's had given up the right to challenge the facial constitutionality of the Bangor Code provisions by signing the settlement agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The court then dismissed the facial challenge portion of Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Diva's Section 1983 challenge portion of Count One against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities, the federal district court issued a stay pending the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's decision in the state court enforcement proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 2003, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court issued its decision in the enforcement action upholding the constitutionality of Bangor Code Sections 228-14 and 61-17, and finding Diva's liable for violation of those provisions. <i>See City of Bangor v. Diva's, Inc.,</i> 830 A.2d 898 (Me.2003). On April 21, 2003, the federal district court issued an order requesting the parties to file a \"short written submission\" discussing the effects of the state court decision on the remaining claim &#8212; Diva's Section 1983 challenge against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities. The City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees filed a submission, but Diva's declined to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 3, 2003, the federal district court dismissed the remaining portion of Count One. In ruling on that motion, the federal district court stated that \"Plaintiff's federal free speech claim can succeed `only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it,'\" and \"[t]he <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> prohibits district courts from ruling on federal claims where the ruling would effectively defeat or negate a state judgment to which the federal claimant was a party.\" The federal district court went on to state that \"Diva's had ample opportunity to pursue its Fourteenth Amendment objection to the licensing procedures before the state court,\" and because it did not present its claims in the state court proceeding, the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine also precludes federal court review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment entered in favor of Appellees on June 9, 2003, and Diva's and Cormier-Youngs filed this timely appeal of both the December 20, 2001 and June 3, 2003 orders of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We engage in plenary review of the district court's allowance of a motion to dismiss, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the Appellants. <i>Rockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp.,</i> 26 F.3d 254, 255 (1st Cir.1994). We begin our review with the district court's order of dismissal dated December 20, 2001, leaving that order's discussion of Count One for last, and then conclude with our review of the dismissal of the remainder of Count One as contained in the June 3, 2003 order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Count Two: Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substance of the Appellants' breach of contract claim is that it was a breach of the settlement agreement for the City of Bangor to deny Diva's application for a special amusement permit &#8212; that is, that the Appellees breached their \"obligation not to frustrate, retard, or disallow the plaintiff's ability to practice her art form, consistent with the terms of the agreement.\" On appeal, the Appellants raise only a procedural challenge to the district court's order of dismissal: they argue that the district court improperly dismissed their breach of contract claim because the second amended complaint pled all the elements necessary to state a claim for breach of contract and that the court \"transcended the applicable scope of review\" when it considered the settlement document in rendering its decision on the motion to dismiss. The Appellants are incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Bangor attached a copy of the settlement agreement to its motion to dismiss. And, although \"[o]rdinarily, a court may not consider any documents that are outside of the complaint, or not expressly incorporated therein, unless the motion is converted into one for summary judgment,\" <i>Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 267 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2001), \"[u]nder First Circuit precedent, when `a complaint's factual allegations are expressly linked to &#8212; and admittedly dependent upon &#8212; a document (the authenticity of which is not challenged),' then the court can review it upon a motion to dismiss.\" <i>Id.</i> at 34 (quoting <i>Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1998)). Here, the Appellants' claim that the Appellees breached the settlement agreement is dependent on the scope of the settlement agreement, and thus, that document was properly considered by the district court. Furthermore, the settlement agreement provides only that the City of Bangor would permit Diva's to operate as a nude entertainment establishment until May 31, 2001, in violation of the amended Bangor Code Section 228. There is nothing in the settlement agreement that explicitly or implicitly creates a contract between the parties with regards to a special amusement permit. The Appellants have failed to state claim for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Counts Three and Five: State Tort Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next challenge the dismissal of the two state tort claims against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees: Count Three alleging tortious interference with Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' contracts with \"talent, support staff and vendors\"; and Count Five, alleging, on behalf of Cormier-Youngs only, intentional infliction of emotional distress. We do not address the substance of either claim, however, because the district court correctly determined that all of the Appellees enjoy immunity under the Maine Tort Claims Act. <i>See</i> 14 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 8104-B(2), 8111(1)(B). The Maine Tort Claims Act provides statutorily created absolute immunity for the City of Bangor and Individual Appellees from suit for claims \"which result[] from ... [u]ndertaking or failing to undertake any judicial or quasi-judicial act, including, but not limited to, the granting ... or refusal to grant ... [a] permit.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court's dismissal of the state tort claims is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Count Four: Violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next allege that Appellees conspired to violate their First and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985(3). Section 1985(3) creates a private cause of action \"for injuries occasioned when `two or more persons ... conspire ... for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.'\" <i>Burns v. State Police Ass'n of Mass.,</i> 230 F.3d 8, 12 n. 3 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985(3)). In <i>Griffin v. Breckenridge,</i> 403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971), the Supreme Court clarified that in order to state a claim under Section 1985(3), the plaintiff must, among other requirements, allege that the \"conspiratorial conduct of which he complains is propelled by `some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.'\" <i>Aulson v. Blanchard,</i> 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Griffin,</i> 403 U.S. at 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in dismissing Appellants' Section 1985(3) claim, found that \"Plaintiffs fail to state class-based animus on the part of Defendants, and indeed, the Court does not perceive any class into which the Plaintiffs might fall.\" The district court went on to find that even if it were to assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that \"Plaintiffs had claimed that they belonged to a class of purveyors of adult entertainment for 1985(3) purposes, that class would be fatally indeterminate in that it is, at best, a `vague and amorphous' grouping of individuals.\" On appeal, Appellants do not advance the argument that their class is one of purveyors of adult entertainment, and therefore we deem that argument waived. <i>See Van Haaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</i> 989 F.2d 1, 7 n. 6 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[A]rguments neither presented to the district court nor presented in appellant's opening brief on appeal [are] deem [ed] waived.\"). Instead, Appellants state in their Opening Brief that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the complaint alleges that Ms. Cormier is a woman. Women are a protected class of persons under &#167; 1985(3). Because the Court is obliged to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendants, the Court erred in finding that the Plaintiff fatally excluded reference to a protectable class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Citation omitted.) In support of this argument against dismissal, Appellants cite to paragraph 25 of their amended complaint, which states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Plaintiff enjoys a right to free speech and expression in the presentation and performance of <i>her</i> art form of semi-nude dancing recognized under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and <i>Erie v. Pap's A.M., TBDA \"KANDYLAND,\"</i> 529 U.S. 277 [120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265] (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) We presume that it is Appellant Cormier-Youngs' contention that by using the feminine possessive pronoun \"her\" in paragraph 25 of the amended complaint, she has alleged that the state class-based animus she has suffered is a result of her being a member of the class of \"women\" in general.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, even under the most liberal of pleading standards, using a possessive pronoun that signals that the Appellant Cormier-Youngs is a woman is insufficient to set forth an allegation that she suffered class-based animus because she belongs to the class of women. Second, Appellant has failed to allege in her complaint any facts that the Individual Appellees conspired against her <i>because</i> she was a woman (as opposed to her being, for example, a purveyor of nude entertainment, regardless of her gender). Appellants have failed to state a claim under Section 1985(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Count One: Section 1983 and Facial Challenge</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously mentioned, the district court construed the Appellants'\"Count One\" as being comprised of two separate counts: a Section 1983 claim and a challenge to the facial constitutionality of Section 61-17 of the Bangor Code. In its December 20, 2001 order, the district court addressed first whether Count One of the complaint stated a claim under Section 1983 against the Individual Appellees in their individual capacities, and concluded in the negative. The district court next addressed whether Appellant Cormier-Youngs had standing in her personal capacity to pursue a claim against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities, and similarly concluded in the negative. This left only Diva's Section 1983 claim against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities and its facial challenge to the constitutionality of the Bangor Code Section 61-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then raised the issue of <i>Younger</i> abstention <i>sua sponte</i> and dismissed the facial challenge to the Bangor Code under principles of comity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a> As to the remaining claim, Diva's Section 1983 claim attacking the propriety of the City Council's denial of its permit application, the district court, in its December 20, 2001 order, raised the issue of <i>Colorado River</i> abstention <i>sua sponte,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and stayed its decision of that claim pending the outcome of the state enforcement action. The Appellants do not challenge on appeal the district court's decision to abstain from deciding the Section 1983 claim until after the state court decision, and make no mention of the district court's decision to exercise <i>Younger</i> abstention and dismiss the facial challenge to Section 61-17. Thus, we review <i>de novo</i> the district court's December 20, 2001 decision to (1) dismiss the claims against the Individual Appellants in their individual capacities; (2) dismiss Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff for lack of standing; and its June 3, 2003 decision to (3) dismiss the remaining Section 1983 claims under the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine. We treat as waived any challenges Appellants may have to the district court's (1) dismissal of the facial challenge to Section 61-17 under principles of <i>Younger</i> abstention and (2) the district court's decision to stay its decision on the Section 1983 claim until the Maine Supreme Judicial Court decided the City of Bangor's enforcement action against Diva's. <i>See, e.g., Smilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> 323 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner (or not at all) are waived.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Individual Appellees in their Individual Capacities</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the Individual Appellees enjoyed both absolute and qualified immunity for their actions during the permitting process. The district court's justification for finding absolute immunity was that the City Council members had acted in both a quasi-judicial and legislative capacity. We agree that the officials enjoy absolute immunity from personal liability because they were acting in a quasi-judicial capacity when they denied the special amusement permit, and thus, we do not need to determine whether the officials are qualifiedly immune for their actions or whether they are absolutely immune because their actions were also legislative in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must take a \"functional approach\" to determining whether the City Council members are absolutely immune from suit for their denial of the special amusement permit. <i>See Destek Group, Inc. v. State of N.H. Pub. Util. Comm'n,</i> 318 F.3d 32, 40-41 (1st Cir.2003). And, even though the City Council members \"at various times may perform legislative, executive and judicial functions, each of which may entitle the official to a different level of immunity, the functional approach to immunity requires that actions taken in the performance of a particular function are to be accorded the level of immunity appropriate to that <i>function.</i>\" <i>Bettencourt v. Bd. of Registration,</i> 904 F.2d 772, 782 (1st Cir.1990) (citing <i>Scott v. Cent. Me. Power Co.,</i> 709 F.Supp. 1176, 1187 (D.Me.1989)) (emphasis in <i>Scott</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Bettencourt,</i> 904 F.2d at 783, we described the analysis for determining whether an official has engaged in a quasi-judicial act:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proper analysis involves answering three questions, each designed to determine how closely analogous the adjudicatory experience of a Board member is to that of a judge. First, does a Board member, like a judge, perform a traditional \"adjudicatory\" function, in that he decides facts, applies law, and otherwise resolves disputes on the merits (free from direct political influence)? Second, does a Board member, like a judge, decide cases sufficiently controversial that, in the absence of absolute immunity, he would be subject to numerous damages actions? Third, does a Board member, like a judge, adjudicate disputes against a backdrop of multiple safeguards designed to protect [the complaining party's] rights?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, first, the Council members performed an \"adjudicatory\" function when they reviewed and voted on Diva's special amusement permit: they held a hearing, heard testimony, asked questions, discussed the matter, made their decision, and then provided a written explanation of their reasoning. Second, the act of denying a special amusement permit can be controversial, and can prompt litigation, as it did in this case. Without the proper protection from personal liability, it would be extremely difficult to get people to serve as City Council members. <i>Cf. Bogan v. Scott-Harris,</i> 523 U.S. 44, 52, 118 S.Ct. 966, 140 L.Ed.2d 79 (1998) (\"[T]he threat of liability may significantly deter service in local government, where prestige and pecuniary rewards may pale in comparison to the threat of civil liability.\"). Lastly, there are procedural safeguards that operate to protect a special amusement permit applicant from the violation of its constitutional rights. Indeed, this case presents a perfect example: Diva's exercised its statutory right to (1) request a written explanation of the reasons justifying the Council's denial of the special amusement permit, <i>see</i> Bangor Code &#167; 61-21, and (2) appeal the decision to the Bangor Board of Appeals, <i>see</i> Bangor Code &#167; 61-24. As a result of the appeal, the faulty decision of the City Council was reversed, and Diva's received its special amusement permit. The process worked. And, if Diva's had lost its appeal to the Bangor Board of Appeals, it had recourse to the Maine state courts, <i>see</i> Bangor Code &#167; 23-3H.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the Appellants' amended complaint raises a claim against the Individual Appellees in their individual capacities, the district court was correct to grant their motion to dismiss, because the City Council members are absolutely immune in their personal capacities from a suit arising from their denial of the special amusement permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Corimer-Youngs' Lack of Standing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court next dismissed Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff in the remaining Section 1983 claims. \"Article III of the Constitution confines the federal courts to deciding actual cases and controversies.\" <i>Cotter v. City of Boston,</i> 323 F.3d 160, 166 (1st Cir.2003). In order to establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must have a \"personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.\" <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). And, \"[a]ctions to enforce corporate rights or redress injuries to [a] corporation cannot be maintained by a stockholder in his own name ... even though the injury to the corporation may incidentally result in the depreciation or destruction of the value of the stock.\" <i>Pignato v. Dein Host, Inc.,</i> 835 F.2d 402, 406 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting <i>Brictson v. Woodrough,</i> 164 F.2d 107, 109 (8th Cir.1947)). This standing rule applies even when there is only one shareholder in a corporation. <i>See id.</i> And, although we have not yet had the opportunity to explicitly state, we join the circuits who have already addressed the issue to hold that this standing requirement also applies to actions brought to redress injuries to a corporation under Section 1983. <i>See Potthoff v. Morin,</i> 245 F.3d 710, 717 (8th Cir.2001) (holding that the shareholder standing rule applies to civil rights actions brought pursuant to &#167; 1983); <i>Flynn v. Merrick,</i> 881 F.2d 446, 450 (7th Cir.1989) (holding that \"filing suit under &#167; 1983 does not diminish the requirement that the shareholder suffer some individual, direct injury.\"); <i>Gregory v. Mitchell,</i> 634 F.2d 199, 202 (5th Cir.1981) (extending shareholder standing rule to civil rights actions under &#167; 1983); <i>Erlich v. Glasner,</i> 418 F.2d 226, 228 (9th Cir.1969) (finding \"nothing in the Civil Rights Act\" which would permit a plaintiff-stockholder to circumvent the rule that \"even though a stockholder owns all, or practically all, of the stock in a corporation, such a fact of itself does not authorize him to sue as an individual\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Appellant Cormier-Youngs does not allege any injury, separate from the injury to Diva's, resulting from her claim that the Appellees violated Section 1983 when they acted under color of state law to deny Diva's the special amusement permit in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. As the district court correctly determined, once it dismissed all but the Section 1983 claim of the second amended complaint, Appellant Cormier-Youngs no longer had Article III standing. We affirm the dismissal of Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff in the remaining Section 1983 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Section 1983 Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Maine Supreme Judicial Court rendered its decision, the federal district court requested submissions on the effect of the decision on the pending federal case, and then dismissed the remaining Section 1983 claim under the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine. The federal district court held that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine prevented it from ruling on Diva's federal claim because a decision in favor of Diva's would \"effectively defeat or negate a state judgment to which the federal claimant was a party.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this court heard argument and took this case under advisement, the Supreme Court decided <i>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). In <i>Exxon Mobil</i>, the Supreme Court cautioned that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine \"is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1521-22. And, the Court held that \"neither <i>Rooker</i> nor <i>Feldman</i> supports the notion that properly invoked concurrent jurisdiction vanishes if a state court reaches judgment on the same or related question while the case remains <i>sub judice</i> in a federal court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1527.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine does not apply in this case because Diva's filed its case in federal court before the enforcement action was filed against it in state court. And, Diva's was not seeking an \"appeal\" of a state court judgment in federal district court, but instead was, among other things, seeking redress for the City Council's arbitrary and capricious denial of the special amusement permit for impermissible reasons. Thus, it was an error for the district court to invoke the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine to dismiss Appellant Diva's remaining Section 1983 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry does not end, however, with the determination that the federal district court erroneously invoked the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, as we may uphold the dismissal on any ground supported by the record. <i>See Wilson v. Town of Mendon,</i> 294 F.3d 1, 10 n. 23 (1st Cir.2002). In our review of whether there is an alternate ground to support the dismissal, we find our jurisprudence on damages resulting from delays caused by the improper denial of building permits instructive. In <i>Chiplin Enters. v. City of Lebanon,</i> 712 F.2d 1524, 1526-28 (1st Cir.1983), we held that a building developer who had to wait five years between the denial of a building permit and the determination that the permit had been improperly denied, could not state a Section 1983 claim for deprivation of either substantive or procedural due process. Taking all facts alleged as true, even though the plaintiff \"had met all legal requirements for the permit\" and \"the town had no valid reason to reject the application\" and that defendants \"maliciously den [ied] [plaintiff] a building permit for invalid and illegal reasons and in bad faith,\" we held that the plaintiff could not state a valid Section 1983 claim. <i>Id.</i> at 1526. We found that even though the conduct complained of was concededly carried out under the color of state law, the plaintiff could not \"identify a constitutional right of which [he] ha[d] been denied.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1527. This is because \"property is not denied without due process simply because a local planning board rejects a proposed development for erroneous reasons or makes demands which arguably exceed its authority under the relevant state statutes.\" <i>Creative Env'ts, Inc. v. Estabrook,</i> 680 F.2d 822, 832 n. 9 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, although an erroneous denial of a permit for the use of property does not amount to a denial of due process, it may, in certain circumstances, \"give rise to genuine constitutional issues.\" <i>Chiplin,</i> 712 F.2d at 1527. In <i>Packish v. McMurtrie,</i> 697 F.2d 23, 25-26 (1st Cir.1983), we held that a firefighter who had initially been denied reimbursement for medical expenses, allegedly in retaliation for his published criticism of town officials, and who sought damages for the delay in receiving the reimbursement, could not state a claim for denial of due process, but \"might have viable claims if [he] could in fact demonstrate that [he] was denied indemnification in retaliation\" for his exercise of his First Amendment rights. Similarly, in <i>Manego v. Cape Cod Five Cents Sav. Bank,</i> 692 F.2d 174, 177 (1st Cir.1982), we found that the plaintiff had stated a claim under Section 1983 because he alleged that the reason for the denial of an entertainment license was based on race &#8212; even though this was a claim the plaintiff ultimately could not prove. Furthermore, in <i>Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> 964 F.2d 32, 40 (1st Cir.1992), we considered \"whether the denial of a land use permit in unjustifiable retaliation for the applicant's expressions of his political views is a First Amendment violation,\" and found, at least with respect to one of the plaintiff's claims, that summary judgment was inappropriate because plaintiff had \"stated a prima facie case of denial in retaliation for his political expressions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, even though Bangor Code Section 61-17 has been determined by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to be constitutional on its face, and, even though Diva's cannot state a claim for a violation of procedural or substantive due process, we believe that Diva's has stated a claim that the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities acted under color of state law to deprive Diva's of its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. We caution, however, that the First Amendment right that is implicated here is <i>not</i> the right for Diva's to allow nude dancers on its premises,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a> but for Diva's right, if any, to offer dancing that is consistent with the type of dancing permitted under Section 61-17. We also caution that if the district court on remand determines that the City Council did act arbitrarily and capriciously with the intent of depriving Diva's of its First Amendment right to free speech, the only available damages are those incurred by Appellant Diva's during the three week period from when the City Council denied the permit, to when the Bangor Board of Appeals reversed that decision and granted the permit. We express no opinion on whether Diva's can ultimately prove her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order of dismissal of Appellant Diva's, Inc. and Appellant Cormier-Young's claims for (1) breach of contract, (2) conspiracy to deprive under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985(3), (3) tortious interference with contractual relations, and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress is <i>AFFIRMED.</i> The district court's order dismissing all claims against the Mayor and the City Council members in their individual capacities and the dismissal of Appellant Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff in the Section 1983 claims is <i>AFFIRMED.</i> The district court's order of dismissal of Appellants' challenge to the facial constitutionality of Bangor Code Section 61-17 is <i>AFFIRMED.</i> The district court's order of dismissal of Appellant Diva's claim that Appellees violated Section 1983 by depriving it of its Fourteenth Amendment right to due process is <i>AFFIRMED.</i> The district court's order of dismissal of Appellant Diva's claim that Appellees violated Section 1983 by depriving it of its First Amendment right to free speech under color of state law is <i>REVERSED</i> and <i>REMANDED</i> to determine whether Appellant Diva's can show that the City Council members denied the special amusement permit with the intent to curtail Diva's First Amendment right to free speech. And, as noted above, although we do not express any opinion on the viability of Diva's claim, the potential damages, if any, are limited to the three-week period between the denial of the permit by the City Council, and the reversal of that denial by the Bangor Board of Appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Nude entertainment\" is defined in the Bangor Code as \"Any display of live persons in a state of nudity, or in a visible state of sexual excitement whether or not clothed.\" Bangor Code &#167; 228-13(B).

(\"Diva's\"), an adult entertainment bar located in Bangor, Maine, Plaintiff-Appellant Dianne Cormier-Youngs, the owner of Diva's, and Appellee City of Bangor, Maine. Also involved in the instant action are various Bangor government officials in their official and individual capacities (collectively, \"Individual Appellees\"). We decide today an appeal from two district court orders which together dismissed all of Appellants' claims, affirming in part and reversing and remanding in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several ordinances and statutes involved in this dispute. The first is Bangor City Code (\"Bangor Code\") Chapter 228 on Public Morals. Chapter 228 contains a provision that regulates the location of commercial establishments offering nude dancing. <i>See</i> Bangor Code &#167; 228-14. That section provides that establishments offering nude entertainment can only be located in certain zoned districts, and that operators of a commercial establishment offering nude entertainment must obtain a certificate of occupancy, which will not be granted if the establishment is located within 500 feet of a litany of establishments including: another nude entertainment establishment, an establishment licensed to sell alcohol, a church, school, public park, public library, or residentially-zoned district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Diva's cannot obtain a certificate of occupancy without a variance as it is located within 500 feet of a church.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Chapter 228 also regulates the operation of nude establishments by prohibiting such establishments from serving alcohol. <i>See</i> Bangor Code &#167; 228-15(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second provision of the Bangor Code at issue here applies to establishments that sell alcohol in conjunction with the provision of non-nude entertainment. <i>See</i> Bangor Code Chapter 61. A liquor licensee desiring to have live entertainment, that is, dancing or music performed by something other than a mechanical device, must apply for a special amusement permit pursuant to Article II of Chapter 61 of the Bangor Code.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although an applicant may properly seek a special amusement permit for \"dancing,\" the dancing cannot be \"nude entertainment,\" as defined by Bangor Code Chapter 228. This means, in essence, that female dancers in an establishment that serves alcohol must, in addition to not violating the provisions of Chapter 228, have their buttocks and the areola area of their breasts covered with an opaque covering.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this background in mind, we turn to the history of Diva's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diva's opened as nude dancing establishment and juice bar in 1996. In 1999, Bangor amended Chapter 228 of the Bangor Code to add, <i>inter alia,</i> the provision prohibiting nude entertainment establishments from being located within 500 feet of a church. Because Diva's is located next to a church, it is unable to obtain a certificate of occupancy without being granted a variance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Diva's challenged the ordinance in the Maine Superior Court and lost. Diva's appealed the Superior Court decision, but entered into a settlement agreement (\"settlement agreement\") before the appeal was decided. In the settlement agreement, the City of Bangor gave Diva's the right to continue to operate as a nude dancing establishment, essentially in violation of the new Section 228-14, until May 31, 2001. In return, Diva's agreed to withdraw the appeal, cease nude dancing on its premises on or before May 31, 2001, and to never challenge the constitutionality or validity of Bangor Code Chapter 228 as written at the time of the settlement in any forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In anticipation of the May 31, 2001 deadline, Diva's began the process of converting into a \"bikini lounge\"; that is, an establishment that would serve alcohol in conjunction with bikini-clad dancing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Diva's applied for a liquor license and special amusement permit which would allow it to provide live dancing and musical entertainment in conjunction with the provision of alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2001, as part of the permitting process, the City Council of Bangor (\"City Council\") held a public hearing. Although the City Council approved the permit for the liquor license, it denied the special amusement permit. As entitled by statute, Diva's requested a written explanation of the reasoning for the denial of the special amusement permit, and the City Council responded by stating in writing that it was concerned that the \"bikini lounge\" would soon revert back to a nude dancing establishment in violation of Sections 228-14 and 61-17 of the Bangor Code, and that granting the permit would negatively affect public health, safety and welfare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Diva's and Cormier-Youngs appealed the decision of the City Council to the Bangor Board of Appeals and filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Bangor in the United States District Court for the District of Maine (\"federal district court\"). On June 20, 2001, the Bangor Board of Appeals reversed the decision of the City Council and on June 21, 2001, issued an order granting the special amusement permit for the \"bikini lounge.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One day later, on June 22, 2001, Diva's and Cormier-Youngs invited the public to witness an \"act of civil disobedience.\" When the invitees arrived, they observed the Diva's dancers performing in \"pasties\" and \"G-string\" underwear, in violation of Bangor Code Section 61-17 for liquor licensees because the dancers exposed their buttocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Bangor responded by filing a civil enforcement action against Diva's in the State of Maine District Court (\"state district court\") for violating Bangor Code Sections 228-14 and 61-17. Diva's moved to dismiss, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that Bangor Code Sections 228 and 61-17 as written violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. On August 29, 2001, the Maine District Court denied Diva's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diva's and Cormier-Youngs subsequently were permitted to amend their federal complaint (\"amended complaint\") to include as defendants the Mayor of Bangor and the City Council members who voted against granting Diva's a special amusement permit. The amended complaint also asserted: (1) a facial challenge to the constitutionality of Bangor Code Section 61-17 and several claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (collectively, \"Count One\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>; (2) a state law breach of contract claim alleging that the City of Bangor had violated the 1999 settlement agreement by denying the special amusement permit (\"Count Two\"); (3) a claim alleging tortious interference with Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' ability to contract with \"talent, support staff and vendors\" (\"Count Three\"); (4) a claim that Appellees had conspired to violate Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985 (\"Count Four\"); and (5) an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim on behalf of Cormier-Youngs individually (\"Count Five\"). The claims requested monetary, declarative, punitive and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees moved to dismiss, and, while the motion to dismiss was pending in federal court, trial was held on October 5, 2001 in the state court civil enforcement action against Diva's. The state district court decided in favor of the City of Bangor, and Diva's appealed the decision to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. On December 20, 2001, the federal district court dismissed Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' claims contained in Counts Two (breach of contract), Three (tortious interference), Four (Section 1985 conspiracy), and Five (intentional infliction of emotional distress). The district court also dismissed Appellants' Section 1983 claims contained in Count One against the Individual Appellees in their individual capacities, and determined that Cormier-Youngs lacked standing to pursue individually the Section 1983 claim portion of Count One. This left only Diva's and Cormier-Young's facial challenge to Bangor Code Section 61-17 and Diva's Section 1983 claim against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Diva's and Cormier-Youngs' challenge to the facial constitutionality of Bangor Code Section 61-17, the federal district court raised the issue of <i>Younger</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> abstention <i>sua sponte,</i> and concluded that principles of comity dictate that it should abstain from deciding the facial constitutionality of the Bangor Code Section 61-17 because there was an ongoing state proceeding against Diva's to enforce that provision. The court also found that comity dictated that it refrain from deciding whether Diva's had given up the right to challenge the facial constitutionality of the Bangor Code provisions by signing the settlement agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The court then dismissed the facial challenge portion of Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Diva's Section 1983 challenge portion of Count One against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities, the federal district court issued a stay pending the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's decision in the state court enforcement proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 2003, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court issued its decision in the enforcement action upholding the constitutionality of Bangor Code Sections 228-14 and 61-17, and finding Diva's liable for violation of those provisions. <i>See City of Bangor v.

On April 21, 2003, the federal district court issued an order requesting the parties to file a \"short written submission\" discussing the effects of the state court decision on the remaining claim &#8212; Diva's Section 1983 challenge against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities.

Second, Appellant has failed to allege in her complaint any facts that the Individual Appellees conspired against her <i>because</i> she was a woman (as opposed to her being, for example, a purveyor of nude entertainment, regardless of her gender).

In its December 20, 2001 order, the district court addressed first whether Count One of the complaint stated a claim under Section 1983 against the Individual Appellees in their individual capacities, and concluded in the negative. The district court next addressed whether Appellant Cormier-Youngs had standing in her personal capacity to pursue a claim against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities, and similarly concluded in the negative. This left only Diva's Section 1983 claim against the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities and its facial challenge to the constitutionality of the Bangor Code Section 61-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then raised the issue of <i>Younger</i> abstention <i>sua sponte</i> and dismissed the facial challenge to the Bangor Code under principles of comity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a> As to the remaining claim, Diva's Section 1983 claim attacking the propriety of the City Council's denial of its permit application, the district court, in its December 20, 2001 order, raised the issue of <i>Colorado River</i> abstention <i>sua sponte,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and stayed its decision of that claim pending the outcome of the state enforcement action. The Appellants do not challenge on appeal the district court's decision to abstain from deciding the Section 1983 claim until after the state court decision, and make no mention of the district court's decision to exercise <i>Younger</i> abstention and dismiss the facial challenge to Section 61-17. Thus, we review <i>de novo</i> the district court's December 20, 2001 decision to (1) dismiss the claims against the Individual Appellants in their individual capacities; (2) dismiss Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff for lack of standing; and its June 3, 2003 decision to (3) dismiss the remaining Section 1983 claims under the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine. We treat as waived any challenges Appellants may have to the district court's (1) dismissal of the facial challenge to Section 61-17 under principles of <i>Younger</i> abstention and (2) the district court's decision to stay its decision on the Section 1983 claim until the Maine Supreme Judicial Court decided the City of Bangor's enforcement action against Diva's. <i>See, e.g., Smilow v.

The district court's justification for finding absolute immunity was that the City Council members had acted in both a quasi-judicial and legislative capacity. We agree that the officials enjoy absolute immunity from personal liability because they were acting in a quasi-judicial capacity when they denied the special amusement permit, and thus, we do not need to determine whether the officials are qualifiedly immune for their actions or whether they are absolutely immune because their actions were also legislative in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must take a \"functional approach\" to determining whether the City Council members are absolutely immune from suit for their denial of the special amusement permit. <i>See Destek Group, Inc. v.

And, even though the City Council members \"at various times may perform legislative, executive and judicial functions, each of which may entitle the official to a different level of immunity, the functional approach to immunity requires that actions taken in the performance of a particular function are to be accorded the level of immunity appropriate to that <i>function.</i>\" <i>Bettencourt v.

First, does a Board member, like a judge, perform a traditional \"adjudicatory\" function, in that he decides facts, applies law, and otherwise resolves disputes on the merits (free from direct political influence)? Second, does a Board member, like a judge, decide cases sufficiently controversial that, in the absence of absolute immunity, he would be subject to numerous damages actions? Third, does a Board member, like a judge, adjudicate disputes against a backdrop of multiple safeguards designed to protect [the complaining party's] rights?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, first, the Council members performed an \"adjudicatory\" function when they reviewed and voted on Diva's special amusement permit: they held a hearing, heard testimony, asked questions, discussed the matter, made their decision, and then provided a written explanation of their reasoning. Second, the act of denying a special amusement permit can be controversial, and can prompt litigation, as it did in this case. Without the proper protection from personal liability, it would be extremely difficult to get people to serve as City Council members. <i>Cf. Bogan v.

Lastly, there are procedural safeguards that operate to protect a special amusement permit applicant from the violation of its constitutional rights. Indeed, this case presents a perfect example: Diva's exercised its statutory right to (1) request a written explanation of the reasons justifying the Council's denial of the special amusement permit, <i>see</i> Bangor Code &#167; 61-21, and (2) appeal the decision to the Bangor Board of Appeals, <i>see</i> Bangor Code &#167; 61-24. As a result of the appeal, the faulty decision of the City Council was reversed, and Diva's received its special amusement permit. The process worked. And, if Diva's had lost its appeal to the Bangor Board of Appeals, it had recourse to the Maine state courts, <i>see</i> Bangor Code &#167; 23-3H.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the Appellants' amended complaint raises a claim against the Individual Appellees in their individual capacities, the district court was correct to grant their motion to dismiss, because the City Council members are absolutely immune in their personal capacities from a suit arising from their denial of the special amusement permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Corimer-Youngs' Lack of Standing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court next dismissed Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff in the remaining Section 1983 claims. \"Article III of the Constitution confines the federal courts to deciding actual cases and controversies.\" <i>Cotter v.

And, Diva's was not seeking an \"appeal\" of a state court judgment in federal district court, but instead was, among other things, seeking redress for the City Council's arbitrary and capricious denial of the special amusement permit for impermissible reasons. Thus, it was an error for the district court to invoke the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine to dismiss Appellant Diva's remaining Section 1983 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry does not end, however, with the determination that the federal district court erroneously invoked the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, as we may uphold the dismissal on any ground supported by the record. <i>See Wilson v. Town of Mendon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200002\"><a href=\"/opinion/200002/wilson-v-town-of-mendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 n. 23 (1st Cir.2002). In our review of whether there is an alternate ground to support the dismissal, we find our jurisprudence on damages resulting from delays caused by the improper denial of building permits instructive. In <i>Chiplin Enters. v. City of Lebanon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422031\"><a href=\"/opinion/422031/chiplin-enterprises-inc-v-city-of-lebanon/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span>, 1526-28 (1st Cir.1983), we held that a building developer who had to wait five years between the denial of a building permit and the determination that the permit had been improperly denied, could not state a Section 1983 claim for deprivation of either substantive or procedural due process. Taking all facts alleged as true, even though the plaintiff \"had met all legal requirements for the permit\" and \"the town had no valid reason to reject the application\" and that defendants \"maliciously den [ied] [plaintiff] a building permit for invalid and illegal reasons and in bad faith,\" we held that the plaintiff could not state a valid Section 1983 claim. <i>Id.</i> at 1526. We found that even though the conduct complained of was concededly carried out under the color of state law, the plaintiff could not \"identify a constitutional right of which [he] ha[d] been denied.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1527. This is because \"property is not denied without due process simply because a local planning board rejects a proposed development for erroneous reasons or makes demands which arguably exceed its authority under the relevant state statutes.\" <i>Creative Env'ts, Inc. v. Estabrook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405155\"><a href=\"/opinion/405155/creative-environments-inc-v-robert-estabrook/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 832 n. 9 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, although an erroneous denial of a permit for the use of property does not amount to a denial of due process, it may, in certain circumstances, \"give rise to genuine constitutional issues.\" <i>Chiplin,</i> 712 F.2d at 1527. In <i>Packish v. McMurtrie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"412700\"><a href=\"/opinion/412700/george-w-packish-v-heather-mcmurtrie/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 25-26 (1st Cir.1983), we held that a firefighter who had initially been denied reimbursement for medical expenses, allegedly in retaliation for his published criticism of town officials, and who sought damages for the delay in receiving the reimbursement, could not state a claim for denial of due process, but \"might have viable claims if [he] could in fact demonstrate that [he] was denied indemnification in retaliation\" for his exercise of his First Amendment rights. Similarly, in <i>Manego v. Cape Cod Five Cents Sav. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410372\"><a href=\"/opinion/410372/isaac-manego-v-cape-cod-five-cents-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 177 (1st Cir.1982), we found that the plaintiff had stated a claim under Section 1983 because he alleged that the reason for the denial of an entertainment license was based on race &#8212; even though this was a claim the plaintiff ultimately could not prove. Furthermore, in <i>Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583574\"><a href=\"/opinion/583574/nestor-colon-medina-sucesores-inc-v-patria-g-custodio/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1992), we considered \"whether the denial of a land use permit in unjustifiable retaliation for the applicant's expressions of his political views is a First Amendment violation,\" and found, at least with respect to one of the plaintiff's claims, that summary judgment was inappropriate because plaintiff had \"stated a prima facie case of denial in retaliation for his political expressions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, even though Bangor Code Section 61-17 has been determined by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to be constitutional on its face, and, even though Diva's cannot state a claim for a violation of procedural or substantive due process, we believe that Diva's has stated a claim that the City of Bangor and the Individual Appellees in their official capacities acted under color of state law to deprive Diva's of its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. We caution, however, that the First Amendment right that is implicated here is <i>not</i> the right for Diva's to allow nude dancers on its premises,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a> but for Diva's right, if any, to offer dancing that is consistent with the type of dancing permitted under Section 61-17. We also caution that if the district court on remand determines that the City Council did act arbitrarily and capriciously with the intent of depriving Diva's of its First Amendment right to free speech, the only available damages are those incurred by Appellant Diva's during the three week period from when the City Council denied the permit, to when the Bangor Board of Appeals reversed that decision and granted the permit. We express no opinion on whether Diva's can ultimately prove her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order of dismissal of Appellant Diva's, Inc. and Appellant Cormier-Young's claims for (1) breach of contract, (2) conspiracy to deprive under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985(3), (3) tortious interference with contractual relations, and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress is <i>AFFIRMED.</i> The district court's order dismissing all claims against the Mayor and the City Council members in their individual capacities and the dismissal of Appellant Cormier-Youngs as a plaintiff in the Section 1983 claims is <i>AFFIRMED.</i> The district court's order of dismissal of Appellants' challenge to the facial constitutionality of Bangor Code Section 61-17 is <i>AFFIRMED.</i> The district court's order of dismissal of Appellant Diva's claim that Appellees violated Section 1983 by depriving it of its Fourteenth Amendment right to due process is <i>AFFIRMED.</i> The district court's order of dismissal of Appellant Diva's claim that Appellees violated Section 1983 by depriving it of its First Amendment right to free speech under color of state law is <i>REVERSED</i> and <i>REMANDED</i> to determine whether Appellant Diva's can show that the City Council members denied the special amusement permit with the intent to curtail Diva's First Amendment right to free speech. And, as noted above, although we do not express any opinion on the viability of Diva's claim, the potential damages, if any, are limited to the three-week period between the denial of the permit by the City Council, and the reversal of that denial by the Bangor Board of Appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Nude entertainment\" is defined in the Bangor Code as \"Any display of live persons in a state of nudity, or in a visible state of sexual excitement whether or not clothed.\" Bangor Code &#167; 228-13(B).
