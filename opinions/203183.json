ELLRICH, INDIVIDUALLY,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellant.\n                               __________\n\n                  MORGAN FINANCIAL ADVISORS, INC.,\n\n                                 Plaintiff,\n\n                                      v.\n\n         U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, d/b/a US Bank,\n                       f/k/a Firstar Bank,\n\n                          Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Rya W. Zobel,       U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                       and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     David J. Ellrich on brief pro se.\n     Timothy C. Sullivan and Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP on\nbrief for defendant, appellee.\n\n\n\n                              March 13, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.     David Ellrich, the plaintiff in the trial\n\ncourt, served as president of Morgan Financial Advisors (\"Morgan\"),\n\nwhich in turn served as investment advisor to the Convergent Market\n\nFund Series II, LP (\"Convergent\"). Convergent was a Delaware-based\n\nhedge fund that traded in mutual fund indices and futures, a type\n\nof high risk investing.        From December 2000 until April 2003,\n\nEllrich managed a custodial account on Convergent's behalf with\n\nU.S. Bank National Association (\"U.S. Bank\" or \"Bank\"), an Ohio\n\ncorporation.\n\n            As custodian, U.S. Bank agreed, among other things, to\n\nprocess orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the\n\naccounts, to accept or withdraw sums upon Convergent's request,\n\nand, pertinently for our purposes, to provide Convergent's designee\n\nwith monthly account statements showing all activity from the\n\nprevious month and the value of each asset held in the account.\n\n            After Convergent dissolved in April 2003 and assigned its\n\nremaining    interests    to      Ellrich,   Ellrich   brought   suit     in\n\nMassachusetts    state    court    against   U.S.   Bank,   claiming    that\n\nConvergent's losses were caused by U.S. Bank's faulty record-\n\nkeeping, violations of the Master Custody Agreement, and disregard\n\nfor state banking laws.     In due course, the case was removed to the\n\nMassachusetts federal district court and a four-day trial was held.\n\n            Ellrich agreed at trial that only two of his claims\n\nshould be submitted to the jury: first, that U.S. Bank had breached\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe custody agreement by issuing erroneous account statements; and\n\nsecond, that U.S. Bank had violated Ohio banking laws by returning\n\ntwo overdraft checks issued to Morgan out of Convergent's account\n\nafter the statutory \"midnight deadline\" for disavowal.     Ellrich\n\nagreed that a third claim, arising under a Massachusetts statute\n\ngoverning unfair trade practices, would be decided by the trial\n\njudge.\n\n          Both the jury and the judge found in favor of the Bank,\n\nand Ellrich now appeals from the final judgment.      The heart of\n\nEllrich's argument at trial was that U.S. Bank violated the terms\n\nof the custody agreement by failing to provide proper monthly\n\nstatements.   On appeal, Ellrich argues that he was entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law on his breach of contract claim because\n\nU.S. Bank conceded before trial that it had issued an erroneous\n\nstatement to Convergent.\n\n          The short answer is that at trial Ellrich did not move\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law on his breach of contract claim\n\nagainst U.S. Bank and this in turn bars him from making such a\n\nclaim on appeal.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b); Unitherm Food Sys., Inc.\n\nv. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U.S. 394, 400-01 (2006).       Nor did\n\nEllrich ask for a new trial after the jury returned its verdict, so\n\nhe cannot press such a claim now.\n\n          As it happens, the jury would have been hard put to find\n\nthat U.S. Bank's issuance of a single inaccurate statement caused\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fEllrich any harm.      The Bank's mistake was promptly corrected and\n\nEllrich did not show that he made any trades in reliance on the\n\ninaccurate version. There appears to have been good reason for the\n\nfailure to move for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n           Next,     Ellrich        complains       that    the      district    court\n\nincorrectly      instructed       the   jury     that   only   the    December      2001\n\nstatements remained at issue even though his claim for breach of\n\ncontract     was   based     on    a    three-year       \"pattern\"      of   contract\n\nviolations. But Ellrich did not object to the instruction; indeed,\n\nat the charge conference Ellrich's counsel conceded that the breach\n\nof contract claim should be limited to the December 2001 events\n\nalone, seemingly because damages stemming from the other instances\n\nof alleged breach were too speculative.                 Any challenge to the jury\n\ninstruction is therefore waived.               United States v. Wall, 349 F.3d\n\n18, 24 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Ellrich then says that the trial court erred in refusing\n\nto admit testimony from his expert witness, William Gormley, about\n\nbanking regulations and bank procedures.                       The district court\n\npressed Ellrich's counsel to explain what Gormley's testimony would\n\nreveal   about     whether    U.S.      Bank's    behavior     accorded      with   its\n\nobligations under the Master Custody Agreement.                   Dissatisfied with\n\ncounsel's vague response, the district court excluded Gormley's\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f           We see no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\nrefusal to admit Gormley's testimony.      Baker v. Dalkon Shield\n\nClaimants Trust, 156 F.3d 248, 251-52 (1st Cir. 1998).   The court\n\nreasonably concluded that Gormley's proposed testimony was not\n\nrelevant to the question of whether U.S. Bank violated the Master\n\nCustody Agreement. Even if relevance was not disputed, the meaning\n\nof the pertinent regulations was plainly a matter for the district\n\ncourt.   Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 99-100 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n           Finally, Ellrich urges that the district court erred in\n\nits jury instruction on his claim that U.S. Bank violated state\n\nbanking regulations by dishonoring two Convergent checks.      The\n\ndetails are not important because Ellrich raised the instruction\n\nissue only in his reply brief, so it is forfeited.   Thomas R.W. v.\n\nMass. Dep't of Educ., 130 F.3d 477, 480 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
