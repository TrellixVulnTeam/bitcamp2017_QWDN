Hahn and Hahn & Matkov on brief for petitioner.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney and Michael Sady,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                               July 18, 2007\n\f             Per Curiam. Petitioner, referred to in the record simply\n\nby the name \"Essen,\" seeks review of an order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) affirming an order of removal against\n\nhim.   He claims that he was denied his right to due process of law\n\nby   being   required   to   proceed   without   counsel,   and   that   the\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) erred by not finding that he had suffered\n\npast persecution, which would have qualified him for withholding of\n\nremoval, see 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (2007).          We deny the petition.\n\n             Essen, an Indonesian citizen of Chinese descent, entered\n\nthe United States as a visitor in 2000.              In April 2003, the\n\nImmigration     and     Naturalization    Service     commenced    removal\n\nproceedings against him for overstaying his visa.             Essen first\n\nappeared before an IJ on July 31, 2003, without counsel.            The IJ\n\ncontinued the hearing to September 8, 2003, so Essen could have an\n\ninterpreter present.      The IJ also encouraged Essen to look for an\n\nattorney to represent him in the proceedings and provided Essen\n\nwith a list of legal services agencies to assist him.\n\n             When Essen returned on the appointed date, he again\n\nappeared pro se, and the IJ asked him if he wanted more time to\n\nlook for a lawyer.      Essen said that he did.     The IJ continued the\n\nhearing to November 10, 2003, but warned him that, whether he had\n\na lawyer by that time or not, he would be placed under oath and\n\nasked to respond to the charges against him.          Essen acknowledged\n\nthat he understood this.       The IJ also instructed Essen to take a\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\flist of legal services agencies and to seek a lawyer right away.\n\n           Essen returned as scheduled, again appearing without\n\ncounsel.   The IJ reminded him that she had continued the hearing so\n\nthat he could obtain counsel and that he had agreed to proceed with\n\nor without a lawyer.   After asking Essen about each of the charges\n\nagainst him, the IJ determined that he was subject to removal, but\n\nalso continued the case to permit Essen to apply for asylum or\n\nwithholding of removal based on fear of persecution.          The IJ also\n\nrecommended that Essen contact a legal services agency for help\n\nwith completing his application.\n\n           At the next hearing, on March 30, 2004, Essen, again\n\nappearing pro se, submitted the application, but not in English.\n\nThe IJ allowed him additional time to file a proper application and\n\ngave him another copy of the list of legal services agencies as\n\nwell as a written advisory informing him of his right to counsel.\n\nEssen submitted a translated version of the application at a later\n\nhearing, when he appeared without counsel again.           The IJ accepted\n\nthe filing as only an application for withholding of removal\n\nbecause Essen had failed to seek asylum within one year after his\n\narrival in the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) (2007).\n\nThen,   continuing   the   hearing    to   December   7,    2004,   the   IJ\n\nrecommended that Essen take another copy of the list of legal\n\nservices agencies.\n\n           Essen appeared as scheduled, again pro se, and presented\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\ftestimony and exhibits in support of his withholding claim.               He\n\nalso produced a letter from an attorney he had apparently contacted\n\nin connection with the removal proceedings.          In the letter, the\n\nattorney expressed a willingness to discuss the case but explained\n\nthat he would be out of the country on December 7 and therefore\n\ncould not appear at the hearing.        The IJ treated the letter as a\n\nrequest for more time to find an attorney, and denied it.\n\n           The IJ then issued an oral decision denying Essen’s\n\nrequests both for asylum and withholding of removal. Though the IJ\n\nfound that Essen \"may have been able to establish a reasonable fear\n\nof persecution,\" she expressed doubt that \"the fear would amount to\n\na well-founded fear\" as required to qualify for asylum on that\n\nbasis, see, e.g., Sou v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2006),\n\nand ruled that, in any event, Essen had unjustifiably failed to\n\napply for asylum within the time required.      The IJ also ruled that\n\n\"[w]ith respect to withholding, it is quite evident that [Essen]\n\nhas not met his burden of showing it is more likely than not he\n\nwould suffer persecution\" if returned to Indonesia.         The IJ did,\n\nhowever,   grant   Essen   voluntary    departure.    See   8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1229c(b)(1) (2007).\n\n           Essen appealed this decision to the BIA.             His brief,\n\nprepared by counsel, identified the issues on appeal as (1) whether\n\nthe IJ had denied him due process of law by requiring him to\n\nproceed pro se at the December 7 hearing, (2) whether the IJ had\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fwrongly held him to the one-year deadline for seeking asylum, and\n\n(3) whether the IJ had erroneously denied his requests for asylum\n\nand withholding of removal.   The body of the brief, however, was\n\ndedicated exclusively to arguing the due process claim, save for\n\none sentence that \"the IJ should have found Essen entitled to\n\neither asylum or withholding of removal\" based on his testimony and\n\nofficial reports of conditions in Indonesia.   The BIA adopted and\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision, agreeing with her conclusion that Essen\n\nhad failed to demonstrate his eligibility for either relief from\n\nthe one-year asylum deadline or for withholding of removal.    The\n\nBIA also rejected Essen's due process argument on the grounds that\n\nhe had received \"a just hearing\" and \"a fair opportunity to obtain\n\nrepresentation.\"   This petition followed.\n\n          In support of his petition, Essen renews the due process\n\nclaim he made to the BIA, and also argues that the IJ erred by\n\nneglecting to consider whether he had demonstrated past persecution\n\nunder the withholding of removal standard, as opposed to the asylum\n\nstandard, cf. Un v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 205, 209 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(ruling that IJ erred by denying withholding of removal claim\n\nwithout making finding as to past persecution).   As the government\n\npoints out, however, Essen did not present this second argument to\n\nthe BIA, so he has waived it.    See, e.g., Molina De Massenet v.\n\nGonzales, 485 F.3d 661, 664 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          We review Essen's due process claim de novo.    Zheng v.\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fGonzales, 464 F.3d 60, 62 (1st Cir. 2006); Kheireddine v. Gonzales,\n\n427 F.3d 80, 83 (1st Cir. 2005).                 The Fifth Amendment entitles\n\naliens to due process of law in removal proceedings.                            E.g.,\n\nMekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 118, 128 (1st Cir. 2004); Morales v.\n\nINS, 208 F.3d 323, 327 n. 1 (1st Cir. 2000).                In those proceedings,\n\naliens    are    also   afforded         the   statutory    privilege    \"of    being\n\nrepresented, at no expense to the Government, by counsel of the\n\nalien’s    choosing      who        is    authorized   to     practice     in    such\n\nproceedings.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A) (2007).                   Aliens have no\n\nconstitutional      right      to    counsel     during     removal   proceedings,\n\nhowever, as they are civil in nature and are designed solely to\n\ndetermine the respondent's eligibility to remain in the United\n\nStates.    INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984).\n\n            We have recognized that, under certain circumstances, the\n\nabridgement of access to counsel in removal proceedings may amount\n\nto a denial of due process.              See, e.g., Mekhoukh, 358 F.3d at 128-\n\n29.   But we agree with the BIA that the IJ did not deprive Essen of\n\ndue process by ultimately requiring him to go forward pro se.\n\nStarting    at    the   outset       of    the   removal    proceedings,    the   IJ\n\nrepeatedly informed Essen of his right to counsel and provided him\n\na list of legal services agencies.               Despite this information, and\n\na number of continuances--at least one of them for the express\n\npurpose of providing him additional time to seek representation--\n\nEssen never did obtain counsel.                  Indeed, even when Essen was\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\feventually heard on his application, he did not claim to have\n\nretained counsel, but simply produced a letter showing that a\n\nlawyer he had contacted could not have attended the hearing on his\n\nbehalf.\n\n            By that point, the IJ had told Essen of his right to\n\ncounsel on three occasions, once in writing; had encouraged him to\n\nutilize the list of legal services agencies on five occasions; and\n\nhad granted approximately fourteen months' worth of continuances.\n\nEssen had ample opportunity, then, to retain an attorney before his\n\nclaims    for   relief   were   heard   on    the     merits.     Under   these\n\ncircumstances, the ultimate adjudication of Essen's case without\n\ncounsel did not offend due process.          See Mekhoukh, 358 F.3d at 129\n\n(finding no denial of due process where IJ required alien to\n\nproceed pro se after having informed him of his right to counsel at\n\nthe outset of the removal proceedings, provided him with a list of\n\ncontacts, and continued proceedings for three months).\n\n            We disagree with Essen that our decision in Herbert v.\n\nAshcroft,   325   F.3d   68   (1st   Cir.    2003),    supports   a   different\n\nconclusion.     In that case we reversed an IJ's denial of a motion to\n\nreopen removal proceedings following the entry of an order of\n\nremoval in the absence of either the petitioner or his attorney.\n\nId. at 71-72.       Before the IJ decided to proceed in absentia,\n\nhowever, the petitioner's counsel had filed an emergency motion for\n\na continuance explaining that he had been unexpectedly called to\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fappear before a federal magistrate judge in another matter at the\n\nsame time as the scheduled hearing before the IJ--a fact that\n\nremained unknown to his client prior to the hearing.   Id.   Here, in\n\ncontrast, the lawyer who wrote to Essen before the December 7\n\nhearing never sought a continuance (or, for that matter, did\n\nanything to indicate his involvement in the case to the IJ), and\n\nEssen himself appeared for the hearing, as he had on several\n\noccasions beforehand, without any expectation that counsel would be\n\nthere.   Herbert, in which we did not even reach the petitioner's\n\ndue process claim, id. at 72 n.2, does not help Essen with his.\n\nThe petition for review is denied.\n\n     So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

In those proceedings,\n\naliens    are    also   afforded         the   statutory    privilege    \"of    being\n\nrepresented, at no expense to the Government, by counsel of the\n\nalien’s    choosing      who        is    authorized   to     practice     in    such\n\nproceedings.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A) (2007).                   Aliens have no\n\nconstitutional      right      to    counsel     during     removal   proceedings,\n\nhowever, as they are civil in nature and are designed solely to\n\ndetermine the respondent's eligibility to remain in the United\n\nStates.    INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111265\"><a href=\"/opinion/111265/ins-v-lopez-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1038 (1984).\n\n            We have recognized that, under certain circumstances, the\n\nabridgement of access to counsel in removal proceedings may amount\n\nto a denial of due process.              See, e.g., Mekhoukh, 358 F.3d at 128-\n\n29.   But we agree with the BIA that the IJ did not deprive Essen of\n\ndue process by ultimately requiring him to go forward pro se.\n\nStarting    at    the   outset       of    the   removal    proceedings,    the   IJ\n\nrepeatedly informed Essen of his right to counsel and provided him\n\na list of legal services agencies.               Despite this information, and\n\na number of continuances--at least one of them for the express\n\npurpose of providing him additional time to seek representation--\n\nEssen never did obtain counsel.                  Indeed, even when Essen was\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\feventually heard on his application, he did not claim to have\n\nretained counsel, but simply produced a letter showing that a\n\nlawyer he had contacted could not have attended the hearing on his\n\nbehalf.\n\n            By that point, the IJ had told Essen of his right to\n\ncounsel on three occasions, once in writing; had encouraged him to\n\nutilize the list of legal services agencies on five occasions; and\n\nhad granted approximately fourteen months' worth of continuances.\n\nEssen had ample opportunity, then, to retain an attorney before his\n\nclaims    for   relief   were   heard   on    the     merits.     Under   these\n\ncircumstances, the ultimate adjudication of Essen's case without\n\ncounsel did not offend due process.          See Mekhoukh, 358 F.3d at 129\n\n(finding no denial of due process where IJ required alien to\n\nproceed pro se after having informed him of his right to counsel at\n\nthe outset of the removal proceedings, provided him with a list of\n\ncontacts, and continued proceedings for three months).\n\n            We disagree with Essen that our decision in Herbert v.\n\nAshcroft,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200420\"><a href=\"/opinion/200420/herbert-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1st   Cir.    2003),    supports   a   different\n\nconclusion.     In that case we reversed an IJ's denial of a motion to\n\nreopen removal proceedings following the entry of an order of\n\nremoval in the absence of either the petitioner or his attorney.\n\nId. at 71-72.       Before the IJ decided to proceed in absentia,\n\nhowever, the petitioner's counsel had filed an emergency motion for\n\na continuance explaining that he had been unexpectedly called to\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fappear before a federal magistrate judge in another matter at the\n\nsame time as the scheduled hearing before the IJ--a fact that\n\nremained unknown to his client prior to the hearing.   Id.   Here, in\n\ncontrast, the lawyer who wrote to Essen before the December 7\n\nhearing never sought a continuance (or, for that matter, did\n\nanything to indicate his involvement in the case to the IJ), and\n\nEssen himself appeared for the hearing, as he had on several\n\noccasions beforehand, without any expectation that counsel would be\n\nthere.   Herbert, in which we did not even reach the petitioner's\n\ndue process claim, id. at 72 n.2, does not help Essen with his.\n\nThe petition for review is denied.\n\n     So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f</pre>",
