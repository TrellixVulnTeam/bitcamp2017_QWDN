Rodríguez, with whom Joseph S. Berman and Berman &\nDowell were on brief, for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief,\nAppellate Division, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United\nStates Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 27, 2007\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.          On March 26, 2004, a jury\n\nfound Appellant, Fernando Gil Carmona (\"Gil\"), guilty of: (1)\n\npossession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of\n\ncocaine, in violation of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act\n\n(\"MDLEA\"), 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a),1 and (2) conspiracy to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in\n\nviolation of 46 U.S.C. § 70506(b).2        On appeal, we face a question\n\nof first impression for this Court: whether the jurisdictional\n\ncomponent of the MDLEA, 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a), violates the Fifth\n\nand Sixth Amendments.     Without reaching the merits, we find that\n\nany potential error by the district court was harmless.\n\n                            I. Background\n\n          Gil is a Colombian national. His legal troubles began on\n\nthe morning of October 17, 2003, when he and two other individuals\n\ndeparted the Dominican Republic on a vessel bound for Puerto Rico.\n\nThat evening, a patrol aircraft of the U.S. Immigration and Customs\n\nEnforcement   Agency   (\"ICE\")   spotted    Gil's   vessel   approximately\n\ntwenty-five nautical miles northwest of Puerto Rico--i.e., one\n\nnautical mile outside the twenty-four mile contiguous zone of the\n\n\n\n1\n   The briefs and relevant cases cite to the MDLEA under the now\nrepealed 46 U.S.C. app. §§ 1901 et seq. (repealed 2006). We will\ncite to the MDLEA's codification at 46 U.S.C. §§ 70501 et seq.\n(Supp. 2006).\n2\n   Appellant was also convicted of attempting into import to the\nUnited States five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21\nU.S.C. § 952(a).\n\n                                   -2-\n\fUnited States.     The vessel was traveling without lights southeast\n\ntowards Puerto Rico at a speed of ten to twelve knots.                  In the\n\nearly morning of October 18, 2003, the United States Coast Guard\n\n(\"USCG\") Cutter NORTHLAND initiated pursuit of the vessel.                  When\n\nthe NORTHLAND encountered the vessel, it was dead in the water.              As\n\nthe   NORTHLAND    approached,   the   vessel     started    its   engine    and\n\ncontinued on a southeast course towards Puerto Rico.                 While in\n\npursuit, the NORTHLAND's crew observed the occupants of the vessel\n\ndumping bales of cocaine overboard.            The NORTHLAND then requested\n\nassistance from an ICE Marine Unit.            The ICE unit interdicted the\n\nvessel   approximately    twenty-one      to    twenty-two   nautical    miles\n\nnorthwest of Puerto Rico,3 apprehended Gil, and transported him to\n\nPuerto Rico, where he was arrested.             The vessel did not have a\n\nflag, identifying marks, or paperwork establishing that it was\n\nregistered in any nation.        After the interception of the vessel,\n\nthe USCG recovered fifteen bales from the area where the vessel was\n\ninterdicted.      The bales contained over 300 kilograms of cocaine.\n\n           At trial, the district court stated that the MDLEA's\n\njurisdictional provision, 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a),4 requires the trial\n\n\n3\n   The record indicates that this area, approximately twenty miles\nnorthwest of Punta Borinquen and fifteen miles north of Desecheo\nIsland, is a common entrance point for vessels carrying contraband\nand illegal aliens.\n4\n  Section 70504(a) states in relevant part that \"[j]urisdiction of\nthe United States with respect to a vessel subject to this chapter\nis not an element of an offense. Jurisdictional issues arising\nunder this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be\n\n                                    -3-\n\fjudge to decide whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of\n\nthe United States as a preliminary issue of law, rather than submit\n\nthe issue to the jury.     Accordingly, the court said that it would\n\nhear    testimony   to   ascertain   whether    the    United    States   had\n\njurisdiction over the vessel.\n\n            The Government argued to the district court that the\n\nvessel was subject to United States jurisdiction under § 70502(c)\n\n(1)(F),5 because the vessel was interdicted within the twenty-five\n\nmile contiguous zone from the shores of the United States,6 and the\n\nvessel   was   \"entering   the   United    States\"    or   was   a   \"hovering\n\nvessel.\"7\n\n\ndetermined solely by the trial judge.\"\n5\n   Section 70502(c)(1)(F) establishes that: \"(1) In this Chapter,\nthe term 'vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'\nincludes- (F) a vessel in the contiguous zone of the United States\n. . . , that (i) is entering the United States; (ii) has departed\nthe United States; or (iii) is a hovering vessel . . . .\"\n6\n   Presidential Proclamation 7219 of August 2, 1999 defines the\ncontiguous zone of the United States to extend to twenty-four\nnautical miles from the baselines of the United States, including\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Proclamation No. 7219, 64 Fed.\nReg. 48,701 (Sept. 8, 1999).\n7\n    A \"hovering vessel\" is defined as:\n\n       (1) any vessel which is found or kept off the coast of\n       the United States within or without the customs waters,\n       if, from the history, conduct, character or location of\n       the vessel, it is reasonable to believe that such vessel\n       is being used or may be used to introduce or promote or\n       facilitate the introduction or attempted introduction of\n       merchandise into the United States in violation of the\n       laws of the United States; and\n       (2) any vessel which has visited a vessel described in\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           Gil argued that it is unconstitutional for a judge to\n\ndecide whether the \"vessel [was] subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States\" because the decision requires factual determinations\n\nregarding the location of the vessel which should be decided by a\n\njury. Relying on the express language of the statute, the district\n\ncourt disagreed and ruled that the United States had jurisdiction\n\nover the vessel as a matter of law.       Gil renewed his challenge to\n\n§ 70504(a) at the close of evidence, and the motion was again\n\ndenied. Subsequently, the district court instructed the jury: \"You\n\nare instructed as a matter of law that the vessel in question is a\n\nvessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.              I have\n\nmade that determination.\"\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n           The issue before this Court is whether the MDLEA's\n\nrequirement that a \"vessel [be] subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited   States\"   is   an   essential   element   of   the   crime   to   be\n\ndetermined by a jury, rather than by a judge, as mandated by\n\nCongress in § 70504(a).        We do not, however, have to reach the\n\nmerits of this decision because, we find that the record compels\n\nthe finding that if there was any error below, it was harmless.\n\n           A defendant's claim that his constitutional rights were\n\nviolated by the removal of an element of the uncharged offense from\n\n\n     paragraph (1).\n\n19 U.S.C. § 1401(k).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe jury's consideration is ordinarily reviewed for harmless error.\n\nNeder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 13 (2002).                   Under this\n\nstandard, we must determine \"whether the record contains evidence\n\nthat could rationally lead to a contrary finding with regard to the\n\nomitted element.\"    Id. at 19.\n\n           The record before us could not lead to a conclusion\n\ncontrary to the district court's finding that the vessel was\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.                Indeed, Gil\n\nconceded that he \"did not make a factual argument in opposition to\n\nthe government's presentation\" on jurisdiction over the vessel.\n\nThis omission alone suggests that the asserted error was harmless.\n\nSee id. (finding error in failing to submit element of an offense\n\nto jury harmless where \"defendant did not, and apparently could\n\nnot, bring forth facts contesting the omitted element\").\n\n           Furthermore, the record establishes beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that jurisdiction over the vessel existed under § 70502(c)\n\n(1)(F)(iii), which in relevant part, extends jurisdiction over \"a\n\nvessel located in the contiguous zone of the United States . . .\n\nthat . . . is a hovering vessel,\" as both of those concepts are\n\nabove defined.     The vessel was indisputably \"located within the\n\ncontiguous zone of the United States,\" i.e., less than twenty-four\n\nnautical   miles   from   the   shores    of   Puerto   Rico,   when   it   was\n\ninterdicted.     Although Gil argues (without citation to authority\n\nand contrary to logic) that the position of the boat when spotted,\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\frather than interdicted, determines its position for purposes of\n\n§ 70502(c)(1)(F), he does not (nor can he) contest that, when\n\nseized, the vessel was within the contiguous zone.\n\n            Moreover, the vessel was clearly a \"hovering vessel\" as\n\ndefined by 19 U.S.C. § 1401(K): as explained above, the vessel was\n\nlocated    in    an   area     known   as    \"a   common    entrance    point      for\n\ncontraband,\" was traveling without lights at night, and was dead in\n\nthe water until the USCG approached -- at which point the vessel\n\nattempted to evade capture while its occupants jettisoned bales of\n\ncocaine.        Again,   Gil    does   not    identify     any   evidence     to   the\n\ncontrary.       We must conclude beyond a reasonable doubt, then, that\n\nthe jury would have found Gil guilty even if the question of\n\njurisdiction      over   Gil's     vessel     had   been    submitted    to    them,\n\nrendering any error in failing to do so harmless.                  See Neder, 527\n\nU.S. at 19.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f",

Accordingly, the court said that it would hear testimony to ascertain whether the United States had jurisdiction over the vessel.</p>\n<p>The Government argued to the district court that the vessel was subject to United States jurisdiction under § 70502(c)(1)(F),<sup>[5]</sup> because the vessel was interdicted within the twenty-five mile contiguous zone from the shores of the United States,<sup>[6]</sup> and the vessel was \"entering the United States\" or was a \"hovering vessel.\"<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Gil argued that it is unconstitutional for a judge to decide whether the \"vessel [was] subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" because the decision requires factual determinations regarding the location of the vessel which should be decided by a jury. Relying on the express language of the statute, the district court disagreed and ruled that the United States had jurisdiction over the vessel as a matter of law. Gil renewed his challenge to § 70504(a) at the close of evidence, and the motion was again denied. Subsequently, the district court instructed the jury: \"You are instructed as a matter of law that the vessel in question is a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. I have made that determination.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The issue before this Court is whether the MDLEA's requirement that a \"vessel [be] subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" is an essential element of the crime to be determined by a jury, rather than by a judge, as mandated by Congress in § 70504(a). We do not, however, have to reach the merits of this decision because, we find that the record compels the finding that if there was any error below, it was harmless.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> A defendant's claim that his constitutional rights were violated by the removal of an element of the charged offense from the jury's consideration is ordinarily reviewed for harmless error. <i>Neder v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span> (1999). Under this standard, we must determine \"whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with regard to the omitted element.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, Gil conceded that he \"did not make a factual argument in opposition to the government's presentation\" on jurisdiction over the vessel. This omission alone suggests that the asserted error was harmless. <i>See id.</i> (finding error in failing to submit element of an offense to jury harmless where \"defendant did not, and apparently could not, bring forth facts contesting the omitted element\").</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the record establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that jurisdiction over the vessel existed under § 70502(c)(1)(F)(iii), which in relevant part, extends jurisdiction over \"a vessel located in the contiguous zone of the United States . . . that . . . is a hovering vessel,\" as both of those concepts are above defined. The vessel was indisputably \"located within the contiguous zone of the United States,\" <i>i.e.,</i> less than twenty-four nautical miles from the shores of Puerto Rico, when it was interdicted. Although Gil argues (without citation to authority and contrary to logic) that the position of the boat when spotted, rather than interdicted, determines its position for purposes of § 70502(c)(1)(F), he does not (nor can he) contest that, when seized, the vessel was within the contiguous zone.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the vessel was clearly a \"hovering vessel\" as defined by 19 U.S.C. § 1401(k): as explained above, the vessel was located in an area known as \"a common entrance point for contraband,\" was traveling without lights at night, and was dead in the water until the USCG approachedat which point the vessel attempted to evade capture while its occupants jettisoned bales of cocaine. Again, Gil does not identify any evidence to the contrary. We must conclude beyond a reasonable doubt, then, that the jury would have found Gil guilty even if the question of jurisdiction over Gil's vessel had been submitted to them, rendering any error in failing to do so harmless. <i>See </i><i>Neder,</i> 527 U.S. at 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
