George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n              and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Charles F.

These sentencing appeals — one by the\n\ndefendant and one by the government — arise out of a sentence\n\nimposed during the uncertain period between the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), and its\n\nsubsequent decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005).   Although Blakely foreshadowed the demise of the mandatory\n\nsystem of federal sentencing guidelines then in effect, it did not\n\nadumbrate the form (if any) in which the guidelines would survive.\n\nBooker answered that question, see 125 S. Ct. at 756-57, but not in\n\na way that had been widely anticipated.\n\n           The district court in this case, like every district\n\ncourt that confronted sentencing issues in the interval between\n\nBlakely and Booker, was forced to improvise.                  The court here\n\nsettled upon a methodology that it had developed in a similarly\n\nsituated case.    See United States v. Zompa, 326 F. Supp. 2d 176,\n\n178 (D. Me. 2004).   As matters turned out, Zompa did not correctly\n\nanticipate the contours of the Supreme Court's later decision in\n\nBooker.\n\n           Both   sides   objected   at    the   time   and   both   have   now\n\nappealed from the sentence.      They argue that, in hindsight, the\n\ndistrict court did not use an acceptable sentencing methodology.\n\nThat is patently so.\n\n           We need go no further.      Under the peculiar circumstances\n\nof this case, it is our view that the district court ought to have\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe first opportunity to reappraise the facts in light of Booker.\n\nWe therefore summarily vacate the defendant's sentence and remand\n\nfor resentencing.   We express no opinion on what the sentence\n\nshould be or on any of the district court's earlier sentencing\n\ndeterminations.\n\n\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
