Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rusmir Begovic on brief pro se.\n     Lee Stephen MacPhee and Morrison Mahoney LLP on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 17, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam.     Plaintiff Rusmir Begovic has worked as a\n\nmachinist at defendant Water Pik Technologies, Inc. since 1993.             A\n\nnative of Bosnia, he brings this action alleging that he was\n\nsubjected to discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title\n\nVII.   See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2, 2000e-3.                 In particular, he\n\ncontends that four work-related events-–the rejection of his two\n\napplications for job promotions; the discontinuance of his tuition\n\nreimbursement benefit; and his failure to obtain a higher hourly\n\nwage-–amounted to disparate treatment based on his national origin.\n\nHe also claims that several of these events constituted acts of\n\nretaliation for his earlier complaints about discrimination.             From\n\nan award of summary judgment for defendant, plaintiff now appeals.\n\nWe affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the district\n\ncourt’s opinion, adding only the following comments.\n\n            First.    Based on the record before it at the time of its\n\ndecision,    the     district   court’s    ruling   was    clearly   correct.\n\nDefendant had submitted evidence providing reasonable explanations\n\nas to why plaintiff received neither job promotion, why his tuition\n\nreimbursement was discontinued, and how his pay rate had increased\n\nover time.    Even on the arguendo assumption that plaintiff had\n\nestablished a prima facie case in each instance, such evidence put\n\nthe burden back on him to show that defendant’s cited reasons were\n\na pretext for discrimination or retaliation. See, e.g., Rathbun v.\n\nAutozone, Inc., 361 F.3d 62, 71-72 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fburden shifting in failure-to-promote context); Calero-Cerezo v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2004) (same in\n\nretaliation context).             Because plaintiff proffered virtually no\n\nevidence     in   this       regard,   the   award   of    summary   judgment   was\n\nappropriate.           “Even    in   employment    discrimination     cases    where\n\nelusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue, summary\n\njudgment is appropriate if the non-moving party rests merely upon\n\nconclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported\n\nspeculation.”          Benoit v. Technical Mfg. Corp., 331 F.3d 166, 173\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).                   Plaintiff’s\n\nassertion that he submitted direct evidence of discrimination and\n\nretaliation, and thereby rendered the burden-shifting framework\n\ninapplicable, is belied by the record.               Also insufficient to stave\n\noff summary judgment is his contention that the credibility of\n\ndefendant’s affiants is a matter for the jury.                   See Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256-57 (1986).\n\n             Second.         At several points in his appellate papers,\n\nplaintiff complains that he was denied an adequate opportunity to\n\nconduct discovery.             This argument is never developed and can be\n\nrejected for that reason alone.                   See, e.g., United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (“issues adverted to in a\n\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived”). But it fails for other reasons\n\nas   well.        To    be     sure,   “trial     courts   should    refrain    from\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fentertaining summary judgment motions until after the parties have\n\nhad a sufficient opportunity to conduct necessary discovery.”\n\nVelez v. Awning Windows, Inc., 375 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2004).   Yet\n\nthis rule “is not self-executing”; a party needing additional\n\ndiscovery must “make the court aware of its plight.”     Id.   This is\n\ntypically accomplished by the filing of a Rule 56(f) motion or its\n\nfunctional equivalent.   See id. at 40.\n\n          [S]uch a motion must (1) be presented in a timely manner,\n          (2) show good cause for the failure to discover the\n          necessary facts sooner; (3) set forth a plausible basis\n          for believing that the necessary facts probably exist and\n          can be learned in a reasonable time; and (4) establish\n          that the sought facts, if found, will “influence the\n          outcome of the pending motion for summary judgment.”\n\nAdorno v. Crowley Towing & Transp. Co., ___ F.3d ___, ___, 2006 WL\n\n852363, at *4 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Resolution Trust Corp. v.\n\nNorth Bridge Assocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n          Plaintiff never invoked this safeguard below.        He did\n\nvoice some general complaints that defendant was attempting to\n\navoid discovery, but “[t]hose cryptic allusions failed to set any\n\nbasis for believing that some discoverable material facts did\n\nexist.”   Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Munic. Wholesale Elec. Co.,\n\n840 F.2d 985, 989 (1st Cir. 1988).    He did also remark at one point\n\nthat further information was needed about a specific matter (the\n\nrequirements for the second job opening and the winning candidate’s\n\nqualifications therefor).    Yet plaintiff did not explain what\n\nadditional discovery was contemplated.      More important, he never\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fcited Rule 56(f), never filed a motion or its functional equivalent\n\nsatisfying the above-mentioned requirements, and never directly\n\nrequested that a summary judgment ruling be deferred pending\n\nfurther discovery.            Instead, he filed an opposition to defendant’s\n\nsummary judgment motion and, a few days later, filed his own motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment.                This hardly sufficed to inform the\n\ncourt of his alleged plight.                 Cf. Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-\n\nSquibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 1996) (upholding denial of Rule\n\n56(f)   motion     because,          inter   alia,    “[a]ppellants       filed   their\n\noriginal       opposition       to    summary      judgment     without    previously\n\ninforming the court of their inability to properly oppose summary\n\njudgment due to incomplete discovery”); Hebert v. Wicklund, 744\n\nF.2d    218,    222     n.4    (1st   Cir.    1984)    (noting    that     Rule   56(f)\n\ncontinuances are frequently granted “where the moving party has\n\nsole possession of the relevant facts,” but that “this maxim\n\nrepresents a factor that the court should consider only after the\n\nnon-moving party has complied with the requirements of the rule”).\n\n               Third.    Even assuming arguendo that plaintiff adequately\n\ninvoked Rule 56(f) and that the court erred in not allowing further\n\ndiscovery, the result would not change. As mentioned, the only new\n\nfacts cited by plaintiff in this regard concerned the requirements\n\nfor the second job opening and the qualifications of the successful\n\ncandidate.         Yet    plaintiff          did   eventually     obtain    documents\n\ndescribing these matters, which he attached to a motion to amend\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fthe judgment.       Even if these materials were considered, his legal\n\nclaims would fare no better.             For example, their respective job\n\napplications provide no evidence that plaintiff was more qualified\n\nthan the winning candidate.             Indeed, the new documents, together\n\nwith another attached to the motion to amend, actually undermine\n\nplaintiff’s case in one respect. Defendant has averred that he was\n\nrejected for the second job opening mainly because of an inability\n\nto   communicate       well   with    others,    noting     that        he    had   been\n\ndisciplined earlier for “inappropriate behavior” toward a co-\n\nemployee.      The     job    listing    confirms    that     an    “[a]bility         to\n\ncommunicate clearly” and “provide direction” was a requirement.\n\nAnd plaintiff’s 2002 performance review, prepared two months prior\n\nto     his    rejection       here,      gives     him    a      low         mark      for\n\n“teamwork/communication,” stating that he “needs to work on his\n\ncommunications with others” and on “working more cooperatively”\n\nwith co-employees.       Plaintiff has thus provided no reason to think\n\nthat   further      discovery    would    have    bolstered        his       attempt   to\n\nestablish    that    defendant’s      cited     reasons   were      a    pretext       for\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation.\n\n             Fourth.    We have no occasion here to address whether pro\n\nse litigants are entitled to notice regarding their evidentiary\n\nburden at the summary judgment stage. See generally Ruiz Rivera v.\n\nRiley, 209 F.3d 24, 26-27 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2000); Posadas de Puerto\n\nRico, Inc., v. Radin, 856 F.2d 399, 401 (1st Cir. 1988).                      Plaintiff\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fhas voiced no complaint in this regard on appeal.                           And his\n\nsubmissions below, which contained a citation to the very page in\n\na   Supreme    Court   opinion        where   the    Rule   56(e)    methodology   is\n\ndiscussed, see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986),\n\nsuggest that he was not unfamiliar therewith.\n\n              Fifth.      To    the    extent       plaintiff   is   alleging   that\n\ndefendant retaliated against him by giving him a less favorable\n\n2003 performance review than he deserved, we note that his 2002\n\nreview was no better.          Regarding the alleged denial of a merit pay\n\nincrease in 2004, plaintiff has provided no evidence that he was\n\npaid less than similarly situated employees outside the protected\n\nclass, as the district court observed.                      And plaintiff has not\n\ndenied that he received a substantial pay hike in May 2004.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f",

More important, he never\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fcited Rule 56(f), never filed a motion or its functional equivalent\n\nsatisfying the above-mentioned requirements, and never directly\n\nrequested that a summary judgment ruling be deferred pending\n\nfurther discovery.            Instead, he filed an opposition to defendant’s\n\nsummary judgment motion and, a few days later, filed his own motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment.                This hardly sufficed to inform the\n\ncourt of his alleged plight.                 Cf. Ayala-Gerena v.

Even assuming arguendo that plaintiff adequately\n\ninvoked Rule 56(f) and that the court erred in not allowing further\n\ndiscovery, the result would not change. As mentioned, the only new\n\nfacts cited by plaintiff in this regard concerned the requirements\n\nfor the second job opening and the qualifications of the successful\n\ncandidate.         Yet    plaintiff          did   eventually     obtain    documents\n\ndescribing these matters, which he attached to a motion to amend\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fthe judgment.       Even if these materials were considered, his legal\n\nclaims would fare no better.             For example, their respective job\n\napplications provide no evidence that plaintiff was more qualified\n\nthan the winning candidate.             Indeed, the new documents, together\n\nwith another attached to the motion to amend, actually undermine\n\nplaintiff’s case in one respect. Defendant has averred that he was\n\nrejected for the second job opening mainly because of an inability\n\nto   communicate       well   with    others,    noting     that        he    had   been\n\ndisciplined earlier for “inappropriate behavior” toward a co-\n\nemployee.      The     job    listing    confirms    that     an    “[a]bility         to\n\ncommunicate clearly” and “provide direction” was a requirement.\n\nAnd plaintiff’s 2002 performance review, prepared two months prior\n\nto     his    rejection       here,      gives     him    a      low         mark      for\n\n“teamwork/communication,” stating that he “needs to work on his\n\ncommunications with others” and on “working more cooperatively”\n\nwith co-employees.       Plaintiff has thus provided no reason to think\n\nthat   further      discovery    would    have    bolstered        his       attempt   to\n\nestablish    that    defendant’s      cited     reasons   were      a    pretext       for\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation.\n\n             Fourth.    We have no occasion here to address whether pro\n\nse litigants are entitled to notice regarding their evidentiary\n\nburden at the summary judgment stage.
