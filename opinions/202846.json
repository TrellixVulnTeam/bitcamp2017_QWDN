Juan and Maria Lopez\n\npetition for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\") affirming a decision of an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\")\n\ndenying them asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").             We deny the petition.\n\n             We glean the following facts from the record of the\n\nhearing before the IJ.        Juan and Maria Lopez are married citizens\n\nof Colombia. Juan Lopez (\"Lopez\") owned a trucking business in Don\n\nMatias, Colombia.     On May 28, 1998, he was stopped while making a\n\ndelivery     by   members     of     the     guerilla   group   known      as    the\n\nRevolutionary     Armed     Forces    of     Colombia   (\"FARC\").       The     FARC\n\nguerillas held him for a short period of time, during which they\n\nbeat him and demanded that he inform them in the future about other\n\ntrucks they could hijack and rob.\n\n             After being released, Lopez reported his robbery and\n\nkidnapping to the police, but they reportedly did not investigate\n\nthe matter.       Lopez then approached a group known as Convivir,\n\nwhich, according to the record, was a quasi-private self-protection\n\norganization formed with the support of the Colombian government to\n\nhelp with such things as security of cargo transportation.                      With\n\nthe   help   of   Convivir,    the     police    then   arrested    five    people\n\nsuspected of being Lopez's assailants, two of whom Lopez ultimately\n\nidentified. However, the two posted bail and were released, and it\n\ndoes not appear that they were ever tried for the offense.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\f          The   Lopezes     continued       to   be   harassed   by    these   two\n\nsuspected assailants and others.        They received threatening phone\n\ncalls, and on one occasion, two people approached Maria Lopez at\n\nher workplace, looking for her husband.               After that incident, the\n\nLopezes moved to Monteria Cordoba, to stay with relatives. Shortly\n\nthereafter,   the   local    leader    of    Convivir     in   Don    Matias   was\n\nassassinated.   The Lopezes then moved to Medellin and sought visas\n\nto the United States.       Juan Lopez traveled to the United States on\n\nor about August 23, 1999, on a nonimmigrant visa for pleasure\n\ntravel, with authorization to stay in the United States until\n\nFebruary 22, 2000.   Maria Lopez traveled to the United States on or\n\nabout February 24, 2000, as a nonimmigrant working on a B-1 visa,\n\nwith authorization to remain until March 22, 2000.\n\n          On November 20, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\")1 issued them Notices to Appear.                On the Lopezes'\n\npre-hearing statement of May 29, 2003, they stated an intention to\n\npursue asylum and withholding of removal claims. Their application\n\nfor asylum was ultimately filed on April 28, 2005.                   On that same\n\ndate, the Lopezes appeared before the IJ, who ruled that they did\n\nnot qualify for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      On March 1, 2003, the functions of the INS were transferred\nto the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security Act of\n2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471(a), 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified\nat 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe CAT.      They appealed to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the\n\ndecision of the IJ on August 10, 2006.\n\n              We will uphold decisions of the BIA \"if supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"          INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                             The\n\nsubstantial evidence standard applies to asylum and withholding\n\nclaims as well as to claims brought under the CAT.                      See Settenda v.\n\nAshcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).                   \"To reverse the BIA, we\n\nmust    be    persuaded   that    'the       evidence    not     only    supports   that\n\nconclusion, but compels it.'\"                Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 53\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1).\n\nBecause the BIA adopted and affirmed the decision of the IJ, we\n\nreview the IJ's decision as part of the final decision of the BIA.\n\nHernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              An application for asylum must be filed within one year\n\nof   the     alien's   arrival    in    the    United        States,    absent   changed\n\ncircumstances affecting eligibility for asylum or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances      relating      to    the    delay     in    filing.      8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1158(a)(2)(B), (D).        Both the IJ and the BIA found that more than\n\na year had passed between the petitioners' respective entries in\n\n1999 and 2000, and the filing of their application for asylum in\n\n2005.      The petitioners did not allege any changed circumstances or\n\notherwise explain their delay in filing, and indeed conceded the\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fissue before the IJ, and we therefore have no jurisdiction to\n\nreview the determination that the one-year time limit had expired.\n\nId. § 1158(a)(3); see Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n             To qualify for withholding of removal, the petitioners\n\nmust show that their \"life or freedom would be threatened in [the\n\nremoval country] because of [their] race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"            8\n\nU.S.C.   §   1231(b)(3)(A).   \"As    a    general   rule,   withholding   is\n\nmandatory if an alien 'establish[es] that it is more likely than\n\nnot that [he] would be subject to persecution on one of the\n\nspecified grounds.'\"     INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 419\n\n(1999) (quoting INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30 (1984)); accord\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372-73 (1st Cir. 2003) (applying\n\n\"more likely than not\" standard).         This is a tougher standard than\n\nthat for asylum, which requires only a \"well-founded fear of\n\npersecution.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 569 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999) (contrasting \"well-founded\n\nfear of persecution\" with \"clear probability of persecution\").\n\n             The IJ and the BIA found that the petitioners' incidents\n\nwith the FARC did not establish that they would more likely than\n\nnot be persecuted on account of one of the five protected grounds.\n\nPetitioners argue that Lopez was targeted because of his membership\n\nin Convivir.      However, the IJ found that the incidents Lopez\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\ftestified to were examples of criminal conduct, not persecution\n\nbased on one of the five protected categories.                    The BIA held\n\nfurther that the incidents themselves \"were not so menacing and\n\nimmediate as to rise to the level of persecution.\"                Our review of\n\nthe record supports the IJ's determination.               Lopez testified that,\n\nin each of the incidents in which he was harassed, the FARC members\n\nwere demanding that he give them information to aid in hijackings\n\nand robberies, as they had when he first encountered them, and not\n\nthat       he   was   being   targeted   because   of    his   affiliation   with\n\nConvivir.2        Therefore, we cannot say that the evidence compels a\n\nconclusion contrary to the IJ's.\n\n                To qualify for protection under the CAT, the petitioners\n\nmust show that it is \"more likely than not that [they] would be\n\ntortured if removed\" to Colombia.              8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); see\n\nSettenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 94 (1st Cir. 2004).                        \"To\n\nestablish a prima facie showing of torture, a petitioner must offer\n\nspecific showings that he or she will be subject to 'severe pain or\n\nsuffering, whether physical or mental' by or at 'the instigation of\n\nor with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other\n\nperson acting in an official capacity.'\"                Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d\n\n11, 17 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting 8 C.F.R. 208.18(a)(1)).\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      We do not reach the question of whether membership in\nConvivir qualifies as \"membership in a particular social group\"\nunder the statute.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          The   IJ   found   that   there   was   no   evidence   that   the\n\npetitioners would be subject to future torture, and the BIA held in\n\naddition that there was no evidence of government \"acquiescence\" in\n\nthe acts of the FARC such as would bring their actions under the\n\ndefinition of torture cited above.        While it may be that Lopez will\n\nbe subject to criminal pressures if removed to Colombia, the\n\npetitioners did not present any evidence that they would be faced\n\nwith torture, particularly such as would be done \"by or at the\n\ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\n\nofficial.\"   8 C.F.R. 208.18(a)(1).        Therefore, we cannot say that\n\nthe evidence compels an alternative result.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

However, the IJ found that the incidents Lopez\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\ftestified to were examples of criminal conduct, not persecution\n\nbased on one of the five protected categories.                    The BIA held\n\nfurther that the incidents themselves \"were not so menacing and\n\nimmediate as to rise to the level of persecution.\"                Our review of\n\nthe record supports the IJ's determination.               Lopez testified that,\n\nin each of the incidents in which he was harassed, the FARC members\n\nwere demanding that he give them information to aid in hijackings\n\nand robberies, as they had when he first encountered them, and not\n\nthat       he   was   being   targeted   because   of    his   affiliation   with\n\nConvivir.2        Therefore, we cannot say that the evidence compels a\n\nconclusion contrary to the IJ's.\n\n                To qualify for protection under the CAT, the petitioners\n\nmust show that it is \"more likely than not that [they] would be\n\ntortured if removed\" to Colombia.              8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); see\n\nSettenda v.
