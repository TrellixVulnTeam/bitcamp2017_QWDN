Carmen C. Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                 Torruella and Siler,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Alvin E. Entin, with whom Richard Della Fera was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Vernon B. Miles, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Vélez, United\nStates Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States\nAttorney, and Luke Cass, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 7, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f     SILER, Circuit Judge.          Jose Vazquez-Castro was convicted by a\n\njury of three counts:         (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute     cocaine;      (2)    possessing     cocaine    with    intent    to\n\ndistribute; and (3) possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug\n\ntrafficking.      He appeals the sufficiency of the evidence for the\n\nweapon charge in Count Three, and argues the district court erred\n\nby instructing the jury on the Pinkerton theory of liability.                  For\n\nthe following reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                        I.\n\nA.   The Undercover Sting Operation\n\n     DEA   Agents    Miguel    Melendez-Cruz,       Roberto   Cruz-Perez,      and\n\nJohnny Melendez organized an undercover operation to buy cocaine.\n\nThe targeted individuals included Carlos Rodriguez and Israel Ruiz.\n\nRodriguez had solicited Marcos Nunez-Retamar to be a \"runner,\" or\n\nan intermediary who earns commissions by matching suppliers of\n\ncocaine    with    buyers.         Nunez-Retamar     became    a     confidential\n\ninformant.\n\n     Agent Cruz-Perez instructed Nunez-Retamar to call Rodriguez\n\nand tell him that Cruz-Perez was his brother and he wanted to buy\n\nten kilograms of cocaine.          Cruz-Perez, Melendez, and Nunez-Retamar\n\nthen met with Rodriguez and Ruiz.            Nunez-Retamar introduced Cruz-\n\nPerez as his brother, and told Rodriguez and Ruiz that he wanted to\n\nbuy ten kilograms of cocaine. After conversing about the specifics\n\nof the deal, they came to an agreement to purchase the cocaine.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f      The next day, Rodriguez called to report that he had spoken\n\nwith the supplier and \"they wanted to do the deal\" in front of a\n\nrestaurant at a shopping mall that evening.                   Rodriguez and Ruiz\n\narrived at the designated time, but stated that their supplier did\n\nnot   like    the   area    because    they    saw    suspicious   vehicles   and\n\nuniformed patrols.\n\n      Cruz-Perez made several recorded calls to Rodriguez and Ruiz\n\nthe following day.         Ruiz said that no one wants to \"release the\n\ntickets,\" which meant that the suppliers did not want to provide\n\nthe   drugs   without      first    seeing    the    money.    Cruz-Perez   asked\n\nRodriguez if he had \"iron,\" meaning firearms.                 Rodriguez replied,\n\n\"I carry steel on my waist.\"\n\n      Cruz-Perez, Melendez, Nunez-Retamar, and Rodriguez agreed to\n\nmeet at a restaurant for the exchange at 5:30 p.m. on June 23,\n\n2006. Cruz-Perez placed agents around the premises to make arrests\n\nonce the drugs arrived.            They planned to call these agents after\n\nseeing the drugs and ask them to \"bring the money in,\" which was\n\nthe code phrase ordering the arrests of the dealers.\n\n      Cruz-Perez, Melendez, and Nunez-Retamar arrived first, and\n\nwaited inside the restaurant.           Rodriguez called and said he could\n\nnot attend the meeting because his car broke down.                 At 6:30 p.m.,\n\na Mitsubishi automobile parked in front of the restaurant, with\n\nRuiz in the back seat and Angel Cruz-Perez (\"Angel\") driving.\n\nVazquez-Castro was also in the vehicle, sitting in the front\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpassenger seat.   Ruiz exited the vehicle, and Angel and Vazquez-\n\nCastro left the area. Ruiz entered the restaurant, told Cruz-Perez\n\nthat the \"kilos were there,\" and asked about the money.    The agent\n\nreplied that \"not a penny was going to be shown until\" he \"saw the\n\nkilos.\" Ruiz responded that he needed to speak \"with the owners of\n\nthe material.\"\n\n     Ruiz left the restaurant, made a telephone call outside, and\n\nreturned to again inquire about the money.      The agents repeated\n\nthat there would be no money until the drugs were shown, and Ruiz\n\nleft to make another telephone call.   The Mitsubishi returned with\n\nAngel driving and Vazquez-Castro in the front passenger seat. Ruiz\n\ngot into the back seat.      Cruz-Perez approached the Mitsubishi,\n\nopened the rear passenger side door, and asked whether they were\n\n\"going to negotiate?\"    Angel said \"yes,\" and instructed Vazquez-\n\nCastro to \"go get that.\"\n\n     Vazquez-Castro exited the vehicle, walked to an Isuzu \"about\n\nsix vehicles away,\" and got into the rear passenger side.     A few\n\nminutes later, Vazquez-Castro exited the vehicle, and returned with\n\nhis hand tucked near the left side of his body and apparently\n\ncarrying something inside his sweater.      Vazquez-Castro got back\n\ninto the Mitsubishi.    Ruiz opened the door and said, it is \"here.\"\n\nCruz-Perez instructed Nunez-Retamar to check the drugs.      Nunez-\n\nRetamar looked in the passenger's side \"for several seconds,\" then\n\ntold Cruz-Perez to \"[b]ring the money, there is a kilo.\"\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f       Angel and Vazquez-Castro exited the vehicle and walked into\n\nthe restaurant, where they were arrested.                     Ruiz was arrested\n\noutside, as were the two individuals in the Isuzu.                When Melendez\n\narrested the driver of the Isuzu, the driver said he was armed and\n\n\"[t]he weapon is under the carpet in the driver's seat, on the\n\nfloor.\" The agent then found a loaded .45 caliber pistol folded in\n\nthe floor mat on the driver's side of the Isuzu.                The agents also\n\nretrieved a blue bag containing five kilograms of cocaine from the\n\nback   seat   of   the    Isuzu   and   a     kilogram   of   cocaine    from   the\n\nMitsubishi's glove box.\n\nB.     The Trial\n\n       Vazquez-Castro and his co-defendants were indicted on three\n\ncounts. Count One charged Vazquez-Castro and others with knowingly\n\nand unlawfully conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five\n\nkilograms     or   more    of     cocaine      in   violation    of     21   U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846.                Count Two charged him with\n\npossessing with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of\n\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2.       Count Three charged, \"[t]he defendants herein,\n\nwhile aiding and abetting each other, did possess, use and carry .\n\n. . a .45 caliber Ruger pistol . . . in furtherance of a drug\n\ntrafficking crime\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A) and\n\n(c)(1)(A)(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f     At trial, Vazquez-Castro moved under Rule 29(a) for a judgment\n\nof acquittal on Count Three. The district court denied the motion.\n\nIt held that, even though the Government had expressly charged\n\nVazquez-Castro under an aiding and abetting theory in Count Three,\n\nthe jury may be instructed to consider the liability theory from\n\nPinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946), as an alternative\n\ntheory for conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).           The district\n\ncourt found that \"since both parties argued the foreseeability\n\nfactor [of the Pinkerton theory] during the Rule 29(a) discussion,\n\na factor which is not an element of the standard of proof of the\n\naiding and abetting theory, . . . the alternative Pinkerton theory\n\nof liability is justified.\" The court later instructed the jury on\n\nboth theories of liability.\n\n     Vazquez-Castro was convicted and sentenced to 120 months for\n\nCounts One and Two to be served concurrently, and 60 months for\n\nCount Three to be served consecutively, for a total of 180 months\n\nimprisonment.\n\n                                   II.\n\n     On appeal, Vazquez-Castro makes three related arguments.            He\n\nargues there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the weapon\n\ncharge, and maintains that the district court therefore erred in\n\ndenying his Rule 29 motion before the case was submitted to the\n\njury.   He also contends that, because the government expressly\n\nincluded   an   aiding   and   abetting   theory   of   liability   in   the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\findictment,       the   court   erred   by    instructing   the   jury   on   the\n\nPinkerton theory of liability.1\n\n     We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for acquittal de\n\nnovo.       See United States v. Rosado-Perez, 605 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).       We review the jury instructions for plain error because\n\nVazquez-Castro did not object to them at trial.             See Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 52(b); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).                   In\n\nanalyzing Vazquez-Castro's sufficiency claim, \"we must affirm the\n\nconviction if after de novo review of the evidence taken in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government, we conclude that a rational\n\nfactfinder could find that the government proved the essential\n\nelements of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"             United States v.\n\nMarin, 523 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nA.   The Pinkerton Instruction\n\n     An aiding and abetting theory of liability requires a higher\n\nmens rea than a Pinkerton theory of liability.               United States v.\n\nShea, 150 F.3d 44, 50 (1st Cir. 1998), abrogated on other grounds,\n\nUnited States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292 (1st Cir. 2000).                   To\n\nshow aider and abettor liability, the government must prove that\n\nthe defendant knew to a \"practical certainty\" that the principal\n\nwould use a weapon during the commission of the crime.                   United\n\nStates v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir. 1995).              \"[P]ractical\n\n\n        1\n         We have also reviewed the pro se supplemental brief\nsubmitted by Vazquez-Castro. It does not raise any substantial\nadditional claims.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fcertainty is a rubric that calls for proof verging on actual\n\nknowledge.\"      Id.   By contrast, under the Pinkerton theory of\n\nliability, the jury must find that the defendant was a member of a\n\nconspiracy and the use or carrying of a firearm was \"reasonably\n\nforeseeable\" in furtherance of the conspiracy.          Shea, 150 F.3d at\n\n50.\n\n      Notwithstanding this difference, \"a jury may be instructed to\n\nconsider the liability theory established in Pinkerton as an\n\nalternative ground for conviction under § 924(c)(1) in addition to\n\nan aiding and abetting theory.\" United States v. Medina-Roman, 376\n\nF.3d 1, 3 n.4 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted).             The\n\nalternative instruction is justified because, \"[a]s with the aiding\n\nand   abetting   theory,   vicarious   co-conspirator    liability   under\n\nPinkerton is not in the nature of a separate offense.\"               United\n\nStates v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 1990) (internal\n\nquotations omitted); accord United States v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302,\n\n309 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"The law is crystalline that, when the\n\ngovernment has advanced several alternate theories of guilt and the\n\ntrial court has submitted the case to the jury on that basis, an\n\nensuing conviction may stand as long as the evidence suffices to\n\nsupport any one of the submitted theories.\").\n\n      In the same manner, the trial court may instruct the jury on\n\na Pinkerton theory even though the indictment does not plead\n\nvicarious liability.       Sanchez, 917 F.2d at 612.      \"Indeed, every\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fcourt       to    consider    the    matter   has    held   that        the    individual\n\nsubstantive         counts    need   not   make     reference     to    co-conspirator\n\nliability in order for the jury to be so instructed.\"                                 Id.\n\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\n     When an indictment does not reference Pinkerton liability,\n\nhowever, the defendant remains entitled to fair notice of the\n\ngovernment's charge against him.                 Id. at 611.      The defendants in\n\nSanchez were charged with conspiracy and possession of cocaine for\n\ndistribution, and the district court instructed the jury on both\n\naiding and abetting and Pinkerton theories of liability.                           Id. at\n\n611-12.          Even though the indictment itself did not mention either\n\ntheory of liability, we held that the defendants were \"on notice of\n\nthe essential nature of the charges against them.\"                            Id. at 612.\n\nThis is because aiding and abetting \"is not a separate offense.\"\n\nId. at 611-12.          Rather, \"[a]iding and abetting is an alternative\n\ncharge in every count, whether explicit or implicit.\"2                         Id. at 611\n\n(internal         citations    omitted).      We     held   the    Pinkerton       charge\n\nwarranted \"on the same reasoning.\"                Id. at 612.      There was also no\n\nunfair surprise because the government submitted proposed jury\n\ninstructions on both theories prior to trial.                     Id.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n       We noted in Sanchez that it is \"better practice,\" however,\n\"to have the indictment framed in the alternative or at least to\nhave noted upon it a reference to\" the aiding and abetting theory\nof liability. Id. at 611 n.3.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f     However, \"a Pinkerton charge should not be given as a matter\n\nof course.\"        Id. at 612 n.4 (internal quotations omitted).            The\n\nPinkerton charge causes concern \"particularly where the jury is\n\nbeing asked to make the converse inference; that is, to infer, on\n\nthe basis of a series of disparate criminal acts, that a conspiracy\n\nexisted.\"     Id.     In Sanchez, \"there was ample evidence that [the\n\ndefendant] was a member of the alleged conspiracy to possess\n\ncocaine for distribution.\"          The jury instructions on aiding and\n\nabetting and Pinkerton were proper for the separate purpose of\n\ndetermining whether the defendant's co-conspirators \"committed the\n\nsubstantive offense of possessing cocaine for distribution.\"                Id.\n\n     Applying this reasoning, the district court here did not\n\nplainly err by instructing the jury on the Pinkerton theory of\n\nliability as an alternative to the aiding and abetting theory.\n\nEven though only the aiding and abetting theory was specifically\n\nreferenced in the indictment, each theory was implicit in the\n\nfirearm charge against him.         See id. at 611-12.       \"Since there was\n\nsufficient    evidence     to   enable    a   jury   to   conclude,   beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt,\" that Vazquez-Castro and his co-defendants were\n\nmembers of the cocaine conspiracy, \"the Pinkerton charge was\n\nproper\" on the substantive weapon count.             See id. at 612.\n\n     There was also no unfair surprise.               As the district court\n\npointed     out,    the   parties   argued     the    Pinkerton   element      of\n\nforeseeability during trial.             See Gobbi, 471 F.3d at 309; cf.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fMedina-Roman, 376 F.3d at 3 n.4.                     Additionally, Vazquez-Castro's\n\nown proposed jury instructions referenced the Pinkerton theory of\n\nliability.     See Sanchez, 917 F.2d at 612.                        Moreover, following a\n\ncharge conference in chambers and prior to instructing the jury,\n\nVazquez-Castro       appears       to    have        agreed    on    the   record    to     the\n\nGovernment's       request        that     the       court     include     the     Pinkerton\n\ninstruction.\n\nB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     To convict a defendant under § 924(c)(1)(A), the government\n\nmust prove that the defendant (1) committed a drug trafficking\n\ncrime; (2) knowingly possessed a firearm; and (3) possessed the\n\nfirearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.                                 United\n\nStates v. Pena, 586 F.3d 105, 112 (1st Cir. 2009).                                  \"We have\n\nrepeatedly held that under Pinkerton, the defendant does not need\n\nto have carried the gun himself to be liable under § 924(c).\"\n\nUnited States v. Flecha-Maldonado, 373 F.3d 170, 179 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).       \"So    long     as    there        is    sufficient        evidence     that    a\n\nco-conspirator carried or used a firearm in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy    and     that    this        was    reasonably          foreseeable     to     the\n\ndefendant, the defendant can be held liable as if he himself\n\ncarried or used the firearm.\"               Id.\n\n         It is not necessary to show that the defendant owned or\n\n\"physically        possessed\"       the     firearm,          and    possession      may    be\n\nconstructive.       United States v. Rodriguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 41\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\f(1st Cir. 2009).        \"Constructive possession of a firearm may be\n\nestablished by showing that the person knows (or has reason to\n\nknow) that the firearm is within easy reach, so that he can take\n\nactual possession of it virtually at will.\"                   United States v.\n\nRobinson, 473 F.3d 387, 399 (1st Cir. 2007).            \"The mere presence of\n\na firearm\" in the area is insufficient, and there must be some\n\n\"nexus\" between the firearm and the offense.                  Id. at 400.    In\n\ndetermining whether there is a nexus, we consider whether the\n\nfirearm was loaded, whether the firearm was easily accessible, the\n\nproximity   of   the    firearm    to    the   drugs,   and   the   surrounding\n\ncircumstances.    Id.\n\n     \"[F]irearms are often used by drug dealers to protect drug\n\nstockpiles, to preempt encroachment into a dealer's 'territory' by\n\nrival dealers, and for retaliation.\" United States v. Luciano, 329\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003).               In Luciano, agents searched an\n\napartment the defendant had been inside just prior to selling\n\nheroin.   Id. at 3.     In a crawl space in the ceiling, an agent found\n\na large bag of heroin close to another bag containing two handguns\n\nand two loaded magazines.         Id. at 3-4.    The defendant argued there\n\nwas no nexus between the drug transaction and the gun possession.\n\nId. at 6.   However, \"[g]iven the close proximity of the firearms\n\nand loaded magazines to the significant stockpile of heroin, we\n\n[had] no difficulty concluding that there was a sufficient nexus\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fbetween the drug trafficking crime and the firearms to sustain a\n\nconviction under § 924.\"       Id. at 6.\n\n     Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's\n\nverdict in Vazquez-Castro's case, there was sufficient evidence for\n\nthe jury to convict him of the weapon charge.             First, sufficient\n\nevidence     showed    Vazquez-Castro       voluntarily     and      knowingly\n\nparticipated    in    the   drug   conspiracy.    See     United    States   v.\n\nBristol-Martir, 570 F.3d 29, 39 (1st Cir. 2009).            The DEA agents'\n\ntestimony,    video   recordings,     and   Vazquez-Castro's       post-arrest\n\ninterview allowed the jury to reasonably infer that he was aware\n\nof, and intended to participate in, the conspiracy.                See United\n\nStates v. Paret-Ruiz, 567 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"An agreement\n\nbetween coconspirators may be proven by circumstantial evidence,\n\nand it may be tacit.\").\n\n     Second, sufficient evidence supports a finding that one of\n\nVazquez-Castro's co-conspirators constructively possessed a firearm\n\n\"in furtherance of\" the drug trafficking crime. Robinson, 473 F.3d\n\nat 399.    At the time of the arrests, the driver of the Isuzu told\n\nthe agents where to find the weapon.         The pistol was found loaded\n\nwith a magazine and easily accessible by reaching to the floorboard\n\nof the driver's seat in the Isuzu.           See Marin, 523 F.3d at 28.\n\nFive kilograms of cocaine were found on the floor behind the\n\ndriver's seat, in close proximity to the gun.              See Luciano, 329\n\nF.3d at 6.     Additionally, these items were seized in the broader\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fcontext of a drug deal, and the driver and passengers arrived at\n\nthe designated location carrying both the drugs and the gun in\n\ntheir vehicle.     See Robinson, 473 F.3d at 400.\n\n     Sufficient evidence also supports a finding that it was\n\n\"reasonably foreseeable\" to Vazquez-Castro that a co-conspirator\n\nwould    possess   a    firearm   in    furtherance     of   the   conspiracy.\n\nFlecha-Maldonado, 373 F.3d at 179.            In the days prior to the drug\n\ndeal, one of Vazquez-Castro's co-conspirators told an undercover\n\nagent he carried \"steel.\"         Although Vazquez-Castro arrived in a\n\ndifferent vehicle on the day of the deal, he walked to and sat\n\ninside the Isuzu for several minutes after Angel instructed him to\n\n\"go get that.\"         While seated in the Isuzu, Vazquez-Castro was\n\nwithin    reaching     distance   of    both    the   loaded   weapon   and   a\n\nsignificant amount of cocaine.            When Vazquez-Castro exited the\n\nIsuzu, he carried a kilogram of the cocaine back to the Mitsubishi.\n\nThe Government estimated the total value of the cocaine seized at\n\napproximately $100,000. See United States v. Bianco, 922 F.2d 910,\n\n912 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[W]e think it fairly inferable that a\n\ncodefendant's possession of a dangerous weapon is foreseeable to a\n\ndefendant with reason to believe that their collaborative criminal\n\nventure includes an exchange of controlled substances for a large\n\namount of cash.\").\n\n     Under these circumstances, the jury could have concluded it\n\nwas reasonably foreseeable to Vazquez-Castro that one of his\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fco-conspirators would carry a firearm. See United States v. Bucci,\n\n525 F.3d 116, 132 (1st Cir. 2008); Flecha-Maldonado, 373 F.3d at\n\n179; Bianco, 922 F.2d at 912.      The jury's finding of liability on\n\na   Pinkerton   theory   is   sufficient   to   uphold   Vazquez-Castro's\n\nconviction on the gun charge, and we therefore need not reach the\n\nquestion of whether this evidence adequately supported the higher\n\nshowing required under an aiding and abetting theory of liability.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f",

Jose Vazquez-Castro was convicted by a\n\njury of three counts:         (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute     cocaine;      (2)    possessing     cocaine    with    intent    to\n\ndistribute; and (3) possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug\n\ntrafficking.      He appeals the sufficiency of the evidence for the\n\nweapon charge in Count Three, and argues the district court erred\n\nby instructing the jury on the Pinkerton theory of liability.                  For\n\nthe following reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                        I.\n\nA.   The Undercover Sting Operation\n\n     DEA   Agents    Miguel    Melendez-Cruz,       Roberto   Cruz-Perez,      and\n\nJohnny Melendez organized an undercover operation to buy cocaine.\n\nThe targeted individuals included Carlos Rodriguez and Israel Ruiz.\n\nRodriguez had solicited Marcos Nunez-Retamar to be a \"runner,\" or\n\nan intermediary who earns commissions by matching suppliers of\n\ncocaine    with    buyers.         Nunez-Retamar     became    a     confidential\n\ninformant.\n\n     Agent Cruz-Perez instructed Nunez-Retamar to call Rodriguez\n\nand tell him that Cruz-Perez was his brother and he wanted to buy\n\nten kilograms of cocaine.          Cruz-Perez, Melendez, and Nunez-Retamar\n\nthen met with Rodriguez and Ruiz.            Nunez-Retamar introduced Cruz-\n\nPerez as his brother, and told Rodriguez and Ruiz that he wanted to\n\nbuy ten kilograms of cocaine. After conversing about the specifics\n\nof the deal, they came to an agreement to purchase the cocaine.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f      The next day, Rodriguez called to report that he had spoken\n\nwith the supplier and \"they wanted to do the deal\" in front of a\n\nrestaurant at a shopping mall that evening.                   Rodriguez and Ruiz\n\narrived at the designated time, but stated that their supplier did\n\nnot   like    the   area    because    they    saw    suspicious   vehicles   and\n\nuniformed patrols.\n\n      Cruz-Perez made several recorded calls to Rodriguez and Ruiz\n\nthe following day.         Ruiz said that no one wants to \"release the\n\ntickets,\" which meant that the suppliers did not want to provide\n\nthe   drugs   without      first    seeing    the    money.    Cruz-Perez   asked\n\nRodriguez if he had \"iron,\" meaning firearms.                 Rodriguez replied,\n\n\"I carry steel on my waist.\"\n\n      Cruz-Perez, Melendez, Nunez-Retamar, and Rodriguez agreed to\n\nmeet at a restaurant for the exchange at 5:30 p.m. on June 23,\n\n2006. Cruz-Perez placed agents around the premises to make arrests\n\nonce the drugs arrived.            They planned to call these agents after\n\nseeing the drugs and ask them to \"bring the money in,\" which was\n\nthe code phrase ordering the arrests of the dealers.\n\n      Cruz-Perez, Melendez, and Nunez-Retamar arrived first, and\n\nwaited inside the restaurant.           Rodriguez called and said he could\n\nnot attend the meeting because his car broke down.                 At 6:30 p.m.,\n\na Mitsubishi automobile parked in front of the restaurant, with\n\nRuiz in the back seat and Angel Cruz-Perez (\"Angel\") driving.\n\nVazquez-Castro was also in the vehicle, sitting in the front\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpassenger seat.   Ruiz exited the vehicle, and Angel and Vazquez-\n\nCastro left the area. Ruiz entered the restaurant, told Cruz-Perez\n\nthat the \"kilos were there,\" and asked about the money.    The agent\n\nreplied that \"not a penny was going to be shown until\" he \"saw the\n\nkilos.\" Ruiz responded that he needed to speak \"with the owners of\n\nthe material.\"\n\n     Ruiz left the restaurant, made a telephone call outside, and\n\nreturned to again inquire about the money.      The agents repeated\n\nthat there would be no money until the drugs were shown, and Ruiz\n\nleft to make another telephone call.   The Mitsubishi returned with\n\nAngel driving and Vazquez-Castro in the front passenger seat. Ruiz\n\ngot into the back seat.      Cruz-Perez approached the Mitsubishi,\n\nopened the rear passenger side door, and asked whether they were\n\n\"going to negotiate?\"    Angel said \"yes,\" and instructed Vazquez-\n\nCastro to \"go get that.\"\n\n     Vazquez-Castro exited the vehicle, walked to an Isuzu \"about\n\nsix vehicles away,\" and got into the rear passenger side.     A few\n\nminutes later, Vazquez-Castro exited the vehicle, and returned with\n\nhis hand tucked near the left side of his body and apparently\n\ncarrying something inside his sweater.      Vazquez-Castro got back\n\ninto the Mitsubishi.    Ruiz opened the door and said, it is \"here.\"\n\nCruz-Perez instructed Nunez-Retamar to check the drugs.      Nunez-\n\nRetamar looked in the passenger's side \"for several seconds,\" then\n\ntold Cruz-Perez to \"[b]ring the money, there is a kilo.\"\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f       Angel and Vazquez-Castro exited the vehicle and walked into\n\nthe restaurant, where they were arrested.                     Ruiz was arrested\n\noutside, as were the two individuals in the Isuzu.                When Melendez\n\narrested the driver of the Isuzu, the driver said he was armed and\n\n\"[t]he weapon is under the carpet in the driver's seat, on the\n\nfloor.\" The agent then found a loaded .45 caliber pistol folded in\n\nthe floor mat on the driver's side of the Isuzu.                The agents also\n\nretrieved a blue bag containing five kilograms of cocaine from the\n\nback   seat   of   the    Isuzu   and   a     kilogram   of   cocaine    from   the\n\nMitsubishi's glove box.\n\nB.     The Trial\n\n       Vazquez-Castro and his co-defendants were indicted on three\n\ncounts. Count One charged Vazquez-Castro and others with knowingly\n\nand unlawfully conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five\n\nkilograms     or   more    of     cocaine      in   violation    of     21   U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846.                Count Two charged him with\n\npossessing with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of\n\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2.       Count Three charged, \"[t]he defendants herein,\n\nwhile aiding and abetting each other, did possess, use and carry .\n\n. . a .45 caliber Ruger pistol . . . in furtherance of a drug\n\ntrafficking crime\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A) and\n\n(c)(1)(A)(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f     At trial, Vazquez-Castro moved under Rule 29(a) for a judgment\n\nof acquittal on Count Three. The district court denied the motion.\n\nIt held that, even though the Government had expressly charged\n\nVazquez-Castro under an aiding and abetting theory in Count Three,\n\nthe jury may be instructed to consider the liability theory from\n\nPinkerton v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1946), as an alternative\n\ntheory for conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).           The district\n\ncourt found that \"since both parties argued the foreseeability\n\nfactor [of the Pinkerton theory] during the Rule 29(a) discussion,\n\na factor which is not an element of the standard of proof of the\n\naiding and abetting theory, . . . the alternative Pinkerton theory\n\nof liability is justified.\" The court later instructed the jury on\n\nboth theories of liability.\n\n     Vazquez-Castro was convicted and sentenced to 120 months for\n\nCounts One and Two to be served concurrently, and 60 months for\n\nCount Three to be served consecutively, for a total of 180 months\n\nimprisonment.\n\n                                   II.\n\n     On appeal, Vazquez-Castro makes three related arguments.            He\n\nargues there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the weapon\n\ncharge, and maintains that the district court therefore erred in\n\ndenying his Rule 29 motion before the case was submitted to the\n\njury.   He also contends that, because the government expressly\n\nincluded   an   aiding   and   abetting   theory   of   liability   in   the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\findictment,       the   court   erred   by    instructing   the   jury   on   the\n\nPinkerton theory of liability.1\n\n     We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for acquittal de\n\nnovo.

Id. at 611 n.3.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f     However, \"a Pinkerton charge should not be given as a matter\n\nof course.\"        Id. at 612 n.4 (internal quotations omitted).            The\n\nPinkerton charge causes concern \"particularly where the jury is\n\nbeing asked to make the converse inference; that is, to infer, on\n\nthe basis of a series of disparate criminal acts, that a conspiracy\n\nexisted.\"     Id.     In Sanchez, \"there was ample evidence that [the\n\ndefendant] was a member of the alleged conspiracy to possess\n\ncocaine for distribution.\"          The jury instructions on aiding and\n\nabetting and Pinkerton were proper for the separate purpose of\n\ndetermining whether the defendant's co-conspirators \"committed the\n\nsubstantive offense of possessing cocaine for distribution.\"                Id.\n\n     Applying this reasoning, the district court here did not\n\nplainly err by instructing the jury on the Pinkerton theory of\n\nliability as an alternative to the aiding and abetting theory.\n\nEven though only the aiding and abetting theory was specifically\n\nreferenced in the indictment, each theory was implicit in the\n\nfirearm charge against him.         See id. at 611-12.       \"Since there was\n\nsufficient    evidence     to   enable    a   jury   to   conclude,   beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt,\" that Vazquez-Castro and his co-defendants were\n\nmembers of the cocaine conspiracy, \"the Pinkerton charge was\n\nproper\" on the substantive weapon count.             See id. at 612.\n\n     There was also no unfair surprise.               As the district court\n\npointed     out,    the   parties   argued     the    Pinkerton   element      of\n\nforeseeability during trial.             See Gobbi, 471 F.3d at 309; cf.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fMedina-Roman, 376 F.3d at 3 n.4.                     Additionally, Vazquez-Castro's\n\nown proposed jury instructions referenced the Pinkerton theory of\n\nliability.     See Sanchez, 917 F.2d at 612.                        Moreover, following a\n\ncharge conference in chambers and prior to instructing the jury,\n\nVazquez-Castro       appears       to    have        agreed    on    the   record    to     the\n\nGovernment's       request        that     the       court     include     the     Pinkerton\n\ninstruction.\n\nB.

First, sufficient\n\nevidence     showed    Vazquez-Castro       voluntarily     and      knowingly\n\nparticipated    in    the   drug   conspiracy.
