Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Richard J. Savage for appellant.\n     Rebecca Tedford Partington, Deputy Chief, and Patrick Lynch,\nAttorney General, Office of the Attorney General, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           June 12, 2003\n\f     BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.       Plaintiff-appellant, Ugurhan\n\nAkturk Kosereis (\"Kosereis\"), brought a discrimination claim in the\n\ndistrict court against his employer, the State of Rhode Island\n\nDepartment of Children Youth and Families, Rhode Island Training\n\nSchool (\"the Training School\"), and the director of the Training\n\nSchool in   his   official   capacity.    Kosereis   alleged   that   the\n\ndefendants discriminated against him based on his religion and\n\nnational origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e, and various state laws.\n\nThe district court granted the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment because Kosereis failed to produce sufficient evidence\n\nthat he suffered from discrimination.         Although the district\n\ncourt's decision contained legal errors, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n     When reviewing a district court's grant of summary judgment,\n\nwe state the facts in the light most favorable to the opposing\n\nparty and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.         See Sands\n\nv. Ridefilm Corp., 212 F.3d 657, 661 (1st Cir. 2000).      Kosereis is\n\na Turkish-born Muslim who works as a vocational teacher at the\n\nTraining School.    The Training School is a juvenile correction\n\nfacility that contains both classrooms and residences.         Kosereis\n\nhas worked for the Training School since 1975.       During his tenure,\n\nhe has taught woodworking, autobody, and at the times relevant to\n\nthis appeal, welding and auto mechanics.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f       Kosereis     has     experienced     difficulties         with    tardiness    and\n\nabsenteeism.         In 1981, the Training School issued Kosereis a\n\nreminder     about        taking    excessive      sick      leave      without    proper\n\ndocumentation.        The problem became worse in the mid-1990s when\n\nArlene Chorney (\"Chorney\") was hired as principal of the Training\n\nSchool.      According       to     Kosereis,      his   discriminatory         treatment\n\n\"started the day Dr. Chorney became principal.\"\n\n       Chorney instituted a new work schedule that, in Kosereis'\n\nwords, was \"very complicated.\" Kosereis claims that the complexity\n\nof the work schedule caused him to become confused about when he\n\nwas    required      to    report     for    work.        In    1995,     for     example,\n\ndisciplinary proceedings were initiated against Kosereis because he\n\nmissed work without notifying the proper personnel.                             In 1996,\n\nKosereis was verbally disciplined for being late to a class.                            In\n\n1997, Kosereis was given a written reprimand for failing to report\n\nto    his   first    period        class.     In     1998,     Kosereis     received     a\n\ndisciplinary        letter    for     falsifying      his      time   records.        This\n\nreprimand, however, was later expunged from his record.                           In 1999,\n\nKosereis was verbally reprimanded after he failed to report for\n\nwork in the morning.\n\n       It is clear that Chorney made efforts to clarify the work\n\nschedule.      As part of the verbal reprimand in 1996, Chorney\n\nexplained the schedule to Kosereis in the presence of his union\n\nrepresentative.           In Kosereis' 1997 letter, Chorney again offered\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fKosereis help:\n\n     As a professional, you are expected to arrive to school\n     and classes on time. You are also expected to follow\n     your schedule.   If you are unable to understand your\n     schedule, I will assist you further.\n\n     In addition to the alleged complicated work schedule, Kosereis\n\nclaims that Chorney was responsible for a host of other problems.\n\nHe says that Chorney did not give him sufficient funding, adequate\n\nsupplies or proper facilities to teach auto mechanics.            Kosereis\n\nwas required to work in a particular building that he says lacked\n\nventilation and was dirty.    Chorney denied Kosereis' request for a\n\nsabbatical to travel to Turkey and study that country's juvenile\n\njustice system. Instead, Kosereis was granted a sabbatical to take\n\ncourses in Rhode Island.     Kosereis also says that Chorney did not\n\ndo enough to stop students from calling him \"turkey\" and teachers\n\nteasing him about his Turkish food in the lunchroom.\n\n     In 1995, Kosereis was laid off and soon after initiated an\n\nadministrative   appeal   with     the    Rhode   Island   Commissioner   of\n\nEducation (\"the Commissioner\").           While the appeal was pending,\n\nKosereis filed a claim with the Rhode Island Commission for Human\n\nRights (\"RICHR\") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(\"EEOC\")   alleging   that   his    job     was   terminated   because    of\n\ndiscrimination. The EEOC ultimately issued Kosereis a right to sue\n\nletter, but the RICHR did not.\n\n     In 1996, Kosereis' administrative appeal of his lay-off was\n\ndecided.   The Commissioner determined that Kosereis was laid off\n\n                                    -4-\n\ffor \"good and just cause,\" but nevertheless reinstated him with\n\nbackpay because he did not receive a timely notice of his lay-off.\n\n     Two years after Kosereis returned to work, he filed another\n\nset of claims with the RICHR and the EEOC.        This time, he alleged\n\nthat Chorney's disciplinary actions stemming from his absenteeism\n\nconstituted discrimination. Kosereis claimed he was disciplined in\n\nretaliation for filing his earlier claims of discrimination.            Both\n\nthe RICHR and the EEOC issued right to sue letters.\n\n     Having properly navigated the administrative waters of the\n\nRICHR and the EEOC, Kosereis filed a complaint in the district\n\ncourt.    He alleged that the defendants violated Title VII by\n\ncreating a hostile work environment and denying him equal terms and\n\nconditions of employment because of his religion and national\n\norigin.    Kosereis    then   amended   his   complaint   and   added    the\n\nallegation of retaliation.     Kosereis also raised claims under the\n\nRhode Island Civil Rights Act, R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 42-112-1 (1998),\n\nand the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, R.I. Gen. Laws\n\nยง 28-5-1 (2000).\n\n     After discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe district court referred the case to a Magistrate Judge who\n\nrecommended that the defendants' motion be granted.         The district\n\ncourt adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants on both the federal and\n\nstate law claims.     Kosereis filed a timely appeal, but challenged\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fonly the district court's rulings regarding the federal law claims.\n\nIt is to these rulings we now turn.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n      We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.    See Muniz Cortes v. Intermedics, Inc., 229 F.3d 12, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).     Summary judgment for the defendants is appropriate\n\nwhen the evidence is so one-sided that no reasonable person could\n\nfind in favor of the plaintiff.     See Kearney v. Town of Wareham,\n\n316 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2002).       There are four issues we must\n\naddress in this appeal:       whether Kosereis was precluded from\n\nlitigating issues pertaining to his lay-off; whether Kosereis was\n\ntreated differently than other co-workers because of his religion\n\nand national origin; whether Kosereis suffered from a hostile work\n\nenvironment; and whether Kosereis was subjected to discriminatory\n\nretaliation.\n\nA.      Preclusion\n\n      Our initial inquiry is whether Kosereis can, as part of this\n\ncase, delve into matters related to his 1995 lay-off.    The lay-off\n\nis important to Kosereis in this litigation because he believes it\n\nhelps establish that he was subjected to disparate treatment, a\n\ntopic which we will discuss later.\n\n      The district court held that the doctrine of res judicata\n\nbarred Kosereis from litigating any issues related to his lay-off.\n\n\"Under federal law, the doctrine of res judicata dictates that a\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffinal judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or\n\ntheir privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been\n\nraised in that action.\"     Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303,\n\n311 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94\n\n(1980)). The district court reasoned that Kosereis' administrative\n\nappeal of the lay-off, and the Commissioner's subsequent ruling\n\nthat he was laid off for \"good and just cause,\" amounted to a final\n\njudgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.     This ruling\n\nwas incorrect.\n\n     The critical part of the district court's ruling stated that\n\n\"[t]he doctrine of res judicata applies to a decision of a quasi-\n\njudicial administrative tribunal,\" such as the decision by the\n\nCommissioner in the present case.      To support this statement, the\n\ndistrict court cited to Department of Corrections of State of Rhode\n\nIsland v. Tucker, 657 A.2d 546, 549 (R.I. 1995), in which the Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme Court held that Rhode Island state courts give\n\npreclusive effect to quasi-judicial administrative tribunals.\n\n     The district court was correct in looking to state law for\n\nanswers to questions regarding the preclusive effect of state\n\nadministrative decisions.    Federal common law generally requires\n\nthat federal courts accord the decisions of state administrative\n\nagencies acting in a judicial capacity \"the same preclusive effect\n\nto which it would be entitled in the State's courts.\"       Univ. of\n\nTenn. v. Elliott, 478 U.S. 788, 799 (1986).      But that is not the\n\n                                 -7-\n\fend of the matter.             Even if state courts apply res judicata to\n\nstate administrative decisions, federal courts will only follow\n\nsuit if doing so is consistent with Congress' intent in enacting\n\nthe federal statute at issue.           See Astoria Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass'n\n\nv. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 110 (1991) (citing Elliot, 478 U.S. at\n\n796).     This means that when the preclusive effect of a state\n\nadministrative decision is in question, the central inquiry is one\n\nof federal statutory interpretation.                    See Thomas v. Contoocook\n\nValley Sch. Dist., 150 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir. 1998).                   In this case,\n\nthe     district    court       erred   by    looking     no   further   than    the\n\npredilections of the state court; the district court failed to\n\nconsider the vital question of congressional intent.\n\n        That said, we need not canvass the congressional intent\n\nunderlying Title VII. The Supreme Court has already considered the\n\nmatter, and held that Congress did not intend that unreviewed state\n\nadministrative decisions would prohibit plaintiffs from bringing\n\nsubsequent Title VII actions in federal courts.                   See Elliot, 478\n\nU.S. at 795-96.          We will, of course, follow the Supreme Court's\n\nruling in Elliot.              The administrative decision issued by the\n\nCommissioner regarding Kosereis' lay-off was not reviewed by a\n\ncourt. It therefore does not have a preclusive effect on Kosereis'\n\nTitle VII claims.         See Thomas, 150 F.3d at 39 (\"It is now settled,\n\nhowever, that State agency findings that are not reviewed by a\n\nstate    court     are   not    entitled     to   any    preclusive   effect    in   a\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fsubsequent    action    under     Title     VII\")    (emphasis      in   original).\n\nKosereis is free to use the facts related to his lay-off as\n\nevidence of disparate treatment.              The district court's holding to\n\nthe contrary is overruled.\n\nB.    Disparate Treatment\n\n      Kosereis claims that he was denied equal terms and conditions\n\nof   employment     because    of     his   religion    and   national     origin.\n\nKosereis concedes, however, that he lacks direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. This means that the case turns on whether Kosereis\n\nhas presented sufficient circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\n\nSee Weston-Smith v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., 282 F.3d 60, 64\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).       To make this determination, we use the burden-\n\nshifting analysis from McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n792 (1973).   See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n      Under   the     McDonnell     Douglas     analysis,     a   plaintiff   must\n\nestablish a prima facie case, which in turn gives rise to an\n\ninference of discrimination.           See Dichner v. Liberty Travel, 141\n\nF.3d 24, 29-30 (1st Cir. 1998).               The employer then must state a\n\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision. See Zapata-\n\nMatos v. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nIf   the   employer    can    state    such    a    reason,   the    inference   of\n\ndiscrimination disappears and the plaintiff is required to show\n\nthat the employer's stated reason is a pretext for discrimination.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fSee id. at 45.\n\n     Generally, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by\n\nshowing that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was\n\nqualified for the job; (3) the employer took an adverse employment\n\naction against him; and (4) the position remained open or was\n\nfilled by a person with similar qualifications.      See St. Mary's\n\nHonor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993); Santiago-Ramos v.\n\nCentential P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n     The district court assumed, arguendo, that Kosereis made out\n\na prima facie case.    In doing so, it quoted language in Rivera-\n\nRodriguez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean, 265 F.3d 15 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), and described the fourth prong as requiring plaintiff to\n\nshow that \"other similarly situated employees who were not members\n\nof the protected class were treated more favorably.\"     Id. at 25.\n\nThis language was dicta, however; the plaintiff's prima facie case\n\nwas not contested as part of that appeal.    Nor did the case that\n\nRivera-Rodriguez cited, Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d\n\n670, 673 (1st Cir. 1996), involve the prima facie showing required\n\nfor disparate treatment claims.    Dicta, of course, is not binding\n\non future panels.   See Municipality of San Juan v. Rullan, 318 F.3d\n\n26, 28 n.3 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n     In Conward v. Cambridge School Committee, 171 F.3d 12 (1st\n\nCir. 1999), in contrast, we explicitly rejected the notion that\n\nplaintiffs in disparate treatment cases are required to demonstrate\n\n                                -10-\n\fthat they were treated differently as part of their prima facie\n\ncase.1   Rather, we held that:\n\n     [T]he time to consider comparative evidence in a\n     disparate treatment case is at the third step of the\n     burden-shifting ritual, when the need arises to test the\n     pretextuality vel non of the employer's articulated\n     reason for having acted adversely to the plaintiff's\n     interests.\n\nId. at 19.       We have since repeated our Conward ruling.               See\n\nFernandes, 199 F.3d at 584 (\"[A] plaintiff need not show as part of\n\nhis prima facie case that the employer either recalled similarly\n\nsituated non-minority employees or otherwise treated employees of\n\ndifferent ethnic backgrounds more favorably.\").\n\n     Our holding in Conward makes sense and is attuned to the\n\napplicable law.    We have described the prima facie case as a \"small\n\nshowing,\" Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 259 (1st.\n\nCir. 2001), that is \"not onerous,\" Santiago-Ramos, 217 F.3d at 54,\n\nand is \"easily made,\" Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283\n\nF.3d 11, 30 (1st Cir. 2002).         The pretext analysis, on the other\n\nhand, is more demanding.         See Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v.\n\nBurdine,   450   U.S.   248,   255   (1981)   (stating   that   the   pretext\n\nanalysis moves the inquiry \"to a new level of specificity\"). Thus,\n\nConward presents the applicable rule:             in disparate treatment\n\n     1\n          It is a different issue if a plaintiff opts to provide\ncomparative data as part of a prima facie case.        See, e.g.,\nFernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc., 199 F.3d 572, 585-86 (1st\nCir. 1999). Our question here is whether a comparative analysis is\nrequired as part of a prima facie case.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fcases, comparative evidence is to be treated as part of the pretext\n\nanalysis, and not as part of the plaintiff's prima facie case.                      171\n\nF.3d at 19.\n\n      As in Conward, the district court here went on to grant\n\nsummary    judgment     because      there    was    insufficient     evidence       of\n\npretext.      We    agree   that    Kosereis      failed    to   present   adequate\n\nevidence of pretext to survive summary judgment, and affirm on that\n\nbasis.\n\n      The \"ultimate touchstone\" of the McDonnell Douglas analysis is\n\nwhether    the     employer's      actions    were    improperly      motivated      by\n\ndiscrimination.       Fite v. Digital Equip. Corp., 232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).      Evidence that the employer's stated reasons for its\n\nactions are pretextual can be sufficient to show improper motive,\n\nand hence, allow the plaintiff to survive summary judgment. See\n\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143\n\n(2000);    Fite,     232    F.3d    at   7;     Feliciano   de   la    Cruz    v.    El\n\nConquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n      Plaintiffs can show that an employer's stated reasons are\n\npretextual in any number of ways.             See Santiago-Ramos, 217 F.3d at\n\n55.   One method is to produce evidence that the plaintiff was\n\ntreated differently than other similarly situated employees.                        See\n\nStraughn, 250 F.3d at 43-44; Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 581.                      To show\n\ndisparate treatment, Kosereis relies heavily on the claim that only\n\nhe was disciplined for failing to come to work on time.                       He says\n\n                                         -12-\n\fthat other tardy employees were never disciplined.\n\n     The record, however, does not support Kosereis' claims. There\n\nis simply no evidence that other teachers who failed to report to\n\nwork were not disciplined.          In fact, the evidence is just the\n\nopposite.    Chorney testified at her deposition that she had issued\n\nwritten or verbal reprimands to employees other than Kosereis for\n\nbeing late to work.\n\n     Kosereis raises a number of other instances of disparate\n\ntreatment.    All of these are insufficient to show pretext because\n\nthey do     not   involve   facts   or   circumstances    similar     to   those\n\nKosereis faced.        To successfully allege disparate treatment, a\n\nplaintiff must show \"that others similarly situated to him in all\n\nrelevant    respects    were   treated   differently     by    the   employer.\"\n\nConward, 171 F.3d at 20; see also Rosado v. Radio Shack, Inc., 312\n\nF.3d 532, 534 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that to have a plausible\n\ndifferential treatment claim, plaintiffs must show that others\n\nsimilarly situated were treated differently).                 The examples of\n\ndisparate treatment \"need not be perfect replicas, [but] they must\n\nclosely resemble one another in respect to relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances.\"      Conward, 171 F.3d at 20.\n\n     Kosereis claims that a secretary and some teachers were not\n\ndisciplined after they returned late to work after going out to\n\nlunch for \"Secretary's Day.\"        Kosereis admitted at his deposition,\n\nhowever, that he did not know whether the secretary and the\n\n                                     -13-\n\fteachers violated any rules.       Kosereis did not know, for example,\n\nwhether they had permission to return late or whether they used\n\npersonal time for the lunch.         He also did not say whether the\n\nteachers' late arrival caused them to miss classes, as was the case\n\nin his situation.\n\n      In the same vein, Kosereis claims that other teachers who\n\nbehaved inappropriately were never disciplined.            He cites an\n\ninstance where a student's fingers were cut by a machine in a\n\ncarpentry class.    Chorney testified in her deposition that the\n\nteacher in charge of the carpentry class was not punished because\n\nthe student had been told not to touch the machine, but disobeyed\n\nthe teacher's order.    Kosereis cites an instance where a staff\n\nmember urinated outside the school.        Chorney explained that the\n\nstaff member was not punished because the incident did not take\n\nplace on school property or on school time.          Chorney also lacked\n\npersonal knowledge of the incident.        Kosereis says that a staff\n\nmember once used profane language in Kosereis' classroom.         Chorney\n\nexplained that she did not discipline the staff member because she\n\nwas not the staff member's supervisor, but she did forward a report\n\nof the incident to the appropriate person.           In short, the long\n\nlunch for \"Secretary's Day,\" the accident in the carpentry class,\n\nthe   alleged   urination,   and    the   use   of   profanity   are   not\n\nsufficiently similar to the facts and circumstances surrounding\n\nKosereis' discipline to give rise to a finding of pretext.\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f     Kosereis    also    points      to    examples      of   disparate      treatment\n\noutside the context of disciplinary matters.                  Kosereis claims that\n\nhe was required to work in a particular building that was dirty and\n\nlacked ventilation.      Kosereis, however, admitted at his deposition\n\nthat other teachers were required to work in the same building.\n\n     Kosereis claims that he was not permitted to take a sabbatical\n\nin Turkey to study that country's juvenile justice system.                         He has\n\npresented no evidence, however, that other teachers were treated\n\nmore favorably by being permitted to take sabbaticals overseas.\n\nMoreover, Kosereis was granted a sabbatical, albeit to take courses\n\nin Rhode Island.\n\n     Kosereis says that other vocational teachers, such as the\n\ncarpentry and culinary arts teachers, were given equipment and\n\ntheir own classrooms. Specifically, Kosereis complains that he was\n\nnot given a shop in which to teach auto mechanics and was not\n\npermitted   to   use    an     automobile        in   his     class.        The   record\n\ndemonstrates, however, that the auto mechanics program was not\n\nunique in this regard.         Chorney testified at her deposition that\n\nthe health vocational program, like the auto mechanics program,\n\ndoes not have its own equipment or a special classroom.\n\n     Moreover, the Training School was without an auto mechanics\n\nshop well before the alleged discrimination took place.                           Chorney\n\nexplained that there has not been an auto mechanics shop at the\n\nTraining    School     since    at    least       1989      because    of    budgetary\n\n                                          -15-\n\fconstraints.     She also said that Kosereis' proposal to bring an\n\nautomobile to school as a teaching aid was rejected for safety and\n\nsecurity reasons.    Chorney was concerned that there was no place\n\ninside the school to store the automobile, and that it would remain\n\noutside and unsecured.\n\n     Kosereis alleges that in 1995 the Training School announced\n\nthat three other teachers, in addition to Kosereis, were to be laid\n\noff, but only Kosereis' job was actually eliminated.                Chorney\n\nexplained at her deposition that the other teachers were not laid\n\noff because they resigned after learning of the lay-offs.             Their\n\njobs were not filled and the positions were eliminated.         There is\n\nno evidence that Kosereis was treated differently than the teachers\n\nwho resigned.\n\n     There is one piece of evidence, however, that merits careful\n\nanalysis.   In 1998, Kosereis received a written reprimand from\n\nChorney for falsifying his time records. Kosereis informed Chorney\n\nthat he was not working on the alleged date of the falsification.\n\nChorney   then   amended   the   written   reprimand   with   new    dates.\n\nKosereis contested the reprimand and it was ultimately expunged\n\nfrom his record.    Chorney maintains that she simply made a mistake\n\nas to the dates.    Kosereis says this evidence shows that Chorney's\n\ndisciplinary measures were pretextual.        We do not think this one\n\nincident, standing alone, is enough to permit a reasonable jury to\n\nfind that the defendants' explanation for Kosereis' discipline was\n\n                                  -16-\n\fpretextual.       This   is   especially    true   in   light    of    Kosereis'\n\nnumerous other instances of absenteeism and tardiness -- none of\n\nwhich he contests.        See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148 (stating that\n\nsummary judgment may be appropriate \"if the plaintiff created only\n\na weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue\n\nand there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that\n\nno discrimination had occurred.\").          Rather, Chorney's changing of\n\nthe dates creates only a \"slight suggestion of pretext,\" which we\n\nhave held is insufficient to survive summary judgment.                   Zapata-\n\nMatos, 277 F.3d at 47 (citing Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148).\n\n     To summarize, all of the instances of disparate treatment\n\ncited by Kosereis, save the one involving the expunged reprimand,\n\nare either unsupported by the record or are distinguishable in\n\nimportant respects from the facts and circumstances that Kosereis\n\nfaced.      See   Straughn,    250   F.3d    at    43-44.       We    have   been\n\n\"particularly cautious\" about affirming an employer's motion for\n\nsummary judgment on a discrimination claim when the case boils down\n\nto whether the employer's stated reasons are pretextual.                 Hodgens\n\nv. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 167 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation\n\nomitted).     But the evidence that Kosereis presents regarding\n\npretext is so weak that we have no difficulty affirming the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment as to the disparate\n\ntreatment claim.     See Zapata-Matos, 277 F.3d at 47-48.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fC.   Hostile Work Environment\n\n     A hostile work environment exists in violation of Title VII\n\n\"[w]hen     the    workplace   is     permeated     with     discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and\n\ncreate an abusive working environment.\"           See Harris v. Forklist\n\nSys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (citations and quotation marks\n\nomitted).    There is no \"mathematically precise test\" to determine\n\nwhether   Kosereis     presented    sufficient    evidence   that   he   was\n\nsubjected to a hostile work environment.          Id.   Rather, we look to\n\nall the circumstances, including the frequency and severity of the\n\ndiscriminatory conduct, whether it was physically threatening or\n\nhumiliating, and whether it unreasonably interfered with Kosereis'\n\nwork performance.      See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536\n\nU.S. 101, 116 (2002); Gorski v. N.H. Dep't of Corr., 290 F.3d 466,\n\n472 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     Kosereis claims that he was subjected to a hostile work\n\nenvironment when the residents of the Training School called him\n\n\"turkey,\" when fellow teachers teased him in the lunchroom about\n\nhis food, and when Chorney issued him repeated reprimands for his\n\nabsenteeism.      Mindful that \"[t]he accumulated effect of incidents\"\n\ncan amount to a hostile work environment over time, we consider\n\nKosereis' evidence collectively.        O'Rourke v. City of Providence,\n\n235 F.3d 713, 729 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                    -18-\n\f       The name calling by the residents of the Training School and\n\nthe teasing by the teachers in the lunchroom do not rise to the\n\nlevel of \"severe or pervasive conduct,\" that is required for a\n\nhostile    work   environment   claim.     Burlington   Indus.,    Inc.   v.\n\nEllerth, 524 U.S. 742, 754 (1998).          A hostile work environment\n\ngenerally is not created by a \"mere offensive utterance,\" Harris,\n\n510 U.S. at 23; nor does it arise from \"simple teasing, offhand\n\ncomments, and isolated incidents.\" Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,\n\n524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998).       Courts are supposed to use \"[c]ommon\n\nsense, and an appropriate sensitivity to social context,\" to\n\ndistinguish between such innocuous behavior and severely hostile or\n\nabusive conduct.      Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Serv., Inc., 523\n\nU.S. 75, 82 (1998).\n\n       Here, Kosereis, an adult, was called names by children who\n\nreside at a juvenile correction facility. When Kosereis complained\n\nto Chorney about the name calling, she met with the children and\n\nother staff members on two separate occasions to resolve the\n\nproblem.    As for the teasing by fellow teachers about Kosereis'\n\nfood, there is no evidence in the record that this teasing was\n\nfrequent or severe. It also bears mentioning that Kosereis has not\n\nproduced any evidence that the comments about which he complains,\n\neither those made by the children or those made by his colleagues,\n\nwere    physically    threatening    or    interfered   with      his   work\n\nperformance.\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f      There is even less merit to Kosereis' claim that he suffered\n\na    hostile    work     environment     because   of   Chorney's    repeated\n\nreprimands.      The reprimands were frequent only because Kosereis\n\ncontinued to miss work.        If Kosereis wished for the reprimands to\n\nstop, then he could have simply arrived at work on time.             The name\n\ncalling by the children, the alleged teasing by the teachers, and\n\nChorney's reprimands did not create a hostile work environment.\n\nSee, e.g., DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 311 (1st Cir.\n\n1997). The district court's grant of summary judgment on Kosereis'\n\nhostile work environment claim is affirmed.\n\nD.    Retaliation\n\n      To maintain a claim of discriminatory retaliation, a plaintiff\n\nmust produce evidence that (1) he engaged in protected conduct\n\nunder Title VII; (2) he experienced an adverse employment action;\n\nand (3) a casual connection exists between the protected conduct\n\nand the adverse action.       See Gu v. Boston Police Dep't, 312 F.3d 6,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 2002).        The parties dispute only the final prong of\n\nthe analysis, and our discussion is limited accordingly.\n\n      Kosereis says that Chorney's reprimands and her denial of his\n\nsabbatical to Turkey constituted retaliation for filing his claims\n\nof discrimination with the RICHR and the EEOC.                After carefully\n\nexamining the record, we can find no evidence that a casual\n\nconnection      exists   between   the    denial   of   the   sabbatical   and\n\nKosereis'      charges   of   discrimination.      In   fact,   Kosereis   was\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fpermitted to take a sabbatical in Rhode Island.\n\n     Nor is there any evidence connecting Kosereis' reprimands to\n\nthe discrimination charges he filed with the RICHR and the EEOC in\n\n1996. \"It is insufficient for [Kosereis] to simply recount that he\n\ncomplained and that he was disciplined . . . .\"    King v. Town of\n\nHanover, 116 F.3d 965, 968 (1st Cir. 1997).    In fact, the warning\n\nletter Kosereis received in 1981 and the disciplinary proceedings\n\nthat were initiated against him in 1995 demonstrate that Kosereis\n\nhad been disciplined for instances of absenteeism well before the\n\nalleged discrimination took place.    The district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment on Kosereis' retaliation claim is affirmed.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n     After reviewing the record in the light most favorable to\n\nKosereis, we conclude that he has failed to produce evidence that\n\nhe was treated differently than fellow co-workers because of his\n\nreligion or national origin, was subjected to a hostile work\n\nenvironment, or suffered discriminatory retaliation.   The district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants is\n\nAFFIRMED.   No costs are awarded on appeal.   So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

Kosereis alleged that the defendants discriminated against him based on his religion and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e, and various state laws. The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment because Kosereis failed to produce sufficient evidence that he suffered from discrimination. Although the district court's decision contained legal errors, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When reviewing a district court's grant of summary judgment, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>See Sands v. Ridefilm Corp.,</i> 212 F.3d 657, 661 (1st Cir.2000). Kosereis is a Turkish-born Muslim who works as a vocational teacher at the Training School. The Training School is a juvenile correction facility that contains both classrooms and residences. Kosereis has worked for the Training School since 1975. During his tenure, he has taught woodworking, autobody, and at the times relevant to this appeal, welding and auto mechanics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis has experienced difficulties with tardiness and absenteeism. In 1981, the Training School issued Kosereis a reminder about taking excessive sick leave without proper documentation. The problem became worse in the mid-1990s when Arlene Chorney (\"Chorney\") was hired as principal of the Training School. According to Kosereis, his discriminatory treatment \"started the day Dr. Chorney became principal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chorney instituted a new work schedule that, in Kosereis' words, was \"very complicated.\" Kosereis claims that the complexity of the work schedule caused him to become confused about when he was required to report for work. In 1995, for example, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Kosereis because he missed work without notifying the proper personnel. In 1996, Kosereis was verbally disciplined for being late to a class. In 1997, Kosereis was given a written reprimand for failing to report to his first period class. In 1998, Kosereis received a disciplinary letter for falsifying his time records. This reprimand, however, was later expunged from his record. In 1999, Kosereis was verbally reprimanded after he failed to report for work in the morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that Chorney made efforts to clarify the work schedule. As part of the verbal reprimand in 1996, Chorney explained the schedule to Kosereis in the presence of his union representative. In Kosereis' 1997 letter, Chorney again offered Kosereis help:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a professional, you are expected to arrive to school and classes on time. You are also expected to follow your schedule. If you are unable to understand your schedule, I will assist you further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the alleged complicated work schedule, Kosereis claims that Chorney was responsible for a host of other problems. He says that Chorney did not give him sufficient funding, adequate supplies or proper facilities to teach auto mechanics. Kosereis was required to work in a particular building that he says lacked ventilation and was dirty. Chorney denied Kosereis' request for a sabbatical to travel to Turkey and study that country's juvenile justice system. Instead, Kosereis was granted a sabbatical to take courses in Rhode Island. Kosereis also says that Chorney did not do enough to stop students from calling him \"turkey\" and teachers teasing him about his Turkish food in the lunchroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Kosereis was laid off and soon after initiated an administrative appeal with the Rhode Island Commissioner of Education (\"the Commissioner\"). While the appeal was pending, Kosereis filed a claim with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (\"RICHR\") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") alleging that his job was terminated because of discrimination. The EEOC ultimately issued Kosereis a right to sue letter, but the RICHR did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Kosereis' administrative appeal of his lay-off was decided. The Commissioner determined that Kosereis was laid off for \"good and just cause,\" but nevertheless reinstated him with backpay because he did not receive a timely notice of his lay-off.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years after Kosereis returned to work, he filed another set of claims with the RICHR and the EEOC. This time, he alleged that Chorney's disciplinary actions stemming from his absenteeism constituted discrimination. Kosereis claimed he was disciplined in retaliation for filing his earlier claims of discrimination. Both the RICHR and the EEOC issued right to sue letters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having properly navigated the administrative waters of the RICHR and the EEOC, Kosereis filed a complaint in the district court. He alleged that the defendants violated Title VII by creating a hostile work environment and denying him equal terms and conditions of employment because of his religion and national origin. Kosereis then amended his complaint and added the allegation of retaliation. Kosereis also raised claims under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 42-112-1 (1998), and the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-5-1 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court referred the case to a Magistrate Judge who recommended that the defendants' motion be granted. The district court adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both the federal and state law claims. Kosereis filed a timely appeal, but challenged only the district court's rulings regarding the federal law claims. It is to these rulings we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. See Muniz Cortes v. Intermedics, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.2000). Summary judgment for the defendants is appropriate when the evidence is so one-sided that no reasonable person could find in favor of the plaintiff. <i>See Kearney v. Town of Wareham,</i> 316 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.2002). There are four issues we must address in this appeal: whether Kosereis was precluded from litigating issues pertaining to his lay-off; whether Kosereis was treated differently than other co-workers because of his religion and national origin; whether Kosereis suffered from a hostile work environment; and whether Kosereis was subjected to discriminatory retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Preclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our initial inquiry is whether Kosereis can, as part of this case, delve into matters related to his 1995 lay-off. The lay-off is important to Kosereis in this litigation because he believes it helps establish that he was subjected to disparate treatment, a topic which we will discuss later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the doctrine of res judicata barred Kosereis from litigating any issues related to his lay-off. \"Under federal law, the doctrine of res judicata dictates that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\" <i>Perez v. Volvo Car Corp.,</i> 247 F.3d 303, 311 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Allen v. McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980)). The district court reasoned that Kosereis' administrative appeal of the lay-off, and the Commissioner's subsequent ruling that he was laid off for \"good and just cause,\" amounted to a final judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata. This ruling was incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical part of the district court's ruling stated that \"[t]he doctrine of res judicata applies to a decision of a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal,\" such as the decision by the Commissioner in the present case. To support this statement, the district court cited to <i>Department of Corrections of State of Rhode Island v. Tucker,</i> 657 A.2d 546, 549 (R.I.1995), in which the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that Rhode Island state courts give preclusive effect to quasi-judicial administrative tribunals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was correct in looking to state law for answers to questions regarding the preclusive effect of state administrative decisions. Federal common law generally requires that federal courts accord the decisions of state administrative agencies acting in a judicial capacity \"the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the State's courts.\" <i>Univ. of Tenn. v. Elliott,</i> 478 U.S. 788, 799, 106 S.Ct. 3220, 92 L.Ed.2d 635 (1986). But that is not the end of the matter. Even if state courts apply res judicata to state administrative decisions, federal courts will only follow suit if doing so is consistent with Congress' intent in enacting the federal statute at issue. <i>See Astoria Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. Solimino,</i> 501 U.S. 104, 110, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991) (citing <i>Elliott,</i> 478 U.S. at 796, 106 S.Ct. 3220). This means that when the preclusive effect of a state administrative decision is in question, the central inquiry is one of federal statutory interpretation. <i>See Thomas v. Contoocook Valley Sch. Dist.,</i> 150 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir.1998). In this case, the district court erred by looking no further than the predilections of the state court; the district court failed to consider the vital question of congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we need not canvass the congressional intent underlying Title VII. The Supreme Court has already considered the matter, and held that Congress did not intend that unreviewed state administrative decisions would prohibit plaintiffs from bringing subsequent Title VII actions in federal courts. <i>See Elliott,</i> 478 U.S. at 795-96, 106 S.Ct. 3220. We will, of course, follow the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Elliott.</i> The administrative decision issued by the Commissioner regarding Kosereis' lay-off was not reviewed by a court. It therefore does not have a preclusive effect on Kosereis' Title VII claims. <i>See Thomas,</i> 150 F.3d at 39 (\"It is now settled, however, that State agency findings that are <i>not reviewed</i> by a state court are not entitled to any preclusive effect in a subsequent action under Title VII\") (emphasis in original). Kosereis is free to use the facts related to his lay-off as evidence of disparate treatment. The district court's holding to the contrary is overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Disparate Treatment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis claims that he was denied equal terms and conditions of employment because of his religion and national origin. Kosereis concedes, however, that he lacks direct evidence of discrimination. This means that the case turns on whether Kosereis has presented sufficient circumstantial evidence of discrimination. <i>See Weston-Smith v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc.,</i> 282 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir.2002). To make this determination, we use the burden-shifting analysis from <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <i>See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> analysis, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case, which in turn gives rise to an inference of discrimination. <i>See Dichner v. Liberty Travel,</i> 141 F.3d 24, 29-30 (1st Cir.1998). The employer then must state a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision. <i>See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> 277 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.2002). If the employer can state such a reason, the inference of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff is required to show that the employer's stated reason is a pretext for discrimination. <i>See id.</i> at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the job; (3) the employer took an adverse employment action against him; and (4) the position remained open or was filled by a person with similar qualifications. <i>See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks,</i> 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993); <i>Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir.2000). The district court assumed, arguendo, that Kosereis made out a prima facie case. In doing so, it quoted language in <i>Rivera-Rodriguez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean,</i> 265 F.3d 15 (1st Cir.2001), and described the fourth prong as requiring plaintiff to show that \"other similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected class were treated more favorably.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25. This language was dicta, however; the plaintiff's prima facie case was not contested as part of that appeal. Nor did the case that <i>Rivera-Rodriguez</i> cited, <i>Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc.,</i> 98 F.3d 670, 673 (1st Cir.1996), involve the prima facie showing required for disparate treatment claims. Dicta, of course, is not binding on future panels. <i>See Municipality of San Juan v. Rullan,</i> 318 F.3d 26, 28 n. 3 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Conward v. Cambridge School Committee,</i> 171 F.3d 12 (1st Cir.1999), in contrast, we explicitly rejected the notion that plaintiffs in disparate treatment cases are required to demonstrate that they were treated differently as part of their prima facie case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Rather, we held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he time to consider comparative evidence in a disparate treatment case is at the third step of the burden-shifting ritual, when the need arises to test the pretextuality vel non of the employer's articulated reason for having acted adversely to the plaintiff's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 19. We have since repeated our <i>Conward</i> ruling. <i>See Fernandes,</i> 199 F.3d at 584 (\"[A] plaintiff need not show as part of his prima facie case that the employer either recalled similarly situated non-minority employees or otherwise treated employees of different ethnic backgrounds more favorably.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in <i>Conward</i> makes sense and is attuned to the applicable law. We have described the prima facie case as a \"small showing,\" <i>Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc.,</i> 244 F.3d 254, 259 (1st. Cir.2001), that is \"not onerous,\" <i>Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 54, and is \"easily made,\" <i>Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc.,</i> 283 F.3d 11, 30 (1st Cir.2002). The pretext analysis, on the other hand, is more demanding. <i>See Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (stating that the pretext analysis moves the inquiry \"to a new level of specificity\"). Thus, <i>Conward</i> presents the applicable rule: in disparate treatment cases, comparative evidence is to be treated as part of the pretext analysis, and not as part of the plaintiff's prima facie case. 171 F.3d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Conward,</i> the district court here went on to grant summary judgment because there was insufficient evidence of pretext. We agree that Kosereis failed to present adequate evidence of pretext to survive summary judgment, and affirm on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"ultimate touchstone\" of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> analysis is whether the employer's actions were improperly motivated by discrimination. <i>Fite v. Digital</i> <i>Equip. Corp.,</i> 232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2000). Evidence that the employer's stated reasons for its actions are pretextual can be sufficient to show improper motive, and hence, allow the plaintiff to survive summary judgment. <i>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <i>Fite,</i> 232 F.3d at 7; <i>Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort &amp; Country Club,</i> 218 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs can show that an employer's stated reasons are pretextual in any number of ways. <i>See Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 55. One method is to produce evidence that the plaintiff was treated differently than other similarly situated employees. <i>See Straughn,</i> 250 F.3d at 43-44; <i>Fernandes,</i> 199 F.3d at 581. To show disparate treatment, Kosereis relies heavily on the claim that only he was disciplined for failing to come to work on time. He says that other tardy employees were never disciplined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, however, does not support Kosereis' claims. There is simply no evidence that other teachers who failed to report to work were not disciplined. In fact, the evidence is just the opposite. Chorney testified at her deposition that she had issued written or verbal reprimands to employees other than Kosereis for being late to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis raises a number of other instances of disparate treatment. All of these are insufficient to show pretext because they do not involve facts or circumstances similar to those Kosereis faced. To successfully allege disparate treatment, a plaintiff must show \"that others similarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated differently by the employer.\" <i>Conward,</i> 171 F.3d at 20; <i>see also Rosado v. Radio Shack, Inc.,</i> 312 F.3d 532, 534 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that to have a plausible differential treatment claim, plaintiffs must show that others similarly situated were treated differently). The examples of disparate treatment \"need not be perfect replicas, [but] they must closely resemble one another in respect to relevant facts and circumstances.\" <i>Conward,</i> 171 F.3d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis claims that a secretary and some teachers were not disciplined after they returned late to work after going out to lunch for \"Secretary's Day.\" Kosereis admitted at his deposition, however, that he did not know whether the secretary and the teachers violated any rules. Kosereis did not know, for example, whether they had permission to return late or whether they used personal time for the lunch. He also did not say whether the teachers' late arrival caused them to miss classes, as was the case in his situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same vein, Kosereis claims that other teachers who behaved inappropriately were never disciplined. He cites an instance where a student's fingers were cut by a machine in a carpentry class. Chorney testified in her deposition that the teacher in charge of the carpentry class was not punished because the student had been told not to touch the machine, but disobeyed the teacher's order. Kosereis cites an instance where a staff member urinated outside the school. Chorney explained that the staff member was not punished because the incident did not take place on school property or on school time. Chorney also lacked personal knowledge of the incident. Kosereis says that a staff member once used profane language in Kosereis' classroom. Chorney explained that she did not discipline the staff member because she was not the staff member's supervisor, but she did forward a report of the incident to the appropriate person. In short, the long lunch for \"Secretary's Day,\" the accident in the carpentry class, the alleged urination, and the use of profanity are not sufficiently similar to the facts and circumstances surrounding Kosereis' discipline to give rise to a finding of pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis also points to examples of disparate treatment outside the context of disciplinary matters. Kosereis claims that he was required to work in a particular building that was dirty and lacked ventilation. Kosereis, however, admitted at his deposition that other teachers were required to work in the same building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis claims that he was not permitted to take a sabbatical in Turkey to study that country's juvenile justice system. He has presented no evidence, however, that other teachers were treated more favorably by being permitted to take sabbaticals overseas. Moreover, Kosereis was granted a sabbatical, albeit to take courses in Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis says that other vocational teachers, such as the carpentry and culinary arts teachers, were given equipment and their own classrooms. Specifically, Kosereis complains that he was not given a shop in which to teach auto mechanics and was not permitted to use an automobile in his class. The record demonstrates, however, that the auto mechanics program was not unique in this regard. Chorney testified at her deposition that the health vocational program, like the auto mechanics program, does not have its own equipment or a special classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Training School was without an auto mechanics shop well before the alleged discrimination took place. Chorney explained that there has not been an auto mechanics shop at the Training School since at least 1989 because of budgetary constraints. She also said that Kosereis' proposal to bring an automobile to school as a teaching aid was rejected for safety and security reasons. Chorney was concerned that there was no place inside the school to store the automobile, and that it would remain outside and unsecured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis alleges that in 1995 the Training School announced that three other teachers, in addition to Kosereis, were to be laid off, but only Kosereis' job was actually eliminated. Chorney explained at her deposition that the other teachers were not laid off because they resigned after learning of the lay-offs. Their jobs were not filled and the positions were eliminated. There is no evidence that Kosereis was treated differently than the teachers who resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one piece of evidence, however, that merits careful analysis. In 1998, Kosereis received a written reprimand from Chorney for falsifying his time records. Kosereis informed Chorney that he was not working on the alleged date of the falsification. Chorney then amended the written reprimand with new dates. Kosereis contested the reprimand and it was ultimately expunged from his record. Chorney maintains that she simply made a mistake as to the dates. Kosereis says this evidence shows that Chorney's disciplinary measures were pretextual. We do not think this one incident, standing alone, is enough to permit a reasonable jury to find that the defendants' explanation for Kosereis' discipline was pretextual. This is especially true in light of Kosereis' numerous other instances of absenteeism and tardiness &#8212; none of which he contests. <i>See Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (stating that summary judgment may be appropriate \"if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred.\"). Rather, Chorney's changing of the dates creates only a \"slight suggestion of pretext,\" which we have held is insufficient to survive summary judgment. <i>Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 47 (citing <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, all of the instances of disparate treatment cited by Kosereis, save the one involving the expunged reprimand, are either unsupported by the record or are distinguishable in important respects from the facts and circumstances that Kosereis faced. <i>See Straughn,</i> 250 F.3d at 43-44. We have been \"particularly cautious\" about affirming an employer's motion for summary judgment on a discrimination claim when the case boils down to whether the employer's stated reasons are pretextual. <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 167 (1st Cir.1998) (citation omitted). But the evidence that Kosereis presents regarding pretext is so weak that we have no difficulty affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment as to the disparate treatment claim. <i>See Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 47-48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Hostile Work Environment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A hostile work environment exists in violation of Title VII \"[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.\" <i>See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (citations and quotation marks omitted). There is no \"mathematically precise test\" to determine whether Kosereis presented sufficient evidence that he was subjected to a hostile work environment. <i>Id.</i> Rather, we look to all the circumstances, including the frequency and severity of the discriminatory conduct, whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, and whether it unreasonably interfered with Kosereis' work performance. <i>See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</i> 536 U.S. 101, 116, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002); <i>Gorski v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 290 F.3d 466, 472 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis claims that he was subjected to a hostile work environment when the residents of the Training School called him \"turkey,\" when fellow teachers teased him in the lunchroom about his food, and when Chorney issued him repeated reprimands for his absenteeism. Mindful that \"[t]he accumulated effect of incidents\" can amount to a hostile work environment over time, we consider Kosereis' evidence collectively. <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 729 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The name calling by the residents of the Training School and the teasing by the teachers in the lunchroom do not rise to the level of \"severe or pervasive conduct,\" that is required for a hostile work environment claim. <i>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 754, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998). A hostile work environment generally is not created by a \"mere offensive utterance,\" <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367; nor does it arise from \"simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents.\" <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). Courts are supposed to use \"[c]ommon sense, and an appropriate sensitivity to social context,\" to distinguish between such innocuous behavior and severely hostile or abusive conduct. <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Serv., Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 82, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Kosereis, an adult, was called names by children who reside at a juvenile correction facility. When Kosereis complained to Chorney about the name calling, she met with the children and other staff members on two separate occasions to resolve the problem. As for the teasing by fellow teachers about Kosereis' food, there is no evidence in the record that this teasing was frequent or severe. It also bears mentioning that Kosereis has not produced any evidence that the comments about which he complains, either those made by the children or those made by his colleagues, were physically threatening or interfered with his work performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is even less merit to Kosereis' claim that he suffered a hostile work environment because of Chorney's repeated reprimands. The reprimands were frequent only because Kosereis continued to miss work. If Kosereis wished for the reprimands to stop, then he could have simply arrived at work on time. The name calling by the children, the alleged teasing by the teachers, and Chorney's reprimands did not create a hostile work environment. <i>See, e.g., DeNovellis v. Shalala,</i> 124 F.3d 298, 311 (1st Cir.1997). The district court's grant of summary judgment on Kosereis' hostile work environment claim is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Retaliation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To maintain a claim of discriminatory retaliation, a plaintiff must produce evidence that (1) he engaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2) he experienced an adverse employment action; and (3) a casual connection exists between the protected conduct and the adverse action. <i>See Gu v. Boston Police Dep't,</i> 312 F.3d 6, 14 (1st Cir.2002). The parties dispute only the final prong of the analysis, and our discussion is limited accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis says that Chorney's reprimands and her denial of his sabbatical to Turkey constituted retaliation for filing his claims of discrimination with the RICHR and the EEOC. After carefully examining the record, we can find no evidence that a casual connection exists between the denial of the sabbatical and Kosereis' charges of discrimination. In fact, Kosereis was permitted to take a sabbatical in Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any evidence connecting Kosereis' reprimands to the discrimination charges he filed with the RICHR and the EEOC in 1996. \"It is insufficient for [Kosereis] to simply recount that he complained and that he was disciplined....\" <i>King v. Town of Hanover,</i> 116 F.3d 965, 968 (1st Cir.1997). In fact, the warning letter Kosereis received in 1981 and the disciplinary proceedings that were initiated against him in 1995 demonstrate that Kosereis had been disciplined for instances of absenteeism well before the alleged discrimination took place. The district court's grant of summary judgment on Kosereis' retaliation claim is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record in the light most favorable to Kosereis, we conclude that he has failed to produce evidence that he was treated differently than fellow co-workers because of his religion or national origin, was subjected to a hostile work environment, or suffered discriminatory retaliation. The district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants is AFFIRMED. No costs are awarded on appeal.

Kosereis alleged that the defendants discriminated against him based on his religion and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e, and various state laws. The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment because Kosereis failed to produce sufficient evidence that he suffered from discrimination. Although the district court's decision contained legal errors, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When reviewing a district court's grant of summary judgment, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>See Sands v. Ridefilm Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198937\"><a href=\"/opinion/198937/sands-v-ridefilm/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span>, 661 (1st Cir.2000). Kosereis is a Turkish-born Muslim who works as a vocational teacher at the Training School. The Training School is a juvenile correction facility that contains both classrooms and residences. Kosereis has worked for the Training School since 1975. During his tenure, he has taught woodworking, autobody, and at the times relevant to this appeal, welding and auto mechanics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis has experienced difficulties with tardiness and absenteeism. In 1981, the Training School issued Kosereis a reminder about taking excessive sick leave without proper documentation. The problem became worse in the mid-1990s when Arlene Chorney (\"Chorney\") was hired as principal of the Training School. According to Kosereis, his discriminatory treatment \"started the day Dr. Chorney became principal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chorney instituted a new work schedule that, in Kosereis' words, was \"very complicated.\" Kosereis claims that the complexity of the work schedule caused him to become confused about when he was required to report for work. In 1995, for example, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Kosereis because he missed work without notifying the proper personnel. In 1996, Kosereis was verbally disciplined for being late to a class. In 1997, Kosereis was given a written reprimand for failing to report to his first period class. In 1998, Kosereis received a disciplinary letter for falsifying his time records. This reprimand, however, was later expunged from his record. In 1999, Kosereis was verbally reprimanded after he failed to report for work in the morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that Chorney made efforts to clarify the work schedule. As part of the verbal reprimand in 1996, Chorney explained the schedule to Kosereis in the presence of his union representative. In Kosereis' 1997 letter, Chorney again offered Kosereis help:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a professional, you are expected to arrive to school and classes on time. You are also expected to follow your schedule. If you are unable to understand your schedule, I will assist you further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the alleged complicated work schedule, Kosereis claims that Chorney was responsible for a host of other problems. He says that Chorney did not give him sufficient funding, adequate supplies or proper facilities to teach auto mechanics. Kosereis was required to work in a particular building that he says lacked ventilation and was dirty. Chorney denied Kosereis' request for a sabbatical to travel to Turkey and study that country's juvenile justice system. Instead, Kosereis was granted a sabbatical to take courses in Rhode Island. Kosereis also says that Chorney did not do enough to stop students from calling him \"turkey\" and teachers teasing him about his Turkish food in the lunchroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Kosereis was laid off and soon after initiated an administrative appeal with the Rhode Island Commissioner of Education (\"the Commissioner\"). While the appeal was pending, Kosereis filed a claim with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (\"RICHR\") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") alleging that his job was terminated because of discrimination. The EEOC ultimately issued Kosereis a right to sue letter, but the RICHR did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Kosereis' administrative appeal of his lay-off was decided. The Commissioner determined that Kosereis was laid off for \"good and just cause,\" but nevertheless reinstated him with backpay because he did not receive a timely notice of his lay-off.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years after Kosereis returned to work, he filed another set of claims with the RICHR and the EEOC. This time, he alleged that Chorney's disciplinary actions stemming from his absenteeism constituted discrimination. Kosereis claimed he was disciplined in retaliation for filing his earlier claims of discrimination. Both the RICHR and the EEOC issued right to sue letters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having properly navigated the administrative waters of the RICHR and the EEOC, Kosereis filed a complaint in the district court. He alleged that the defendants violated Title VII by creating a hostile work environment and denying him equal terms and conditions of employment because of his religion and national origin. Kosereis then amended his complaint and added the allegation of retaliation. Kosereis also raised claims under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 42-112-1 (1998), and the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-5-1 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court referred the case to a Magistrate Judge who recommended that the defendants' motion be granted. The district court adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both the federal and state law claims. Kosereis filed a timely appeal, but challenged only the district court's rulings regarding the federal law claims. It is to these rulings we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. See Muniz Cortes v. Intermedics, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770704\"><a href=\"/opinion/770704/pedro-muiz-cortes-and-the-estate-of-clotilde-diaz-sustache-composed-by/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2000). Summary judgment for the defendants is appropriate when the evidence is so one-sided that no reasonable person could find in favor of the plaintiff. <i>See Kearney v. Town of Wareham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200237\"><a href=\"/opinion/200237/kearney-v-town-of-wareham/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2002). There are four issues we must address in this appeal: whether Kosereis was precluded from litigating issues pertaining to his lay-off; whether Kosereis was treated differently than other co-workers because of his religion and national origin; whether Kosereis suffered from a hostile work environment; and whether Kosereis was subjected to discriminatory retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Preclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our initial inquiry is whether Kosereis can, as part of this case, delve into matters related to his 1995 lay-off. The lay-off is important to Kosereis in this litigation because he believes it helps establish that he was subjected to disparate treatment, a topic which we will discuss later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the doctrine of res judicata barred Kosereis from litigating any issues related to his lay-off. \"Under federal law, the doctrine of res judicata dictates that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\" <i>Perez v. Volvo Car Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199393\"><a href=\"/opinion/199393/perez-de-munoz-v-volvo-car-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 311 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Allen v. McCurry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span> (1980)). The district court reasoned that Kosereis' administrative appeal of the lay-off, and the Commissioner's subsequent ruling that he was laid off for \"good and just cause,\" amounted to a final judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata. This ruling was incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical part of the district court's ruling stated that \"[t]he doctrine of res judicata applies to a decision of a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal,\" such as the decision by the Commissioner in the present case. To support this statement, the district court cited to <i>Department of Corrections of State of Rhode Island v. Tucker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403871\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403871/department-of-correction-of-state-of-ri-v-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 549 (R.I.1995), in which the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that Rhode Island state courts give preclusive effect to quasi-judicial administrative tribunals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was correct in looking to state law for answers to questions regarding the preclusive effect of state administrative decisions. Federal common law generally requires that federal courts accord the decisions of state administrative agencies acting in a judicial capacity \"the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the State's courts.\" <i>Univ. of Tenn. v. Elliott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111757\"><a href=\"/opinion/111757/universityof-tennessee-v-elliott/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 799, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111757\"><a href=\"/opinion/111757/universityof-tennessee-v-elliott/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3220</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111757\"><a href=\"/opinion/111757/universityof-tennessee-v-elliott/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span> (1986). But that is not the end of the matter. Even if state courts apply res judicata to state administrative decisions, federal courts will only follow suit if doing so is consistent with Congress' intent in enacting the federal statute at issue. <i>See Astoria Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. Solimino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112618\"><a href=\"/opinion/112618/astoria-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-solimino/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 110, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112618\"><a href=\"/opinion/112618/astoria-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-solimino/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2166</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112618\"><a href=\"/opinion/112618/astoria-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-solimino/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (1991) (citing <i>Elliott,</i> 478 U.S. at 796, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111757\"><a href=\"/opinion/111757/universityof-tennessee-v-elliott/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3220</span></a></span>). This means that when the preclusive effect of a state administrative decision is in question, the central inquiry is one of federal statutory interpretation. <i>See Thomas v. Contoocook Valley Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198071\"><a href=\"/opinion/198071/thomas-v-contoocook-valley/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.1998). In this case, the district court erred by looking no further than the predilections of the state court; the district court failed to consider the vital question of congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we need not canvass the congressional intent underlying Title VII. The Supreme Court has already considered the matter, and held that Congress did not intend that unreviewed state administrative decisions would prohibit plaintiffs from bringing subsequent Title VII actions in federal courts. <i>See Elliott,</i> 478 U.S. at 795-96, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111757\"><a href=\"/opinion/111757/universityof-tennessee-v-elliott/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3220</span></a></span>. We will, of course, follow the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Elliott.</i> The administrative decision issued by the Commissioner regarding Kosereis' lay-off was not reviewed by a court. It therefore does not have a preclusive effect on Kosereis' Title VII claims. <i>See Thomas,</i> 150 F.3d at 39 (\"It is now settled, however, that State agency findings that are <i>not reviewed</i> by a state court are not entitled to any preclusive effect in a subsequent action under Title VII\") (emphasis in original). Kosereis is free to use the facts related to his lay-off as evidence of disparate treatment. The district court's holding to the contrary is overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Disparate Treatment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis claims that he was denied equal terms and conditions of employment because of his religion and national origin. Kosereis concedes, however, that he lacks direct evidence of discrimination. This means that the case turns on whether Kosereis has presented sufficient circumstantial evidence of discrimination. <i>See Weston-Smith v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199863\"><a href=\"/opinion/199863/weston-smith-v-cooley-dickinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2002). To make this determination, we use the burden-shifting analysis from <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Liberty Travel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197902\"><a href=\"/opinion/197902/dichner-v-liberty-travel/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29-30 (1st Cir.1998). The employer then must state a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision. <i>See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776184\"><a href=\"/opinion/776184/ram-n-zapata-matos-v-reckitt-colman-inc-fka-lf-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2002). If the employer can state such a reason, the inference of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff is required to show that the employer's stated reason is a pretext for discrimination. <i>See id.</i> at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the job; (3) the employer took an adverse employment action against him; and (4) the position remained open or was filled by a person with similar qualifications. <i>See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.

The district court assumed, arguendo, that Kosereis made out a prima facie case. In doing so, it quoted language in <i>Rivera-Rodriguez v.

This language was dicta, however; the plaintiff's prima facie case was not contested as part of that appeal. Nor did the case that <i>Rivera-Rodriguez</i> cited, <i>Mulero-Rodriguez v.

One method is to produce evidence that the plaintiff was treated differently than other similarly situated employees. <i>See Straughn,</i> 250 F.3d at 43-44; <i>Fernandes,</i> 199 F.3d at 581. To show disparate treatment, Kosereis relies heavily on the claim that only he was disciplined for failing to come to work on time.

There is simply no evidence that other teachers who failed to report to work were not disciplined. In fact, the evidence is just the opposite. Chorney testified at her deposition that she had issued written or verbal reprimands to employees other than Kosereis for being late to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis raises a number of other instances of disparate treatment. All of these are insufficient to show pretext because they do not involve facts or circumstances similar to those Kosereis faced. To successfully allege disparate treatment, a plaintiff must show \"that others similarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated differently by the employer.\" <i>Conward,</i> 171 F.3d at 20; <i>see also Rosado v. Radio Shack, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200242\"><a href=\"/opinion/200242/rivas-rosado-v-radio-shack-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 534 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that to have a plausible differential treatment claim, plaintiffs must show that others similarly situated were treated differently). The examples of disparate treatment \"need not be perfect replicas, [but] they must closely resemble one another in respect to relevant facts and circumstances.\" <i>Conward,</i> 171 F.3d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis claims that a secretary and some teachers were not disciplined after they returned late to work after going out to lunch for \"Secretary's Day.\" Kosereis admitted at his deposition, however, that he did not know whether the secretary and the teachers violated any rules. Kosereis did not know, for example, whether they had permission to return late or whether they used personal time for the lunch. He also did not say whether the teachers' late arrival caused them to miss classes, as was the case in his situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same vein, Kosereis claims that other teachers who behaved inappropriately were never disciplined. He cites an instance where a student's fingers were cut by a machine in a carpentry class. Chorney testified in her deposition that the teacher in charge of the carpentry class was not punished because the student had been told not to touch the machine, but disobeyed the teacher's order. Kosereis cites an instance where a staff member urinated outside the school. Chorney explained that the staff member was not punished because the incident did not take place on school property or on school time. Chorney also lacked personal knowledge of the incident. Kosereis says that a staff member once used profane language in Kosereis' classroom. Chorney explained that she did not discipline the staff member because she was not the staff member's supervisor, but she did forward a report of the incident to the appropriate person. In short, the long lunch for \"Secretary's Day,\" the accident in the carpentry class, the alleged urination, and the use of profanity are not sufficiently similar to the facts and circumstances surrounding Kosereis' discipline to give rise to a finding of pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis also points to examples of disparate treatment outside the context of disciplinary matters. Kosereis claims that he was required to work in a particular building that was dirty and lacked ventilation. Kosereis, however, admitted at his deposition that other teachers were required to work in the same building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis claims that he was not permitted to take a sabbatical in Turkey to study that country's juvenile justice system. He has presented no evidence, however, that other teachers were treated more favorably by being permitted to take sabbaticals overseas. Moreover, Kosereis was granted a sabbatical, albeit to take courses in Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis says that other vocational teachers, such as the carpentry and culinary arts teachers, were given equipment and their own classrooms. Specifically, Kosereis complains that he was not given a shop in which to teach auto mechanics and was not permitted to use an automobile in his class. The record demonstrates, however, that the auto mechanics program was not unique in this regard. Chorney testified at her deposition that the health vocational program, like the auto mechanics program, does not have its own equipment or a special classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Training School was without an auto mechanics shop well before the alleged discrimination took place. Chorney explained that there has not been an auto mechanics shop at the Training School since at least 1989 because of budgetary constraints. She also said that Kosereis' proposal to bring an automobile to school as a teaching aid was rejected for safety and security reasons. Chorney was concerned that there was no place inside the school to store the automobile, and that it would remain outside and unsecured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kosereis alleges that in 1995 the Training School announced that three other teachers, in addition to Kosereis, were to be laid off, but only Kosereis' job was actually eliminated. Chorney explained at her deposition that the other teachers were not laid off because they resigned after learning of the lay-offs. Their jobs were not filled and the positions were eliminated. There is no evidence that Kosereis was treated differently than the teachers who resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one piece of evidence, however, that merits careful analysis. In 1998, Kosereis received a written reprimand from Chorney for falsifying his time records. Kosereis informed Chorney that he was not working on the alleged date of the falsification. Chorney then amended the written reprimand with new dates. Kosereis contested the reprimand and it was ultimately expunged from his record. Chorney maintains that she simply made a mistake as to the dates. Kosereis says this evidence shows that Chorney's disciplinary measures were pretextual. We do not think this one incident, standing alone, is enough to permit a reasonable jury to find that the defendants' explanation for Kosereis' discipline was pretextual. This is especially true in light of Kosereis' numerous other instances of absenteeism and tardiness &#8212; none of which he contests. <i>See Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 148, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When Kosereis complained to Chorney about the name calling, she met with the children and other staff members on two separate occasions to resolve the problem. As for the teasing by fellow teachers about Kosereis' food, there is no evidence in the record that this teasing was frequent or severe.

The reprimands were frequent only because Kosereis continued to miss work. If Kosereis wished for the reprimands to stop, then he could have simply arrived at work on time.

In fact, the warning letter Kosereis received in 1981 and the disciplinary proceedings that were initiated against him in 1995 demonstrate that Kosereis had been disciplined for instances of absenteeism well before the alleged discrimination took place.
