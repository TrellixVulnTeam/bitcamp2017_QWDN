A       grand    jury\n\nindicted     defendant       Edgar    Pomales-Lebrón          and       five     co-\n\ndefendants    for    drug-trafficking            offenses.     Defendant         was\n\ncharged     with:    (1)    conspiracy      to    possess    with       intent    to\n\ndistribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base, in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846 (Count 1); and (2) possession with\n\nintent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count 2). 1\n\nA petit jury convicted defendant on both counts.                        On appeal,\n\ndefendant     challenges       his   convictions,          arguing       that    the\n\ndistrict     court     erred    in    denying       his:     (1)       Motion    for\n\nAcquittal; and (2) Motion for New Trial.                    See Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 29, 33.     As to defendant’s Rule 29 Motion for Acquittal,\n\nwe   have   jurisdiction,      pursuant      to    28   U.S.C.     §    1291,    and\n\naffirm.     As to defendant’s arguments pertaining to Rule 33,\n\nwe lack jurisdiction and dismiss.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Viewed     in    the     light       most   favorable         to     the\n\ngovernment, the trial evidence demonstrated that: in late\n\n2003, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Agent\n\n\n      1\n         In addition, the First Superceding Indictment\nincluded a Count 3, which stated that any property derived\nfrom the offenses stated in Counts 1 and 2 would be subject\nto forfeiture.   The district court dismissed Count 3 for\nlack of evidence after defendant rested his case. (12/2 Tr.\n75.)\n\n                                      -2-\n\fTodd Yant (SA Yant) began investigating the Joel Rivera-\n\nDelgado           drug-trafficking         organization           (the      Rivera\n\norganization) based in Guayama, Puerto Rico.                        (Tr. 68:10-\n\n11.)         To    further     the     investigation,      DEA     used    a   paid\n\nconfidential          source      (CS)     to     infiltrate        the     Rivera\n\norganization.         (Id.; see also 12/2 Tr. 30.)                At trial, the\n\nCS testified in person and admitted he used marijuana in\n\nDecember 2003 and January 2004.                 (See 12/2 Tr. 29, 32.)\n\n              On    December     19,    2003,   the   CS   was    introduced     to\n\nHarry Arizmendi-Serrano, a Rivera organization affiliate.\n\n(11/30 Tr. 78; 12/1 Tr. 100.)               The CS purchased 100 vials of\n\ncocaine base (crack), weighing 7.4 grams (12/1 Tr. 16), from\n\nArizmendi.         (11/30 Tr. 78; 12/1 Tr. 100.)             According to the\n\nCS,     although      he   did   not     know    defendant       Edgar    Pomales-\n\nLebrón’s       name   at   the   time    (12/1    Tr.    131),    defendant     was\n\npresent when he purchased crack from Arizmendi on December\n\n19. 2       (12/1 Tr. 101, 104, 109-10.)                The CS recorded this\n\n        2\n       The CS did not inform the government that defendant\nwas present at the December 19, 2003 transaction until\nNovember 30, 2005, after the conclusion of the first day of\ndefendant’s trial. (12/1 Tr. 2.) Before the trial resumed\non December 1, 2005, the government apprised the district\ncourt and defendant of this development.      (12/1 Tr. 2.)\nDefendant objected to the CS’s proposed testimony regarding\ndefendant’s presence at the December 19, 2003 deal.      (12/1\nTr. 103.)  Specifically, defendant argued that he would be\nprejudiced by such testimony due to, inter alia, his having\ninadequate time to prepare.   (12/1 Tr. 103.)   The district\ncourt, however, allowed the testimony finding: (1) no bad\n                                                    (continued...)\n\n                                         -3-\n\ftransaction;      DEA     conducted     partial    video     surveillance. 3\n\n(12/1 Tr. 75-76, 105.)\n\n            On December 31, 2003, the CS arranged for a larger\n\ncontrolled buy from Arizmendi.               (11/30 Tr. 79-80.)       SA Yant\n\ntestified that the 600 crack vials the CS purchased on that\n\ndate weighed 49 grams.          (11/30 Tr. 81.)         DEA conducted video\n\nsurveillance of the deal.            (12/1 Tr. 83.)       Defendant was not\n\npresent during the December 31 transaction.                  (12/1 Tr. 16,\n\n23.)\n\n            On January 12, 2004, the CS met with Arizmendi and\n\ndefendant to arrange a 1000-vial crack buy.                 (11/30 Tr. 84-\n\n85; 12/1 Tr. 117.)         The CS learned defendant’s name for the\n\nfirst time at this meeting.              (11/30 Tr. 84; 12/1 Tr. 130-\n\n31.)       When   asked    by    the    CS,    defendant     and   Arizmendi\n\nidentified their supplier as “Joel.” 4              (12/1 Tr. 132-33.)\n\n\n(...continued)\nfaith on the government’s part; (2) the December 19, 2003\nbuy was, in any event, carried out during, and in\nfurtherance of, the charged conspiracy; (3) the government\npromptly disclosed this development to the court and\nopposing counsel; and (4) defendant had sufficient time to\nprepare (i.e., primarily during the one and one-half hour\nlunch break). (See 12/1 Tr. 103.)\n       3\n        DEA’s video surveillance did not capture the\ntransaction in its entirety because much of the transaction\nunexpectedly transpired away from the surveillance location.\n(11/30 Tr. 75-76.)\n       4\n            Although    the     CS   recorded     the    January   12, 2004\n                                                                    (continued...)\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            The next day, January 13, 2004, the CS purchased\n\n1000 vials (73.7 grams) of crack from defendant.                (Id. 85,\n\n87; 12/1 Tr. 122-25; see also 12/1 Tr. 17.)             The CS recorded\n\nthe transaction; DEA conducted partial video surveillance. 5\n\nThe audio recordings from the CS’s wire were played to the\n\njury.     (12/2 Tr. 5.)    On the recording, a voice — identified\n\nas defendant’s by the CS — is heard counting.              (12/2 Tr. 9-\n\n10; 12/1 Tr. 122-25.)          The CS testified that defendant was\n\ncounting money he had handed to defendant in payment for the\n\nnarcotics.     (12/2 Tr. 9-10; 12/1 Tr. 122-25.)           Later on the\n\nrecording, defendant is heard saying to the CS: “[T]ake that\n\nbag, and let’s get the F out of here.”            (12/2 Tr. 9-10; 12/1\n\nTr.   122-25.)    The     CS   testified   that   the   “bag”   defendant\n\nreferred to was the bag containing the 1000 vials of crack. 6\n\n(12/2 Tr. 11.)\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nmeeting, the recording proved unintelligible.    (11/30 Tr.\n85.) T he district court, consequently, refused to admit the\nrecording into evidence. (12/1 Tr. 141, 148.)\n      5\n       As with the December 19, 2003 transaction, see supra\nnote 3, DEA’s video surveillance did not capture the entire\ntransaction.   SA Yant explained that the deal’s location\nchanged several times as it unfolded.   (12/1 Tr. 83, 87.)\n      6\n      In addition to the aforementioned, SA Yant testified\nregarding two other drug buys that purportedly occurred\nduring the charged conspiracy.  Both of those transactions\ninvolved defendant’s co-conspirators; SA Yant testified,\nhowever, that defendant was not implicated in either of\nthose incidents. (11/30 Tr. 124; 12/1 Tr. 4.)\n\n                                   -5-\n\f             After     the    January        13,   2004       transaction,      the      CS\n\nplaced — at the DEA’s direction — several recorded calls to\n\ndefendant.          (12/1 Tr. 133.)              The district court admitted\n\nthese recordings into evidence; they were played for the\n\njury. (12/2 Tr. 14-17, 20.)                  As to each recorded call, the\n\nCS identified defendant’s voice, as well as his own.                                (See\n\nid.)\n\n             In the first recorded call, the CS referenced “a\n\nthousand” and stated that “the stuff was good” in talking to\n\ndefendant.      (12/2 Tr. 14.)               The CS testified that this was\n\na reference to the January 13, 2004 buy.                            (12/2 Tr. 14-15;\n\n12/1 Tr. 134.)         The connection dropped and the call ended.\n\nDuring the second call, the CS asked defendant about whether\n\nhe   could     get     “2000”      (which,         the    CS    testified,         was    a\n\nreference      to    2000     vials     of    crack).          (12/2     Tr.    15-16.)\n\nDefendant refused to discuss the matter over the phone with\n\nthe CS.      (12/2 Tr. 15-16.)\n\n             In the third call, the CS tried to get defendant to\n\nagree to meet his “friend” (in reality, an undercover DEA\n\nagent).        (12/2       Tr.    16;     12/1     Tr.    133-34.)           Defendant,\n\nhowever, refused.            (12/1 Tr. 134.)              At some point in this\n\nconversation,        the     CS   mentioned        “fifteen         hundred”   —   i.e.,\n\n1500   vials    of     crack      (12/2    Tr.     18)    —    to    which    defendant\n\nresponded: “[N]o, those things cannot be talked about over\n\n                                           -6-\n\fthe telephone.”          (12/2 Tr. 18.)          During the fourth, and\n\nfinal, recorded call, the CS asked defendant to discount ten\n\ncents    on    each    “nail.”        (12/2    Tr.     20.)     The    CS     also\n\nreferenced “fifteen hundred nails.”                  (12/2 Tr. 20.)      The CS\n\ntestified that by “nail” he was referring to one vial of\n\ncrack.    (12/2 Tr. 20-21.)\n\n              Based on these conversations, as well as other DEA\n\ninvestigatory         efforts,   SA   Yant     applied    for   a     Title    III\n\nwiretap of defendant’s phone number. 7                 A U.S. District Judge\n\ngranted SA Yant’s application on March 25, 2004.                     (11/30 Tr.\n\n105; see also 11/30 Tr. 100-04.)               During the thirty-day wire\n\ntap, DEA intercepted and recorded several drug-trafficking\n\nrelated discussions on defendant’s phone line.                  The district\n\ncourt admitted portions of these recorded calls, which were\n\nplayed    for    the    jury.     (E.g.,       11/30    Tr.   107,    128     (co-\n\ndefendant Omar Caraballo-García’s arrest for possessing 13\n\nvials    of    crack    discussed     by     defendant    and   Arizmendi       on\n\ndefendant’s wire); e.g., 11/30 Tr. 108, 124-25, 136 (seizure\n\nof 600 vials of crack from a suspected member of the Rivera\n\norganization – “Otto” – whose vehicle was used during the\n\n\n    7\n        Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe\nStreets Act of 1968 is codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-22\n(Title  III).     Authorities  can   apply  “for  an  order\nauthorizing or approving the interception of a wire, oral,\nor electronic communication” pursuant to the procedures set\nforth in 18 U.S.C. § 2518.   18 U.S.C. § 2518.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fDecember 31, 2003 and January 13, 2004 drug transactions,\n\ndiscussed by defendant and Arizmendi on defendant’s wire);\n\nsee    also,   e.g.,     11/30      Tr.    132-33     (conversation             between\n\ndefendant      and     Arizmendi      regarding           Joel        Rivera      having\n\n“2100”); 11/30 Tr. 138-39 (conversation between defendant\n\nand Joel Rivera regarding Otto’s arrest after the 600-vial\n\nseizure).)          Additionally,          based     on    his        investigation,\n\nSA Yant testified that his conservative estimation was that\n\nthe Rivera organization sold 125 grams of crack per week\n\nbetween 2002-2005.           (12/1 Tr. 4-5, 10.)\n\n            At the close of the government’s case, defendant\n\nmoved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.\n\n(12/2    Tr.   70.)      The     district       court      denied         the   motion,\n\nfinding sufficient evidence had been introduced to support\n\ndefendant’s conviction on both Count 1 and Count 2.                                (12/2\n\nTr. 70.)\n\n                                          II.\n\n            Under     Fed.     R.   Crim.       P.   29,       we    “must      enter   a\n\njudgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence\n\nis insufficient to sustain a conviction.”                           Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n29.     We review a denial of a motion for acquittal “de novo\n\nto    determine      whether    any   rational       factfinder            could    have\n\nfound that the evidence presented at trial, together with\n\nall     reasonable      inferences,         viewed        in        the   light     most\n\n                                          -8-\n\ffavorable to the government, established each element of the\n\nparticular     offense       beyond      a    reasonable       doubt.”      United\n\nStates v. Campbell, 268 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n             To establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, the\n\ngovernment must prove: “[1] the existence of a conspiracy,\n\n[2] the defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and [3] the\n\ndefendant's        knowing       and    voluntary       participation      in    the\n\nconspiracy.”         United States v. Portalla, 496 F.3d 23, 26\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).            To establish a violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§     841,    the        government      must        prove     that     defendant:\n\n(1)       possessed       crack        cocaine,       “either       actually      or\n\nconstructively,”          (2)    “did    so    with    a     specific   intent    to\n\ndistribute the [crack] cocaine over which [he] had actual or\n\nconstructive        possession,”        and    (3)    “did     so   knowingly    and\n\nintentionally.”           United States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d 1,\n\n19 (1st Cir. 2002).              Review of the record makes clear that\n\nthe evidence introduced at trial adequately supported the\n\njury’s verdicts.\n\n             The recordings of the December 31, 2003 buy, the\n\nJanuary 13, 2004 buy, and the calls between defendant and\n\nthe CS (including the Title III calls) are likely sufficient\n\n— on their own — to support defendant’s convictions on Count\n\n1   and    Count    2.      We   agree    with    the      district     court   that\n\ndefendant’s voice — particularly on the January 13, 2004\n\n                                         -9-\n\frecording and the Title III calls — constitutes compelling\n\nevidence     of      defendant’s      guilt.         Even    if,   as    defendant\n\nsuggests,      this       evidence     could        be    interpreted        as    non-\n\nincriminating, other evidence readily supported the jury’s\n\nverdict.     See Campbell, 268 F.3d at 6 (reviewing court must\n\nview   the     evidence       in    the     light    most    favorable        to     the\n\ngovernment).\n\n             The CS’s testimony further evidenced                   defendant’s\n\nguilt.       The     CS’s    testimony       was    corroborated        by    several\n\nsources, including the recorded conversations between the CS\n\nand defendant, as well as SA Yant’s testimony.                          See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Vazquez Guadalupe, 407 F.3d 492, 499 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (case did not turn on the CS’s testimony where\n\nthere were “audio and video tapes, in which the defendants\n\nincriminated themselves”).                Indeed, SA Yant’s testimony, and\n\nthe recorded conversation itself, track the CS’s testimony.\n\n Cf. United States v. Andujar-Basco, 488 F.3d 549, 558 (1st\n\nCir.   2007)      (case     hinged    on    the    CS’s    testimony,        but    that\n\ntestimony      was    “corroborated         by    several    sources”).            Taken\n\ntogether, the recorded conversations and the CS’s testimony\n\nprovided ample — even overwhelming — evidence from which a\n\nrational juror could have found defendant guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt on both charges.\n\n             Contrary       to     defendant’s       position,     the       district\n\n                                           -10-\n\fcourt did not err in permitting the CS to testify in light\n\nof   his     admitted    marijuana      use    and     compensation      by    DEA.\n\nDefendant failed to make a timely objection at trial. 8                         See\n\nUnited States v. Mangual-García, Nos. 05-2275, 05-2414, 2007\n\nWL 2702973, at *5 (1st Cir. Sept. 18, 2007).                       Defendant’s\n\n“failure to object to the omission of such an express trial-\n\nend determination bars him from raising the point on appeal\n\nin the absence of plain error.”                Id.; see also Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 52(b).         No plain error is evident here as defendant’s\n\nposition lacks merit.           See id.\n\n              The   issues     raised     by    defendant    do    not    go       to\n\nadmissibility, but rather pertain to the credibility of the\n\nCS’s testimony.         See United States v. Vázquez-Guadalupe, 407\n\nF.3d       492,   499   (1st   Cir.   2007)     (deeming    testimony         of    a\n\ngovernment witness, a criminal defendant being paid by the\n\ngovernment for his cooperation, admissible and noting the\n\ncredibility of that testimony “is left for the jury”).                          The\n\njury was free to — as it presumably did — credit the CS’s\n\ntestimony, notwithstanding his marijuana use and government\n\ncompensation.            Id.   (rejecting        the    argument      that      the\n\n“government         cannot      conduct        sting      operations          using\n\n\n       8\n        We note that while neither party addresses whether\ndefendant objected to the CS’s testimony on the grounds that\nhe was compensated and used marijuana, our review of the\ntranscript indicates that defendant failed to do so.\n\n                                        -11-\n\findividuals    who    expect      to   receive   .     .    .   financial\n\ncompensation in exchange for their cooperation”).\n\n           Defendant’s argument that the district court erred\n\nin allowing the CS to testify as to the December 19, 2003\n\ndeal is more compelling.       See supra note 2.           Specifically,\n\ndefendant contends that this constituted prejudicial error\n\ngiven that the government did not: (1) charge the incident\n\nin the First Superceding Indictment; and (2) disclose the\n\nincident to defendant until trial was underway (i.e., long\n\nafter discovery had concluded).           Appellant’s Br. 35 (citing\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 52).\n\n           As noted above, after trial began, the government\n\ninformed the district court and defendant that the CS would\n\ntestify that defendant was present at the December 19, 2003\n\nbuy.     The parties do not contest that: (1) the government\n\nacted in good faith; (2) defendant timely objected to, and\n\nsought    exclusion   of,   the    CS’s    testimony       regarding   the\n\nDecember 19, 2003 buy; and (3) defendant did not seek a\n\ncontinuance.    (See 12/1 Tr. 103.)\n\n           “We review the district court's evidentiary rulings\n\nas to preserved claims for abuse of discretion.”                   United\n\nStates v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir. 2000).               Further,\n\n“[a]s a general rule, a defendant who does not request a\n\ncontinuance will not be heard to complain on appeal that he\n\n                                  -12-\n\fsuffered prejudice as a result of late-arriving discovery.”\n\nUnited States v. Mangual-García, Nos. 05-2275, 05-2414, 2007\n\nWL 2702973, at *2 (1st Cir. Sept. 18, 2007); see generally\n\nUnited    States     v.    Benedetti,         433    F.3d    111,    118       (1st    Cir.\n\n2005) (“We note in passing that, were surprise a genuine\n\nproblem,      ‘the     granting          of    a     continuance          is     a     more\n\nappropriate         remedy        than   exclusion          of     the     evidence.’”\n\n(quoting Fed. R. Evid. 403 advisory committee’s note)).\n\n             In any event, defendant fails to explain how the\n\nlate       disclosure         of     defendant’s         presence         during        the\n\nDecember 19, 2003 incident constituted the “manifest abuse\n\nof discretion required to overturn the presider's decision\n\nto   allow    a    criminal       case   to    go    forward,       notwithstanding\n\ndelayed disclosure of material relevant to impeachment of a\n\nwitness.”         Mangual-García, 2007 WL 2702973, at *2.                            Though\n\ndefendant did not have a great deal of time to prepare, he\n\nlearned      that    the     CS    would      testify       that    he    was    at     the\n\nDecember 19, 2003 buy before the government concluded its\n\ndirect examination of the CS (i.e., prior to defendant’s\n\ncross-examination of the CS).\n\n             Defendant also argues that the First Superceding\n\nIndictment’s        silence       regarding        the   December        19,    2003    buy\n\nrequires this Court to reverse the verdicts.                             We disagree.\n\nFirst, the government “is not limited in its proof at trial\n\n                                         -13-\n\fto those overt acts alleged in the indictment.”                              See United\n\nStates    v.    Muñoz-Franco,         487     F.3d    25,   53     (1st      Cir.   2007)\n\n(internal quotation omitted).\n\n           Second,          the     underlying       indictment’s         failure      to\n\nreference the December 19, 2003 incident does not constitute\n\na “prejudicial variance.”               See United States v. Cruz-Arroyo,\n\n461 F.3d 69, 77 (1st Cir. 2006).                       A prejudicial variance\n\nconstitutes one in which: (1) “the facts proved at trial\n\ndiffer from those alleged in the indictment”; and (2) the\n\nerror “affects the defendant’s substantial rights” (i.e.,\n\nwhen the indictment fails to provide the “the defendant with\n\nsufficient detail to allow him to prepare a defense, avoid\n\nunfair surprise at trial, and plead double jeopardy when\n\nappropriate”).          Id.       Here, the First Superceding Indictment\n\nalleged    that       the    conspiracy       began    in    1998      and    continued\n\nuntil May 11, 2005 (the date the indictment issued).                                  The\n\nindictment set forth: (1) the “nucleus of operative facts\n\ngiving    rise    to        the    charges    against       the    appellant”;        (2)\n\n“listed        some        overt     acts     referable           to   the      charged\n\nconspirac[y]; and (3) described the nature of the alleged\n\nagreement between the alleged co-conspirators.”                              See, e.g.,\n\nid.   (finding        no    prejudicial       variance       occurred        where    the\n\nindictment at issue met these three criteria).\n\n           As explained above: (1) defendant failed to ask for\n\n                                            -14-\n\fa continuance, or even an extended recess, prior to the CS’s\n\ntestimony;        and   (2)    ample   evidence      existed    of   defendant’s\n\ninvolvement        in    the    charged      conspiracy,       aside    from    the\n\nDecember 19, 2003 incident, and the January 13, 2004 deal.\n\n                                        III.\n\n              Defendant        also     maintains      the     district     court\n\nimproperly denied his motion for a new trial.                          See, e.g.,\n\nAppellant’s Br. 2.             As outlined in our November 28, 2007\n\nOrder to Show Cause, however, defendant never filed any such\n\nmotion. 9     We remain certain that no appellate jurisdiction\n\nlies       over   that    portion       of     the   appeal     pertaining       to\n\ndefendant’s Rule 33 “motion.”                   Put simply: (1) defendant\n\nfailed to properly present a motion for a new trial to the\n\ndistrict      court;     and    (2)    thus,   the   district    court    had    no\n\nopportunity to rule on the motion.                     See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(b)(3)(B).        Lacking appellate jurisdiction, we dismiss that\n\nportion of defendant’s appeal pertaining to Rule 33.                            See\n\nEspinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico, 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st\n\n\n\n       9\n        While Document 145 on the district court’s docket\nsheet is entitled “Motion for New Trial,” the attached\ndocument does not pertain to this case.            Effective\nFebruary 24, 2004, pursuant to a previously entered standing\norder, the United States District Court for the District of\nPuerto   Rico’s  official  court   record   constitutes  the\nelectronic file maintained on the District’s servers.    See\nStanding Order No. 1 (In the Matter of Electronic Case\nFiling, Misc. No. 03-149 (HL)).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fCir.   2003)       (“Even        though      the     parties      have      assumed      the\n\nexistence of appellate jurisdiction, we enjoy no comparable\n\nluxury. Because federal courts are powerless to act in the\n\nabsence       of    subject           matter       jurisdiction,           we    have     an\n\nunflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects and\n\nto pursue them on our own initiative.”).\n\n              Counsel for both parties bear responsibility for\n\nthis egregious error.                  Accordingly, we feel compelled to\n\ncomment at some length.                 Defense counsel failed to properly\n\nfile   a   Rule       33    motion        on    behalf       of     his    client,       but\n\nnonetheless sought appeal on that ground.                            This – at best –\n\namounted to gross ineptitude; at worst, it constituted an\n\nintentional        effort        to    mislead       this    Court.         We    do    not,\n\nhowever,      pretend      to     know    which      is     correct.           Defendant’s\n\nresponse to the Order to Show Cause, rather than explaining\n\nhow    this    error       occurred,           simply       states       the     painfully\n\nobvious:       that        the        motion        was     “incorrectly           filed.”\n\nAppellant’s Mot. in Resp. to Ct.’s Order to Show Cause ¶ 1.\n\n              Despite      defendant’s          concession          that    no    Rule    33\n\nmotion     was     filed         in    the     district        court,          remarkably,\n\ndefendant      argues       —    without       citation        to    a     single      legal\n\nauthority — that “justice demands” that we address his Rule\n\n33 arguments.         (Id. ¶4.)           Therein, defendant notes: (1) he\n\ntimely filed his appeal pertaining to the non-existent Rule\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\f33   order;      (2)     his       Rule     29    and       Rule    33    arguments          were\n\n“essentially the same”; (3) both parties argued the case\n\nwithout recognizing that defendant failed to file a Rule 33\n\nmotion;       and      (4)        this     case        presents      —        unspecified       —\n\n“exceptional circumstances that excuse the [non] filing of\n\nthe motion for new trial.”                       (Id.)      This is utter nonsense.\n\nWe   are   a     court       of    limited        jurisdiction.                See     Espinal-\n\nDominguez, 352 F.3d at 495.                       Appellate jurisdiction cannot\n\nbe conferred by counsel’s assertion that he intended, but\n\nadmittedly failed, to file a Rule 33 motion.                                   Id.\n\n              The government compounded the problem by obviously\n\nfailing to review the record.                         The government’s briefing, as\n\nwell as its oral argument, responded to defendant’s Rule 33\n\nappeal     on    the     merits.           The    government’s           response       to    the\n\nOrder    to     Show     Cause      sheds        little      light       on    its    actions.\n\nTherein, the government attempted to explain its conduct by\n\nnoting: (1) “the defense never alleged on appeal that it had\n\nactually filed a Rule 33 motion in the district court;” and\n\n(2) defendant “simply argued on appeal that the [he] was\n\nentitled        to   a    new       trial        as    an    alternative             argument.”\n\nAppellee’s       Mot.        in    Resp.     to        Order   to    Show       Cause     at    2\n\n(emphasis        added).             Quite        plainly,         this       reasoning        is\n\nludicrous.\n\n                 Contrary             to         the        government’s               puzzling\n\n                                             -17-\n\fcharacterization, defendant’s briefing and position at oral\n\nargument unambiguously referenced the “district court[’s] .\n\n. . . error [in] denying appellant’s motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal    and    his     motion      for    new    trial.”      See,     e.g.,\n\nAppellant’s Br. at 38 (emphasis added).                   In any event, what\n\nconcerns us most about the government’s response is that it\n\nmisses the point entirely.\n\n            Counsel are bound by the American Bar Association’s\n\nModel Rules of Professional Conduct (the Model Rules).                          1st\n\nCir. R. IV, at 106; see also P.R. U.S. Dist. L.R. 83.5(a)\n\n(expressly incorporating the Model Rules).                  Therein, counsel\n\nowes     their    respective       clients      duties    of,     inter     alia,\n\ncompetence and diligence and they owe this Court a duty of\n\ncandor.    See Model Rules of Prof’l Conduct R. 1.1, 1.3, 3.3.\n\nIt is axiomatic that lawyers are obligated to scrupulously\n\nreview the record on appeal, including the district court\n\ndocket.     When referring to documents purportedly filed in\n\nthe    district    court    —   much    less   documents       material    to    an\n\nappeal — counsel must verify that such documents exist.                          If\n\nthey do not, obviously, immediate corrective action must be\n\ntaken.      None    of     these     steps     were    taken     here,     at the\n\nconsiderable       expense      of     judicial       economy.      Even     more\n\namazingly, counsel failed to recognize the severity of this\n\nsituation or attempt to make amends even after the Order to\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fShow Cause issued.    As noted above, both parties’ responses\n\nare nonsensical.     We underscore how deeply troubled we are\n\nby this unfortunate series of events.\n\n                              IV.\n\n         For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s denial of defendant’s Rule 29 motion.      We dismiss\n\nthe Rule 33 arguments raised by defendant on appeal.\n\n         Affirmed in part, dismissed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f",

Defendant was charged with: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846 (Count 1); and (2) possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count 2).<sup>[1]</sup> A petit jury convicted defendant on both counts. On appeal, defendant challenges his convictions, arguing that the district court erred in denying his: (1) Motion for Acquittal; and (2) Motion for New Trial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, 33. As to defendant's Rule 29 Motion for Acquittal, we have jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and affirm. As to defendant's arguments pertaining to Rule 33, we lack jurisdiction and dismiss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the trial evidence demonstrated that: in late 2003, Drug Enforcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> Administration (DEA) Special Agent Todd Yant (SA Yant) began investigating the Joel Rivera-Delgado drug-trafficking organization (the Rivera organization) based in Guayama, Puerto Rico. (Tr. 68:10-11.) To further the investigation, DEA used a paid confidential source (CS) to infiltrate the Rivera organization. (<i>Id.</i>; <i>see also</i> 12/2 Tr. 30.) At trial, the CS testified in person and admitted he used marijuana in December 2003 and January 2004. (<i>See</i> 12/2 Tr. 29, 32.)</p>\n<p>On December 19, 2003, the CS was introduced to Harry Arizmendi-Serrano, a Rivera organization affiliate. (11/30 Tr. 78; 12/1 Tr. 100.) The CS purchased 100 vials of cocaine base (crack), weighing 7.4 grams (12/1 Tr. 16), from Arizmendi. (11/30 Tr. 78; 12/1 Tr. 100.) According to the CS, although he did not know defendant Edgar Pomales-Lebrón's name at the time (12/1 Tr. 131), defendant was present when he purchased crack from Arizmendi on December 19.<sup>[2]</sup> (12/1 Tr. 101, 104, 109-10.) The CS recorded this transaction; DEA conducted partial video surveillance.<sup>[3]</sup> (12/1 Tr. 75-76, 105.)</p>\n<p>On December 31, 2003, the CS arranged for a larger controlled buy from Arizmendi. (11/30 Tr. 79-80.) SA Yant testified that the 600 crack vials the CS purchased on that date weighed 49 grams. (11/30 Tr. 81.) DEA conducted video surveillance of the deal. (12/1 Tr. 83.) Defendant was not present during the December 31 transaction. (12/1 Tr. 16, 23.)</p>\n<p>On January 12, 2004, the CS met with Arizmendi and defendant to arrange a 1000-vial crack buy. (11/30 Tr. 84-85; 12/1 Tr. 117.) The CS learned defendant's name for the first time at this meeting. (11/30 Tr. 84; 12/1 Tr. 130-31.) When asked by the CS, defendant and Arizmendi identified their supplier as \"Joel.\"<sup>[4]</sup> (12/1 Tr. 132-33.)</p>\n<p>The next day, January 13, 2004, the CS purchased 1000 vials (73.7 grams) of crack from defendant. (<i>Id.</i> 85, 87; 12/1 Tr. 122-25; <i>see also</i> 12/1 Tr. 17.) The CS recorded the transaction; DEA conducted partial video surveillance.<sup>[5]</sup> The audio recordings from the CS's wire were played to the jury. (12/2 Tr. 5.) On the recording, a voiceidentified as defendant's by the CSis heard counting. (12/2 Tr. 9-10; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> 12/1 Tr. 122-25.) The CS testified that defendant was counting money he had handed to defendant in payment for the narcotics. (12/2 Tr. 9-10; 12/1 Tr. 122-25.) Later on the recording, defendant is heard saying to the CS: \"[T]ake that bag, and let's get the F out of here.\" (12/2 Tr. 9-10; 12/1 Tr. 122-25.) The CS testified that the \"bag\" defendant referred to was the bag containing the 1000 vials of crack.<sup>[6]</sup> (12/2 Tr. 11.)</p>\n<p>After the January 13, 2004 transaction, the CS placedat the DEA's direction several recorded calls to defendant. (12/1 Tr. 133.) The district court admitted these recordings into evidence; they were played for the jury. (12/2 Tr. 14-17, 20.) AS to each recorded call, the CS identified defendant's voice, as well as his own. (<i>See id.</i>)</p>\n<p>In the first recorded call, the CS referenced \"a thousand\" and stated that \"the stuff was good\" in talking to defendant. (12/2 Tr. 14.) The CS testified that this was a reference to the January 13, 2004 buy. (12/2 Tr. 14-15; 12/1 Tr. 134.) The connection dropped and the call ended. During the second call, the CS asked defendant about whether he could get \"2000\" (which, the CS testified, was a reference to 2000 vials of crack). (12/2 Tr. 15-16.) Defendant refused to discuss the matter over the phone with the CS. (12/2 Tr. 15-16.)</p>\n<p>In the third call, the CS tried to get defendant to agree to meet his \"friend\" (in reality, an undercover DEA agent). (12/2 Tr. 16; 12/1 Tr. 133-34.) Defendant, however, refused. (12/1 Tr. 134.) At some point in this conversation, the CS mentioned \"fifteen hundred\"<i>i.e.,</i> 1500 vials of crack (12/2 Tr. 18)to which defendant responded: \"[N]o, those things cannot be talked about over the telephone.\" (12/2 Tr. 18.) During the fourth, and final, recorded call, the CS asked defendant to discount ten cents on each \"nail.\" (12/2 Tr. 20.) The CS also referenced \"fifteen hundred nails.\" (12/2 Tr. 20.) The CS testified that by \"nail\" he was referring to one vial of crack. (12/2 Tr. 20-21.)</p>\n<p>Based on these conversations, as well as other DEA investigatory efforts, SA Yant applied for a Title III wiretap of defendant's phone number.<sup>[7]</sup> A U.S. District Judge granted SA Yant's application on March 25, 2004. (11/30 Tr. 105; <i>see also</i> 11/30 Tr. 100-04.) During the thirty-day wire tap, DEA intercepted and recorded several drug-trafficking related discussions on defendant's phone line. The district court admitted portions of these recorded calls, which were played for the jury. (<i>E.g.,</i> 11/30 Tr. 107, 128 (co-defendant Omar Caraballo-García's arrest for possessing 13 vials of crack discussed by defendant and Arizmendi on defendant's wire); <i>e.g.,</i> 11/30 Tr. 108, 124-25, 136 (seizure of 600 vials of crack from a suspected member of the Rivera organization\"Otto\"whose vehicle was used during the December 31, 2003 and January 13, 2004 drug transactions, discussed by defendant and Arizmendi on defendant's wire); <i>see also, e.g.,</i> 11/30 Tr. 132-33 (conversation between defendant and Arizmendi regarding Joel Rivera having \"2100\"); 11/30 Tr. 138-39 (conversation between defendant and Joel Rivera regarding Otto's arrest <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> after the 600-vial seizure).) Additionally, based on his investigation, SA Yant testified that his conservative estimation was that the Rivera organization sold 125 grams of crack per week between 2002-2005. (12/1 Tr. 4-5, 10.)</p>\n<p>At the close of the government's case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. (12/2 Tr. 70.) The district court denied the motion, finding sufficient evidence had been introduced to support defendant's conviction on both Count 1 and Count 2. (12/2 Tr. 70.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, we \"must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. We review a denial of a motion for acquittal \"de novo to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found that the evidence presented at trial, together with all reasonable inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, established each element of the particular offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Campbell,</i> 268 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>To establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, the government must prove: \"[1] the existence of a conspiracy, [2] the defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and [3] the defendant's knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Portalla,</i> 496 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir.2007). To establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, the government must prove that defendant: (1) possessed crack cocaine, \"either actually or constructively,\" (2) \"did so with a specific intent to distribute the [crack] cocaine over which [he] had actual or constructive possession,\" and (3) \"did so knowingly and intentionally.\" <i>United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2002). Review of the record makes clear that the evidence introduced at trial adequately supported the jury's verdicts.</p>\n<p>The recordings of the December 31, 2003 buy, the January 13, 2004 buy, and the calls between defendant and the CS (including the Title III calls) are likely sufficienton their ownto support defendant's convictions on Count 1 and Count 2. We agree with the district court that defendant's voiceparticularly on the January 13, 2004 recording and the Title III callsconstitutes compelling evidence of defendant's guilt. Even if, as defendant suggests, this evidence could be interpreted as non-incriminating, other evidence readily supported the jury's verdict. <i>See </i><i>Campbell,</i> 268 F.3d at 6 (reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government).</p>\n<p>The CS's testimony further evidenced defendant's guilt. The CS's testimony was corroborated by several sources, including the recorded conversations between the CS and defendant, as well as SA Yant's testimony. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Vazquez Guadalupe,</i> 407 F.3d 492, 499 (1st Cir.2005) (case did not turn on the CS's testimony where there were \"audio and video tapes, in which the defendants incriminated themselves\"). Indeed, SA Yant's testimony, and the recorded conversation itself, track the CS's testimony. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Andujar-Rasco,</i> 488 F.3d 549, 558 (1st Cir.2007) (case hinged on the CS's testimony, but that testimony was \"corroborated by several sources\"). Taken together, the recorded conversations and the CS's testimony provided ampleeven overwhelmingevidence from which a rational juror could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both charges.</p>\n<p>Contrary to defendant's position, the district court did not err in permitting the CS to testify in light of his admitted marijuana use and compensation by DEA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> Defendant failed to make a timely objection at trial.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Mangual-García,</i> 505 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2007). Defendant's \"failure to object to the omission of such an express trial-end determination bars him from raising the point on appeal in the absence of plain error.\" <i>Id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). No plain error is evident here as defendant's position lacks merit. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The issues raised by defendant do not go to admissibility, but rather pertain to the credibility of the CS's testimony. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vázquez-Guadalupe,</i> 407 F.3d 492, 499 (1st Cir.2005) (deeming testimony of a government witness, a criminal defendant being paid by the government for his cooperation, admissible and noting the credibility of that testimony \"is left for the jury\"). The jury was free toas it presumably didcredit the CS's testimony, notwithstanding his marijuana use and government compensation. <i>Id.</i> (rejecting the argument that the \"government cannot conduct sting operations using individuals who expect to receive . . . financial compensation in exchange for their cooperation\").</p>\n<p>Defendant's argument that the district court erred in allowing the CS to testify as to the December 19, 2003 deal is more compelling. <i>See supra</i> note 2. Specifically, defendant contends that this constituted prejudicial error given that the government did not: (1) charge the incident in the First Superceding Indictment; and (2) disclose the incident to defendant until trial was underway (<i>i.e.,</i> long after discovery had concluded). Appellant's Br. 35 (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 52).</p>\n<p>As noted above, after trial began, the government informed the district court and defendant that the CS would testify that defendant was present at the December 19, 2003 buy. The parties do not contest that: (1) the government acted in good faith; (2) defendant timely objected to, and sought exclusion of, the CS's testimony regarding the December 19, 2003 buy; and (3) defendant did not seek a continuance. (<i>See</i> 12/1 Tr. 103.)</p>\n<p>\"We review the district court's evidentiary rulings as to preserved claims for abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Balsam,</i> 203 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir.2000). Further, \"[a]s a general rule, a defendant who does not request a continuance will not be heard to complain on appeal that he suffered prejudice as a result of late-arriving discovery.\" <i>United States v. Mangual-García,</i> 505 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see generally </i><i>United States v. Benedetti,</i> 433 F.3d 111, 118 (1st Cir.2005) (\"We note in passing that, were surprise a genuine problem, `the granting of a continuance is a more appropriate remedy than exclusion of the evidence.'\" (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 403 advisory committee's note)).</p>\n<p>In any event, defendant fails to explain how the late disclosure of defendant's presence during the December 19, 2003 incident constituted the \"manifest abuse of discretion required to overturn the presider's decision to allow a criminal case to go forward, notwithstanding delayed disclosure of material relevant to impeachment of a witness.\" <i>Mangual-García,</i> 505 F.3d at 5-6. Though defendant did not have a great deal of time to prepare, he learned that the CS would testify that he was at the December 19, 2003 buy before the government concluded its direct examination of the CS (<i>i.e.,</i> prior to defendant's cross-examination of the CS).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> Defendant also argues that the First Superceding Indictment's silence regarding the December 19, 2003 buy requires this Court to reverse the verdicts. We disagree. First, the government \"is not limited in its proof at trial to those overt acts alleged in the indictment.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Muñoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d 25, 53 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>Second, the underlying indictment's failure to reference the December 19, 2003 incident does not constitute a \"prejudicial variance.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cruz-Arroyo,</i> 461 F.3d 69, 77 (1st Cir. 2006). A prejudicial variance constitutes one in which: (1) \"the facts proved at trial differ from those alleged in the indictment\"; and (2) the error \"affects the defendant's substantial rights\" (<i>i.e.,</i> when the indictment fails to provide the \"the defendant with sufficient detail to allow him to prepare a defense, avoid unfair surprise at trial, and plead double jeopardy when appropriate\"). <i>Id.</i> Here, the First Superceding Indictment alleged that the conspiracy began in 1998 and continued until May 11, 2005 (the date the indictment issued). The indictment set forth: (1) the \"nucleus of operative facts giving rise to the charges against the appellant\"; (2) \"listed some overt acts referable to the charged conspirac[y]; and (3) described the nature of the alleged agreement between the alleged coconspirators.\" <i>See, e.g., id.</i> (finding no prejudicial variance occurred where the indictment at issue met these three criteria).</p>\n<p>As explained above: (1) defendant failed to ask for a continuance, or even an extended recess, prior to the CS's testimony; and (2) ample evidence existed of defendant's involvement in the charged conspiracy, aside from the December 19, 2003 incident, and the January 13, 2004 deal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Defendant also maintains the district court improperly denied his motion for a new trial. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Appellant's Br. 2. As outlined in our November 28, 2007 Order to Show Cause, however, defendant never filed any such motion.<sup>[9]</sup> We remain certain that no appellate jurisdiction lies over that portion of the appeal pertaining to defendant's Rule 33 \"motion.\" Put simply: (1) defendant failed to properly present a motion for a new trial to the district court; and (2) thus, the district court had no opportunity to rule on the motion. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(3)(B). Lacking appellate jurisdiction, we dismiss that portion of defendant's appeal pertaining to Rule 33. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Even though the parties have assumed the existence of appellate jurisdiction, we enjoy no comparable luxury. Because federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, we have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects and to pursue them on our own initiative.\").</p>\n<p>Counsel for both parties bear responsibility for this egregious error. Accordingly, we feel compelled to comment at some length. Defense counsel failed to properly file a Rule 33 motion on behalf of his client, but nonetheless sought appeal on that ground. Thisat bestamounted to gross ineptitude; at worst, it constituted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> an intentional effort to mislead this Court. We do not, however, pretend to know which is correct. Defendant's response to the Order to Show Cause, rather than explaining how this error occurred, simply states the painfully obvious: that the motion was \"incorrectly filed.\" Appellant's Mot. in Resp. to Ct.'s Order to Show Cause ¶ 1.</p>\n<p>Despite defendant's concession that no Rule 33 motion was filed in the district court, remarkably, defendant argueswithout citation to a single legal authoritythat \"justice demands\" that we address his Rule 33 arguments. (<i>Id.</i> ¶ 4.) Therein, defendant notes: (1) he timely filed his appeal pertaining to the non-existent Rule 33 order; (2) his Rule 29 and Rule 33 arguments were \"essentially the same\"; (3) both parties argued the case without recognizing that defendant failed to file a Rule 33 motion; and (4) this case presentsunspecified\"exceptional circumstances that excuse the [<i>non</i>] filing of the motion for new trial.\" (<i>Id.</i>) This is utter nonsense. We are a court of limited jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez,</i> 352 F.3d at 495. Appellate jurisdiction cannot be conferred by counsel's assertion that he <i>intended,</i> but admittedly failed, to file a Rule 33 motion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The government compounded the problem by obviously failing to review the record. The government's briefing, as well as its oral argument, responded to defendant's Rule 33 appeal on the merits, The government's response to the Order to Show Cause sheds little light on its actions. Therein, the government attempted to explain its conduct by noting: (1) \"the defense never alleged on appeal that it had <i>actually</i> filed a Rule 33 motion in the district court;\" and (2) defendant \"simply argued on appeal that the [he] was entitled to a new trial as an alternative argument.\" Appellee's Mot. in Resp. to Order to Show Cause at 2 (emphasis added). Quite plainly, this reasoning is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the government's puzzling characterization, defendant's briefing and position at oral argument unambiguously referenced the \"district court['s]. . . . error [in] denying appellant's motion for judgment of acquittal and his <i>motion for new trial.</i>\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> Appellant's Br. at 38 (emphasis added). In any event, what concerns us most about the government's response is that it misses the point entirely.</p>\n<p>Counsel are bound by the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct (the Model Rules). 1st Cir. R. IV, at 106; <i>see also</i> P.R.U.S. Dist. L.R. 83.5(a) (expressly incorporating the Model Rules). Therein, counsel owes their respective clients duties of, <i>inter alia,</i> competence and diligence and they owe this Court a duty of candor. <i>See</i> Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 1.1, 1.3, 3.3. It is axiomatic that lawyers are obligated to scrupulously review the record on appeal, including the district court docket. When referring to documents purportedly filed in the district courtmuch less documents material to an appealcounsel must verify that such documents exist. If they do not, obviously, immediate corrective action must be taken. None of these steps were taken here, at the considerable expense of judicial economy. Even more amazingly, counsel failed to recognize the severity of this situation or attempt to make amends even after the Order to Show Cause issued. As noted above, both parties' responses are nonsensical. We underscore how deeply troubled we are by this unfortunate series of events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the forgoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's denial of defendant's Rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> 29 motion. We <i>dismiss</i> the Rule 33 arguments raised by defendant on appeal.</p>\n<p>Affirmed in part, dismissed in part.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  In addition, the First Superceding Indictment included a Count 3, which stated that any property derived from the offenses stated in Counts 1 and 2 would be subject to forfeiture. The district court dismissed Count 3 for lack of evidence after defendant rested his case. (12/2 Tr. 75.)</p>\n<p>[2]  The CS did not inform the government that defendant was present at the December 19, 2003 transaction until November 30, 2005, after the conclusion of the first day of defendant's trial. (12/1 Tr. 2.) Before the trial resumed on December 1, 2005, the government apprised the district court and defendant of this development. (12/1 Tr. 2.) Defendant objected to the CS's proposed testimony regarding defendant's presence at the December 19, 2003 deal. (12/1 Tr. 103.) Specifically, defendant argued that he would be prejudiced by such testimony due to, <i>inter alia,</i> his having inadequate time to prepare. (12/1 Tr. 103.) The district court, however, allowed the testimony finding: (1) no bad faith on the government's part; (2) the December 19, 2003 buy was, in any event, carried out during, and in furtherance of, the charged conspiracy; (3) the government promptly disclosed this development to the court and opposing counsel; and (4) defendant had sufficient time to prepare (<i>i.e.,</i> primarily during the one and one-half hour lunch break). (<i>See</i> 12/1 Tr. 103.)</p>\n<p>[3]  DEA's video surveillance did not capture the transaction in its entirety because much of the transaction unexpectedly transpired away from the surveillance location. (11/30 Tr. 75-76.)</p>\n<p>[4]  Although the CS recorded the January 12, 2004 meeting, the recording proved unintelligible. (11/30 Tr. 85.) The district court; consequently, refused to admit the recording into evidence. (12/1 Tr. 141, 148.)</p>\n<p>[5]  As with the December 19, 2003 transaction, <i>see supra</i> note 3, DEA's video surveillance did not capture the entire transaction. SA Yant explained that the deal's location changed several times as it unfolded. (12/1 Tr. 83, 87.)</p>\n<p>[6]  In addition to the aforementioned, SA Yant testified regarding two other drug buys that purportedly occurred during the charged conspiracy. Both of those transactions involved defendant's co-conspirators; SA Yant testified, however, that defendant was not implicated in either of those incidents. (11/30 Tr. 124; 12/1 Tr. 4.)</p>\n<p>[7]  Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-22 (Title III). Authorities can apply \"for an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication\" pursuant to the procedures set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 2518. 18 U.S.C. § 2518.</p>\n<p>[8]  We note that while neither party addresses whether defendant objected to the CS's testimony on the grounds that he was compensated and used marijuana, our review of the transcript indicates that defendant failed to do so.</p>\n<p>[9]  While Document 145 on the district court's docket sheet is entitled \"Motion for New Trial,\" the attached document does not pertain to this case.

Defendant was charged with: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846 (Count 1); and (2) possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count 2).<sup>[1]</sup> A petit jury convicted defendant on both counts. On appeal, defendant challenges his convictions, arguing that the district court erred in denying his: (1) Motion for Acquittal; and (2) Motion for New Trial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, 33. As to defendant's Rule 29 Motion for Acquittal, we have jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and affirm. As to defendant's arguments pertaining to Rule 33, we lack jurisdiction and dismiss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the trial evidence demonstrated that: in late 2003, Drug Enforcement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> Administration (DEA) Special Agent Todd Yant (SA Yant) began investigating the Joel Rivera-Delgado drug-trafficking organization (the Rivera organization) based in Guayama, Puerto Rico. (Tr. 68:10-11.) To further the investigation, DEA used a paid confidential source (CS) to infiltrate the Rivera organization. (<i>Id.</i>; <i>see also</i> 12/2 Tr. 30.) At trial, the CS testified in person and admitted he used marijuana in December 2003 and January 2004. (<i>See</i> 12/2 Tr. 29, 32.)</p>\n<p>On December 19, 2003, the CS was introduced to Harry Arizmendi-Serrano, a Rivera organization affiliate. (11/30 Tr. 78; 12/1 Tr. 100.) The CS purchased 100 vials of cocaine base (crack), weighing 7.4 grams (12/1 Tr. 16), from Arizmendi. (11/30 Tr. 78; 12/1 Tr. 100.) According to the CS, although he did not know defendant Edgar Pomales-Lebrón's name at the time (12/1 Tr. 131), defendant was present when he purchased crack from Arizmendi on December 19.<sup>[2]</sup> (12/1 Tr. 101, 104, 109-10.) The CS recorded this transaction; DEA conducted partial video surveillance.<sup>[3]</sup> (12/1 Tr. 75-76, 105.)</p>\n<p>On December 31, 2003, the CS arranged for a larger controlled buy from Arizmendi. (11/30 Tr. 79-80.) SA Yant testified that the 600 crack vials the CS purchased on that date weighed 49 grams. (11/30 Tr. 81.) DEA conducted video surveillance of the deal. (12/1 Tr. 83.) Defendant was not present during the December 31 transaction. (12/1 Tr. 16, 23.)</p>\n<p>On January 12, 2004, the CS met with Arizmendi and defendant to arrange a 1000-vial crack buy. (11/30 Tr. 84-85; 12/1 Tr. 117.) The CS learned defendant's name for the first time at this meeting. (11/30 Tr. 84; 12/1 Tr. 130-31.) When asked by the CS, defendant and Arizmendi identified their supplier as \"Joel.\"<sup>[4]</sup> (12/1 Tr. 132-33.)</p>\n<p>The next day, January 13, 2004, the CS purchased 1000 vials (73.7 grams) of crack from defendant. (<i>Id.</i> 85, 87; 12/1 Tr. 122-25; <i>see also</i> 12/1 Tr. 17.) The CS recorded the transaction; DEA conducted partial video surveillance.<sup>[5]</sup> The audio recordings from the CS's wire were played to the jury. (12/2 Tr. 5.) On the recording, a voiceidentified as defendant's by the CSis heard counting. (12/2 Tr. 9-10; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> 12/1 Tr. 122-25.) The CS testified that defendant was counting money he had handed to defendant in payment for the narcotics. (12/2 Tr. 9-10; 12/1 Tr. 122-25.) Later on the recording, defendant is heard saying to the CS: \"[T]ake that bag, and let's get the F out of here.\" (12/2 Tr. 9-10; 12/1 Tr. 122-25.) The CS testified that the \"bag\" defendant referred to was the bag containing the 1000 vials of crack.<sup>[6]</sup> (12/2 Tr. 11.)</p>\n<p>After the January 13, 2004 transaction, the CS placedat the DEA's direction several recorded calls to defendant. (12/1 Tr. 133.) The district court admitted these recordings into evidence; they were played for the jury. (12/2 Tr. 14-17, 20.) AS to each recorded call, the CS identified defendant's voice, as well as his own. (<i>See id.</i>)</p>\n<p>In the first recorded call, the CS referenced \"a thousand\" and stated that \"the stuff was good\" in talking to defendant. (12/2 Tr. 14.) The CS testified that this was a reference to the January 13, 2004 buy. (12/2 Tr. 14-15; 12/1 Tr. 134.) The connection dropped and the call ended. During the second call, the CS asked defendant about whether he could get \"2000\" (which, the CS testified, was a reference to 2000 vials of crack). (12/2 Tr. 15-16.) Defendant refused to discuss the matter over the phone with the CS. (12/2 Tr. 15-16.)</p>\n<p>In the third call, the CS tried to get defendant to agree to meet his \"friend\" (in reality, an undercover DEA agent). (12/2 Tr. 16; 12/1 Tr. 133-34.) Defendant, however, refused. (12/1 Tr. 134.) At some point in this conversation, the CS mentioned \"fifteen hundred\"<i>i.e.,</i> 1500 vials of crack (12/2 Tr. 18)to which defendant responded: \"[N]o, those things cannot be talked about over the telephone.\" (12/2 Tr. 18.) During the fourth, and final, recorded call, the CS asked defendant to discount ten cents on each \"nail.\" (12/2 Tr. 20.) The CS also referenced \"fifteen hundred nails.\" (12/2 Tr. 20.) The CS testified that by \"nail\" he was referring to one vial of crack. (12/2 Tr. 20-21.)</p>\n<p>Based on these conversations, as well as other DEA investigatory efforts, SA Yant applied for a Title III wiretap of defendant's phone number.<sup>[7]</sup> A U.S. District Judge granted SA Yant's application on March 25, 2004. (11/30 Tr. 105; <i>see also</i> 11/30 Tr. 100-04.) During the thirty-day wire tap, DEA intercepted and recorded several drug-trafficking related discussions on defendant's phone line. The district court admitted portions of these recorded calls, which were played for the jury. (<i>E.g.,</i> 11/30 Tr. 107, 128 (co-defendant Omar Caraballo-García's arrest for possessing 13 vials of crack discussed by defendant and Arizmendi on defendant's wire); <i>e.g.,</i> 11/30 Tr. 108, 124-25, 136 (seizure of 600 vials of crack from a suspected member of the Rivera organization\"Otto\"whose vehicle was used during the December 31, 2003 and January 13, 2004 drug transactions, discussed by defendant and Arizmendi on defendant's wire); <i>see also, e.g.,</i> 11/30 Tr. 132-33 (conversation between defendant and Arizmendi regarding Joel Rivera having \"2100\"); 11/30 Tr. 138-39 (conversation between defendant and Joel Rivera regarding Otto's arrest <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> after the 600-vial seizure).) Additionally, based on his investigation, SA Yant testified that his conservative estimation was that the Rivera organization sold 125 grams of crack per week between 2002-2005. (12/1 Tr. 4-5, 10.)</p>\n<p>At the close of the government's case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. (12/2 Tr. 70.) The district court denied the motion, finding sufficient evidence had been introduced to support defendant's conviction on both Count 1 and Count 2. (12/2 Tr. 70.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, we \"must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. We review a denial of a motion for acquittal \"de novo to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found that the evidence presented at trial, together with all reasonable inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, established each element of the particular offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v.

To establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, the government must prove that defendant: (1) possessed crack cocaine, \"either actually or constructively,\" (2) \"did so with a specific intent to distribute the [crack] cocaine over which [he] had actual or constructive possession,\" and (3) \"did so knowingly and intentionally.\" <i>United States v.

Review of the record makes clear that the evidence introduced at trial adequately supported the jury's verdicts.</p>\n<p>The recordings of the December 31, 2003 buy, the January 13, 2004 buy, and the calls between defendant and the CS (including the Title III calls) are likely sufficienton their ownto support defendant's convictions on Count 1 and Count 2. We agree with the district court that defendant's voiceparticularly on the January 13, 2004 recording and the Title III callsconstitutes compelling evidence of defendant's guilt. Even if, as defendant suggests, this evidence could be interpreted as non-incriminating, other evidence readily supported the jury's verdict. <i>See </i><i>Campbell,</i> 268 F.3d at 6 (reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government).</p>\n<p>The CS's testimony further evidenced defendant's guilt. The CS's testimony was corroborated by several sources, including the recorded conversations between the CS and defendant, as well as SA Yant's testimony. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Vazquez Guadalupe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201586\"><a href=\"/opinion/201586/united-states-v-vazquez-guadalupe/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 499 (1st Cir.2005) (case did not turn on the CS's testimony where there were \"audio and video tapes, in which the defendants incriminated themselves\"). Indeed, SA Yant's testimony, and the recorded conversation itself, track the CS's testimony. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Andujar-Rasco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202777\"><a href=\"/opinion/202777/united-states-v-andujar-basco/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 558 (1st Cir.2007) (case hinged on the CS's testimony, but that testimony was \"corroborated by several sources\"). Taken together, the recorded conversations and the CS's testimony provided ampleeven overwhelmingevidence from which a rational juror could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both charges.</p>\n<p>Contrary to defendant's position, the district court did not err in permitting the CS to testify in light of his admitted marijuana use and compensation by DEA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> Defendant failed to make a timely objection at trial.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Mangual-García,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202945\"><a href=\"/opinion/202945/united-states-v-mangual-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2007). Defendant's \"failure to object to the omission of such an express trial-end determination bars him from raising the point on appeal in the absence of plain error.\" <i>Id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). No plain error is evident here as defendant's position lacks merit. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The issues raised by defendant do not go to admissibility, but rather pertain to the credibility of the CS's testimony. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vázquez-Guadalupe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201586\"><a href=\"/opinion/201586/united-states-v-vazquez-guadalupe/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 499 (1st Cir.2005) (deeming testimony of a government witness, a criminal defendant being paid by the government for his cooperation, admissible and noting the credibility of that testimony \"is left for the jury\"). The jury was free toas it presumably didcredit the CS's testimony, notwithstanding his marijuana use and government compensation. <i>Id.</i> (rejecting the argument that the \"government cannot conduct sting operations using individuals who expect to receive . . . financial compensation in exchange for their cooperation\").</p>\n<p>Defendant's argument that the district court erred in allowing the CS to testify as to the December 19, 2003 deal is more compelling. <i>See supra</i> note 2. Specifically, defendant contends that this constituted prejudicial error given that the government did not: (1) charge the incident in the First Superceding Indictment; and (2) disclose the incident to defendant until trial was underway (<i>i.e.,</i> long after discovery had concluded). Appellant's Br. 35 (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 52).</p>\n<p>As noted above, after trial began, the government informed the district court and defendant that the CS would testify that defendant was present at the December 19, 2003 buy. The parties do not contest that: (1) the government acted in good faith; (2) defendant timely objected to, and sought exclusion of, the CS's testimony regarding the December 19, 2003 buy; and (3) defendant did not seek a continuance. (<i>See</i> 12/1 Tr. 103.)</p>\n<p>\"We review the district court's evidentiary rulings as to preserved claims for abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Balsam,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198819\"><a href=\"/opinion/198819/united-states-v-balsam/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2000). Further, \"[a]s a general rule, a defendant who does not request a continuance will not be heard to complain on appeal that he suffered prejudice as a result of late-arriving discovery.\" <i>United States v.

Though defendant did not have a great deal of time to prepare, he learned that the CS would testify that he was at the December 19, 2003 buy before the government concluded its direct examination of the CS (<i>i.e.,</i> prior to defendant's cross-examination of the CS).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> Defendant also argues that the First Superceding Indictment's silence regarding the December 19, 2003 buy requires this Court to reverse the verdicts. We disagree. First, the government \"is not limited in its proof at trial to those overt acts alleged in the indictment.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Muñoz-Franco,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>Second, the underlying indictment's failure to reference the December 19, 2003 incident does not constitute a \"prejudicial variance.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cruz-Arroyo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202375\"><a href=\"/opinion/202375/united-states-v-cruz-arroyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir. 2006). A prejudicial variance constitutes one in which: (1) \"the facts proved at trial differ from those alleged in the indictment\"; and (2) the error \"affects the defendant's substantial rights\" (<i>i.e.,</i> when the indictment fails to provide the \"the defendant with sufficient detail to allow him to prepare a defense, avoid unfair surprise at trial, and plead double jeopardy when appropriate\"). <i>Id.</i> Here, the First Superceding Indictment alleged that the conspiracy began in 1998 and continued until May 11, 2005 (the date the indictment issued). The indictment set forth: (1) the \"nucleus of operative facts giving rise to the charges against the appellant\"; (2) \"listed some overt acts referable to the charged conspirac[y]; and (3) described the nature of the alleged agreement between the alleged coconspirators.\" <i>See, e.g., id.</i> (finding no prejudicial variance occurred where the indictment at issue met these three criteria).</p>\n<p>As explained above: (1) defendant failed to ask for a continuance, or even an extended recess, prior to the CS's testimony; and (2) ample evidence existed of defendant's involvement in the charged conspiracy, aside from the December 19, 2003 incident, and the January 13, 2004 deal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Defendant also maintains the district court improperly denied his motion for a new trial. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Appellant's Br. 2. As outlined in our November 28, 2007 Order to Show Cause, however, defendant never filed any such motion.<sup>[9]</sup> We remain certain that no appellate jurisdiction lies over that portion of the appeal pertaining to defendant's Rule 33 \"motion.\" Put simply: (1) defendant failed to properly present a motion for a new trial to the district court; and (2) thus, the district court had no opportunity to rule on the motion. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(3)(B). Lacking appellate jurisdiction, we dismiss that portion of defendant's appeal pertaining to Rule 33. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200783\"><a href=\"/opinion/200783/espinal-dominguez-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 495 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Even though the parties have assumed the existence of appellate jurisdiction, we enjoy no comparable luxury. Because federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, we have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects and to pursue them on our own initiative.\").</p>\n<p>Counsel for both parties bear responsibility for this egregious error. Accordingly, we feel compelled to comment at some length. Defense counsel failed to properly file a Rule 33 motion on behalf of his client, but nonetheless sought appeal on that ground. Thisat bestamounted to gross ineptitude; at worst, it constituted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> an intentional effort to mislead this Court. We do not, however, pretend to know which is correct. Defendant's response to the Order to Show Cause, rather than explaining how this error occurred, simply states the painfully obvious: that the motion was \"incorrectly filed.\" Appellant's Mot. in Resp. to Ct.'s Order to Show Cause ¶ 1.</p>\n<p>Despite defendant's concession that no Rule 33 motion was filed in the district court, remarkably, defendant argueswithout citation to a single legal authoritythat \"justice demands\" that we address his Rule 33 arguments. (<i>Id.</i> ¶ 4.) Therein, defendant notes: (1) he timely filed his appeal pertaining to the non-existent Rule 33 order; (2) his Rule 29 and Rule 33 arguments were \"essentially the same\"; (3) both parties argued the case without recognizing that defendant failed to file a Rule 33 motion; and (4) this case presentsunspecified\"exceptional circumstances that excuse the [<i>non</i>] filing of the motion for new trial.\" (<i>Id.</i>) This is utter nonsense. We are a court of limited jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez,</i> 352 F.3d at 495. Appellate jurisdiction cannot be conferred by counsel's assertion that he <i>intended,</i> but admittedly failed, to file a Rule 33 motion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The government compounded the problem by obviously failing to review the record. The government's briefing, as well as its oral argument, responded to defendant's Rule 33 appeal on the merits, The government's response to the Order to Show Cause sheds little light on its actions. Therein, the government attempted to explain its conduct by noting: (1) \"the defense never alleged on appeal that it had <i>actually</i> filed a Rule 33 motion in the district court;\" and (2) defendant \"simply argued on appeal that the [he] was entitled to a new trial as an alternative argument.\" Appellee's Mot. in Resp. to Order to Show Cause at 2 (emphasis added). Quite plainly, this reasoning is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the government's puzzling characterization, defendant's briefing and position at oral argument unambiguously referenced the \"district court['s]. . . . error [in] denying appellant's motion for judgment of acquittal and his <i>motion for new trial.</i>\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> Appellant's Br. at 38 (emphasis added). In any event, what concerns us most about the government's response is that it misses the point entirely.</p>\n<p>Counsel are bound by the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct (the Model Rules). 1st Cir. R. IV, at 106; <i>see also</i> P.R.U.S. Dist. L.R. 83.5(a) (expressly incorporating the Model Rules). Therein, counsel owes their respective clients duties of, <i>inter alia,</i> competence and diligence and they owe this Court a duty of candor. <i>See</i> Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 1.1, 1.3, 3.3. It is axiomatic that lawyers are obligated to scrupulously review the record on appeal, including the district court docket. When referring to documents purportedly filed in the district courtmuch less documents material to an appealcounsel must verify that such documents exist. If they do not, obviously, immediate corrective action must be taken. None of these steps were taken here, at the considerable expense of judicial economy. Even more amazingly, counsel failed to recognize the severity of this situation or attempt to make amends even after the Order to Show Cause issued. As noted above, both parties' responses are nonsensical. We underscore how deeply troubled we are by this unfortunate series of events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the forgoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's denial of defendant's Rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> 29 motion.

The district court dismissed Count 3 for lack of evidence after defendant rested his case. (12/2 Tr. 75.)</p>\n<p>[2]  The CS did not inform the government that defendant was present at the December 19, 2003 transaction until November 30, 2005, after the conclusion of the first day of defendant's trial. (12/1 Tr. 2.) Before the trial resumed on December 1, 2005, the government apprised the district court and defendant of this development. (12/1 Tr. 2.) Defendant objected to the CS's proposed testimony regarding defendant's presence at the December 19, 2003 deal. (12/1 Tr. 103.) Specifically, defendant argued that he would be prejudiced by such testimony due to, <i>inter alia,</i> his having inadequate time to prepare. (12/1 Tr. 103.) The district court, however, allowed the testimony finding: (1) no bad faith on the government's part; (2) the December 19, 2003 buy was, in any event, carried out during, and in furtherance of, the charged conspiracy; (3) the government promptly disclosed this development to the court and opposing counsel; and (4) defendant had sufficient time to prepare (<i>i.e.,</i> primarily during the one and one-half hour lunch break). (<i>See</i> 12/1 Tr. 103.)</p>\n<p>[3]  DEA's video surveillance did not capture the transaction in its entirety because much of the transaction unexpectedly transpired away from the surveillance location. (11/30 Tr. 75-76.)</p>\n<p>[4]  Although the CS recorded the January 12, 2004 meeting, the recording proved unintelligible. (11/30 Tr. 85.) The district court; consequently, refused to admit the recording into evidence. (12/1 Tr. 141, 148.)</p>\n<p>[5]  As with the December 19, 2003 transaction, <i>see supra</i> note 3, DEA's video surveillance did not capture the entire transaction. SA Yant explained that the deal's location changed several times as it unfolded. (12/1 Tr. 83, 87.)</p>\n<p>[6]  In addition to the aforementioned, SA Yant testified regarding two other drug buys that purportedly occurred during the charged conspiracy. Both of those transactions involved defendant's co-conspirators; SA Yant testified, however, that defendant was not implicated in either of those incidents.
