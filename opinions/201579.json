Luis Daniel Ayala-Pizarro was\n\nconvicted, after a four-day jury trial, of possession with intent\n\nto distribute 153 decks of heroin and of knowingly possessing a\n\nfirearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.                      21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i).               He was acquitted of two\n\nadditional     gun    charges    involving      possession       of   semiautomatic\n\nassault   weapons.          He   was    sentenced      to   twenty-four    months'\n\nimprisonment on the first charge and sixty months on the second, to\n\nbe   served    consecutively      for    a     total   of   eighty-four    months'\n\nimprisonment.        He attacks both his conviction and his sentence.\n\n              We   affirm   Ayala's     conviction.         We   also   affirm   his\n\nsentence, save for a limited remand, agreed to by the government,\n\nfor the purposes of conforming the drug testing and drug treatment\n\nprogram portions of Ayala's supervised release conditions to the\n\ndictates of United States v. Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\nChallenge to Conviction\n\n              Ayala argues that the district court erred in permitting\n\nan arresting officer to cross the line from being a fact witness to\n\nbeing an expert witness when the officer testified about drug\n\ndistribution points and how they operate as well as how heroin is\n\nnormally packaged for distribution at these points. Ayala objected\n\nat trial that the officer's testimony was expert testimony under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 702, and that no prior notice of such expert\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\ftestimony   had    been   given,   as   required   by   Fed.   R.   Crim.   P.\n\n16(a)(1)(G).      We describe the pertinent facts.\n\n            Officer Mulero, one of the arresting officers, testified\n\nthat he arrested Ayala at 2 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon on\n\nMelilla Street in Loiza, Puerto Rico, near a house known to be a\n\ndrug point.       Officer Mulero and the other arresting officer,\n\nOfficer Pietri, were in the area looking for two suspects in the\n\nwounding of another man.      The officers observed Ayala and another\n\nman, Luis Vazquez Alvarez, at the right-hand corner of the house.\n\nAyala and Vazquez did not see the officers, but the officers saw\n\nboth men and that they were armed with firearms.         Indeed, Ayala was\n\ntrying to cock his gun, a Cobrai Model M11, nine millimeter caliber\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon, at the time.              The officers then\n\ndetained and arrested the two men.        A search of Ayala turned up 153\n\naluminum-foil covered decks of heroin from his left pocket; his\n\ncompanion had $250. The officers arrested three other men standing\n\nnearby; each had a revolver.        Experts determined that the heroin\n\nweighed 10.94 grams. An expert also testified that Ayala's gun was\n\nfunctioning and capable of firing in semiautomatic mode, and that\n\nits serial number was obliterated.\n\n            At trial, when the government asked Officer Mulero about\n\nhis experience with drug points, as a lead-in to Mulero's testimony\n\nthat Ayala was arrested at a known drug point, defense counsel\n\nobjected, arguing that this was expert testimony and that because\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe government had not given notice of expert testimony from Mulero\n\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(G), the witness could not so\n\ntestify.    At a subsequent bench conference, the government made a\n\nproffer that the witness would also testify that the particular\n\npackaging    of   the   drugs   seized   showed   they    were   packaged   for\n\ndistribution.     Defense counsel countered that the testimony about\n\nthe nature of the packaging was even more clearly expert testimony.\n\nThe court ruled that the testimony that Melilla Street was a known\n\ndrug point was permissible lay testimony.                As to the packaging\n\nissue, the court ruled it needed to hear foundational evidence and\n\nallowed the testimony subject to a motion to strike.\n\n            Officer Mulero then testified as to how drug points work\n\ngenerally, stating:\n\n            Basically one individual loads the drug while\n            the other one collects the money, and then you\n            have [men] who are armed and just waiting\n            around in the event other gangs might come by\n            and take action, and then you have others as\n            vigilantes to see if the cops come.\n\n\nMulero testified about his experience with Melilla Street as a drug\n\npoint.     He also testified that he had made previous seizures of\n\nheroin at drug points, and that the heroin was typically packed in\n\naluminum decks.     Officer Mulero was then asked about the packaging\n\nof the drugs he seized from the defendant, and replied that the\n\nheroin was packaged \"[i]n a shape or manner of a deck.\"             Ayala did\n\nnot later move to strike.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f            On appeal, Ayala argues that he is entitled to a new\n\ntrial because two parts of Mulero's testimony, first about how drug\n\npoints operate and, second, about how heroin is packaged, could\n\nonly be given by an expert and the government failed to give notice\n\nthat Officer Mulero would testify as an expert.\n\n            As to the testimony concerning how drug points operate,\n\nbecause Ayala timely objected, review is for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir. 2000).             As to\n\nthe testimony concerning packaging, because the objection was\n\ndenied conditionally, subject to a later motion to strike, and\n\nAyala made no later motion to strike, review is for plain error.\n\nSee Wilson v. Williams, 182 F.3d 562, 566-67 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n            The government contends that neither of the two types of\n\ntestimony (on the nature of drug points and on heroin packaging for\n\ndistribution) was expert testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 702.              We\n\nagree with the government that neither type of testimony was expert\n\ntestimony at all, but was admissible as lay witness testimony under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 701, even after the amendments to the two rules in\n\nDecember 2000.   The pre-amendment version of Rule 701 required lay\n\nopinion testimony to be \"rationally based on the perception of the\n\nwitness\" and \"helpful to a clear understanding of the witness'\n\ntestimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\"         In 2000, Rule\n\n701   was   amended   to   include   the   additional   requirement    that\n\ntestimony admitted under the rule \"not [be] based on scientific,\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftechnical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule\n\n702.\"     As the advisory committee's notes explain, this amendment\n\nwas     intended   \"to   eliminate   the        risk   that    the   reliability\n\nrequirements set forth in Rule 702 will be evaded through the\n\nsimple expedient of proffering an expert in lay witness clothing.\"\n\nFed. R. Evid. 701, advisory committee's note on 2000 amendment.\n\nInstead,    such   expert   testimony      is    subject      to   the   pre-trial\n\ndisclosure requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n16 and the additional reliability requirements imposed by Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 702.    Id.; see also Fed. R. Evid. 702, advisory committee's\n\nnote on 2000 amendment (explaining intent to \"provid[e] some\n\ngeneral standards that the trial court must use to assess the\n\nreliability and helpfulness of proffered expert testimony\" in the\n\nwake of Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 1379 (1999), and\n\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)).\n\n            We have noted that \"[t]he line between expert testimony\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 702 . . . and lay opinion testimony under Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 701 . . . is not easy to draw.\"               United States v. Colon-\n\nOsorio, 360 F.3d 48, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2004).                    Indeed, the same\n\nwitness –- for example, a law enforcement officer -- may be\n\nqualified to \"provide both lay and expert testimony in a single\n\ncase.\"     See Fed. R. Evid. 701, advisory committee's note (citing\n\nUnited States v. Figeuroa-Lopez, 125 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f1997)).   In this case, however, the testimony did not cross the\n\nline to become expert testimony.\n\n           As to the testimony about how drug points operate,\n\nOfficer Mulero stated that he had investigated, patrolled, or made\n\narrests at drug points on more than 100 occasions.         His testimony\n\nstated what occurred at those drug points.          This testimony was\n\nbased on the requisite personal knowledge under Fed. R. Evid. 602\n\nand also met the requirements of Fed. R. Evid. 701, because it was\n\nbased on \"particularized knowledge that the witness [had] by virtue\n\nof his . . . position\" as a police officer assigned to patrol the\n\nneighborhood.1   Fed. R. Evid. 701, advisory committee's note.\n\n           Before the 2000 amendments, we had repeatedly noted that\n\n\"the modern trend favors the admission of [lay] opinion testimony\n\nprovided it is well founded on personal knowledge and susceptible\n\nto cross-examination.\"     See United States v. Vega-Figueroa, 234\n\nF.3d 744, 755 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v. Paiva, 892\n\nF.2d 148, 157 (1st Cir. 1989)).     While the 2000 amendments subject\n\ntestimony falling within the scope of Rule 702 to heightened\n\nreliability requirements and rules governing pre-trial disclosure,\n\nOfficer   Mulero's   testimony   does   not   trigger   these   additional\n\nsafeguards. It required no special expertise for Officer Mulero to\n\nconclude, based on his observations, that places which sell drugs\n\n\n     1\n      Defendant relies on the opinion of the Second Circuit in\nUnited States v. Cruz, 363 F.3d 187 (2d Cir. 2004), which is\ninapposite on its facts.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fare often protected by people with weapons.                The defense could\n\nhardly be surprised by Mulero's testimony that Ayala was arrested\n\nat   a   drug    point,    nor   was   Ayala   disabled    from     testing   the\n\nreliability of Mulero's perceptions through cross-examination.\n\n              As to the packaging, the officer simply testified to his\n\nexperience on prior drug arrests that the heroin seized at drug\n\npoints was \"basically packed in . . . aluminum decks,\" and that in\n\nthis case the drugs were packaged \"[i]n a shape or manner of a\n\ndeck.\"    The agent's testimony as to what he saw is not expert\n\ntestimony.      See United States v. Santana, 342 F.3d 60, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).    The jury was left to draw its own conclusions as to the\n\ncontents and purpose of the decks, undoubtedly assisted by the fact\n\nthat the 153 decks seized in this case, when tested, in fact\n\ncontained heroin.\n\nChallenge to Sentence\n\n              The government has conceded that under the rule of United\n\nStates v. Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93 (1st Cir. 2003), the case\n\nshould   be     remanded   for   adjustment    of   the   portion    of   Ayala's\n\nsentence imposing conditions of supervised release, in order to\n\ncure an impermissible delegation of authority to the probation\n\nofficer over drug testing and drug treatment.              We have no reason\n\nnot to accept this concession.\n\n              Ayala tries to ride the concession further, arguing that\n\nthe term of imprisonment in the sentence is also now open.                That is\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fcontrary to Melendez-Santana itself and a long line of cases\n\nremanding for limited adjustment of sentences.           See Melendez-\n\nSantana, 353 F.3d at 108 (remanding for limited adjustment solely\n\nof   supervised   released   conditions).   A   remand   to   correct   a\n\ndelegation error as to conditions of supervised release does not\n\nopen up any other aspect of a sentence for resentencing.\n\n            Ayala's brief also raised a different sort of sentencing\n\nargument.    Ayala on appeal for the first time raised an argument\n\nthat under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the issue\n\nof exact drug quantity should have been found by the jury.         This\n\nargument has since been transformed into a Booker argument, due to\n\nthe Supreme Court's recent decision on the Sentencing Guidelines in\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).    This issue was not\n\npreserved at the trial court.      On its own terms the unpreserved\n\nApprendi argument would have failed pre-Booker -- there would have\n\nbeen no plain error.    At sentencing defendant did not, and indeed\n\nhad no basis to, contest the government's evidence that the heroin\n\nweighed 10.94 grams.    See United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625,\n\n633-34 (2002) (no plain error under Apprendi when evidence of drug\n\nquantity was overwhelming and uncontested at trial).\n\n            After the Supreme Court's recent decision in Booker, the\n\nquestion for plain error review is whether defendant has shown a\n\nreasonable probability the sentencing judge would, in a non-\n\nmandatory Guidelines system, have imposed a more lenient sentence.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fSee United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 78-79 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Ayala cannot meet that standard.   The sixty-month portion\n\nof the sentence for the firearm possession was mandated by statute,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i), (D)(ii), and the twenty-four months\n\nfor drug distribution was centered in the middle of the twenty-one\n\nto twenty-seven month range.   We see no reasonable likelihood of a\n\nmore lenient sentence should the case be remanded. Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d at 79.\n\n           The conviction is affirmed; the sentence is affirmed save\n\nfor that limited portion of the conditions of supervised release\n\nrelating to drug testing and treatment, which is remanded for\n\ncorrection in accordance with this opinion.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

That is contrary to <i>Melendez-Santana</i> itself and a long line of cases remanding for limited adjustment of sentences. <i>See Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d at 108 (remanding for limited adjustment solely of supervised released conditions). A remand to correct a delegation error as to conditions of supervised release does not open up any other aspect of a sentence for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala's brief also raised a different sort of sentencing argument. Ayala on appeal for the first time raised an argument that under <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the issue of exact drug quantity should have been found by the jury. This argument has since been transformed into a <i>Booker</i> argument, due to the Supreme Court's recent decision on the Sentencing Guidelines in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This issue was not preserved at the trial court. On its own terms the unpreserved <i>Apprendi</i> argument would have failed pre-<i>Booker</i>&#8212;there would have been no plain error. At sentencing defendant did not, and indeed had no basis to, contest the government's evidence that the heroin weighed 10.94 grams. <i>See United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 633-34, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (no plain error under <i>Apprendi</i> when evidence of drug quantity was overwhelming and uncontested at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Booker,</i> the question for plain error review is whether defendant has shown a reasonable probability the sentencing judge would, in a non-mandatory Guidelines system, have imposed a more lenient sentence. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 78-79 (1st Cir.2005). Ayala cannot meet that standard. The sixty-month portion of the sentence for the firearm possession was mandated by statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(i), (D)(ii), and the twenty-four months for drug distribution was centered in the middle of the twenty-one to twenty-seven month range.

Ayala objected at trial that the officer's testimony was expert testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 702, and that no prior notice of such expert testimony had been given, as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G). We describe the pertinent facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Mulero, one of the arresting officers, testified that he arrested Ayala at 2 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon on Melilla Street in Loiza, Puerto Rico, near a house known to be a drug point. Officer Mulero and the other arresting officer, Officer Pietri, were in the area looking for two suspects in the wounding of another man. The officers observed Ayala and another man, Luis Vazquez Alvarez, at the right-hand corner of the house. Ayala and Vazquez did not see the officers, but the officers saw both men and that they were armed with firearms. Indeed, Ayala was trying to cock his gun, a Cobrai Model M11, nine millimeter caliber semiautomatic assault weapon, at the time. The officers then detained and arrested the two men. A search of Ayala turned up 153 aluminum-foil covered decks of heroin from his left pocket; his companion had $250. The officers arrested three other men standing nearby; each had a revolver. Experts determined that the heroin weighed 10.94 grams. An expert also testified that Ayala's gun was functioning and capable of firing in semiautomatic mode, and that its serial number was obliterated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, when the government asked Officer Mulero about his experience with drug points, as a lead-in to Mulero's testimony that Ayala was arrested at a known drug point, defense counsel objected, arguing that this was expert testimony and that because the government had not given notice of expert testimony from Mulero under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G), the witness could not so testify. At a subsequent bench conference, the government made a proffer that the witness would also testify that the particular packaging of the drugs seized showed they were packaged for distribution. Defense counsel countered that the testimony about the nature of the packaging was even more clearly expert testimony. The court ruled that the testimony that Melilla Street was a known drug point was permissible lay testimony. As to the packaging issue, the court ruled it needed to hear foundational evidence and allowed the testimony subject to a motion to strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Mulero then testified as to how drug points work generally, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basically one individual loads the drug while the other one collects the money, and then you have [men] who are armed and just waiting around in the event other gangs might come by and take action, and then you have others as vigilantes to see if the cops come.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulero testified about his experience with Melilla Street as a drug point.

Melendez-Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200784\"><a href=\"/opinion/200784/united-states-v-melendez-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003), the case should be remanded for adjustment of the portion of Ayala's sentence imposing conditions of supervised release, in order to cure an impermissible delegation of authority to the probation officer over drug testing and drug treatment. We have no reason not to accept this concession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala tries to ride the concession further, arguing that the term of imprisonment in the sentence is also now open. That is contrary to <i>Melendez-Santana</i> itself and a long line of cases remanding for limited adjustment of sentences. <i>See Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d at 108 (remanding for limited adjustment solely of supervised released conditions). A remand to correct a delegation error as to conditions of supervised release does not open up any other aspect of a sentence for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala's brief also raised a different sort of sentencing argument. Ayala on appeal for the first time raised an argument that under <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000), the issue of exact drug quantity should have been found by the jury. This argument has since been transformed into a <i>Booker</i> argument, due to the Supreme Court's recent decision on the Sentencing Guidelines in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). This issue was not preserved at the trial court. On its own terms the unpreserved <i>Apprendi</i> argument would have failed pre-<i>Booker</i>&#8212;there would have been no plain error. At sentencing defendant did not, and indeed had no basis to, contest the government's evidence that the heroin weighed 10.94 grams. <i>See United States v. Cotton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 633-34, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1781</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span> (2002) (no plain error under <i>Apprendi</i> when evidence of drug quantity was overwhelming and uncontested at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Booker,</i> the question for plain error review is whether defendant has shown a reasonable probability the sentencing judge would, in a non-mandatory Guidelines system, have imposed a more lenient sentence. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 78-79 (1st Cir.2005). Ayala cannot meet that standard. The sixty-month portion of the sentence for the firearm possession was mandated by statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(i), (D)(ii), and the twenty-four months for drug distribution was centered in the middle of the twenty-one to twenty-seven month range. We see no reasonable likelihood of a more lenient sentence should the case be remanded. <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conviction is <i>affirmed;</i> the sentence is <i>affirmed</i> save for that limited portion of the conditions of supervised release relating to drug testing and treatment, which is <i>remanded</i> for correction in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Defendant relies on the opinion of the Second Circuit in<i>United States v.
