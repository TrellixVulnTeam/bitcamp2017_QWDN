Honkola and White\nand Williams LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                                April 15, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           SOUTER, Associate Justice.        Three principals organized\n\nthe appellant, Take It Away, Inc., to act as a broker in a\n\ncontemplated business of supplying dumpsters that do-it-yourselfers\n\ncould rent from the appellee, The Home Depot, Inc., and like\n\nretailers.   In a document called a “teaser,” mailed to a Home Depot\n\nofficial in 1997, Take It Away hopefully described itself as a\n\n“Nationwide Association” of waste haulers and others, with a\n\n“Retail Distribution Channel for renting Construction & Demolition\n\nDebris Removal Containers” (i.e., dumpsters), which was prepared to\n\nform   “Strategic   Partnerships”    with   building   material   supplies\n\ndealers like Home Depot. Take it Away would “provid[e] all the\n\ntools,” apparently dumpsters, “for [Home Depot] to capture [its]\n\nshare of this immense untapped market,” presumably by renting the\n\ndumpsters to its customers.         The statement described itself as\n\nconfidential, and when the recipient at Home Depot agreed to have\n\ndiscussions he signed a “non-disclosure agreement” prepared by Take\n\nIt Away, pledging that Home Depot would “utilize the Confidential\n\nProprietary Information” to be disclosed “for the sole purpose of\n\nevaluating the business of [Take It Away] and [would] make no other\n\nuse” of it without permission.\n\n           The information actually disclosed was a proposal that\n\nthe association, Take It Away, would supply dumpsters (obtained,\n\none supposes, from its associated trash haulers) that Home Depot\n\nwould rent directly to its customers, pocketing ten percent of the\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fcharge and remitting the balance to Take It Away.                    Home Depot was\n\nnot interested in becoming a dumpster lessor, and remained of that\n\nmind despite at least four more of Take It Away’s pitches to other\n\ncompany officers and employees over the next five years. Beginning\n\nin 2003, however, Home Depot signed agreements allowing four\n\nsuppliers in the United States and Canada to use space in Home\n\nDepot stores to offer dumpster rentals directly as lessors to Home\n\nDepot customers.\n\n              Take It Away brought this suit in a Massachusetts state\n\ncourt.   Count 1 accused Home Depot of violating the non-disclosure\n\nagreement; count 2 charged appropriation of trade secrets contrary\n\nto Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93, § 42; count 3 alleged\n\ncommon   law    conversion      of   trade    secrets;       and   count    4   claimed\n\nviolation of Chapter 93A, § 11 of the Massachusetts statutes,\n\nforbidding unfair trade practices.             Home Depot removed the case to\n\nfederal court, where the district judge granted summary judgement\n\nto Home Depot on all counts.          On appeal for de novo review, Klaucke\n\nv. Daly, 595 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2010), we affirm.\n\n              The principal difficulty in this case is understanding\n\nwhat    the    confidentiality       agreement    was    supposed      to       protect.\n\n“Confidential      Proprietary       Information”       is    undefined,        and   the\n\ndistrict court not unnaturally took it at a fairly general level to\n\ncover    “the    concept   of    renting      dumpsters       from   national         home\n\nimprovement retail centers.”            At first, some of us also thought\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthat was what the fight was about, but a careful rereading of Take\n\nIt Away’s reply brief shows that its claim is a degree more\n\nparticular, focused on brokerage.         It says that its “dumpster-\n\nbrokerage concept and business plan” were the intended subjects of\n\nprotection;   “the   essence   of   its   concept   is   national   retail\n\ndistribution dumpster brokerage” combined with a “separate business\n\nplan for putting its concept into practice” (emphasis in original).\n\nThe stress in the reply brief is repeatedly on its “dumpster-\n\nbrokerage concept” or “container-brokerage concept,” which is more\n\nspecific than “rental of dumpsters.”\n\n          The clarification at least saves Take It Away from the\n\nobvious response that all it disclosed was that Home Depot, like\n\never so many others, could rent out dumpsters.               But even as\n\nclarified, the claim seems to boil down to this:         the agreement was\n\nintended to protect a “brokerage” concept to the effect that Take\n\nIt Away would deal with third parties to obtain dumpsters that Home\n\nDepot could rent to customers. The concept is not merely, “you can\n\ndo it, too,” but no more than “you can do it, too, and we will\n\nbroker your supplies.”\n\n          With the subject of the claimed protection so understood,\n\nwe think the summary judgement order was correct on all counts.\n\nAlthough much of the briefing and argument addresses the potential\n\nbreadth of “Confidential Proprietary Information” along with its\n\nrelation to the notion of a trade secret and the criteria for\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fconcluding that information amounts to a trade secret, the anterior\n\nissue is whether the concept actually meant to be protected here\n\ncan reasonably be seen as having enough value, beyond what was\n\ncommonly known or obvious, to amount to consideration for Home\n\nDepot’s promise to limit its use of that concept as Take It Away\n\nsubsequently disclosed it.          The first reason for answering no is\n\nsimply that before the Home Depot official signed the agreement he\n\nhad already seen the teaser, which is fairly read as disclosing the\n\nconcept of a network of businesses organized by Take It Away to\n\nsupply dumpsters to be rented out by retail suppliers to their\n\ncustomers.         That is, the teaser described an association in the\n\nrole of a broker of rental goods.                While the details of the\n\nbusiness plan were not set out there, the basic business structure\n\nwas apparent: Home Depot would “capture” the market, while Take It\n\nAway       would   work   behind   the   scene   of   the   retailer’s   direct\n\ntransaction with the customer.            The concept was out in the open\n\nbefore Home Depot agreed to talk.1\n\n               But even if the claimed secret had not already been\n\nrevealed before the agreement was signed, one searches in vain for\n\nanything of value not readily imaginable that might be protected.\n\n\n       1\n       The detailed provisions of the business plan were not\ndisclosed by the relatively short teaser statement, but this is\nirrelevant for two independent reasons. First, it does not appear\nthat the plan adds anything to the concept that was not obvious\nfrom the concept as described by the teaser.    And, second, Home\nDepot did not implement the details of Take It Away’s plan; its\nfour contractors deal directly with the customers.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fIt is undisputed that Home Depot rented tools and even trucks to\n\nits customers, that dumpsters were commonly rented out, and that\n\nretailers need manufacturers or suppliers.              While it might have\n\nbeen   information      of   some   commercial    (though      not   necessarily\n\nprotectable) value that a previously unknown broker network was\n\nready for business and could give Home Depot an immediate entree to\n\nthe dumpster supply market, that could not have been protectable\n\ninformation here, if for no other reason than the undisputed fact\n\nthat Take it Away’s “Nationwide Association” did not actually\n\nexist; the references to an association were expressions of hope,\n\nnothing more.     In sum, it is hard to see what concept or plan Home\n\nDepot gained from the disclosure that it could not have thought up\n\nreadily for itself if it had found any reason to expand its rental\n\nactivity: a dumpster is a big tool for removing debris, and renting\n\ntools and establishing reliable supply networks are not the stuff\n\nof novel concepts.       This is not to say, of course, that a proposal\n\nlike Take It Away’s could not have led to lucrative business if\n\naccepted,   but   any    such   value    would   have   come    from   efficient\n\nexecution, not conceptual inventiveness, and disclosing the concept\n\ndid not provide the value necessary for consideration supporting a\n\ncontractual claim.\n\n            This view of the nature and worth of Take It Away’s\n\ndisclosure answers its argument that “Confidential Proprietary\n\nInformation” may be the subject of a confidentiality agreement\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fcovering more than trade secrets and may be protected by contract\n\nunder Massachusetts law.    We will assume this to be so, for it\n\nmakes no difference.     Whatever the state law of contract may\n\nprotect, there must be a contract to protect it, and without\n\nvaluable consideration on one side there is none.\n\n          As might be expected, the state doctrine of protectable\n\ntrade secrets, the subject of counts 2 and 3, fails to improve Take\n\nIt Away’s position. Under Massachusetts common law, a trade secret\n\nis “‘any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information\n\n. . . used in one’s business . . . which gives him an opportunity\n\nto obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it,”\n\nJ.T. Healy & Son, Inc. v. James A. Murphy & Son, Inc., 357 Mass.\n\n728, 736, 260 N.E.2d 723, 729 (1970) (quoting Restatement of Torts\n\n§ 757 cmt. b (1939)).2   The definition is spacious to be sure, but\n\na protectable secret must still be described aptly as a secret\n\nafter considering six criteria, see Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v.\n\nCrampton, 361 Mass. 835, 840, 282 N.E.2d 921, 925 (1972), which are\n\nnot much help to Take It Away.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       While Take It Away brought claims under both Massachusetts\ncommon law and statutory law, it does not distinguish between them\non appeal because it views them as “doctrinally equivalent.” This\nmay well be true. See Incase Inc. v. Timex Corp., 488 F.3d 46, 52\nn.10 (1st Cir. 2007); Burten v. Milton Bradley Co., 763 F.2d 461,\n462 (1st Cir. 1985) (“Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93, § 42 . . .\nessentially codifies the common law.”). Regardless, because Take\nIt Away makes no argument that its statutory claim calls for a\nseparate analysis, we analyze counts 2 and 3 together.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          The first and last criteria look to the extent that\n\ninformation was known outside Take It Away and the ease with which\n\nit could be acquired independently.    As noted, the teaser revealed\n\nwhat a true teaser would have left for later, and for that matter\n\nanyone interested in domestic building construction could readily\n\nhave thought of supplying dumpsters for rent by a lumber dealer; in\n\nfact, the idea struck one of Take It Away’s principals in a flash\n\nas he was driving by a Home Depot store.   While it should not count\n\nagainst a small corporation that everyone working for it knows the\n\nsupposed secret (under the second criterion), it does count against\n\nTake It Away (under the third) that the move it made to protect\n\nitself (getting a non-disclosure agreement) was outflanked by the\n\nteaser and was insisted upon in dealing with only one of at least\n\nseven Home Depot officers or employees to whom Take It Away\n\nrevealed the concept.   The others variously refused, declined, or\n\nwere never asked to sign the non-disclosure form.    See Healy, 357\n\nMass. at 738, 260 N.E.2d at 731 (he who wishes to preserve a trade\n\nsecret “must exercise eternal vigilance”).\n\n          The amount of effort and money devoted to developing the\n\nsupposed secret (criterion five) does not enhance Take It Away’s\n\ncase appreciably, for the 1700 hours of work claimed, and the\n\nthousands said to have been spent, include the extended and wholly\n\nunsuccessful marketing efforts.       Finally, with respect to the\n\nfourth criterion (the value of the idea), while Take It Away’s\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fexpert envisioned millions in profits, nothing in his report\n\nsuggests that a trade secret was the reason; he simply estimates\n\nthe value of the business opportunity assuming vigorous marketing\n\nby Home Depot.   Cf. Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1011\n\nn.15 (1984) (“[T]he value of a trade secret lies in the competitive\n\nadvantage it gives its owner over competitors.”).\n\n          It is not apparent that consideration of these six\n\nfactors could support a conclusion of protectable trade secret. So\n\nsummary judgement on counts 2 and 3 was proper.       See Rodi v. S. New\n\nEng. Sch. of Law, 532 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2008) (explaining that\n\nsummary judgement is appropriate if no reasonable jury could find\n\nfor the non-movant, even on an issue that is “ordinarily a question\n\nof fact for the jury” under state law).\n\n          Take    It   Away’s     final   claim   alleges   violation    of\n\nMassachusetts    General   Laws    Chapter   93-A.    As    Take   It   Away\n\nsuccinctly put it in the reply brief, this claim “is premised on a\n\nnumber of unfair and deceptive acts . . . namely, Home Depot’s\n\nbreach of the Agreement and misappropriation of trade secrets.”\n\nAbsent an enforceable agreement and, specifically, a trade secret,\n\ncount 4 fails as well.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

The concept was out in the open\n\nbefore Home Depot agreed to talk.1\n\n               But even if the claimed secret had not already been\n\nrevealed before the agreement was signed, one searches in vain for\n\nanything of value not readily imaginable that might be protected.\n\n\n       1\n       The detailed provisions of the business plan were not\ndisclosed by the relatively short teaser statement, but this is\nirrelevant for two independent reasons. First, it does not appear\nthat the plan adds anything to the concept that was not obvious\nfrom the concept as described by the teaser.    And, second, Home\nDepot did not implement the details of Take It Away’s plan; its\nfour contractors deal directly with the customers.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fIt is undisputed that Home Depot rented tools and even trucks to\n\nits customers, that dumpsters were commonly rented out, and that\n\nretailers need manufacturers or suppliers.              While it might have\n\nbeen   information      of   some   commercial    (though      not   necessarily\n\nprotectable) value that a previously unknown broker network was\n\nready for business and could give Home Depot an immediate entree to\n\nthe dumpster supply market, that could not have been protectable\n\ninformation here, if for no other reason than the undisputed fact\n\nthat Take it Away’s “Nationwide Association” did not actually\n\nexist; the references to an association were expressions of hope,\n\nnothing more.     In sum, it is hard to see what concept or plan Home\n\nDepot gained from the disclosure that it could not have thought up\n\nreadily for itself if it had found any reason to expand its rental\n\nactivity: a dumpster is a big tool for removing debris, and renting\n\ntools and establishing reliable supply networks are not the stuff\n\nof novel concepts.       This is not to say, of course, that a proposal\n\nlike Take It Away’s could not have led to lucrative business if\n\naccepted,   but   any    such   value    would   have   come    from   efficient\n\nexecution, not conceptual inventiveness, and disclosing the concept\n\ndid not provide the value necessary for consideration supporting a\n\ncontractual claim.\n\n            This view of the nature and worth of Take It Away’s\n\ndisclosure answers its argument that “Confidential Proprietary\n\nInformation” may be the subject of a confidentiality agreement\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fcovering more than trade secrets and may be protected by contract\n\nunder Massachusetts law.    We will assume this to be so, for it\n\nmakes no difference.     Whatever the state law of contract may\n\nprotect, there must be a contract to protect it, and without\n\nvaluable consideration on one side there is none.\n\n          As might be expected, the state doctrine of protectable\n\ntrade secrets, the subject of counts 2 and 3, fails to improve Take\n\nIt Away’s position. Under Massachusetts common law, a trade secret\n\nis “‘any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information\n\n. . . used in one’s business . . . which gives him an opportunity\n\nto obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it,”\n\nJ.T.

Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93, § 42 . . .\nessentially codifies the common law.”). Regardless, because Take\nIt Away makes no argument that its statutory claim calls for a\nseparate analysis, we analyze counts 2 and 3 together.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          The first and last criteria look to the extent that\n\ninformation was known outside Take It Away and the ease with which\n\nit could be acquired independently.    As noted, the teaser revealed\n\nwhat a true teaser would have left for later, and for that matter\n\nanyone interested in domestic building construction could readily\n\nhave thought of supplying dumpsters for rent by a lumber dealer; in\n\nfact, the idea struck one of Take It Away’s principals in a flash\n\nas he was driving by a Home Depot store.   While it should not count\n\nagainst a small corporation that everyone working for it knows the\n\nsupposed secret (under the second criterion), it does count against\n\nTake It Away (under the third) that the move it made to protect\n\nitself (getting a non-disclosure agreement) was outflanked by the\n\nteaser and was insisted upon in dealing with only one of at least\n\nseven Home Depot officers or employees to whom Take It Away\n\nrevealed the concept.   The others variously refused, declined, or\n\nwere never asked to sign the non-disclosure form.    See Healy, 357\n\nMass. at 738, 260 N.E.2d at 731 (he who wishes to preserve a trade\n\nsecret “must exercise eternal vigilance”).\n\n          The amount of effort and money devoted to developing the\n\nsupposed secret (criterion five) does not enhance Take It Away’s\n\ncase appreciably, for the 1700 hours of work claimed, and the\n\nthousands said to have been spent, include the extended and wholly\n\nunsuccessful marketing efforts.       Finally, with respect to the\n\nfourth criterion (the value of the idea), while Take It Away’s\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fexpert envisioned millions in profits, nothing in his report\n\nsuggests that a trade secret was the reason; he simply estimates\n\nthe value of the business opportunity assuming vigorous marketing\n\nby Home Depot.   Cf. Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111227\"><a href=\"/opinion/111227/ruckelshaus-v-monsanto-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1011\n\nn.15 (1984) (“[T]he value of a trade secret lies in the competitive\n\nadvantage it gives its owner over competitors.”).\n\n          It is not apparent that consideration of these six\n\nfactors could support a conclusion of protectable trade secret. So\n\nsummary judgement on counts 2 and 3 was proper.       See Rodi v. S. New\n\nEng. Sch. of Law, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203357\"><a href=\"/opinion/203357/rodi-v-southern-new-england-school-of-law/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 2008) (explaining that\n\nsummary judgement is appropriate if no reasonable jury could find\n\nfor the non-movant, even on an issue that is “ordinarily a question\n\nof fact for the jury” under state law).\n\n          Take    It   Away’s     final   claim   alleges   violation    of\n\nMassachusetts    General   Laws    Chapter   93-A.
