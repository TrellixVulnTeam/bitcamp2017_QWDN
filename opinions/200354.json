This appeal asks us to revisit\n\na dispute between the City of Gloucester and Arthur Sheehan, a\n\nformer member of the Gloucester Police Department.                    Previously,\n\nafter reviewing the district court's entry of summary judgment for\n\nthe defendant, we remanded the case for further consideration of\n\nSheehan's Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") claim in light of\n\nan intervening decision by the Supreme Court in Murphy v. United\n\nParcel Services., Inc., 527 U.S. 516 (1999).                   Sheehan v. City of\n\nGloucester,      207    F.3d     35   (1st     Cir.   2000).       After   further\n\nproceedings, the district court again entered summary judgment for\n\nthe defendant.         While the case was before the district court on\n\nremand, a Supreme Court decision once again transformed the terrain\n\nof disability law, this time with unfortunate consequences for\n\nSheehan.      See Toyota Motor Mfg. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002).\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment for the defendants and\n\nfound, using Toyota for guidance, that Sheehan was not disabled\n\nunder   the     ADA.      Sheehan       now    appeals   the    district   court's\n\napplication of Toyota, claiming, inter alia, that delay by the\n\ndistrict court caused him to lose under Toyota rather than prevail\n\nunder Murphy.     This time around, we affirm.\n\n                               Factual Background\n\n           The factual background of Sheehan's case is set forth in\n\nthe district court's opinion, Sheehan v. Marr, 2002 WL 389297 (D.\n\nMass.   March    27,    2000),    and    our    opinion,   Sheehan   v.    City   of\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fGloucester, 207 F.3d 35 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Sheehan I\").                 We will\n\nagain briefly summarize the relevant facts and update them to\n\nreflect events since our last opinion.\n\n            Sheehan was a member of the Gloucester Police Department\n\nfrom 1965 to 1994.      In 1984, Sheehan began receiving treatment for\n\nhypertension.       In August and October of 1992, and August of 1993,\n\nhe was hospitalized due to incidents of chest pain, some of which\n\noccurred while he was on duty.         Then fifty-two years old, Sheehan\n\ndid not return to duty after the 1993 hospitalization.\n\n            Several physicians concluded that Sheehan's hypertension\n\nand chest pain were the result of job-related stress.             In October\n\nof 1993, Dr. Madhu Thakur examined Sheehan at the defendant's\n\nrequest.     Based upon his review of the job description for a\n\nGloucester    police    officer,    Dr.    Thakur   concluded   that   Sheehan\n\n\"should    retire    from   the   police    force   in   Gloucester    and   his\n\nretirement should be permanent.\"\n\n             On November 4, 1993, Gloucester Police Chief James Marr\n\nsubmitted an application for involuntary disability retirement on\n\nSheehan's behalf with the Division of Public Employee Retirement\n\nAdministration (\"PERA\").          A panel of three physicians found that\n\nSheehan was physically incapacitated and substantially incapable of\n\nperforming his particular job and that his incapacity was likely to\n\nbe permanent.       Based upon the medical panel's determination, PERA\n\nconcluded that Sheehan qualified for accidental disability and\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\frecommended that he be retired from the Gloucester police force.\n\nSheehan was retired on August 17, 1994.\n\n                      Procedural Background\n\n           In May 1996, Sheehan brought an action for age and\n\ndisability discrimination in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Massachusetts, contending that the denial of his\n\nrequest for a reasonable accommodation violated his rights under\n\nthe ADA.    The City of Gloucester filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment, asserting, inter alia, that Sheehan was not \"disabled\"\n\nunder the ADA, and alternatively, that they had offered Sheehan\n\nreasonable accommodation (by offering him a quieter night shift,\n\nwhich he declined).\n\n           The district court granted summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants on May 20, 1998.     On March 27, 2000, we remanded the\n\ncase for further consideration of Sheehan's ADA claim in light of\n\nthe Supreme Court's intervening decision in Murphy, 527 U.S. 516\n\n(1999).1\n\n\n\n1\n   The sole issue on remand was the effect of the Murphy decision\non Sheehan's ADA claim against the City of Gloucester.     We did\nnote, however, that the district court had a wide degree of\nlatitude in considering that claim. We stated that:\n\n     The district court, after consideration of the ADA claim,\n     may, if it is so persuaded, award defendants summary\n     judgment once again, or, of course, make any other\n     determination of the matter it deems proper, including\n     assigning the case for trial.\n\nSheehan I, 207 F.3d at 41-42.\n\n                                -4-\n\f              While the case was pending before the district court, the\n\nSupreme Court decided Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams, 534\n\nU.S. 184 (2002), which addressed the question of what an ADA\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate to establish a substantial limitation in\n\nthe specific major life activity of performing manual tasks.              Id.\n\nat 691.    Applying Toyota to Sheehan's ADA claim, the court found\n\nthat Sheehan was not disabled as defined by the ADA because there\n\nwas no evidence that Sheehan's hypertension rendered him unable to\n\nperform a sufficiently broad range of jobs.2             Sheehan, 2002 WL\n\n389297,   at    *5.    Noting    that   after   his   retirement   from   the\n\nGloucester police force Sheehan continued to work as a security\n\nguard for 24-32 hours per week, the court held that his ability to\n\nwork had not been substantially limited by hypertension. Id.              The\n\ncourt concluded, \"[a]ccordingly, I find that he fails -- even under\n\nthe most generous reading of recent Supreme Court caselaw -- to\n\nsatisfy the first prong of the ADA's definition of disability: he\n\ndoes    not    manifest   a     physical   or   mental    impairment      that\n\nsubstantially limits one or more of his major life activities.\" Id.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    The ADA defines the term \"disability\" as:\n\n       (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially\n       limits one or more of the major life activities of such\n       individual;\n       (B) a record of such an impairment; or\n       (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 12102(2).\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            The district court also rejected Sheehan's claim that he\n\nsatisfied   the      ADA's   definition     of    disabled   because     he   had    a\n\n\"record\" of a physical or mental impairment that substantially\n\nlimits   one    or    more   major   life    activities.         See   42     U.S.C.\n\nยง 12102(2)(B).\n\n            Finally,     the    district    court    considered    and    rejected\n\nSheehan's claim that he qualified as disabled under the ADA because\n\nthe   defendant      regarded    Sheehan     as    having    a   disability,        as\n\ncontemplated by 42 U.S.C. ยง 12102(2)(C).                 The court held that\n\nalthough the City of Gloucester considered Sheehan to be unable to\n\nperform the job of a Gloucester police officer, that was not the\n\nsame as showing that the defendants regarded him as disabled for\n\npurposes of the ADA.         According to the court, the ADA's statutory\n\nclassification, as construed by the Supreme Court \"requires that\n\nthe defendant [has] regarded Sheehan's hypertension as rendering\n\nhim unable to perform a broad range of jobs.\"                Id. (citing Murphy,\n\n527 U.S. at 521-23).           The court concluded that Sheehan had not\n\nproduced any evidence in support of his argument that the City of\n\nGloucester regarded him as unable to perform a broad range of jobs.\n\n            Sheehan appealed the district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment.      His primary argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt erroneously and unfairly applied the Supreme Court's recent\n\nToyota decision to his case.               As peculiar as this claim is,\n\nSheehan's appeal is remarkable more for the issues it fails to\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fraise, rather than for the issues actually raised: he does not\n\ndispute that under Toyota, his hypertension does not constitute a\n\n\"disability\"    as   that   term    is    defined   by   the   ADA.     Instead,\n\nSheehan's argument is that the district court took an unreasonable\n\nlength of     time   to   decide   the     defendant's   motion   for    summary\n\njudgment, and, because of the court's delay, his case was decided\n\nunder the guidelines provided in Toyota -- which was decided in\n\n2002 -- rather than under Murphy -- which was decided in 1999.\n\nAccording to Sheehan, if his case had been decided in a timely\n\nmanner, he would have prevailed under Murphy. By subjecting him to\n\nthe Court's decision in Toyota, Sheehan claims the delay resulted\n\nin an ex post facto application of law and denied him his due\n\nprocess rights.\n\n                                   Discussion\n\n            We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nfor the City of Gloucester de novo.            We affirm the district court's\n\njudgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if\n\nthe City of Gloucester is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nRochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n            Sheehan's contention is essentially that the district\n\ncourt's delay exposed him to unfavorable Supreme Court precedent\n\nwhich in turn compelled the district court to grant a motion of\n\nsummary judgment against him.             Although we understand Sheehan's\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\ffrustration with the delay below, there is no merit to his claim\n\nthat    the    timing   of    the   district    court's   decision     and   its\n\napplication of Toyota violated his constitutional rights.               A party\n\nsimply does not suffer any legally cognizable injury when a court\n\napplies the intervening precedent of a higher court which decides\n\nan issue against that party.          After all, it is axiomatic that \"a\n\ncourt is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its\n\ndecision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or\n\nthere   is    statutory      direction    or   legislative   history    to   the\n\ncontrary.\"      Bradley v. Richmond Sch. Bd., 416 U.S. 696, 711-12\n\n(1974).\n\n              It is immaterial that the \"law in effect\" at the time the\n\ncourt renders its decision is an intervening change in the law, or\n\nthat the law took effect after some delay in the district court.\n\nAs Chief Justice Marshall articulated in 1801:\n\n              It is in the general true that the province of\n              an appellate court is only to enquire whether\n              a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not.\n              But if subsequent to the judgment and before\n              the decision of the appellate court, a law\n              intervenes and positively changes the rule\n              which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its\n              obligation   denied.       If   the   law   be\n              constitutional . . . I know of no court which\n              can contest its obligation.\n\nUnited States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 5 U.S. 103, 110\n\n(1801).\n\n              While Sheehan would have us turn back the clock and apply\n\nthe law as it existed prior to Toyota, he does not offer any\n\n                                         -8-\n\flegitimate argument why Toyota should not be applied to his case.\n\nSheehan does not dispute that Toyota was the \"law in effect\" at the\n\ntime his case was decided.   He does not distinguish Toyota in any\n\nsubstantive manner.   And further, he does not allege that the\n\ndistrict court's finding under Toyota, that his hypertension did\n\nnot constitute a \"disability\" as that term is defined by the ADA,\n\nis erroneous.\n\n          Instead Sheehan claims that the court's application of\n\nToyota violated his rights under the ex post facto provisions of\n\nthe United States Constitution and the Massachusetts General Laws.\n\nSheehan maintains that by applying the modifications and changes to\n\nthe ADA, propounded by cases such as Toyota, the district court has\n\nex post facto changed the definition and rights provided under the\n\nADA.\n\n          It is well settled that the prohibitions against ex post\n\nfacto laws apply only when the statute is criminal or is punitive\n\nin nature. Johannessen v. United States, 225 U.S. 227, 242 (1912);\n\nTaylor v. Rhode Island, 101 F.3d 780, 782-83 (1st Cir. 1996); In re\n\nDutil, 768 N.E.2d 1055, 1065 (Mass. 2002).        As there is no\n\nplausible argument that the application of Toyota constituted a\n\nretroactive \"punishment,\" Sheehan's ex post facto arguments are\n\nwithout merit.   The district court correctly applied Toyota to\n\nSheehan's pending claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f           In   his     brief   before     the        Court,     Sheehan   argued\n\nalternatively that even if the district court correctly applied\n\nToyota to his case, he in any event qualifies as disabled because\n\n(1) his hypertension substantially interfered with his ability to\n\nwork; and (2) the City demonstrated that it regarded Sheehan as\n\nbeing disabled when it had him involuntarily retired from the\n\npolice force.       Although we believe that these arguments simply\n\nconstitute further attempts to circumvent Toyota, we nevertheless\n\nbriefly dispatch these claims.\n\n           First, the district court correctly found that Sheehan\n\nfailed to demonstrate that his physical impairment rendered him\n\nincapable of performing a broad class of jobs.                 The Supreme Court\n\nhas repeatedly noted that even assuming that working is a major\n\nlife activity, a claimant must show an inability to work in a\n\n\"broad range of jobs,\" rather than one specific job.                   Sutton v.\n\nUnited Air Lines, 527 U.S. 471, 492 (1999).              Thus, for Sheehan to\n\nprevail on his claim that he is substantially limited in the major\n\nlife activity of working, he \"must be precluded from more than one\n\ntype of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice.                    If\n\njobs utilizing an individual's skills (but perhaps not his or her\n\nunique   talents)     are   available,    one    is    not     precluded   from    a\n\nsubstantial class of jobs.\"         Id.     Applying Sutton to Sheehan's\n\nclaim, it is enough to note that Sheehan continued to work for 24-\n\n32 hours per week as a security guard for us to determine that\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fSheehan's physical impairment simply did not preclude him from a\n\nsubstantial class of jobs.\n\n            Second, although the record clearly sets forth the City's\n\nbelief that Sheehan was incapable of working as a Gloucester police\n\nofficer due to his hypertension and risk of heart attack, this\n\nevidence is not sufficient for Sheehan to be considered disabled\n\nfor purposes of the ADA.         In order for us to find Sheehan disabled\n\nunder the \"regarded as\" prong of the ADA, Sheehan would have to\n\nshow that the City regarded his hypertension as rendering him\n\nunable to perform a broad range of jobs.             See Murphy 527 U.S. at\n\n522-23.     Sheehan has not presented any evidence supporting this\n\nlarger conclusion.\n\n            Finally, Sheehan argues that the district court erred\n\nwhen it     issued    its    opinion   without    providing   the   parties   an\n\nopportunity to amend or supplement the pleadings to make their case\n\nunder Toyota.      For our purposes, it makes no difference whether or\n\nnot Sheehan actually moved for leave to amend, as his argument will\n\nfail in any event.         The decision whether to allow motion for leave\n\nfalls     within     the    district    court's    discretion.      Manzoli   v.\n\nCommissioner, 904 F.2d 101, 103 (1st Cir. 1990), and there was no\n\nabuse of discretion here.\n\n            Judgment affirmed.         No costs are imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f",

A panel of three physicians found that Sheehan was physically incapacitated and substantially incapable of performing his particular job and that his incapacity was likely to be permanent. Based upon the medical panel's determination, PERA concluded that Sheehan qualified for accidental disability and recommended that he be retired from the Gloucester police force.

The City of Gloucester filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting, inter alia, that Sheehan was not \"disabled\" under the ADA, and alternatively, that they had offered Sheehan reasonable accommodation (by offering him a quieter night shift, which he declined).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on May 20, 1998. On March 27, 2000, we remanded the case for further consideration of Sheehan's ADA claim in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in <i>Murphy,</i> 527 U.S. 516, 119 S.Ct. 2133 (1999).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the case was pending before the district court, the Supreme Court decided <i>Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams,</i> 534 U.S. 184, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002), which addressed the question of what an ADA plaintiff must demonstrate to establish a substantial limitation in the specific major life activity of performing manual tasks. <i>Id.</i> at 691. Applying <i>Toyota</i> to Sheehan's ADA claim, the court found that Sheehan was not disabled as defined by the ADA because there was no evidence that Sheehan's hypertension rendered him unable to perform a sufficiently broad range of jobs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Sheehan,</i> 2002 WL 389297, at *5. Noting that after his retirement from the Gloucester police force Sheehan continued to work as a security guard for 24-32 hours per week, the court held that his ability to work had not been substantially limited by hypertension. <i>Id.</i> The court concluded, \"[a]ccordingly, I find that he fails &#8212; even under the most generous reading of recent Supreme Court caselaw &#8212; to satisfy the first prong of the ADA's definition of disability: he does not manifest a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also rejected Sheehan's claim that he satisfied the ADA's definition of disabled because he had a \"record\" of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court considered and rejected Sheehan's claim that he qualified as disabled under the ADA because the defendant <i>regarded</i> Sheehan as having a disability, as contemplated by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(C). The court held that although the City of Gloucester considered Sheehan to be unable to perform the job of a Gloucester police officer, that was not the same as showing that the defendants regarded him as disabled for purposes of the ADA. According to the court, the ADA's statutory classification, as construed by the Supreme Court \"requires that the defendant [has] regarded Sheehan's hypertension as rendering him unable to perform a broad range of jobs.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Murphy,</i> 527 U.S. at 521-23, 119 S.Ct. 2133). The court concluded that Sheehan had not produced any evidence in support of his argument that the City of Gloucester regarded him as unable to perform a broad range of jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheehan appealed the district court's entry of summary judgment. His primary argument on appeal is that the district court erroneously and unfairly applied the Supreme Court's recent <i>Toyota</i> decision to his case. As peculiar as this claim is, Sheehan's appeal is remarkable more for the issues it fails to raise, rather than for the issues actually raised: he does not dispute that under <i>Toyota,</i> his hypertension does not constitute a \"disability\" as that term is defined by the ADA. Instead, Sheehan's argument is that the district court took an unreasonable length of time to decide the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and, because of the court's delay, his case was decided under the guidelines provided in <i>Toyota</i> &#8212; which was decided in 2002 &#8212; rather than under <i>Murphy</i> &#8212; which was decided in 1999. According to Sheehan, if his case had been decided in a timely manner, he would have prevailed under <i>Murphy.</i> By subjecting him to the Court's decision in <i>Toyota,</i> Sheehan claims the delay resulted in an ex post facto application of law and denied him his due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Discussion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment for the City of Gloucester de novo. We affirm the district court's judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if the City of Gloucester is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheehan's contention is essentially that the district court's delay exposed him to unfavorable Supreme Court precedent which in turn compelled the district court to grant a motion of summary judgment against him. Although we understand Sheehan's frustration with the delay below, there is no merit to his claim that the timing of the district court's decision and its application of <i>Toyota</i> violated his constitutional rights. A party simply does not suffer any legally cognizable injury when a court applies the intervening precedent of a higher court which decides an issue against that party. After all, it is axiomatic that \"a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\" <i>Bradley v. Richmond Sch. Bd.,</i> 416 U.S. 696, 711-12, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is immaterial that the \"law in effect\" at the time the court renders its decision is an intervening change in the law, or that the law took effect after some delay in the district court. As Chief Justice Marshall articulated in 1801:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to enquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not. But if subsequent to the judgment and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied. If the law be constitutional ... I know of no court which can contest its obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Schooner Peggy,</i> 1 Cranch 103, 5 U.S. 103, 110, 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Sheehan would have us turn back the clock and apply the law as it existed prior to <i>Toyota,</i> he does not offer any legitimate argument why <i>Toyota</i> should not be applied to his case. Sheehan does not dispute that <i>Toyota</i> was the \"law in effect\" at the time his case was decided. He does not distinguish <i>Toyota</i> in any substantive manner. And further, he does not allege that the district court's finding under <i>Toyota,</i> that his hypertension did not constitute a \"disability\" as that term is defined by the ADA, is erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead Sheehan claims that the court's application of <i>Toyota</i> violated his rights under the ex post facto provisions of the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts General Laws. Sheehan maintains that by applying the modifications and changes to the ADA, propounded by cases such as <i>Toyota,</i> the district court has ex post facto changed the definition and rights provided under the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that the prohibitions against ex post facto laws apply only when the statute is criminal or is punitive in nature. <i>Johannessen v. United States,</i> 225 U.S. 227, 242, 32 S.Ct. 613, 56 L.Ed. 1066 (1912); <i>Taylor v. Rhode Island,</i> 101 F.3d 780, 782-83 (1st Cir.1996); <i>In re Dutil,</i> 437 Mass. 9, 768 N.E.2d 1055, 1065 (2002). As there is no plausible argument that the application of <i>Toyota</i> constituted a retroactive \"punishment,\" Sheehan's ex post facto arguments are without merit. The district court correctly applied <i>Toyota</i> to Sheehan's pending claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief before the Court, Sheehan argued alternatively that even if the district court correctly applied <i>Toyota</i> to his case, he in any event qualifies as disabled because (1) his hypertension substantially interfered with his ability to work; and (2) the City demonstrated that it regarded Sheehan as being disabled when it had him involuntarily retired from the police force. Although we believe that these arguments simply constitute further attempts to circumvent <i>Toyota,</i> we nevertheless briefly dispatch these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court correctly found that Sheehan failed to demonstrate that his physical impairment rendered him incapable of performing a broad class of jobs. The Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that even assuming that working is a major life activity, a claimant must show an inability to work in a \"broad range of jobs,\" rather than one specific job. <i>Sutton v. United Air Lines,</i> 527 U.S. 471, 492, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). Thus, for Sheehan to prevail on his claim that he is substantially limited in the major life activity of working, he \"must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs.\" <i>Id.</i> Applying <i>Sutton</i> to Sheehan's claim, it is enough to note that Sheehan continued to work for 24-32 hours per week as a security guard for us to determine that Sheehan's physical impairment simply did not preclude him from a substantial class of jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although the record clearly sets forth the City's belief that Sheehan was incapable of working as a Gloucester police officer due to his hypertension and risk of heart attack, this evidence is not sufficient for Sheehan to be considered disabled for purposes of the ADA. In order for us to find Sheehan disabled under the \"regarded as\" prong of the ADA, Sheehan would have to show that the City regarded his hypertension as rendering him unable to perform a broad range of jobs. <i>See Murphy</i> 527 U.S. at 522-23, 119 S.Ct. 2133. Sheehan has not presented any evidence supporting this larger conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Sheehan argues that the district court erred when it issued its opinion without providing the parties an opportunity to amend or supplement the pleadings to make their case under <i>Toyota.</i> For our purposes, it makes no difference whether or not Sheehan actually moved for leave to amend, as his argument will fail in any event. The decision whether to allow motion for leave falls within the district court's discretion. <i>Manzoli v. Commissioner,</i> 904 F.2d 101, 103 (1st Cir.1990), and there was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The sole issue on remand was the effect of the<i>Murphy</i> decision on Sheehan's ADA claim against the City of Gloucester.

According to the court, the ADA's statutory classification, as construed by the Supreme Court \"requires that the defendant [has] regarded Sheehan's hypertension as rendering him unable to perform a broad range of jobs.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Murphy,</i> 527 U.S. at 521-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118312\"><a href=\"/opinion/118312/murphy-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court concluded that Sheehan had not produced any evidence in support of his argument that the City of Gloucester regarded him as unable to perform a broad range of jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheehan appealed the district court's entry of summary judgment. His primary argument on appeal is that the district court erroneously and unfairly applied the Supreme Court's recent <i>Toyota</i> decision to his case. As peculiar as this claim is, Sheehan's appeal is remarkable more for the issues it fails to raise, rather than for the issues actually raised: he does not dispute that under <i>Toyota,</i> his hypertension does not constitute a \"disability\" as that term is defined by the ADA. Instead, Sheehan's argument is that the district court took an unreasonable length of time to decide the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and, because of the court's delay, his case was decided under the guidelines provided in <i>Toyota</i> &#8212; which was decided in 2002 &#8212; rather than under <i>Murphy</i> &#8212; which was decided in 1999. According to Sheehan, if his case had been decided in a timely manner, he would have prevailed under <i>Murphy.</i> By subjecting him to the Court's decision in <i>Toyota,</i> Sheehan claims the delay resulted in an ex post facto application of law and denied him his due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Discussion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment for the City of Gloucester de novo. We affirm the district court's judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if the City of Gloucester is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v.

Although we understand Sheehan's frustration with the delay below, there is no merit to his claim that the timing of the district court's decision and its application of <i>Toyota</i> violated his constitutional rights. A party simply does not suffer any legally cognizable injury when a court applies the intervening precedent of a higher court which decides an issue against that party. After all, it is axiomatic that \"a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\" <i>Bradley v.

As Chief Justice Marshall articulated in 1801:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to enquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not. But if subsequent to the judgment and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied. If the law be constitutional ... I know of no court which can contest its obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Sheehan does not dispute that <i>Toyota</i> was the \"law in effect\" at the time his case was decided. He does not distinguish <i>Toyota</i> in any substantive manner. And further, he does not allege that the district court's finding under <i>Toyota,</i> that his hypertension did not constitute a \"disability\" as that term is defined by the ADA, is erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead Sheehan claims that the court's application of <i>Toyota</i> violated his rights under the ex post facto provisions of the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts General Laws. Sheehan maintains that by applying the modifications and changes to the ADA, propounded by cases such as <i>Toyota,</i> the district court has ex post facto changed the definition and rights provided under the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that the prohibitions against ex post facto laws apply only when the statute is criminal or is punitive in nature. <i>Johannessen v.

As there is no plausible argument that the application of <i>Toyota</i> constituted a retroactive \"punishment,\" Sheehan's ex post facto arguments are without merit. The district court correctly applied <i>Toyota</i> to Sheehan's pending claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief before the Court, Sheehan argued alternatively that even if the district court correctly applied <i>Toyota</i> to his case, he in any event qualifies as disabled because (1) his hypertension substantially interfered with his ability to work; and (2) the City demonstrated that it regarded Sheehan as being disabled when it had him involuntarily retired from the police force. Although we believe that these arguments simply constitute further attempts to circumvent <i>Toyota,</i> we nevertheless briefly dispatch these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court correctly found that Sheehan failed to demonstrate that his physical impairment rendered him incapable of performing a broad class of jobs. The Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that even assuming that working is a major life activity, a claimant must show an inability to work in a \"broad range of jobs,\" rather than one specific job. <i>Sutton v. United Air Lines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 492, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span> (1999). Thus, for Sheehan to prevail on his claim that he is substantially limited in the major life activity of working, he \"must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs.\" <i>Id.</i> Applying <i>Sutton</i> to Sheehan's claim, it is enough to note that Sheehan continued to work for 24-32 hours per week as a security guard for us to determine that Sheehan's physical impairment simply did not preclude him from a substantial class of jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although the record clearly sets forth the City's belief that Sheehan was incapable of working as a Gloucester police officer due to his hypertension and risk of heart attack, this evidence is not sufficient for Sheehan to be considered disabled for purposes of the ADA. In order for us to find Sheehan disabled under the \"regarded as\" prong of the ADA, Sheehan would have to show that the City regarded his hypertension as rendering him unable to perform a broad range of jobs. <i>See Murphy</i> 527 U.S. at 522-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118312\"><a href=\"/opinion/118312/murphy-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2133</span></a></span>. Sheehan has not presented any evidence supporting this larger conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Sheehan argues that the district court erred when it issued its opinion without providing the parties an opportunity to amend or supplement the pleadings to make their case under <i>Toyota.</i> For our purposes, it makes no difference whether or not Sheehan actually moved for leave to amend, as his argument will fail in any event. The decision whether to allow motion for leave falls within the district court's discretion. <i>Manzoli v.
