R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-1069\n\n                             UNITED STATES,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                  HÉCTOR LUIS MÁRQUEZ-FIGUEROA,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Salvador E. Casellas, U. S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Carlos Gabriel Santiago-Morales on Anders brief.\n     Héctor Luis Márquez-Figueroa on brief pro se.\n\n\n                              July 6, 2006\n\f     Per Curiam. Defendant's counsel has submitted a brief under\n\nAnders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), which we construe as a\n\nmotion to withdraw.       Defendant has filed a pro se supplemental\n\nbrief.   After careful review of the record and these submissions,\n\nwe conclude that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issues.           We,\n\ntherefore, grant the motion to withdraw. We comment briefly on the\n\nissues raised in defendant's pro se brief.\n\n     Two of the issues were also raised by co-defendant Rafael\n\nPagán Santini and were fully disposed of in that appeal.             First,\n\ndefendant claims, as did Pagán, that the government violated his\n\ndue process rights when it obtained his conviction by knowingly\n\neliciting false testimony from Yamil Kourí Pérez regarding his\n\njailing in Cuba.      We held, \"There is no indication on the present\n\nfacts that the government's eliciting of the political prisoner\n\nstory involved the knowing use of false testimony.\"          United States\n\nv. Pagán-Santini, No. 03-2574, slip op. at 12 (1st Cir. June 14,\n\n2006).   That determination dooms defendant's claim.         We also find,\n\nas we did in Pagán, that there is no reasonable likelihood the\n\nallegedly false testimony affected the outcome.             As we noted in\n\nPagán, the cause of Kourí's jailing in Cuba \"was only marginally\n\nrelevant   to   his   credibility,\"   and    there   was   other   testimony\n\nsupporting defendant's conviction.          Second, defendant claims, as\n\ndid Pagán, that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to\n\ngive their requested \"missing witness\" instruction with respect to\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fDr. Gloria Ornelas.   We held there was no abuse of discretion.   Id.\n\nat 17.   And, as with Pagán, there is no indication that defendant\n\neven attempted to call Ornelas to testify, further undermining the\n\nrequested instruction.   Id.\n\n     Defendant also argues his indictment was invalid because it\n\nwas obtained by the use of testimony known by the prosecution to be\n\nfalse.   He acknowledges that the government \"has no obligation to\n\npresent exculpatory evidence\" to the grand jury, but argues that\n\nthe government \"provided half-truths as well as outright false\n\ntestimony\" to the grand jury because it did not present testimony\n\nby other witnesses \"which contradicted significant portions of the\n\ntestimony of the government's key witness, Dr. Yamil Kouri.\"      The\n\nfact that witnesses contradicted each other in certain respects\n\ndoes not indicate that the prosecution knowingly presented false\n\ntestimony to the grand jury.   United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23,\n\n38 (1st Cir. 2005).      Moreover, \"[a]n indictment returned by a\n\nlegally constituted and unbiased grand jury is not subject to\n\nchallenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of\n\ninadequate or incompetent evidence.\"    Id. (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n     Defendant next challenges the validity of his conviction by\n\narguing that the government \"watched in silence\" while Dr. Roberto\n\nUnda Gomez committed perjury.     Defendant does not identify the\n\nalleged perjury.   Presumably he is referring to Unda's admission\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fthat he accepted and spent a $5,000 cash bribe from Kourí, even\n\nthough Unda lied about the cash while testifying as a government\n\nwitness at Kourí's trial.         To the extent defendant is arguing that\n\nthe prosecution should have indicted Unda for perjury, the trial\n\ncourt corrected ruled that it is an issue for the prosecution to\n\ndecide.      United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693 (1974) (noting\n\nthat   \"Executive       Branch   has    exclusive    authority   and   absolute\n\ndiscretion to decide whether to prosecute a case\").                And to the\n\nextent defendant is arguing that the prosecution allowed the\n\npresentation of false testimony, his contention is belied by the\n\nrecord.\n\n       Defendant also argues that the government allowed Kourí to\n\ntestify falsely on certain matters.                He states that (1) Kourí\n\ntestified that defendant prepared the phony backdated contracts,\n\nwhile other witnesses testified otherwise, and (2) Kourí testified\n\nthat defendant prepared questions and answers for Héctor Ramírez\n\nLugo and helped him prepare for his testimony, while Ramírez\n\ntestified that Kourí wrote the questions and coached him.                    Even\n\ntaking defendant's characterization of the trial testimony as true,\n\nthe government is not prohibited from calling witnesses who present\n\nconflicting stories. Casas, 425 F.3d at 45. \"[S]uch conflicts are\n\na   matter    to   be    explored      on    cross-examination   ...   and    the\n\ncredibility of each account is for the jury to determine.\"                   Id.\n\nDefendant's counsel explored these inconsistencies at trial, and it\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fappears    defendant    was   aided,     rather    than   prejudiced,     by   the\n\nconflicting     testimony.        He   was    acquitted   of    the   substantive\n\noffenses of (1) making false declarations to the grand jury by\n\ndenying that he prepared the phony backdated contracts, and (2)\n\nsuborning Ramírez to commit perjury, thus demonstrating that the\n\ncontradictory testimony likely undermined Kourí's credibility on\n\nthese points.\n\n      Defendant next argues that his conspiracy conviction must be\n\nvacated because it is inconsistent with his acquittal of the\n\nsubstantive charges underlying the conspiracy.                  He contends that\n\nthe conspiracy and substantive counts \"are so interwoven with each\n\nother, as to establish one common set of facts applicable to all\n\ncounts.\"      (Emphasis omitted.)      This claim was properly rejected by\n\nthe   trial    court   in   denying    defendant's    motion     to   vacate   the\n\nverdict. As the lower court noted, in a single, multi-count trial,\n\nacquittal on one count does not preclude conviction on another\n\ncourt based upon the same evidence, as long as that evidence is\n\nlegally sufficient to support a finding of guilt on the count of\n\nconviction.      See United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 66 (1984).\n\nThere was ample evidence here to sustain the conspiracy conviction.\n\nMoreover, as the court noted, the jury's verdict is not logically\n\ninconsistent     because    the    offense     elements   are    different.     A\n\nreasonable jury could have found defendant guilty of willfully\n\nparticipating in the conspiracy without finding that defendant\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fcommitted any of the overt acts himself.\n\n     Defendant's   final   argument    is   that   the   court   erred   in\n\ndetermining the facts underlying the enhancement to his sentence.\n\n\"This argument is defeated by Booker, which permits enhancements\n\nbased on judge-found facts with advisory guidelines.\"              United\n\nStates v. Lata, 415 F.3d 107, 110 (1st Cir. 2005) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n     Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n     Defendant's second motion for the appointment of new counsel\n\nis denied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
