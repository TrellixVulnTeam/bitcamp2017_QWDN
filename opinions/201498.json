Appellant    Wright     Medical\n\nTechnology,    Inc.   (\"Wright     Medical\"),        a    Tennessee   corporation,\n\nappeals from the district court's refusal to enforce the forum\n\nselection clause in an arbitration provision that was part of a\n\ndistribution agreement (the \"Agreement\") between Wright Medical and\n\nOcean State Orthopedics, Inc. (\"OSO\"), a Rhode Island corporation.\n\nThe district court affirmed a bankruptcy court's order that the\n\narbitration of an underlying dispute regarding the Agreement take\n\nplace in Rhode Island, contrary to the Agreement's plain language\n\nthat the arbitration take place in Tennessee.\n\n            Because    appellees       have     failed       to   show    that   the\n\nenforcement of the forum selection clause is unreasonable under the\n\ncircumstances, we reverse the district court's decision.                     See The\n\nBremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972) (a \"forum\n\n[selection] clause should control absent a strong showing that it\n\nshould be set aside\"); Silva v. Encyclopedia Britannica Inc., 239\n\nF.3d 385,     386   (1st   Cir.   2001)      (\"The       prevailing   view   towards\n\ncontractual forum-selection clauses is that 'such clauses are prima\n\nfacie valid and should be enforced unless enforcement is shown by\n\nthe   resisting       party       to    be      \"unreasonable\"           under   the\n\ncircumstances.'\") (quoting The Bremen, 407 U.S. at 10).1\n\n\n1\n    Although we acknowledge the precedential validity of the\nprinciple last presented in Young v. Levanthal, 389 F.3d 1 (1st\nCir. 2004) (the applicability of a forum selection clause in an\narbitration agreement is a matter of procedure to be decided by the\narbitrator), and its probable applicability to the present\n\n                                       -2-\n\f                                      I\n\n          Wright    Medical    manufactures   and   distributes   medical\n\nsupplies from its principal place of business in Tennessee.            In\n\nSeptember 1995, Wright Medical entered into the Agreement with OSO,\n\nwhereby OSO became the exclusive distributor for Wright Medical\n\nproducts in Rhode Island.2 Appellee Gregory A. Mercurio, Jr.,\n\n(\"Mercurio\"), was the president of OSO and signed the Agreement on\n\nits behalf.\n\n          Article    14   of   the    Agreement,    entitled   \"Tennessee\n\nContract,\" provides that it \"shall be governed by and interpreted\n\nin accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee.\"        Article 16\n\nof the Agreement, entitled \"Arbitration of Disputes,\" is central to\n\nthis appeal.   It provides, in relevant part:\n\n          All disputes arising in connection with this\n          Agreement,   including   the   interpretation,\n          performance   or   non-performance   of   this\n          Agreement, shall be settled in Memphis,\n          Tennessee, USA, by arbitration in front of one\n\n\ncircumstances, this issue was not argued by the parties before\neither the bankruptcy or district courts, nor briefed or argued\nbefore us, and is thus deemed waived. See, e.g., García-Ayala v.\nLederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 645 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(holding that failure to brief an argument constitutes waiver)\n(internal citations omitted); Sprague v. Dir., Office of Workers'\nComp. Programs, U.S. Dept. of Labor, 688 F.2d 862, 869 (1st Cir.\n1982) (declining to reach and decide an issue that was not briefed\nor developed in oral argument by either party). See also Playboy\nEnters. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 906 F.2d 25, 40 (1st Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 498 U.S. 959 (1990) (\"An appellant waives any issue which\nit does not adequately raise in its initial brief.\").\n2\n   The Agreement excepted sales made to certain specified medical\nentities.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           Arbitrator.     Such   arbitrator   shall   be\n           appointed by agreement of each of the parties.\n           The arbitration procedures shall be held in\n           accordance with the rules and procedures of\n           The American Arbitration Association.\n\n           Any such arbitration shall be conducted in the\n           English language and shall be governed by laws\n           of the State of Tennessee. Judgment upon the\n           award may be entered in any court of competent\n           jurisdiction of the State of Tennessee.\n\n(emphasis supplied).\n\n           In 1996, for reasons that are in dispute,3 Wright Medical\n\nterminated the Agreement.       Thereafter, Wright Medical proceeded to\n\nappoint another distributor for its products in Rhode Island.\n\n           At some point not relevant to this appeal, Mercurio filed\n\na   voluntary   petition   in   bankruptcy   under    Chapter   11   of   the\n\nBankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq., and Peter J. Furness\n\n(\"Trustee\") became the trustee in bankruptcy.\n\n           Five   years    after   termination   of   the   Agreement,    the\n\nTrustee, on behalf of Mercurio, commenced the present suit as an\n\nadversary proceeding against Wright Medical in the U.S. Bankruptcy\n\nCourt for the District of Rhode Island.           The substance of this\n\naction concerns an alleged breach of contract by Wright Medical in\n\nterminating the Agreement.         Wright Medical moved the bankruptcy\n\n\n\n3\n    Wright Medical claims that, because Mercurio suffered from\nchronic immunodeficiency illness, he was impeded from being present\nduring surgical procedures, a situation which allegedly adversely\naffected Wright Medical's performance of the contract. In turn,\nMercurio contended that his presence in the operating room was not\na requirement under the Agreement.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcourt to compel arbitration of that controversy pursuant to the\n\nterms of the Agreement. The bankruptcy judge granted this request,\n\nbut ordered the arbitration to take place in Rhode Island rather\n\nthan in Tennessee as stipulated in the Agreement.\n\n             The record is fairly sparse as to the reasoning of the\n\nbankruptcy court in bypassing the Agreement's unambiguous language\n\nin this respect.        The order itself merely states in conclusory\n\nlanguage that the \"arbitration take place in Rhode Island.\"                  From\n\nthe transcript of the proceedings, however, it is apparent that the\n\nbankruptcy judge felt that there was a need to resolve the case\n\nwith some celerity, and that sending the matter to Tennessee for\n\narbitration, where none of the witnesses or evidence was present,\n\nwould militate against this goal.            Although we cannot fault the\n\njudge's laudable purpose, arbitration is a contractual matter in\n\nwhich, absent unusual circumstances not present in this case, the\n\nparties are entitled to the measure that they bargained for.\n\n             The bankruptcy judge's order was appealed to the district\n\ncourt, where the arguments followed suit to those made before the\n\nbankruptcy court.       Thus, the transcript of the proceedings shows\n\nthat   the   presence    of   witnesses    in    Rhode   Island    spurred    the\n\nTrustee's    argument,    and   in   turn,      the   district    judge's    oral\n\ndetermination affirming the bankruptcy court's order. The district\n\njudge found that the Trustee would be \"serious[ly] inconvenienc[ed]\n\nin litigating in Memphis, Tennessee,\" and \"effectively deprived of\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhis day in court,\" and thus designated Rhode Island as the place of\n\narbitration.     Cf. Arrow Plumbing & Heating, Inc. v. N. Am. Mech.\n\nServs. Corp., 810 F. Supp. 369, 372-73 (D.R.I. 1993).\n\n                                    II\n\n          The \"'heavy burden of proof' . . . required to set aside\n\n[a forum selection] clause on grounds of inconvenience,\" Carnival\n\nCruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 595 (1991), demands more\n\nof a litigant, however, than simply showing that another location\n\nwould be more convenient.       Were it otherwise, forum selection\n\nclauses would almost never be enforceable, for inconvenience to at\n\nleast one of the parties is an almost forgone conclusion when\n\ndealing with a provision that requires litigating away from one's\n\nhome turf.   Yet these clauses are standard fare in today's multi-\n\njurisdictional and international contractual relationships. At the\n\ntime these contracts are entered into, the parties routinely,\n\nvoluntarily, and knowingly agree to litigate and/or be bound by the\n\ndecision of fora located in distant locations.         Thus, something\n\nconsiderably more than the mere inconvenience of traveling to\n\nlitigate in a different, even faraway foreign jurisdiction, is\n\nrequired to overcome a contractual agreement to do so.           Royal Bed\n\n& Spring Co. v. Famossul Industria e Comercio de Moveis Ltda, 906\n\nF.2d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A] showing of inconvenience as to a\n\nforeign forum would not be enough to hold a forum-selection clause\n\nunenforceable,    especially   if   that   inconvenience   was   known   or\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fcontemplated by the parties at the time of their agreement.\"). The\n\ncost of such litigation alone cannot be enough to meet the \"heavy\n\nburden\" imposed upon the reneging party, who may now have second\n\nthoughts.      Cent. Contracting Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 367 F.2d\n\n341, 344 (3d Cir. 1966) (\"Mere inconvenience or additional expense\n\nis not the test of unreasonableness since it may be assumed that\n\nthe plaintiff received under the contract consideration for these\n\nthings.\").\n\n            The record in this case is bare of specific evidence\n\nregarding the extraordinary additional costs involved in litigating\n\nin Tennessee that were not foreseen by the contracting parties when\n\nthey    entered   into   the   Agreement.        OSO   accepted   some   costs\n\nbeforehand as a normal consequence of arbitrating in Tennessee.\n\nSee The Bremen, 407 U.S. at 17-18; Moses v. Business Card Exp.\n\nInc., 929 F.2d 1131, 1139 (6th Cir. 1991) (increased expenses are\n\n\"inherent in a forum selection clause\"). With a distributorship in\n\nRhode Island, the likelihood existed that witnesses and evidence\n\nwould be located there rather than in Tennessee.                OSO, however,\n\nchose to commit to Tennessee as the forum for dispute resolutions.\n\nThe Trustee stands in the debtor's shoes and is not entitled to\n\navoid    the    forum    selected   by     OSO   on    mere   allegations   of\n\ninconvenience.     See In re Díaz Contracting, Inc., 817 F.2d 1047,\n\n1052 (3d Cir. 1987) (\"[N]either the bankruptcy court's intimate\n\nknowledge of nor [defendant's] concessions concerning [plaintiff-\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdebtor's] precarious financial condition operates to discharge its\n\nburden    of    establishing   grave    inconvenience   under   The   Bremen\n\n[doctrine].\").\n\n               The district judge's bare conclusion that the Trustee\n\nwould be \"deprived of his day in court\" is unsupported by any\n\nevidence in the record.        The Trustee was required to provide a\n\nfactual record establishing the basis for his challenge to the\n\nforum selection clause.        Fireman's Fund Am. Ins. Cos. v. Puerto\n\nRican Forwarding Co., 492 F.2d 1294, 1297 (1st Cir. 1974) (a party\n\nmust present evidence to establish that a forum selection clause is\n\nunreasonable); Arrow Plumbing, 810 F. Supp. at 372-73 (enforcing a\n\nforum selection clause where party failed to provide factual\n\nsupport for the assertion that it would be unable to pursue the\n\nmatter in the selected forum).          We find no evidence in the record\n\nthat would support the conclusion that requiring the parties to\n\narbitrate their dispute in Tennessee would deprive the Trustee of\n\nhis day in court.\n\n               We finish with language which should have a familiar ring\n\nby now:\n\n               Courts must give effect to . . . freely\n               negotiated forum selection clauses . . . .\n               [The parties'] choice of arbitral forum should\n               have been honored by the district court.\n               Courts may not rewrite the parties' agreements\n               and compel arbitration of their dispute in a\n               forum which is not one of those enumerated in\n               an arbitration agreement's forum selection\n               clause.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fKKW Enters., Inc. v.

Were it otherwise, forum selection clauses would almost never be enforceable, for inconvenience to at least one of the parties is an almost forgone conclusion when dealing with a provision that requires litigating away from one's home turf. Yet these clauses are standard fare in today's multi-jurisdictional and international contractual relationships. At the time these contracts are entered into, the parties routinely, voluntarily, and knowingly agree to litigate and/or be bound by the decision of fora located in distant locations. Thus, something considerably more than the mere inconvenience of traveling to litigate in a different, even faraway foreign jurisdiction, is required to overcome a contractual agreement to do so. <i>Royal Bed &amp; Spring Co. v. Famossul Industria e Comercio de Moveis Ltda,</i> 906 F.2d 45, 49 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[A] showing of inconvenience as to a foreign forum would not be enough to hold a forum-selection clause unenforceable, especially if that inconvenience was known or contemplated by the parties at the time of their agreement.\"). The cost of such litigation alone cannot be enough to meet the \"heavy burden\" imposed upon the reneging party, who may now have second thoughts. <i>Cent. Contracting Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co.,</i> 367 F.2d 341, 344 (3d Cir.1966) (\"Mere inconvenience or additional expense is not the test of unreasonableness since it may be assumed that the plaintiff received under the contract consideration for these things.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case is bare of specific evidence regarding the extraordinary additional costs involved in litigating in Tennessee that were not foreseen by the contracting parties when they entered into the Agreement.

With a distributorship in Rhode Island, the likelihood existed that witnesses and evidence would be located there rather than in Tennessee. OSO, however, chose to commit to Tennessee as the forum for dispute resolutions. The Trustee stands in the debtor's shoes and is not entitled to avoid the forum selected by OSO on mere allegations of inconvenience. <i>See In re Diaz Contracting, Inc.,</i> 817 F.2d 1047, 1052 (3d Cir.1987) (\"[N]either the bankruptcy court's intimate knowledge of nor [defendant's] concessions concerning [plaintiff-debtor's] precarious financial condition operates to discharge its burden of establishing grave inconvenience under <i>The Bremen</i> [doctrine].\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's bare conclusion that the Trustee would be \"deprived of his day in court\" is unsupported by any evidence in the record.

Furness (\"Trustee\") became the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five years after termination of the Agreement, the Trustee, on behalf of Mercurio, commenced the present suit as an adversary proceeding against Wright Medical in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island. The substance of this action concerns an alleged breach of contract by Wright Medical in terminating the Agreement. Wright Medical moved the bankruptcy court to compel arbitration of that controversy pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The bankruptcy judge granted this request, but ordered the arbitration to take place in Rhode Island rather than in Tennessee as stipulated in the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is fairly sparse as to the reasoning of the bankruptcy court in bypassing the Agreement's unambiguous language in this respect. The order itself merely states in conclusory language that the \"arbitration take place in Rhode Island.\" From the transcript of the proceedings, however, it is apparent that the bankruptcy judge felt that there was a need to resolve the case with some celerity, and that sending the matter to Tennessee for arbitration, where none of the witnesses or evidence was present, would militate against this goal. Although we cannot fault the judge's laudable purpose, arbitration is a contractual matter in which, absent unusual circumstances not present in this case, the parties are entitled to the measure that they bargained for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy judge's order was appealed to the district court, where the arguments followed suit to those made before the bankruptcy court. Thus, the transcript of the proceedings shows that the presence of witnesses in Rhode Island spurred the Trustee's argument, and in turn, the district judge's oral determination affirming the bankruptcy court's order. The district judge found that the Trustee would be \"serious[ly] inconvenienc[ed] in litigating in Memphis, Tennessee,\" and \"effectively deprived of his day in court,\" and thus designated Rhode Island as the place of arbitration. <i>Cf.
