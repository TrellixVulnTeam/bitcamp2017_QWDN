Supreme Court decisions foreclose\n\nthis habeas corpus petition brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, which\n\nwas correctly denied by the district court.\n\n            Petitioner, Ernest Likely, was convicted on May 17, 2002\n\nin Massachusetts of distributing a controlled substance--cocaine--\n\nin violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 32A(c).        On appeal, he\n\nargued it was error to admit evidence that the substance was\n\ncocaine on the ground that the admission at trial of the chemical\n\ncertificate of analysis with an affidavit but without the testimony\n\nof the chemist violated his Confrontation Clause rights under the\n\nSixth Amendment.    He relied on the 2004 Supreme Court decision in\n\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), which had been issued\n\nwhile his appeal was pending.\n\n            The   state   Appeals     Court    rejected   his   federal\n\nconstitutional argument in a decision dated November 16, 2005, and\n\nso adjudicated the claim on its merits.            See Commonwealth v.\n\nLikely, 65 Mass. App. Ct. 1103 (2005).        On December 21, 2005, the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied Likely's petition for\n\nFurther Appellate Review.    See Commonwealth v. Likely, 840 N.E.2d\n\n56 (Mass. 2005).     That meant his conviction became final under\n\nstate law as of the date the state Appeals Court issued its\n\nrescript.    See Foxworth v. St. Amand, 929 N.E.2d 286, 291 (Mass.\n\n2010).\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           Some years later, the Supreme Court decided Melendez-Diaz\n\nv. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009).            Melendez-Diaz supported\n\nLikely's claim of a Confrontation Clause violation.                  It held that\n\nsuch analysts' affidavits were testimonial statements, the analysts\n\nwere witnesses for purposes of the Sixth Amendment, and that\n\nanalysts   therefore    had   to     be    available     for    examination    and\n\nconfrontation.1\n\n           If    Melendez-Diaz      had    been   decided      before   his   state\n\nconviction became final and if the state courts had properly been\n\npresented with a Melendez-Diaz claim, the state courts would have\n\nevaluated his claims under that standard.                See Foxworth v. St.\n\nAmand, 570 F.3d 414, 431 (1st Cir. 2009).           But the claim was not so\n\nanalyzed because Melendez-Diaz had not yet been decided.\n\n           The question on petition for habeas relief is a very\n\ndifferent one.      It is whether Likely has made out a claim for\n\nrelief under the federal habeas corpus act, as amended by the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, (AEDPA), 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254.      See Evans v. Thompson, 518 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)    cert.    denied,     129     S.    Ct.    255      (2008)      (upholding\n\nconstitutionality of AEDPA).\n\n           The pertinent text of AEDPA, at § 2254(d), states:\n\n           An application for a writ of habeas corpus on\n           behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\n\n\n     1\n          In 2010, the Supreme Court re-affirmed the reasoning of\nMelendez-Diaz in Briscoe v. Virginia, 130 S. Ct. 1316 (2010).\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           judgment of a State court shall not be granted\n           with respect to any claim that was adjudicated\n           on the merits in State court proceedings\n           unless the adjudication of the claim--\n           (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\n           to, or involved an unreasonable application\n           of, clearly established Federal law, as\n           determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n           States . . . .\n\nThe Supreme Court has firmly reiterated that this language \"bars\n\nrelitigation of any claim 'adjudicated on the merits' in state\n\ncourt subject only to the exceptions in §§ 2254(d)(1) and (d)(2).\"\n\nHarrington   v.   Richter,    131   S.   Ct.   770,   784   (2011)    (emphasis\n\nadded).2\n\n           This habeas petition fails for reasons having to do with\n\nthe clearly established federal law requirement.                     First, the\n\nrelevant period for determining what was \"clearly established\n\nFederal law\" ended here well before Melendez-Diaz was decided.3\n\nState court decisions under AEDPA are measured against the Supreme\n\nCourt's precedents that exist as of \"the time of the relevant\n\nstate-court decision.\"       Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 71 (2003)\n\n\n\n     2\n           The terms of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) are not at issue in\nthis case.\n     3\n          \"In most cases, . . . the date of finality of the state\ncourt conviction determines the time line to be used for\ndetermining what Supreme Court decisions comprise the corpus of\nthis 'clearly established Federal law.'\" Foxworth v. St. Amand,\n570 F.3d 414, 430 (1st Cir. 2009). There is some ambiguity, not\nrelevant here, as to whether the relevant time is at the time the\nstate court decision became final or as of the time of the state\ncourt decision. See id.; Brown v. Greiner, 409 F.3d 523, 533 n.3\n(2d Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     -4-\n\f(quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000)).                     In Cullen\n\nv. Pinholster, No. 09-1088, 2011 WL 1225705 (Apr. 4, 2011), the\n\nSupreme Court reaffirmed that review under § 2254(d)(1) \"requires\n\nan examination of the state-court decision at the time it was\n\nmade,\" id. at *8, and focuses on what a state court knew and did at\n\nthe time, id. at *10.          Cullen was, it is true, addressed to the\n\ndifferent question of whether the record under habeas review is\n\nlimited to the record \"in existence at that same time-- i.e., the\n\nrecord before the state court.\"                 Id. at *8.          But its logic\n\nreinforces our first point.\n\n              For purposes of this case, the more important point is\n\nthat during the relevant period, there was no \"clearly established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), as to whether admission of this\n\nevidence      without    the   chemist       being    a   witness    violated       the\n\nConfrontation        Clause.      If   the     federal    law   is    not    clearly\n\nestablished by the United States Supreme Court, then per force the\n\nstate       court   decision   cannot     be    either     contrary     to     or    an\n\nunreasonable        application   of   clearly       established     federal    law.4\n\nWright v. Van Patten, 552 U.S. 120, 126 (2008) (rejecting petition\n\nunder § 2254(d) because \"our cases give no clear answer to the\n\nquestion presented, let alone one in [petitioner's] favor\"); Carey\n\n\n        4\n          Thus, the habeas petition, filed in 2006, should not have\nbeen stayed until after the Supreme Court decided Melendez-Diaz,\nbut should have been dismissed.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fv. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70, 77 (2006) (\"Given the lack of holdings\n\nfrom this Court regarding the [issue presented by the habeas\n\npetition], it cannot be said that the state court 'unreasonabl[y]\n\nappli[ed]    clearly      established    Federal    law.'\"      (alteration      in\n\noriginal) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1))).\n\n            We reject Likely's argument that the analysis in Crawford\n\nclearly   established      that   the   Confrontation      Clause       barred   the\n\nprocedure used here in the state court.                  The phrase \"clearly\n\nestablished Federal law\" refers to holdings, as opposed to dicta,\n\nas of the time of the relevant state court decision.              Williams, 529\n\nU.S. at 412.      Crawford contained no holding that supports Likely's\n\npetition.    In Crawford, the Supreme Court specifically left \"for\n\nanother day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of\n\n'testimonial,'\" and acknowledged that \"our refusal to articulate a\n\ncomprehensive      definition     in    this   case      will    cause     interim\n\nuncertainty.\"       Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68 & n.10.                     The issue\n\npresented    in    this   case    was   exactly    one   of     those    areas   of\n\nuncertainty.      When the Supreme Court itself acknowledges that an\n\nissue has not been resolved and is fairly debatable, there is no\n\nargument left that the state court's decision is contrary to or an\n\nunreasonable application of \"clearly established\" Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.   Foxworth, 570 F.3d at 436; L'Abbe v. DiPaolo, 311 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f93, 98 (1st Cir. 2002).5      Indeed, certiorari    was granted in\n\nMelendez-Diaz precisely so the Supreme Court could resolve the\n\nquestion presented.   On March 17, 2008, the Supreme Court granted\n\ncertiorari in Melendez-Diaz to review the following question:\n\n          Whether a state forensic analyst's laboratory\n          report prepared for use in a criminal\n          prosecution is \"testimonial\" evidence subject\n          to the demands of the Confrontation Clause as\n          set forth in Crawford . . . .\n\nPetition for Writ of Certiori, Melendez-Diaz, No. 07-591 (Oct. 26,\n\n2007), 2007 WL 3252033, at *i; Melendez-Diaz, 552 U.S. 1256 (2008).\n\n          To put it differently, Crawford did not clearly establish\n\nthe answer to the question.     The conclusion that there was no\n\npertinent clearly established law on the issue is itself not close,\n\nand that disposes of this habeas petition.\n\n          The denial of the petition is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n           In Foxworth, we observed that the \"closeness of the\nquestion left open [by then existing Supreme Court precedent] is\nemphasized by the fact that in the subsequent [Supreme Court\ndecision], four justices dissented.\" Foxworth, 570 F.3d at 436\nn.8.   Likewise, that four justices dissented in Melendez-Diaz\nreaffirms that Crawford had not resolved the question Melendez-Diaz\naddressed.\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

That meant his conviction became final under state law as of the date the state Appeals Court issued its rescript. <i>See </i><i>Foxworth v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span> (2009). <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> supported Likely's claim of a Confrontation Clause violation. It held that such analysts' affidavits were testimonial statements, the analysts were witnesses for purposes of the Sixth Amendment, and that analysts therefore had to be available for examination and confrontation.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>If <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> had been decided before his state conviction became final and if the state courts had properly been presented with a <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> claim, the state courts would have evaluated his claims under that standard. <i>See </i><i>Foxworth v.

But the claim was not so analyzed because <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> had not yet been decided.</p>\n<p>The question on petition for habeas relief is a very different one. It is whether Likely has made out a claim for relief under the federal habeas corpus act, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. § 2254. <i>See </i><i>Evans v.

But its logic reinforces our first point.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this case, the more important point is that during the relevant period, there was no \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), as to whether admission of this evidence without the chemist being a witness violated the Confrontation Clause. If the federal law is not clearly established by the United States Supreme Court, then per force the state court decision cannot be either contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Wright v.

The phrase \"clearly established Federal law\" refers to holdings, as opposed to dicta, as of the time of the relevant state court decision. <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 412, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When the Supreme Court itself acknowledges that an issue has not been resolved and is fairly debatable, there is no argument left that the state court's decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of \"clearly established\" Supreme Court precedent. <i>Foxworth,</i> 570 F.3d at 436; <i>L'Abbe v.
