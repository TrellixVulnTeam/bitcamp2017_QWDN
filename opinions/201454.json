Warren on brief for petitioner.\n     Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nTerri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, and Anthony W. Norwood, Senior Litigation Counsel,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n                        February 17, 2005\n\f              SELYA,    Circuit   Judge.       The   petitioner,     Alexander\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez, seeks judicial review of a final order of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his application for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal. He asserts that the Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) ignored the weight of the evidence and, therefore,\n\nincorrectly denied his asylum and withholding of removal claims.\n\nHe further asserts that the BIA erred in not reversing the IJ's\n\nrulings.      Discerning no error, we deny the petition.\n\n              The petitioner, a Guatemalan national, was born in San\n\nSebastian, Guatemala, during the spring of 1984.                When he was\n\nseventeen, he fled to the United States, allegedly because of his\n\nfear of violence in his homeland, and entered illegally.               Shortly\n\nafter his arrival, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(INS)1 detained him and initiated removal proceedings.\n\n              At a hearing on July 31, 2002, the petitioner conceded\n\nremovability     and     cross-applied   for   asylum   and   withholding   of\n\nremoval.      On December 16, 2002, the IJ conducted a hearing on the\n\nmerits   of    the     petitioner's   application.      Testifying    at   that\n\nhearing, the petitioner described the two incidents upon which he\n\npremised his claims for asylum and withholding of removal.                   We\n\nparaphrase his description of those incidents.\n\n\n     1\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471,\n116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)),\nabolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of\nHomeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 13 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          The first incident occurred on the evening of April 25,\n\n1990 (when the petitioner was six years old).            At that time, he\n\nresided with his parents and siblings in San Sebastian. Two masked\n\nguerrillas sought to recruit his father into an insurgent movement\n\nthat was attempting to overthrow the Guatemalan government.            When\n\nthe petitioner's father declined the invitation, the guerrillas\n\nassaulted him in the family's home.      The petitioner hid under the\n\nbed as the violence unfolded and heard the guerrillas tell his\n\nfather that they would return for him in two days.\n\n          As matters turned out, the guerrillas never returned.\n\nFor aught that appears in the record, the described incident marked\n\nthe first and last time that those particular guerrillas, or any\n\nother political insurgents, ever approached or threatened the\n\npetitioner's father.   The petitioner himself was never menaced by\n\nthe guerrillas at any time before, during, or after the incident.\n\n          The second incident occurred six years later (when the\n\npetitioner was twelve).      He testified that, around that time, the\n\narmy killed a number of innocent people in the region in which he\n\nlived, suspecting that they were supporting the guerrillas.            While\n\nthe petitioner did not actually witness any of the killings, he\n\nheard about them from his neighbors.\n\n          The   petitioner    alleged   that,   as   a   result   of   these\n\nincidents, he fears that he will become a target of the guerrillas'\n\nanti-government hostility should he return to his homeland or,\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\falternatively, that the government will mistake him for a guerrilla\n\n(or one sympathetic to the guerrillas) and put him in harm's way.\n\n           In a bench decision, the IJ deemed the petitioner's\n\ntestimony credible but determined that he was not entitled to\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, or the privilege of voluntary\n\ndeparture.    On a first-tier appeal, the BIA summarily affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision.    This timely petition for judicial review followed.\n\n             We turn directly to the petitioner's claim that the BIA\n\nerred in upholding the denial of his application for asylum. After\n\nall, a claim for withholding of removal places a more stringent\n\nburden of proof on an alien than does a counterpart claim for\n\nasylum.   See Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nsee also Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 n.5 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"The threshold of eligibility for withholding of removal is higher\n\nthan the threshold of eligibility for asylum.\") (citing cases).\n\nBecause of that disparity, the BIA's rejection of the petitioner's\n\nasylum claim, if sustainable, sounds the death knell for his\n\ncounterpart claim for withholding of removal.     Hence, we begin —\n\nand end — with the asylum claim.2\n\n             In immigration cases, a highly deferential standard of\n\nreview obtains with respect to fact-driven issues.     Putting aside\n\n\n\n     2\n      Before us, the petitioner contests the adverse rulings on\nasylum and withholding of removal, but not the adverse ruling on\nvoluntary departure. Consequently, the voluntary departure issue\nis waived. See Makhoul, 387 F.3d at 80.\n\n                                 -4-\n\ferrors of law — and none appears here — an inquiring court must\n\nuphold the BIA's resolution of such issues so long as its decision\n\nis supported by substantial evidence in the record.   INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 4-5.\n\nThis means that the BIA's determination must stand unless \"any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); accord Laurent v. Ashcroft,\n\n359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that reversal requires\n\nthat the evidence of record \"point[] unerringly in the opposite\n\ndirection\").\n\n             In order to establish an entitlement to asylum, the\n\npetitioner must show that he is a refugee within the meaning of the\n\nimmigration laws. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).\n\nA refugee is a person who cannot or will not return to his country\n\nof nationality \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\"     8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A).     To be cognizable, persecution — whether past\n\npersecution (which creates a presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution) or feared future persecution — must be on\n\naccount of one of the five statutory grounds.         Mukamusoni v.\n\nAshcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004); Makhoul, 387 F.3d at\n\n79.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f           Here, the IJ (and, by extension, the BIA) found that the\n\npetitioner had failed to make out a meritorious case under either\n\ndoctrinal strand.      We concur in that assessment.\n\n           The argument on past persecution need not detain us. The\n\npetitioner contends that he suffered past persecution when, as a\n\nyoung boy, he witnessed guerrillas assaulting his father, and\n\nagain,   six   years   later,   when   the   army   began   killing   people\n\nsuspected of insurgency. Both halves of this bifurcated contention\n\nlack force.\n\n           Although the boundaries of past persecution are somewhat\n\nflexible, they must encompass more than threats to life and freedom\n\nbut less than mere harassment or annoyance.         Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 569-70 (1st Cir. 1999) (collecting cases).              In this\n\ninstance, neither of the two incidents described by the petitioner\n\npasses through the appropriate legal screen. We take each incident\n\nin turn.\n\n           As to the first incident, we acknowledge that watching\n\none's father beaten may be a horrific experience for a young child\n\n— but not all horrific experiences translate into persecution. The\n\nassault was a single incident, remote in time.              It was neither\n\ndirected at the petitioner — he himself was never attacked (or even\n\nthreatened, for that matter) — nor based on some characteristic\n\nthat he and his father shared.           Despite their braggadocio, the\n\nguerrillas never returned. And, finally, there were no discernible\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fsequelae.    Viewed against this backdrop, the IJ's (and the BIA's)\n\ndetermination that this isolated violence against a family member\n\nwas insufficient to establish past persecution must stand.                        See\n\nQuevedo v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that\n\n\"a single incident of persecution, of a short duration . . . not\n\nfollowed by acts of recrimination\" was insufficient to establish\n\npast persecution).\n\n            The second incident is no more compelling.                 Although the\n\narmy apparently undertook a spate of violent activities in the\n\nregion in which the petitioner lived, that violence was confined to\n\na   particular   temporal     period     (long      since     past).      There    is\n\nabsolutely no proof that the petitioner or his family had done\n\nanything to earn the army's enmity, that they were perceived in\n\nthat light, or that they were targets of this episodic violence\n\n(let alone victims of it).         The fact that the family lived in an\n\narea that was, for a time, wracked by internecine warfare is not\n\nequivalent to undergoing persecution. See, e.g., Ravindran v. INS,\n\n976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that, in general,\n\n\"evidence   of   widespread      violence    and     human     rights    violations\n\naffecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution\");\n\naccord Debab v. INS, 163 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            Of   course,    an   alien    who      is    unable   to    show   past\n\npersecution may nonetheless establish eligibility for asylum if he\n\ncan   demonstrate    a     well-founded      fear       of   future    persecution.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.        To this end, the alien must \"not\n\nonly harbor a genuine fear of future persecution, but also must\n\nestablish an objectively reasonable basis for that fear.\" Laurent,\n\n359 F.3d at 65.       Here, the objective component is lacking.\n\n           The petitioner insists that he has a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution because his father's political views will be\n\nimputed   to   him.      The   evidence,   however,   does   not   show   an\n\nobjectively reasonable basis for this fear.       See, e.g., Ravindran,\n\n976 F.2d at 759 (concluding that fear of persecution based on a\n\nrelative's political activities was not reasonable where there was\n\nno evidence establishing that the petitioner was ever persecuted as\n\na result of those activities or that \"the government has a general\n\npractice of persecuting extended family members\").           The record is\n\nopaque as to the actual views held by the petitioner's father, and\n\nin all events, the petitioner's father has been living peacefully\n\nin San Sebastian during the entire time that the petitioner has\n\nbeen in the United States.       If the holder of a political opinion is\n\nnot a target of ongoing persecution, it strains credulity that one\n\nto whom that opinion might be imputed should be regarded as\n\nobjectively at risk.\n\n           If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\npolitical situation in Guatemala has changed dramatically since the\n\npetitioner's childhood.        Peace accords were signed in 1996 between\n\nthe Guatemalan government and the insurgent forces, who had rallied\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcollectively     under     the   banner      of   the   Guatemalan      National\n\nRevolutionary Unity (GNRU).           These accords put an end to the\n\ncountry's civil war.           The petitioner testified that since the\n\nsigning of the peace accords neither he nor any of his relatives\n\nhas been approached in a bellicose manner or threatened in any way.\n\nThat is particularly significant because the petitioner's parents\n\nand six siblings still reside in Guatemala (most of them in San\n\nSebastian).     Collectively, these facts undermine the objective\n\nreasonableness    of     any   fear   of   future   persecution       should   the\n\npetitioner return to Guatemala.             See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at\n\n573.\n\n             The petitioner has a fallback position.            He asserts that\n\nhe fears future persecution because he falls into a social group\n\nknown to oppose the guerrillas.            This assertion is hopeless.         For\n\none thing, there is no probative evidence in the record suggesting\n\nthat   the   guerrillas    remain     active.       According    to   the   State\n\nDepartment's 2002 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for\n\nGuatemala, the GNRU has become part of the establishment.                   It is\n\ncurrently recognized as a bona fide political party and, in the\n\n1999 general elections, won nine seats in the national legislature.\n\nFor another thing, there is no evidence that the petitioner is, or\n\nis regarded in Guatemala as, a person who opposes the guerrillas.\n\nLast — but not least — a person who claims a fear of persecution on\n\naccount of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwith particularity the social group with which he claims to be\n\nassociated.    See Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 5-6.   The petitioner has\n\nfailed to meet this benchmark.3\n\n          We need go no further.      This is a case in which the\n\npetitioner's testimony, taken at face value, does not objectively\n\nsupport, let alone compel, a conclusion contrary to that reached by\n\nthe agency.    It follows that substantial evidence underpins the\n\nrejection of the petitioner's claims that he experienced past\n\npersecution and that he harbors a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.   This finding dooms not only the petitioner's quest\n\nfor asylum but also his quest for withholding of removal.\n\n\n\n\n          The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      To the extent that the petitioner is suggesting that he\nbelongs to the social group of young men who oppose the guerrillas,\nthe record is devoid of any evidence indicating that the petitioner\nbelonged to or was affiliated with any organized social group. The\nrecord is similarly devoid of any evidence that young men in\ngeneral have reason to fear persecution in Guatemala.\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

Despite their braggadocio, the guerrillas never returned. And, finally, there were no discernible sequelae. Viewed against this backdrop, the IJ's (and the BIA's) determination that this isolated violence against a family member was insufficient to establish past persecution must stand. <i>See Quevedo v. Ashcroft,</i> 336 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that \"a single incident of persecution, of a short duration ... not followed by acts of recrimination\" was insufficient to establish past persecution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second incident is no more compelling.

The fact that the family lived in an area that was, for a time, wracked by internecine warfare is not equivalent to undergoing persecution. <i>See, e.g., Ravindran v.

The record is opaque as to the <i>actual</i> views held by the petitioner's father, and in all events, the petitioner's father has been living peacefully in San Sebastian during the entire time that the petitioner has been in the United States.

Peace accords were signed in 1996 between the Guatemalan government and the insurgent forces, who had rallied collectively under the banner of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (GNRU). These accords put an end to the country's civil war. The petitioner testified that since the signing of the peace accords neither he nor any of his relatives has been approached in a bellicose manner or threatened in any way. That is particularly significant because the petitioner's parents and six siblings still reside in Guatemala (most of them in San Sebastian). Collectively, these facts undermine the objective reasonableness of any fear of future persecution should the petitioner return to Guatemala. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner has a fallback position. He asserts that he fears future persecution because he falls into a social group known to oppose the guerrillas. This assertion is hopeless. For one thing, there is no probative evidence in the record suggesting that the guerrillas remain active. According to the State Department's 2002 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Guatemala, the GNRU has become part of the establishment. It is currently recognized as a bona fide political party and, in the 1999 general elections, won nine seats in the national legislature. For another thing, there is no evidence that the petitioner is, or is regarded in Guatemala as, a person who opposes the guerrillas. Last &#8212; but not least &#8212; a person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated. <i>See Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 5-6.

He asserts that the Immigration Judge (IJ) ignored the weight of the evidence and, therefore, incorrectly denied his asylum and withholding of removal claims. He further asserts that the BIA erred in not reversing the IJ's rulings. Discerning no error, we deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, a Guatemalan national, was born in San Sebastian, Guatemala, during the spring of 1984. When he was seventeen, he fled to the United States, allegedly because of his fear of violence in his homeland, and entered illegally. Shortly after his arrival, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> detained him and initiated removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on July 31, 2002, the petitioner conceded removability and cross-applied for asylum and withholding of removal. On December 16, 2002, the IJ conducted a hearing on the merits of the petitioner's application. Testifying at that hearing, the petitioner described the two incidents upon which he premised his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. We paraphrase his description of those incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first incident occurred on the evening of April 25, 1990 (when the petitioner was six years old). At that time, he resided with his parents and siblings in San Sebastian. Two masked guerrillas sought to recruit his father into an insurgent movement that was attempting to overthrow the Guatemalan government. When the petitioner's father declined the invitation, the guerrillas assaulted him in the family's home. The petitioner hid under the bed as the violence unfolded and heard the guerrillas tell his father that they would return for him in two days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As matters turned out, the guerrillas never returned. For aught that appears in the record, the described incident marked the first and last time that those particular guerrillas, or any other political insurgents, ever approached or threatened the petitioner's father. The petitioner himself was never menaced by the guerrillas at any time before, during, or after the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second incident occurred six years later (when the petitioner was twelve). He testified that, around that time, the army killed a number of innocent people in the region in which he lived, suspecting that they were supporting the guerrillas. While the petitioner did not actually witness any of the killings, he heard about them from his neighbors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner alleged that, as a result of these incidents, he fears that he will become a target of the guerrillas' anti-government hostility should he return to his homeland or, alternatively, that the government will mistake him for a guerrilla (or one sympathetic to the guerrillas) and put him in harm's way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a bench decision, the IJ deemed the petitioner's testimony credible but determined that he was not entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or the privilege of voluntary departure. On a first-tier appeal, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision. This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn directly to the petitioner's claim that the BIA erred in upholding the denial of his application for asylum. After all, a claim for withholding of removal places a more stringent burden of proof on an alien than does a counterpart claim for asylum. <i>See Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also Da Silva v.

Because of that disparity, the BIA's rejection of the petitioner's asylum claim, if sustainable, sounds the death knell for his counterpart claim for withholding of removal. Hence, we begin &#8212; and end &#8212; with the asylum claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In immigration cases, a highly deferential standard of review obtains with respect to fact-driven issues.

Last &#8212; but not least &#8212; a person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated. <i>See Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 5-6.

This is a case in which the petitioner's testimony, taken at face value, does not objectively support, let alone compel, a conclusion contrary to that reached by the agency. It follows that substantial evidence underpins the rejection of the petitioner's claims that he experienced past persecution and that he harbors a well-founded fear of future persecution. This finding dooms not only the petitioner's quest for asylum but also his quest for withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for judicial review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.
