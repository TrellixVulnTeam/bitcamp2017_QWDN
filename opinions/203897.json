Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                    Torruella, Boudin and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Jay Odunukwe on brief pro se.\n     Donn A. Randall, Carol E. Kamm, Matthew A. Kane and Bulkley,\nRichardson and Gelinas, LLP on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               July 1, 2009\n\f          Per Curiam.   Jay Odunukwe appeals from a jury verdict in\n\nfavor of Bank of America (\"the Bank\").   We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          Odunukwe, an African-American originally from Nigeria,\n\nsued the Bank after employees of its Medway, Massachusetts branch\n\nrefused to cash a check that he presented. Odunukwe testified that\n\nhe was not a client of the Bank and that, in attempting to cash the\n\ncheck drawn on his sister's Bank account, he provided two forms of\n\nidentification: a Massachusetts driver's license and an American\n\nExpress credit card.     Bank employees testified that Odunukwe\n\npresented only one acceptable form of identification, i.e., the\n\ndriver's license, and that Odunukwe never proffered any credit\n\ncard.\n\n          After Odunukwe was refused service at the Bank's Medway\n\nbranch, Odunukwe drove to the Bank's Medfield branch, where he was\n\npermitted to cash the check.   According to Odunukwe, he presented\n\nthe same two forms of identification that had been rejected at the\n\nMedway branch.   Bank employees from the Medfield branch testified\n\nthat he presented only his driver's license and no credit card, but\n\nthat they had made a one-time-only exception to the otherwise\n\napplicable \"two forms of identification\" policy, based, in part, on\n\nthe fact that Odunukwe was also depositing a check into his\n\nsister's account that was greater in value than the $1100 check he\n\nwas cashing -- a fact not related by Odunukwe to the Medway branch.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fAfter a one day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the\n\nBank.\n\n                                        II.\n\nA.             The Batson challenge\n\n               Odunukwe alleges that the district court failed to handle\n\nthe Bank's peremptory challenges in accordance with Batson v.\n\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).               See also Edmonson v. Leesville\n\nConcrete Co., 500 U.S. 614 (1991) (applying Batson to a civil\n\ncase).    He complains that the Bank used all three of its peremptory\n\nchallenges to strike black jurors and that the court wrongfully\n\nfailed to require the Bank to proffer a race-neutral explanation\n\nfor its strikes.\n\n               A Batson challenge, such as the one alleged here based on\n\nrace, involves a three step process.            First, the one contesting a\n\nperemptory strike must make a prima facie showing that the strike\n\nis driven by racial discrimination.           Once a prima facie showing is\n\nmade,    the    author    of   the   strike   must   proffer   a   race-neutral\n\nexplanation      for     the   challenge.     Finally,   if    a   race-neutral\n\nexplanation is provided, the court must decide whether the one\n\ncontesting the peremptory strike has carried the ultimate burden of\n\nproving        that    the     strike    constituted     purposeful      racial\n\ndiscrimination.        See United States v. Bergodere, 40 F.3d 512, 515\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (outlining the framework for a Batson challenge).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f           The district court made a determination that Odunukwe\n\nfailed to make a prima facie showing that the Bank's strikes were\n\ndriven by racial animus. Contrary to Odunukwe's contention that we\n\napply de novo review to the district court's determination that\n\nOdunukwe failed to make a prima facie case, the caselaw holds that\n\nwe review that determination for clear error.                      United States v.\n\nGirouard, 521 F.3d 110, 112 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v.\n\nBergodere, 40 F.3d at 516.           There was no clear error here.\n\n           First    of       all,    counsel's       objections     to    the    Bank's\n\nperemptory challenges were rather tentative as counsel himself was\n\nuncertain if the jurors that the Bank was striking were persons of\n\ncolor and his objections were phrased as contingencies.                         Despite\n\nthe tentativeness of Odunukwe's claim that the jurors whom the Bank\n\nwas   striking   were    persons         of   color,      the   court    attempted    to\n\ndetermine the racial make-up of the jury venire by asking the law\n\nclerk to report.\n\n           Based    on   this       report,     it   appears     that    five   of   the\n\nfourteen jurors in the venire -- Jurors 1, 2, 4, 11, and 12 -- were\n\npersons of color.      On appeal, Odunukwe argues that all three of the\n\nBank's peremptory challenges -- to Jurors 1, 7, and 12 -- struck\n\npersons of color.        However, there is no record support for the\n\nclaim   that   Juror     7    was    a   person      of   color.        Juror   11   was\n\nsubsequently excused on hardship grounds and was replaced by a\n\njuror of unknown race.         The two remaining persons of color in the\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fvenire -- Jurors 2 and 4 -- served on Odunukwe's petit jury of\n\neight (contrary to Odunukwe's claim on appeal that only one person\n\nof color served on his jury).\n\n           Moreover, one who objects to peremptory strikes ought to\n\n\"come forward with facts, not just numbers alone,\" United States v.\n\nBergodere, 40 F.3d at 516 (citation omitted).                    Odunukwe relies\n\nsolely on the number of strikes against persons of color and \"[i]t\n\nis at least questionable whether this evidence is adequate to\n\nsurpass the prima facie hurdle.\"             Aspen v. Bissonnette, 480 F.3d\n\n571, 577 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 330 (2007).\n\n           In reviewing a district court's finding that no prima\n\nfacie   case   was     made,   we   look   at   all   relevant    circumstances,\n\nexamining both numeric and non-numeric forms of evidence.                        Id.\n\n\"Relevant numeric evidence includes the percentage of strikes\n\ndirected against members of a particular group, the percentage of\n\na particular group removed from the venire by the challenged\n\nstrikes,   and     a    comparison    of    the   percentage      of   a    group's\n\nrepresentation in the venire to its representation on the jury.\"\n\nId.   (citations       omitted).     It    appears    that   persons       of   color\n\nconstituted approximately 35.7% (5 out of 14) of the total venire;\n\nthe Bank used 66% of its strikes (2 out of 3) to strike persons of\n\ncolor and these two strikes constituted 40% (2 out of 5) of the\n\ntotal number of         persons of color in the venire.                After the\n\nconclusion of the Bank's peremptory strikes, three persons of color\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fwere seated in Odunukwe's petit jury of eight, resulting in a petit\n\njury with a 37.5% minority composition, higher than the minority\n\npercentage existing in the original venire.             Even after Juror 11\n\nwas excused based on hardship, an exclusion which cannot be charged\n\nto any peremptory challenge, the minority percentage of Odunukwe's\n\npetit jury was at least two of eight jurors (since the race of the\n\nreplacement juror is unknown) or 25%.\n\n           We also consider non-numeric forms of evidence, including\n\n\"the striking party's questions and statements during the voir\n\ndire, whether the striking party had unused peremptory challenges\n\nthrough which he or she could have eliminated more members of the\n\nallegedly targeted group, apparent non-discriminatory reasons for\n\nstriking potential jurors based on their voir dire answers, and\n\nwhether   similarly   situated   jurors    from   outside    the   allegedly\n\ntargeted group were permitted to serve.\"          Id.     Odunukwe does not\n\npoint to any non-numeric form of evidence in support of his Batson\n\nclaim.    For example, the Bank's counsel made no statements during\n\nvoir dire suggesting any improper racially-based motive for its\n\nchallenges.    The absence of any non-numeric evidence supports the\n\nconclusion    that   no   discriminatory   motive   infected    the   Bank's\n\nperemptory challenges.\n\n           Accordingly, the district court's determination that\n\nOdunukwe failed to make a prima facie showing that the Bank's\n\nstrikes were driven by racial animus was not clearly erroneous. To\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe extent that Odunukwe's brief suggests that the Bank also\n\nimpermissibly used its peremptory challenges to strike male jurors,\n\nthere was no challenge below to any of the strikes based on gender.\n\nTherefore, we need not address this rather vaporous contention\n\nsporadically threaded through his brief.\n\nB.           Jury Instruction\n\n             Odunukwe contends that the district court misinstructed\n\nthe jury on his § 1981 claim.            We reject this contention.\n\n             Section    1981   prohibits       racial   discrimination        in    the\n\nmaking and enforcing of contracts.              Our caselaw recites that \"[t]o\n\nstate a claim under this statute, a plaintiff must show (1) that he\n\nis    a   member   of   a    racial   minority,       (2)    that    the   defendant\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of his race, and (3) that\n\nthe   discrimination        implicated    one    or   more    of    the    activities\n\nenumerated in the statute.\"           Garrett v. Tandy Corp., 295 F.3d 94,\n\n98 (1st Cir. 2002).         The only contested issue here is the second\n\nelement, i.e., whether the Bank discriminated against Odunukwe on\n\nthe basis of his race.\n\n             On appeal, Odunukwe argues, as he did below, that the\n\ndistrict court failed to recognize that the elements to prove a\n\ncase of racial discrimination involving a commercial establishment\n\ndiffer from the elements of a claim of racial discrimination in\n\nemployment     matters.         The    jury      instruction        reflected      this\n\nmisunderstanding, says Odunukwe.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f              He relies on the 6th Circuit's opinion in Christian v.\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 252 F.3d 862 (6th Cir. 2001), which, in\n\nturn, relied on the district court case of Callwood v. Dave &\n\nBuster's, Inc., 98 F.Supp.2d 694 (D. Md. 2000). In cases involving\n\nallegations of racial discrimination in the services received from\n\na commercial establishment, these courts allow for alternative\n\nmethods to demonstrate an inference of intentional discrimination,\n\neither   by    identifying   similarly    situated   persons    outside   the\n\nprotected class who were not denied the right to enter into or\n\nenjoy the benefits or privileges of the contractual relationship\n\nor, in a situation in which a plaintiff cannot identify other\n\nsimilarly     situated   persons,   by    demonstrating   the   receipt    of\n\n\"hostile services.\"\n\n              At trial, Odunukwe proposed that the court instruct the\n\njury, inter alia, that Odunukwe is an African-American of Nigerian\n\ndescent, who alleged that he received check cashing services in a\n\nmarkedly hostile manner that was objectively discriminatory and\n\nthat a reasonable person would find objectively discriminatory. He\n\nproposed that the court instruct the jury that \"liability will\n\nattach when a plaintiff receives services in a markedly hostile\n\nmanner and in a manner which a reasonable person would find\n\nobjectively discriminatory.\"        The court rejected the request and\n\ncharged the jury in accordance with our own caselaw.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           On appeal, Odunukwe reiterates that the district court\n\nerred in failing to give his requested instruction.            There was no\n\nerror.\n\n           Apart from the 6th Circuit, it does not appear that any\n\nother circuit court has embraced the Christian court's expanded\n\nformulation.    Although we have referenced the Christian court's\n\n\"receipt of hostile services\" formulation, we have not adopted it.\n\nSee Garrett v. Tandy Corp., 295 F.3d at 102 n.5 (describing the\n\nformulation as a \"broader construction\"); see also Lizardo v.\n\nDenny's Inc., 270 F.3d 94, 102 n.2 (2d Cir. 2001) (concluding that\n\n\"[e]ven   if   we   were   inclined   to    employ   the   markedly   hostile\n\nstandard\", the conduct alleged in the case did not meet it).               We\n\nalso note that the basis for the 6th Circuit's formulation arose\n\nfrom the District Court of Maryland's Callwood decision and that\n\nthe 4th Circuit (of which the Callwood court is a part) has not yet\n\nadopted the standard set forth in Callwood.                See Williams v.\n\nStaples, Inc., 372 F.3d 662, 668 n.5 (4th Cir. 2004).\n\n           Moreover, Odunukwe's requested instruction was not even\n\na correct recitation of the 6th Circuit's caselaw.            A party is not\n\nentitled to a jury instruction that does not accurately reflect the\n\ncorrect legal standard.       John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-\n\nConant Properties, Inc., 322 F.3d 26, 48 (1st Cir. 2003). Contrary\n\nto Odunukwe's proposed instruction that \"liability will attach when\n\na plaintiff receives services in a markedly hostile manner and in\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fa   manner    which   a   reasonable    person    would     find    objectively\n\ndiscriminatory,\" in fact, the Christian court's development of a\n\n\"receipt of hostile services\" element relates to the establishment\n\nof a prima facie case of discrimination.               The establishment of a\n\nprima facie case does not result, as Odunukwe would have it, in\n\nliability attaching, but only in the creation of a rebuttable\n\npresumption of discrimination.         See United States Postal Serv. Bd.\n\nv. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 714 (1983); see also            Keck v. Graham Hotel\n\nSys., Inc., 566 F.3d 634, 641 (6th Cir. 2009) (the finding of\n\nreceipt of services in a \"markedly hostile\" manner permits an\n\ninference of discrimination sufficient to state a prima facie\n\ncase).   Both the Christian and the Callwood courts were addressing\n\nthe test for establishing a prima facie test of discrimination.\n\nNeither were addressing jury instructions.\n\n             As the district court correctly realized, since the case\n\nwas past the prima facie stage, it made little sense to instruct\n\nthe jury to first decide whether there was enough evidence to get\n\nto them since the correct determination after the case was in their\n\nhands was whether there was enough evidence to succeed on the §\n\n1981 claim.       The Christian court, itself, reiterated that the\n\nelements representing the plaintiff's ultimate burden of proof in\n\na § 1981 action are those which our caselaw has described and which\n\nthe district court in this case incorporated in its instructions.\n\nChristian    v.   Wal-Mart   Stores,    Inc.,    252    F.3d   at   868,   871-72\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f(reciting that the test that the district court had used in\n\ngranting summary judgment -- (1) the plaintiff is a member of a\n\nracial minority, (2) that the defendant intended to discriminate\n\nagainst him on the basis of race, and (3) the discrimination\n\nconcerned one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute\n\n-- although not appropriate for use as a prima facie standard,\n\ncorrectly represented the plaintiff's ultimate burden of proof).\n\n              On appeal, we confine our review of a jury's verdict to\n\nthe ultimate question of discrimination.                   See Sanchez v. Puerto\n\nRico    Oil    Co.,    37    F.3d    712,     720   (1st   Cir.    1994)   (when   a\n\ndiscrimination case \"has been submitted to a jury, the burden-\n\nshifting framework has fulfilled its function, and backtracking\n\nserves no useful purpose.              To focus on the existence of a prima\n\nfacie case after a discrimination case has been fully tried on the\n\nmerits is to 'unnecessarily evade[] the ultimate question of\n\ndiscrimination        vel    non.'\")    (citation     omitted).        Indeed,    the\n\nChristian court, itself, acknowledges that, after a case has been\n\nfully tried on the merits, a reviewing court should not focus on\n\nthe elements of a prima facie case, but rather should assess the\n\nultimate question of discrimination. Christian v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc.,   266    F.3d    407    (6th     Cir.   2001)   (order      on   petition   for\n\nrehearing).\n\n              In a passing reference, both in response to the jury\n\ninstructions given and in his appellate brief, Odunukwe also\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fcontends that the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework does\n\nnot apply to a § 1981 claim.      This contention is both wrong and odd\n\nin that the Christian decision on which Odunukwe so heavily relies,\n\nitself, refutes this contention.          Christian v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc., 252 F.3d at 868 (reciting that to prevail in a claim of\n\nracial   discrimination   under    §   1981   relying   on   circumstantial\n\nevidence, a plaintiff must meet the McDonnell Douglas burden-\n\nshifting standard of proof); see also Prescott v. Higgins, 538 F.3d\n\n32, 40 (1st Cir. 2008) (same).\n\nC.         Exclusion of MCAD report\n\n           Prior to filing suit, Odunukwe filed a complaint with the\n\nMassachusetts   Commission   Against      Discrimination     (MCAD).   That\n\ncomplaint resulted in the production of an MCAD \"Investigation Fact\n\nSheet\" (\"IFS\"), which summarized Odunukwe's claim that, despite\n\nproffering two forms of acceptable identification in accordance\n\nwith Bank policy, his identification forms were rejected and he was\n\nnot permitted to cash the check.        The IFS contained the following\n\n\"Conclusion.\"\n\n                Based on the foregoing findings, one\n                could form the reasonable belief\n                that the Respondent discriminated\n                against the Complainant by denying\n                him   services    because   of   his\n                race/color.     Genuine issues of\n                material fact are present which are\n                reserved    for    public   hearing.\n                Therefore, a find[ing] of probable\n                cause is warranted.\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f          The district court granted the Bank's motion to exclude\n\nthis IFS from the trial on the ground that its prejudicial value\n\noutweighed any probative value.   The Bank had pointed out that the\n\nIFS stated only a conclusory probability of discrimination, had not\n\nset forth the Bank's counter evidence, and was simply a finding\n\nthat sufficient facts existed to allow Odunukwe to proceed with his\n\ndiscrimination claim in the MCAD.\n\n          On appeal, Odunukwe argues that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in the exclusion.

Odunukwe testified that\n\nhe was not a client of the Bank and that, in attempting to cash the\n\ncheck drawn on his sister's Bank account, he provided two forms of\n\nidentification: a Massachusetts driver's license and an American\n\nExpress credit card.     Bank employees testified that Odunukwe\n\npresented only one acceptable form of identification, i.e., the\n\ndriver's license, and that Odunukwe never proffered any credit\n\ncard.\n\n          After Odunukwe was refused service at the Bank's Medway\n\nbranch, Odunukwe drove to the Bank's Medfield branch, where he was\n\npermitted to cash the check.

Bank employees from the Medfield branch testified\n\nthat he presented only his driver's license and no credit card, but\n\nthat they had made a one-time-only exception to the otherwise\n\napplicable \"two forms of identification\" policy, based, in part, on\n\nthe fact that Odunukwe was also depositing a check into his\n\nsister's account that was greater in value than the $1100 check he\n\nwas cashing -- a fact not related by Odunukwe to the Medway branch.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fAfter a one day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the\n\nBank.\n\n                                        II.\n\nA.

First, the one contesting a\n\nperemptory strike must make a prima facie showing that the strike\n\nis driven by racial discrimination.           Once a prima facie showing is\n\nmade,    the    author    of   the   strike   must   proffer   a   race-neutral\n\nexplanation      for     the   challenge.     Finally,   if    a   race-neutral\n\nexplanation is provided, the court must decide whether the one\n\ncontesting the peremptory strike has carried the ultimate burden of\n\nproving        that    the     strike    constituted     purposeful      racial\n\ndiscrimination.

There was no clear error here.\n\n           First    of       all,    counsel's       objections     to    the    Bank's\n\nperemptory challenges were rather tentative as counsel himself was\n\nuncertain if the jurors that the Bank was striking were persons of\n\ncolor and his objections were phrased as contingencies.                         Despite\n\nthe tentativeness of Odunukwe's claim that the jurors whom the Bank\n\nwas   striking   were    persons         of   color,      the   court    attempted    to\n\ndetermine the racial make-up of the jury venire by asking the law\n\nclerk to report.\n\n           Based    on   this       report,     it   appears     that    five   of   the\n\nfourteen jurors in the venire -- Jurors 1, 2, 4, 11, and 12 -- were\n\npersons of color.      On appeal, Odunukwe argues that all three of the\n\nBank's peremptory challenges -- to Jurors 1, 7, and 12 -- struck\n\npersons of color.        However, there is no record support for the\n\nclaim   that   Juror     7    was    a   person      of   color.        Juror   11   was\n\nsubsequently excused on hardship grounds and was replaced by a\n\njuror of unknown race.

Odunukwe relies\n\nsolely on the number of strikes against persons of color and \"[i]t\n\nis at least questionable whether this evidence is adequate to\n\nsurpass the prima facie hurdle.\"             Aspen v.

Id.\n\n\"Relevant numeric evidence includes the percentage of strikes\n\ndirected against members of a particular group, the percentage of\n\na particular group removed from the venire by the challenged\n\nstrikes,   and     a    comparison    of    the   percentage      of   a    group's\n\nrepresentation in the venire to its representation on the jury.\"\n\nId.   (citations       omitted).     It    appears    that   persons       of   color\n\nconstituted approximately 35.7% (5 out of 14) of the total venire;\n\nthe Bank used 66% of its strikes (2 out of 3) to strike persons of\n\ncolor and these two strikes constituted 40% (2 out of 5) of the\n\ntotal number of         persons of color in the venire.                After the\n\nconclusion of the Bank's peremptory strikes, three persons of color\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fwere seated in Odunukwe's petit jury of eight, resulting in a petit\n\njury with a 37.5% minority composition, higher than the minority\n\npercentage existing in the original venire.             Even after Juror 11\n\nwas excused based on hardship, an exclusion which cannot be charged\n\nto any peremptory challenge, the minority percentage of Odunukwe's\n\npetit jury was at least two of eight jurors (since the race of the\n\nreplacement juror is unknown) or 25%.\n\n           We also consider non-numeric forms of evidence, including\n\n\"the striking party's questions and statements during the voir\n\ndire, whether the striking party had unused peremptory challenges\n\nthrough which he or she could have eliminated more members of the\n\nallegedly targeted group, apparent non-discriminatory reasons for\n\nstriking potential jurors based on their voir dire answers, and\n\nwhether   similarly   situated   jurors    from   outside    the   allegedly\n\ntargeted group were permitted to serve.\"          Id.     Odunukwe does not\n\npoint to any non-numeric form of evidence in support of his Batson\n\nclaim.    For example, the Bank's counsel made no statements during\n\nvoir dire suggesting any improper racially-based motive for its\n\nchallenges.    The absence of any non-numeric evidence supports the\n\nconclusion    that   no   discriminatory   motive   infected    the   Bank's\n\nperemptory challenges.\n\n           Accordingly, the district court's determination that\n\nOdunukwe failed to make a prima facie showing that the Bank's\n\nstrikes were driven by racial animus was not clearly erroneous. To\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe extent that Odunukwe's brief suggests that the Bank also\n\nimpermissibly used its peremptory challenges to strike male jurors,\n\nthere was no challenge below to any of the strikes based on gender.\n\nTherefore, we need not address this rather vaporous contention\n\nsporadically threaded through his brief.\n\nB.           Jury Instruction\n\n             Odunukwe contends that the district court misinstructed\n\nthe jury on his § 1981 claim.            We reject this contention.\n\n             Section    1981   prohibits       racial   discrimination        in    the\n\nmaking and enforcing of contracts.              Our caselaw recites that \"[t]o\n\nstate a claim under this statute, a plaintiff must show (1) that he\n\nis    a   member   of   a    racial   minority,       (2)    that    the   defendant\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of his race, and (3) that\n\nthe   discrimination        implicated    one    or   more    of    the    activities\n\nenumerated in the statute.\"           Garrett v.

The only contested issue here is the second\n\nelement, i.e., whether the Bank discriminated against Odunukwe on\n\nthe basis of his race.\n\n             On appeal, Odunukwe argues, as he did below, that the\n\ndistrict court failed to recognize that the elements to prove a\n\ncase of racial discrimination involving a commercial establishment\n\ndiffer from the elements of a claim of racial discrimination in\n\nemployment     matters.

He\n\nproposed that the court instruct the jury that \"liability will\n\nattach when a plaintiff receives services in a markedly hostile\n\nmanner and in a manner which a reasonable person would find\n\nobjectively discriminatory.\"        The court rejected the request and\n\ncharged the jury in accordance with our own caselaw.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           On appeal, Odunukwe reiterates that the district court\n\nerred in failing to give his requested instruction.

This contention is both wrong and odd\n\nin that the Christian decision on which Odunukwe so heavily relies,\n\nitself, refutes this contention.          Christian v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc., 252 F.3d at 868 (reciting that to prevail in a claim of\n\nracial   discrimination   under    §   1981   relying   on   circumstantial\n\nevidence, a plaintiff must meet the McDonnell Douglas burden-\n\nshifting standard of proof); see also Prescott v.

Exclusion of MCAD report\n\n           Prior to filing suit, Odunukwe filed a complaint with the\n\nMassachusetts   Commission   Against      Discrimination     (MCAD).   That\n\ncomplaint resulted in the production of an MCAD \"Investigation Fact\n\nSheet\" (\"IFS\"), which summarized Odunukwe's claim that, despite\n\nproffering two forms of acceptable identification in accordance\n\nwith Bank policy, his identification forms were rejected and he was\n\nnot permitted to cash the check.        The IFS contained the following\n\n\"Conclusion.\"\n\n                Based on the foregoing findings, one\n                could form the reasonable belief\n                that the Respondent discriminated\n                against the Complainant by denying\n                him   services    because   of   his\n                race/color.     Genuine issues of\n                material fact are present which are\n                reserved    for    public   hearing.\n                Therefore, a find[ing] of probable\n                cause is warranted.\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f          The district court granted the Bank's motion to exclude\n\nthis IFS from the trial on the ground that its prejudicial value\n\noutweighed any probative value.   The Bank had pointed out that the\n\nIFS stated only a conclusory probability of discrimination, had not\n\nset forth the Bank's counter evidence, and was simply a finding\n\nthat sufficient facts existed to allow Odunukwe to proceed with his\n\ndiscrimination claim in the MCAD.\n\n          On appeal, Odunukwe argues that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in the exclusion. There was no abuse of discretion. See\n\nPatten v.
