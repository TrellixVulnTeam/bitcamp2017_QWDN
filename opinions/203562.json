Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Howard, Baldock,* and Selya,\n\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jack P.

This is a diversity case, and the\n\nparties agree that Massachusetts law controls. The hostilities\n\ninitially took the form of a garden-variety insurance dispute — but\n\nthe case has now morphed into an interesting question about the\n\npreclusive    effect   (if   any)   of      a    declaratory     judgment    on   a\n\nsubsequent action for damages arising out of the same nucleus of\n\noperative facts.       The district court determined that a final\n\njudgment in the original declaratory action barred the maintenance\n\nof the subsequent suit.      After careful consideration, we reverse.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We glean the facts from the state court's rescript in the\n\noriginal declaratory judgment action and the plaintiffs' complaint\n\nin the subsequent suit.\n\n           The plaintiffs, appellants in this court, are a quartet\n\nof   affiliated   companies:   Andrew       Robinson    International,       Inc.,\n\nAndrew Robinson International Financial Services, Inc., Andrew\n\nRobinson   International     Insurance          Brokerage,    Inc.,   and   Andrew\n\nRobinson     International     Risk      Management          Consultants,     Inc.\n\n(collectively, Robinson).      The four corporations shared an office\n\ncondominium at 165 Friend St., Boston, Massachusetts. On April 25,\n\n2003, the occupant of a neighboring unit negligently discharged\n\nlead-laden dust into Robinson's unit.             The incident proved costly:\n\nRobinson's premises were badly damaged and Robinson was forced to\n\nrelocate until the clean-up was complete.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f           In due course, Robinson filed a first-party claim against\n\nits insurer, Hartford Fire Insurance Co.          Hartford denied the\n\nclaim, asserting that the dust constituted a pollutant under its\n\npolicy (which, subject to certain exceptions, excluded coverage\n\n\"for loss or damage caused by or resulting from the discharge,\n\ndispersal, seepage, migration, release, or escape\" of pollutants).1\n\nRobinson   responded   by   demanding   an   affirmation   of    coverage.\n\nHartford demurred.\n\n           At that juncture, Robinson repaired to the state superior\n\ncourt in search of a declaration of the parties' rights and\n\nliabilities under the insurance policy. Following some preliminary\n\nskirmishing (not relevant here), the court, acting on cross-motions\n\nfor summary judgment, concluded that lead-laden dust released\n\nwithin a commercial building did not constitute pollution and,\n\ntherefore, did not trigger the policy exclusion.                See Andrew\n\nRobinson Int'l, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. (Robinson I), No.\n\n03-1353, 2006 WL 1537382, at *13 (Mass. Super. Ct. Feb. 6, 2006).\n\nHartford allowed the declaratory judgment to become final and paid\n\nRobinson's first-party claim.\n\n           Approximately eight months later, the other shoe dropped:\n\nRobinson again sued Hartford in the state court.                This time,\n\nRobinson alleged that Hartford's stonewalling constituted an unfair\n\n\n     1\n       The policy defined a pollutant as \"any solid, liquid,\ngaseous, or thermal irritant or containment, including smoke,\nvapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals, and waste.\"\n\n                                  -3-\n\fand deceptive trade practice in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n93A, § 11, and prayed for treble damages and attorneys' fees.\n\nHartford removed the case to the federal district court based on\n\ndiversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the\n\nrequisite amount.     See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a), 1441.\n\n            Hartford's next step was to move for dismissal under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that the\n\nchapter 93A suit was foreclosed by principles of res judicata.\n\nRobinson opposed the motion, arguing among other things that the\n\nMassachusetts courts would not give preclusive effect as to claims\n\nnot actually litigated in a previous declaratory judgment action.2\n\nThe district court sided with Hartford and dismissed the action.\n\nSee Andrew Robinson Int'l, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. (Robinson\n\nII), 533 F. Supp. 2d 218, 222 (D. Mass. 2008).                 This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.   PERTINENT LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\n            We    begin   with    a    précis      of   some    pertinent        legal\n\nprinciples.\n\n            Our   standard   of   review      is    familiar:     we    evaluate    a\n\ndismissal for failure to state a claim de novo, accepting all well-\n\npleaded   facts    delineated     in    the     complaint      and     drawing    all\n\n\n\n      2\n       Neither side asked the district court to certify the\ncontrolling question to the Supreme Judicial Court. See S.J.C.\nRule 1:03. On appeal, the parties have continued to eschew any\nsuch request.\n\n                                       -4-\n\freasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the party contesting\n\ndismissal.      Palmer v. Champion Mortg., 465 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Jorge v. Rumsfeld, 404 F.3d 556, 559 (1st Cir. 2005).                  The\n\nmotion   will    be   granted   unless   the    facts,    evaluated    in    that\n\nplaintiff-friendly      manner,   contain      enough    meat   to   support    a\n\nreasonable expectation that an actionable claim may exist.                   Bell\n\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombley, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007); Morales-Tañón\n\nv. P.R. Elec. Power Auth., 524 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           In passing upon a motion to dismiss for failure to state\n\na claim, the reviewing court's focus on the well-pleaded facts is\n\nmore expansive than might first be thought.               Within that rubric,\n\nthe court may consider matters fairly incorporated within the\n\ncomplaint and matters susceptible of judicial notice.                       In re\n\nColonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThus, where the motion to dismiss is premised on a defense of res\n\njudicata — as is true in the case at hand — the court may take into\n\naccount the record in the original action.               See, e.g., R.G. Fin.\n\nCorp. v. Vergara-Núñez, 446 F.3d 178, 183-84 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nBoateng v. InterAm. Univ., 210 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           The fact that this is a diversity case adds another\n\ndimension to our task.      A federal court sitting in diversity must\n\napply state law to determine the preclusive effect of an earlier\n\nstate court judgment.      Kathios v. Gen. Motors Corp., 862 F.2d 944,\n\n946 (1st Cir. 1988).       In the first instance, this means that the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\ffederal court looks to pronouncements of the highest court of the\n\nstate.   Id.    When that court has not spoken directly to an issue,\n\nthe federal court must make an informed prophecy as to the state\n\ncourt's likely stance.         See Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l. Inc., 81\n\nF.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              In undertaking this inquiry, the federal court may draw\n\nupon a variety of sources that may reasonably be thought to\n\ninfluence the state court's decisional calculus.                 While these\n\nsources are not arranged in any rigid hierarchy, the federal court\n\nas a general matter will start by inspecting analogous decisions of\n\nthe state's highest court; then consider decisions of the lower\n\ncourts   of    that   state;    then   examine   the   precedents      in   other\n\njurisdictions; then survey the collected wisdom found in learned\n\ntreatises; and finally, mull any relevant policy rationales.                See,\n\ne.g., Blinzler, 81 F.3d at 1151; Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d\n\n731, 734-35 (1st Cir. 1990).           In conducting this tamisage, the\n\nfederal court should pay particular attention to those sources that\n\nthe state's highest court has endorsed in the past and to public\n\npolicy   considerations        mentioned     approvingly   in   that    court's\n\ndecisions.     See Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 736 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).     In the final analysis, the federal court's objective\n\nis not to choose the legal path that it deems best but, rather, to\n\npredict what path the state court would most likely travel.                   See\n\nKathios, 862 F.2d at 946.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Massachusetts recognizes two distinct types of preclusion\n\narising out of the maintenance of prior litigation: res judicata\n\n(claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (issue preclusion). See\n\nKobrin v. Bd. of Regist. in Med., 832 N.E.2d 628, 634 (Mass. 2005).\n\nBoth the parties and the district court have analyzed this case in\n\nterms of res judicata.   We follow their lead.\n\n           Res judicata \"makes a valid final judgment conclusive on\n\nthe parties . . . and prevents relitigation of all matters that\n\nwere or could have been adjudicated in the action.\"        Id. This\n\ndoctrine is sometimes known as \"merger and bar,\" nomenclature that\n\nemphasizes the doctrine's role in guarding against claim-splitting.\n\nSee Restatement (Second) of Judgments §§ 18, 19, 24 (1982).\n\n           The operation of res judicata requires the presence of\n\nthree elements: \"(1) the identity or privity of the parties to the\n\npresent and prior actions, (2) identity of the cause of action, and\n\n(3) prior final judgment on the merits.\"     Kobrin, 832 N.E.2d at\n\n634; see McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    Here, the parties are the same and the first action\n\nunarguably ended in a final judgment.      That leaves the second\n\nelement; Robinson's opening gambit is to suggest that the two\n\nactions it brought against Hartford fail to present the requisite\n\nidentity of causes of action.   We test that thesis.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f           Massachusetts deems causes of action identical for claim\n\npreclusion purposes if they \"grow[] out of the same transaction,\n\nact, or agreement, and seek[] redress for the same wrong.\" Brunson\n\nv. Wall, 541 N.E.2d 338, 341 n.9 (Mass. 1989) (quoting Mackintosh\n\nv. Chambers, 190 N.E. 38, 39 (Mass. 1934)).           Viewed against this\n\nbackdrop, Robinson's premise is that because a violation of chapter\n\n93A creates \"an action independent from the [insurance] contract,\"\n\nSwartz v. Travelers Indem. Co., 740 N.E.2d 1039, 1043 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 2001), an action based on chapter 93A addresses a separate\n\n\"wrong.\"\n\n           Massachusetts   law    is   inhospitable    to   this   premise.\n\nDiscrete theories of liability may constitute identical causes of\n\naction for claim preclusion purposes if they are based on the same\n\nnucleus of operative facts.      See Fassas v. First Bank & Trust Co.,\n\n233 N.E.2d 924, 925 (Mass. 1968) (explaining that \"[t]he statement\n\nof a different form of liability is not a different cause of\n\naction, provided it grows out of the same transaction\") (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted); see also Isaac v. Schwartz,\n\n706 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1983) (interpreting Massachusetts law to\n\nhold that \"new legal theories, embodied in different statutes and\n\ndifferent common law doctrines,\" are still identical causes of\n\naction for claim preclusion purposes).\n\n           A review of the complaints in Robinson I and Robinson II,\n\nrespectively, confirms that both actions arise from the same\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\ftransaction.      In the former — the declaratory action — Robinson\n\ncomplained that Hartford wrongfully denied coverage for its first-\n\nparty insurance claim.       In the latter — the chapter 93A action —\n\nRobinson complained that the same denial of coverage, undertaken\n\n\"willfully and in bad faith,\" amounted to an unfair trade practice.\n\nIt   is   thus   apparent   that   both    suits    arose   out    of   the   same\n\nunderlying transaction.      Consequently, the stated causes of action\n\nare identical within the meaning of the res judicata doctrine.\n\n            This conclusion means that the customary ingredients for\n\nthe application of res judicata are present.                Robinson concedes\n\nthat, under those principles, a final judgment ordinarily bars\n\nlitigation of unmade claims arising out of the same transaction.\n\nThe question, however, is whether some special rule obtains here.\n\n            Robinson proposes such a special rule.                It asseverates\n\nthat normal principles of claim preclusion will not operate when\n\nthe original action was for declaratory relief.               The linchpin of\n\nthis asseveration is section 33 of the Restatement (Second) of\n\nJudgments, which states that \"[a] valid and final judgment in an\n\naction brought to declare rights or other legal relations of the\n\nparties is conclusive in a subsequent action between them as to the\n\nmatters declared.\"      Under this prescription, \"[a] plaintiff who\n\nwins a declaratory judgment may go on to seek further relief, even\n\nin an action on the same claim which prompted the action for a\n\ndeclaratory judgment.\"        Id. cmt. c.          \"This further relief may\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\finclude damages which had accrued at the time the declaratory\n\nrelief was sought; it is irrelevant that the further relief could\n\nhave been requested initially.\"    Id.\n\n           The   serial   Restatements   are   much-respected   works.\n\nNevertheless, the question is not one of doctrine in the abstract\n\nbut, rather, whether the highest court of Massachusetts — the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (SJC) — would follow the rule of the Second\n\nRestatement; that is, whether the SJC would hold that a valid and\n\nfinal judgment in an action brought to declare rights precludes the\n\nmaintenance of a subsequent action between the same parties arising\n\nout of the same transaction and involving an issue that could have\n\nbeen, but was not, actually litigated in the former action.\n\n           The district court concluded that we had answered this\n\nquestion in Pasterczyk v. Fair, 819 F.2d 12 (1st Cir. 1987).      The\n\ncourt read Pasterczyk for the proposition that, notwithstanding the\n\ndeclaratory nature of an original action, the usual rules of claim\n\npreclusion apply.    See Robinson II, 533 F. Supp. 2d at 221.       We\n\nthink that the district court read Pasterczyk too aggressively.\n\n           In that case, the plaintiff had filed a Massachusetts\n\nstate court action seeking recalculation of his sentence.       819 at\n\n13.   After obtaining a declaration that he was entitled to credit\n\nfor time served in other states, the plaintiff won his release.\n\nId.   He then sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for damages in consequence\n\nof his overlong incarceration. To escape a res judicata effect, he\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fasserted that his first action was one for habeas corpus relief, in\n\nwhich he argued that he could not have advanced a claim for\n\ndamages. See id. at 14; see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments\n\n§   26(1)(c)   (providing   for   a    \"competency\"   exception    to   claim\n\npreclusion when a jurisdictional obstacle precludes plaintiff from\n\nraising an issue in the first action).\n\n            We concluded that the plaintiff had mischaracterized the\n\nfirst action: it was an action for declaratory judgment, not one\n\nfor habeas corpus.    819 F.2d at 15. Thus, the plaintiff's argument\n\nfailed because the exception was \"inapplicable\" as Pasterczyk could\n\nhave sought damages in the initial action.            Id.   No question was\n\neither asked or answered about the scope of claim preclusion\n\nfollowing the adjudication of a declaratory action.               It follows\n\nthat Pasterczyk does not control here.\n\n            We find equally inconclusive our decision in Mulrain v.\n\nBoard of Selectmen of Town of Leicester, 944 F.2d 23 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).     At the end of the day, the panel in that case refused\n\ndirectly to consider claim preclusion in the declaratory judgment\n\ncontext.    See id. at 25-26.     The issue that Robinson advances on\n\nappeal is, therefore, an open issue in this circuit.3\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      Our recent decision in Herman v. Meiselman, 541 F.3d 59 (1st\nCir. 2008), does not materially advance this inquiry.          The\npreclusive judgment in Herman was not a declaratory judgment but a\nconsent decree awarding among other things money damages. See id.\nat 62 n.5.\n\n                                      -11-\n\f            With that introduction, we turn to the decisions of the\n\nMassachusetts courts.        Although the SJC has never explicitly\n\nadopted section 33 of the Second Restatement, we start with a\n\nrebuttable presumption that it would be inclined to follow that\n\ncourse.    We embrace that presumption for two reasons.\n\n            First,    we   have   noted,    over   and    over       again,   that\n\nMassachusetts    courts     apply    res    judicata      in     a     thoroughly\n\nconventional way.     See, e.g., Mulrain, 944 F.2d at 25; Capraro v.\n\nTilcon Gammino, Inc., 751 F.2d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 1985); Casagrande\n\nv. Agoritsas, 748 F.2d 47, 48 (1st Cir. 1984); Isaac, 706 F.2d at\n\n16.   As a corollary of that proposition, we think it wholly\n\nappropriate to look, at least initially, to the Restatement as an\n\naccurate barometer of unarticulated Massachusetts law.                 See, e.g.,\n\nPasterczyk, 819 F.2d at 14 (\"Finding no Massachusetts case on\n\npoint, we turn . . . to the Restatement.\"); Isaac, 706 F.2d at 16-\n\n17 (applying that principle).       We see nothing in the situation at\n\nhand that would suggest the slightest reason for abandoning this\n\ncourse.\n\n            Second,    although     no     reported      Massachusetts        case\n\nexplicitly adopts section 33 of the Second Restatement, at least\n\nfour cases have cited approvingly to some incarnation of that\n\nsection.   Two of these are decisions of the SJC.          The list follows.\n\n            When defining the term \"binding\" in an unrelated statute,\n\nthe SJC counted section 33's direct lineal ancestor, section 77 of\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fthe first Restatement of Judgments (1942),4 as persuasive evidence.\n\nMeunier's Case, 66 N.E.2d 198, 201 (Mass. 1946).           In another case,\n\nthe SJC looked to section 77 of the first Restatement as authority\n\nfor the proposition that declaratory judgments have binding force\n\nand effect.    Weingartner v. Town of N. Wales, 101 N.E.2d 132, 136\n\n(Mass. 1951). Interestingly, the Weingartner court cited a comment\n\nstating that \"[t]he effect of a declaratory judgment in subsequent\n\ncontroversies between the parties depends upon the scope of the\n\ndeclaration . . . . [A]s to matters not declared . . . the parties\n\nare not so precluded.\"       Restatement of Judgments § 77 cmt. b; see\n\n101 N.E.2d at 132.    We regard that statement as highly suggestive\n\n(if only by negative implication).\n\n            Two opinions emanating from the state's intermediate\n\nappellate court also have exhibited a readiness to look to a\n\ncorresponding    provision    contained   in   tentative    drafts   of   the\n\ntransitional Restatement.       See Boyd v. Jamaica Plain Co-op Bank,\n\n386 N.E.2d 775, 779 (Mass. App. Ct. 1979); Albano v. Jordan Marsh\n\nCo., 362 N.E.2d 219, 221 (Mass. App. Ct. 1977).       While decisions of\n\na state's intermediate appellate court are not binding on a federal\n\n\n\n     4\n         Section 77 states:\n\n     Where an action is brought to obtain a declaration of the\n     rights or other legal relations of the parties to the\n     action, whether or not further relief is or could be\n     prayed, a final and valid judgment declaring such rights\n     or other relations is binding between the parties in\n     subsequent actions.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fcourt sitting in diversity, such opinions are entitled to some\n\nweight.5    See West v. AT&T, 311 U.S. 223, 237 (1940); CPC Int'l,\n\nInc. v. Northbrook Excess & Surplus Ins. Co., 962 F.2d 77, 91 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).\n\n             In the aggregate, these Massachusetts cases strongly\n\nsuggest that when faced with the question that is now before us,\n\nthe SJC will adopt the articulation of claim preclusion principles\n\nlimned in section 33 of the Second Restatement.\n\n             In an effort to weaken the force of this reasoning,\n\nHartford's able counsel marshals a number of other Massachusetts\n\ncases.     In the end, this effort proves fruitless.\n\n             Hartford's first proffer consists of cases holding that\n\na final decree in a declaratory judgment action bars a subsequent\n\naction for declaratory relief arising out of the same transaction.6\n\n\n     5\n       Hartford points to Boyd as a case applying conventional\nprinciples of claim preclusion to bar causes of action that could\nhave been (but were not) brought in a prior declaratory action.\nWhile Boyd is far from a model of clarity, it relied upon a\ntentative draft of the transitional Restatement (now section 33) to\nfind that the claims in the second action were barred as matters\nactually declared in the first action.        368 N.E.2d at 781.\nAnything else in the opinion is dictum. At a bare minimum this\nsomewhat schizophrenic decision suggests that section 33 of the\nSecond Restatement applies except when both the original and\nsubsequent actions are for declaratory judgment. That is not the\nsituation here.\n     6\n      In this regard, Hartford's citation to Fassas, 233 N.E.2d at\n924, is inapposite. In Fassas, the prior action sought primarily\ninjunctive relief and thus did not implicate the special rule for\nclaim preclusion with which we are concerned.     See Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments § 33 cmt. d (explaining that actions\ndominated by claims for coercive relief should not be construed as\n\n                                 -14-\n\fSee, e.g., Fassas, 233 N.E.2d at 925; Sadler v. Indus. Trust Co.,\n\n97 N.E.2d 169, 170-71 (Mass. 1951).        That line of cases provides\n\nHartford no succor.\n\n          Sadler illustrates the point.          That case involved two\n\nappeals to the SJC from orders dismissing similar declaratory\n\njudgment actions brought consecutively by a single plaintiff.          See\n\n97 N.E.2d at 170.        The SJC held that the earlier declaratory\n\njudgment action was res judicata as to matters actually litigated\n\nin that action.   Id. at 171.    That ruling tracks the prescription\n\nof section 33.\n\n          Hartford's next reference is to a pair of unpublished\n\ndecisions. The first is Lin v. Cahaly, No. 307493, 2005 WL 1844619\n\n(Mass. Land Ct. Aug. 5, 2005), in which the court was confronted\n\nwith an argument that claims for trespass and contract damages were\n\nprecluded by an earlier suit to quiet title.        The court dismissed\n\nthe case for want of jurisdiction.         Id. at *2.      The judge, in\n\ndictum and without meaningful analysis, gratuitously rejected a\n\ndeclaratory   judgment    exception   to   the   usual   rules   of   claim\n\npreclusion.   See id. at *3.    The second case in this set, Gleed v.\n\nDonaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, No. 93-12202, 1993 WL 543204, at *1\n\n(D. Mass. Dec. 20, 1993), is likewise bereft of any analysis.\n\nNeither decision has any precedential force.\n\n\ndeclaratory judgment actions for purposes of section 33 merely\nbecause the complaint may contain an incidental prayer for\ndeclaratory relief).\n\n                                 -15-\n\f          That ends our safari through Massachusetts case law.\n\nWhile not conclusive, the drift of these cases strengthens our\n\ninitial intuition that the SJC would likely apply section 33 of the\n\nSecond Restatement in this case.           After all, Massachusetts courts\n\ngenerally follow the Restatement; those courts have cited earlier\n\nversions of this rule with approbation; and they have recognized\n\nthat declaratory judgment actions evoke special claim preclusion\n\nprinciples.        What    remains,   however,   is   to   consult    a   broader\n\nspectrum of authorities.\n\n          A canvass of the decisions in other jurisdictions is\n\ninstructive.       The vast majority of states that have addressed this\n\nproblem unapologetically apply a special rule of claim preclusion,\n\nconsistent with that of section 33 of the Second Restatement, in\n\nthe declaratory judgment context.          Many of these courts have cited\n\nexplicitly    to    some    edition   of   the   Restatement.        See,   e.g.,\n\nJackinsky v. Jackinsky, 894 P.2d 650, 656 (Alaska 1995); Aerojet-\n\nGen. Corp. v. Am. Excess Ins. Co., 117 Cal. Rptr. 2d 427, 441-42\n\n(Cal Ct. App. 2002); Eason v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 961 P.2d 537,\n\n540 (Colo Ct. App. 1997); Salvatore v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., No.\n\nCV990588345S, 2001 WL 823265, at *2 (Conn. Super. Ct. June 18,\n\n2001); N. Shore Realty Corp. v. Gallaher, 99 So. 2d 255, 257 (Fla.\n\nDist. Ct. App. 1957); Bankers & Shippers Ins.

App. 1990); Radkay v.\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fConfalone, 575 A.2d 355, 357-58 (N.H. 1990); Donnelly v. United\n\nFruit Co., 183 A.2d 415, 419 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1962);\n\nPrincipal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Straus, 863 P.2d 447, 451 (N.M.\n\n1993); State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Heights, 765 N.E.2d 345, 355\n\n(Ohio 2002); Carver v.

Several states have used similar reasoning and adopted\n\nessentially the same rule, but without mentioning the Restatement.\n\nSee, e.g., Cooke v. Gaidry, 218 S.W.2d 960, 962 (Ky. 1949); Warwick\n\nv. Pearl River Valley Water Supply Dist., 271 So. 2d 94, 96 (Miss.\n\n1972); In re Cox, 388 S.E.2d 199, 201 (N.C. Ct. App. 1990); Okla.\n\nAlcoholic Bev. Control Bd. v. Cent. Liquor Co., 421 P.2d 244, 247\n\n(Okla. 1966); Robison v. Asbill, 492 S.E.2d 400, 401 (S.C. Ct. App.\n\n1997); Klaus v. Vander Heyden, 316 N.W.2d 664, 672 (Wis. 1982).   In\n\naddition, a number of federal courts, applying state law, have\n\nadopted the Restatement's approach. See, e.g., Stericycle, Inc. v.\n\nCity of Delavan, 120 F.3d 657, 659 (7th Cir. 1997) (applying\n\nWisconsin law); Harborside Refrig. Servs., Inc. v. Vogel, 959 F.2d\n\n368, 373 (2d Cir. 1992) (explaining that \"both federal and New York\n\nlaw recognize the declaratory judgment exception articulated in the\n\nRestatement\"); Cimasi v. City of Fenton, 838 F.2d 298, 299 (8th\n\nCir. 1988) (applying Missouri law); Buckeye Cmty. Hope Found. v.\n\nCity of Cuyahoga Falls, 970 F. Supp. 1289, 1303 (N.D. Ohio 1997)\n\n(applying Ohio law); Umhey v. County of Orange, 957 F. Supp. 525,\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f528 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (applying New York law).   Last — but not least\n\n— a myriad of federal courts have opined that federal common law\n\nembraces the rule.   See, e.g., Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. J.\n\nTransp., Inc., 880 F.2d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir. 1989); Smith v. City\n\nof Chicago, 820 F.2d 916, 919 (7th Cir. 1987); Kaspar Wire Works,\n\nInc. v. Leco Eng'g & Mach., Inc., 575 F.2d 530, 536-37 (5th Cir.\n\n1978); Lube 495, Inc. v. Jiffy Lube, 813 F. Supp. 100, 111-12 (D.\n\nMass. 1993); Horn & Hardart Co. v. Nat'l R.R. Pass. Corp., 659 F.\n\nSupp. 1258, 1265 (D.D.C. 1987); In re Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys\n\nSec. Litig., 623 F. Supp. 1466, 1473 (W.D. Wash. 1985); Solomon v.\n\nEmanuelson, 586 F. Supp. 280, 283 (D. Conn. 1984).\n\n          Some courts have ruled to the contrary — but they are\n\nrelatively few in number.   See, e.g., Boyer v. Mealins, 315 P.2d\n\n878, 880 (Ariz. 1957); Hurst v. Rice, 643 S.W.2d 563, 564 (Ark.\n\n1982); Downen v. Country Mut. Ins. Co., 537 N.E.2d 445, 447 (Ill.\n\nApp. Ct. 1989); Hofmann v. Auto Club Ins. Ass'n, 535 N.W.2d 529,\n\n548 (Mich. Ct. App. 1955); State v. Joseph, 636 N.W.2d 325, 327\n\n(Minn. 2001).   Hartford's attempt to pad this list is unavailing:\n\nthe other cases that it musters are off-point.   Some stand for the\n\nuncontroversial proposition, wholly consistent with section 33,\n\nthat claim preclusion applies to matters actually litigated and\n\ndecided in the original declaratory judgment action.    See, e.g.,\n\nFournier v. Ill Cas. Co., 391 N.W.2d 258, 260-61 (Iowa 1986).\n\nOthers are cases that do not address whether the declaratory\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fjudgment context makes a difference. See, e.g., Smith v. Barfield,\n\n276 S.E.2d 899, 900 (Ga. Ct. App. 1981).\n\n           We also have examined the leading treatises. In general,\n\nthey subscribe to the view that declaratory judgments should be\n\naccorded less preclusive effect than other final judgments.            The\n\npreeminent authority is the Second Restatement itself (which, of\n\ncourse, articulates the very rule on which Robinson's appeal\n\nhinges).    Other texts march to the same beat.            See David L.\n\nShapiro, Civil Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions 63 (2001)\n\n(\"[I]ssues not litigated in the declaratory action — perhaps\n\nbecause they were not foreseeable or because the plaintiff was\n\nseeking only a limited clarification of his rights and duties —\n\nshould not be foreclosed in a later coercive action arising out of\n\nthe same controversy.\"); see also Rosemary Gregor et al., American\n\nJurisprudence   2d   Declaratory    Judgments   §   248   (2d   ed.   2003)\n\n(similar); James Wm. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice § 131.24[3]\n\n(3d ed. 2008) (noting that public policy goals are \"furthered when\n\na plaintiff who has sought solely declarative relief is allowed to\n\nseek additional coercive relief based on the same claim\"); Charles\n\nA. Wright & Mary K. Kane, Law of Federal Courts 723-24 (6th ed.\n\n2002) (similar).     But cf. 18A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller\n\n& Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4446 (2d ed.\n\n2002) (noting that \"traditional doctrine has refused to apply claim\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fpreclusion       to     an   action    for   declaratory         relief   alone,\"   yet\n\ncriticizing that practice).\n\n                Hartford's response consists mainly of citation to law\n\nreview articles and notes, most of ancient vintage, that lament the\n\ndifficulties inherent in the Restatement approach.                         See, e.g.,\n\nNote, Declaratory Judgment and Matured Causes of Action, 53 Colum.\n\nL. Rev. 1130, 1132-33 (1953); Developments in the Law: Declaratory\n\nJudgments       —     1941-1949,      62   Harv.     L.   Rev.    787,    843   (1949);\n\nDevelopments in the Law: Res Judicata, 65 Harv. L. Rev. 818, 881-82\n\n(1952); Recent Decisions, 52 Mich. L. Rev. 139, 143 (1953).7                        The\n\nshort answer to these musty lamentations is that the American Law\n\nInstitute subsequently rejected them and reaffirmed the special\n\nrule       of   claim    preclusion        for     declaratory     judgments.       See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 33.\n\n                This brings us to policy rationales that may bear upon\n\nthe question.         The upshot of that consideration is a mixed bag.               On\n\nthe one hand, claim preclusion is a widely recognized means of\n\nhusbanding judicial resources.               See Heacock v. Heacock, 520 N.E.2d\n\n151, 153 (Mass. 1988) (observing that claim preclusion is \"based on\n\n\n\n       7\n       Two more recent law review notes advance policy arguments\nfavoring Robinson's position.

Rev. 613, 626-27 & nn.112-116 (2002);\nElizabeth L. Hisserich, Note, The Collison of Declaratory Judgments\nand Res Judicata, 48 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 159, 173-75 & nn.53-61\n(2000).\n\n                                            -20-\n\fthe idea that the party to be precluded has had the incentive and\n\nopportunity to litigate the matter fully in the first lawsuit\").\n\nOn the other hand, judicial resources also are conserved by the\n\navailability of a declaratory judgment mechanism; the prompt and\n\nefficient use of that mechanism enables courts \"to clarify the\n\nlegal relationships of parties before they have been disturbed\n\nthereby   tending    towards    avoidance      of   full-blown   litigation.\"\n\nHarborside, 959 F.2d at 373. It would frustrate this latter policy\n\nwere parties required to bring, as part of a declaratory judgment\n\naction,   all   conceivable     claims   and    counterclaims      on    pain   of\n\npreclusion.     The Second Restatement has weighed these competing\n\npolicy rationales and concluded — sensibly, in our view — that, on\n\nbalance, public policy is furthered rather than retarded by the\n\nready availability of a no-strings-attached declaratory remedy that\n\nis simpler, faster, and less nuclear than a suit for coercive\n\nrelief.   Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 33 cmt. c.\n\n           Relatedly, we note that the provision of Massachusetts\n\nlaw that authorizes declaratory judgments specifically anticipates\n\nthe possibility of further proceedings.             See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n231A, § 5 (allowing \"[f]urther relief based on a declaratory\n\njudgment\" whenever necessary or proper).             This provision sets in\n\nplace a structure for declaratory judgments that is at odds with\n\nthe   rigid     deployment     of   conventional      principles        of   claim\n\npreclusion.      Cf. Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 26(1)(d)\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f(delineating an exception to the normal rules of claim preclusion\n\nfor cases in which a statutory scheme permits a splitting of the\n\nclaim).\n\n               To this point, all roads lead to Rome.                     The district\n\ncourt, however, expressed concern that Robinson may have engaged in\n\nstrategic litigation by intentionally splitting its claims between\n\nthe original declaratory action and the later damages action.                      See\n\nRobinson II, 533 F. Supp. 2d at 221.                    But every lawyer — or, at\n\nleast every competent lawyer — factors strategic considerations\n\ninto       decisions     affecting   his    or    her    handling    of    litigation.\n\nMoreover, the type of claim-splitting that worried the district\n\ncourt is precisely what the Restatement rule contemplates.                         The\n\nantidote, if one is needed, should be administered in the first\n\naction, in which the judge can refuse to entertain the declaratory\n\njudgment       petition     absent   joinder      of     coercive    claims.8      See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 33 cmt. c; cf. El Día, Inc. v.\n\nHernández Colón, 963 F.2d 488, 493 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that\n\ndeclaratory relief is a matter of discretion).                       Here, the trial\n\njustice       in   the   first   action     saw    no    need   to   impose     such   a\n\nqualification.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n       As Hartford points out, this may be advantageous because,\nonce joined, those coercive claims can then be stayed. But to say\nthat such a praxis has advantages is not to say that it is\nmandatory.\n\n                                           -22-\n\fIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We   need   go   no   further.   After   canvassing   the\n\nMassachusetts cases, examining the precedents elsewhere, consulting\n\nscholarly literature, and weighing relevant policy rationales, we\n\nbelieve that we can predict with some assurance that the SJC, if\n\nfaced with the question presented in this appeal, would likely\n\nfollow the rule set out in section 33 of the Restatement (Second)\n\nof Judgments.    In other words, we do not think that the SJC would\n\nconstrue a final judgment in a declaratory action that did not\n\nraise coercive claims as barring a subsequent damages action\n\nasserting such claims, even though the latter arose out of the same\n\ntransaction.     Thus, we reverse the order of dismissal and remand\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f",

The hostilities initially took the form of a garden-variety insurance disputebut the case has now morphed into an interesting question about the preclusive effect (if any) of a declaratory judgment on a subsequent action for damages arising out of the same nucleus of operative facts. The district court determined that a final judgment in the original declaratory action barred the maintenance of the subsequent suit. After careful consideration, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We glean the facts from the state court's rescript in the original declaratory judgment action and the plaintiffs' complaint in the subsequent suit.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs, appellants in this court, are a quartet of affiliated companies: Andrew Robinson International, Inc., Andrew Robinson International Financial Services, Inc., Andrew Robinson International Insurance Brokerage, Inc., and Andrew Robinson International Risk Management Consultants, Inc. (collectively, Robinson). The four corporations shared an office condominium at 165 Friend St., Boston, Massachusetts. On April 25, 2003, the occupant of a neighboring unit negligently discharged lead-laden dust into Robinson's unit. The incident proved costly: Robinson's premises were badly damaged and Robinson was forced to relocate until the clean-up was complete.</p>\n<p>In due course, Robinson filed a first-party claim against its insurer, Hartford Fire Insurance Co. Hartford denied the claim, asserting that the dust constituted a pollutant under its policy (which, subject to certain exceptions, excluded coverage \"for loss or damage caused by or resulting from the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release, or escape\" of pollutants).<sup>[1]</sup> Robinson responded by demanding an affirmation of coverage. Hartford demurred.</p>\n<p>At that juncture, Robinson repaired to the state superior court in search of a declaration of the parties' rights and liabilities under the insurance policy. Following some preliminary skirmishing (not relevant here), the court, acting on cross-motions for summary judgment, concluded that lead-laden dust released within a commercial building did not constitute pollution and, therefore, did not trigger the policy exclusion. <i>See Andrew Robinson Int'l, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.</i> (<i>Robinson I</i>), No. 03-1353, 2006 WL 1537382, at *13 (Mass.Super.Ct. Feb. 6, 2006). Hartford allowed the declaratory judgment to become final and paid Robinson's first-party claim.</p>\n<p>Approximately eight months later, the other shoe dropped: Robinson again sued Hartford in the state court. This time, Robinson alleged that Hartford's stonewalling constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 11, and prayed for treble damages and attorneys' fees. Hartford removed the case to the federal district court based on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> amount. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a), 1441.</p>\n<p>Hartford's next step was to move for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that the chapter 93A suit was foreclosed by principles of res judicata. Robinson opposed the motion, arguing among other things that the Massachusetts courts would not give preclusive effect as to claims not actually litigated in a previous declaratory judgment action.<sup>[2]</sup> The district court sided with Hartford and dismissed the action. <i>See </i><i>Andrew Robinson Int'l, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.</i> (<i>Robinson II</i>), 533 F.Supp.2d 218, 222 (D.Mass.2008). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. PERTINENT LEGAL PRINCIPLES</h2>\n<p>We begin with a précis of some pertinent legal principles.</p>\n<p>Our standard of review is familiar: we evaluate a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo, accepting all well-pleaded facts delineated in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the party contesting dismissal. <i>Palmer v. Champion Mortg.,</i> 465 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Jorge v. Rumsfeld,</i> 404 F.3d 556, 559 (1st Cir.2005). The motion will be granted unless the facts, evaluated in that plaintiff-friendly manner, contain enough meat to support a reasonable expectation that an actionable claim may exist. <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <i>Morales-Tañón v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.,</i> 524 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>In passing upon a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the reviewing court's focus on the well-pleaded facts is more expansive than might first be thought. Within that rubric, the court may consider matters fairly incorporated within the complaint and matters susceptible of judicial notice. <i>In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp.,</i> 324 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, where the motion to dismiss is premised on a defense of res judicata as is true in the case at handthe court may take into account the record in the original action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>R.G. Fin. Corp. v. Vergara-Nuñez,</i> 446 F.3d 178, 183-84 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Boateng v. InterAm. Univ.,</i> 210 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>The fact that this is a diversity case adds another dimension to our task. A federal court sitting in diversity must apply state law to determine the preclusive effect of an earlier state court judgment. <i>Kathios v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 862 F.2d 944, 946 (1st Cir.1988). In the first instance, this means that the federal court looks to pronouncements of the highest court of the state. <i>Id.</i> When that court has not spoken directly to an issue, the federal court must make an informed prophecy as to the state court's likely stance. <i>See </i><i>Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l. Inc.,</i> 81 F.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>In undertaking this inquiry, the federal court may draw upon a variety of sources that may reasonably be thought to influence the state court's decisional calculus. While these sources are not arranged in any rigid hierarchy, the federal court as a general matter will start by inspecting analogous decisions of the state's highest court; then consider decisions of the lower courts of that state; then examine the precedents in other jurisdictions; then survey the collected wisdom found in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> learned treatises; and finally, mull any relevant policy rationales. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blinzler,</i> 81 F.3d at 1151; <i>Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co.,</i> 916 F.2d 731, 734-35 (1st Cir.1990). In conducting this tamisage, the federal court should pay particular attention to those sources that the state's highest court has endorsed in the past and to public policy considerations mentioned approvingly in that court's decisions. <i>See </i><i>Gibson v. City of Cranston,</i> 37 F.3d 731, 736 (1st Cir.1994). In the final analysis, the federal court's objective is not to choose the legal path that it deems best but, rather, to predict what path the state court would most likely travel. <i>See </i><i>Kathios,</i> 862 F.2d at 946.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts recognizes two distinct types of preclusion arising out of the maintenance of prior litigation: res judicata (claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (issue preclusion). <i>See </i><i>Kobrin v. Bd. of Regist. in Med.,</i> 444 Mass. 837, 832 N.E.2d 628, 634 (Mass.2005). Both the parties and the district court have analyzed this case in terms of res judicata. We follow their lead.</p>\n<p>Res judicata \"makes a valid final judgment conclusive on the parties ... and prevents relitigation of all matters that were or could have been adjudicated in the action.\" <i>Id.</i> This doctrine is sometimes known as \"merger and bar,\" nomenclature that emphasizes the doctrine's role in guarding against claim-splitting. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> §§ 18, 19, 24 (1982).</p>\n<p>The operation of res judicata requires the presence of three elements: \"(1) the identity or privity of the parties to the present and prior actions, (2) identity of the cause of action, and (3) prior final judgment on the merits.\" <i>Kobrin,</i> 832 N.E.2d at 634; <i>see </i><i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> 452 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir.2006). Here, the parties are the same and the first action unarguably ended in a final judgment. That leaves the second element; Robinson's opening gambit is to suggest that the two actions it brought against Hartford fail to present the requisite identity of causes of action. We test that thesis.</p>\n<p>Massachusetts deems causes of action identical for claim preclusion purposes if they \"grow[] out of the same transaction, act, or agreement, and seek[] redress for the same wrong.\" <i>Brunson v. Wall,</i> 405 Mass. 446, 541 N.E.2d 338, 341 n. 9 (Mass. 1989) (quoting <i>Mackintosh v. Chambers,</i> 285 Mass. 594, 190 N.E. 38, 39 (Mass.1934)). Viewed against this backdrop, Robinson's premise is that because a violation of chapter 93A creates \"an action independent from the [insurance] contract,\" <i>Schwartz v. Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> 50 Mass.App.Ct. 672, 740 N.E.2d 1039, 1043 (Mass.App.Ct.2001), an action based on chapter 93A addresses a separate \"wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Massachusetts law is inhospitable to this premise. Discrete theories of liability may constitute identical causes of action for claim preclusion purposes if they are based on the same nucleus of operative facts. <i>See </i><i>Fassas v. First Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 353 Mass. 628, 233 N.E.2d 924, 925 (Mass. 1968) (explaining that \"[t]he statement of a different form of liability is not a different cause of action, provided it grows out of the same transaction\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Isaac v. Schwartz,</i> 706 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1983) (interpreting Massachusetts law to hold that \"new legal theories, embodied in different statutes and different common law doctrines,\" are still identical causes of action for claim preclusion purposes).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> A review of the complaints in <i>Robinson I</i> and <i>Robinson II,</i> respectively, confirms that both actions arise from the same transaction. In the formerthe declaratory actionRobinson complained that Hartford wrongfully denied coverage for its first-party insurance claim. In the latter the chapter 93A actionRobinson complained that the same denial of coverage, undertaken \"willfully and in bad faith,\" amounted to an unfair trade practice. It is thus apparent that both suits arose out of the same underlying transaction. Consequently, the stated causes of action are identical within the meaning of the res judicata doctrine.</p>\n<p>This conclusion means that the customary ingredients for the application of res judicata are present. Robinson concedes that, under those principles, a final judgment ordinarily bars litigation of unmade claims arising out of the same transaction. The question, however, is whether some special rule obtains here.</p>\n<p>Robinson proposes such a special rule. It asseverates that normal principles of claim preclusion will not operate when the original action was for declaratory relief. The linchpin of this asseveration is section 33 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, which states that \"[a] valid and final judgment in an action brought to declare rights or other legal relations of the parties is conclusive in a subsequent action between them as to the matters declared.\" Under this prescription, \"[a] plaintiff who wins a declaratory judgment may go on to seek further relief, even in an action on the same claim which prompted the action for a declaratory judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> cmt. c. \"This further relief may include damages which had accrued at the time the declaratory relief was sought; it is irrelevant that the further relief could have been requested initially.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The serial Restatements are much-respected works. Nevertheless, the question is not one of doctrine in the abstract but, rather, whether the highest court of Massachusetts the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC)would follow the rule of the Second Restatement; that is, whether the SJC would hold that a valid and final judgment in an action brought to declare rights precludes the maintenance of a subsequent action between the same parties arising out of the same transaction and involving an issue that could have been, but was not, actually litigated in the former action.</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that we had answered this question in <i>Pasterczyk v. Fair,</i> 819 F.2d 12 (1st Cir.1987). The court read <i>Pasterczyk</i> for the proposition that, notwithstanding the declaratory nature of an original action, the usual rules of claim preclusion apply. <i>See Robinson II,</i> 533 F.Supp.2d at 221. We think that the district court read <i>Pasterczyk</i> too aggressively.</p>\n<p>In that case, the plaintiff had filed a Massachusetts state court action seeking recalculation of his sentence. 819 at 13. After obtaining a declaration that he was entitled to credit for time served in other states, the plaintiff won his release. <i>Id.</i> He then sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for damages in consequence of his overlong incarceration. To escape a res judicata effect, he asserted that his first action was one for habeas corpus relief, in which he argued that he could not have advanced a claim for damages. <i>See id.</i> at 14; <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 26(1)(c) (providing for a \"competency\" exception to claim preclusion when a jurisdictional obstacle precludes plaintiff from raising an issue in the first action).</p>\n<p>We concluded that the plaintiff had mischaracterized the first action: it was an action for declaratory judgment, not one for habeas corpus. 819 F.2d at 15. Thus, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> the plaintiff's argument failed because the exception was \"inapplicable\" as Pasterczyk could have sought damages in the initial action. <i>Id.</i> No question was either asked or answered about the scope of claim preclusion following the adjudication of a declaratory action. It follows that <i>Pasterczyk</i> does not control here.</p>\n<p>We find equally inconclusive our decision in <i>Mulrain v. Board of Selectmen of Town of Leicester,</i> 944 F.2d 23 (1st Cir. 1991). At the end of the day, the panel in that case refused directly to consider claim preclusion in the declaratory judgment context. <i>See id.</i> at 25-26. The issue that Robinson advances on appeal is, therefore, an open issue in this circuit.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>With that introduction, we turn to the decisions of the Massachusetts courts. Although the SJC has never explicitly adopted section 33 of the Second Restatement, we start with a rebuttable presumption that it would be inclined to follow that course. We embrace that presumption for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we have noted, over and over again, that Massachusetts courts apply res judicata in a thoroughly conventional way. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mulrain,</i> 944 F.2d at 25; <i>Capraro v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc.,</i> 751 F.2d 56, 58 (1st Cir.1985); <i>Casagrande v. Agoritsas,</i> 748 F.2d 47, 48 (1st Cir.1984); <i>Isaac,</i> 706 F.2d at 16. As a corollary of that proposition, we think it wholly appropriate to look, at least initially, to the Restatement as an accurate barometer of unarticulated Massachusetts law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pasterczyk,</i> 819 F.2d at 14 (\"Finding no Massachusetts case on point, we turn... to the Restatement.\"); <i>Isaac,</i> 706 F.2d at 16-17 (applying that principle). We see nothing in the situation at hand that would suggest the slightest reason for abandoning this course.</p>\n<p>Second, although no reported Massachusetts case explicitly adopts section 33 of the Second Restatement, at least four cases have cited approvingly to some incarnation of that section. Two of these are decisions of the SJC. The list follows.</p>\n<p>When defining the term \"binding\" in an unrelated statute, the SJC counted section 33's direct lineal ancestor, section 77 of the first <i>Restatement of Judgments</i> (1942),<sup>[4]</sup> as persuasive evidence. <i>Meunier's Case,</i> 319 Mass. 421, 66 N.E.2d 198, 201 (Mass.1946). In another case, the SJC looked to section 77 of the first Restatement as authority for the proposition that declaratory judgments have binding force and effect. <i>Weingartner v. Town of N. Wales,</i> 327 Mass. 731, 101 N.E.2d 132, 136 (Mass.1951). Interestingly, the <i>Weingartner</i> court cited a comment stating that \"[t]he effect of a declaratory judgment in subsequent controversies between the parties depends upon the scope of the declaration.... [A]s to matters not declared ... the parties are not so precluded.\" <i>Restatement of Judgments</i> § 77 cmt. b; <i>see</i> 101 N.E.2d at 132. We regard that statement as highly suggestive (if only by negative implication).</p>\n<p>Two opinions emanating from the state's intermediate appellate court also have exhibited a readiness to look to a corresponding provision contained in tentative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> drafts of the transitional Restatement. <i>See </i><i>Boyd v. Jamaica Plain Co-op. Bank,</i> 7 Mass.App.Ct. 153, 386 N.E.2d 775, 779 (Mass.App.Ct.1979); <i>Albano v. Jordan Marsh Co.,</i> 5 Mass.App.Ct. 277, 362 N.E.2d 219, 221 (Mass.App.Ct. 1977). While decisions of a state's intermediate appellate court are not binding on a federal court sitting in diversity, such opinions are entitled to some weight.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>West v. AT &amp; T,</i> 311 U.S. 223, 237, 61 S.Ct. 179, 85 L.Ed. 139 (1940); <i>CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co.,</i> 962 F.2d 77, 91 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>In the aggregate, these Massachusetts cases strongly suggest that when faced with the question that is now before us, the SJC will adopt the articulation of claim preclusion principles limned in section 33 of the Second Restatement.</p>\n<p>In an effort to weaken the force of this reasoning, Hartford's able counsel marshals a number of other Massachusetts cases. In the end, this effort proves fruitless.</p>\n<p>Hartford's first proffer consists of cases holding that a final decree in a declaratory judgment action bars a subsequent action for declaratory relief arising out of the same transaction.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fassas,</i> 233 N.E.2d at 925; <i>Sadler v. Indus. Trust Co.,</i> 327 Mass. 10, 97 N.E.2d 169, 170-71 (Mass.1951). That line of cases provides Hartford no succor.</p>\n<p><i>Sadler</i> illustrates the point. That case involved two appeals to the SJC from orders dismissing similar declaratory judgment actions brought consecutively by a single plaintiff. <i>See</i> 97 N.E.2d at 170. The SJC held that the earlier declaratory judgment action was res judicata as to matters actually litigated in that action. <i>Id.</i> at 171. That ruling tracks the prescription of section 33.</p>\n<p>Hartford's next reference is to a pair of unpublished decisions. The first is <i>Lin v. Cahaly,</i> No. 307493, 2005 WL 1844619 (Mass.Land Ct. Aug.5, 2005), in which the court was confronted with an argument that claims for trespass and contract damages were precluded by an earlier suit to quiet title. The court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at *2. The judge, in dictum and without meaningful analysis, gratuitously rejected a declaratory judgment exception to the usual rules of claim preclusion. <i>See id.</i> at *3. The second case in this set, <i>Gleed v. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,</i> No. 93-12202, 1993 WL 543204, at *1 (D.Mass. Dec.20, 1993), is likewise bereft of any analysis. Neither decision has any precedential force.</p>\n<p>That ends our safari through Massachusetts case law. While not conclusive, the drift of these cases strengthens our initial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> intuition that the SJC would likely apply section 33 of the Second Restatement in this case. After all, Massachusetts courts generally follow the Restatement; those courts have cited earlier versions of this rule with approbation; and they have recognized that declaratory judgment actions evoke special claim preclusion principles. What remains, however, is to consult a broader spectrum of authorities.</p>\n<p>A canvass of the decisions in other jurisdictions is instructive. The vast majority of states that have addressed this problem unapologetically apply a special rule of claim preclusion, consistent with that of section 33 of the Second Restatement, in the declaratory judgment context. Many of these courts have cited explicitly to some edition of the Restatement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jackinsky v. Jackinsky,</i> 894 P.2d 650, 656 (Alaska 1995); <i>Aerojet-Gen. Corp. v. Am. Excess Ins. Co.,</i> 117 Cal.Rptr.2d 427, 441-42 (Cal.Ct.App.2002); <i>Eason v. Bd. of County Comm'rs,</i> 961 P.2d 537, 540 (Colo. Ct.App.1997); <i>Salvatore v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> No. CV990588345S, 2001 WL 823265, at *2 (Conn.Super.Ct. June 18, 2001); <i>N. Shore Realty Corp. v. Gallaher,</i> 99 So.2d 255, 257 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1957); <i>Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co. v. Electro Enters., Inc.,</i> 287 Md. 641, 415 A.2d 278, 285-86 (Md.1980); <i>Ganaway v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 795 S.W.2d 554, 562 (Mo.Ct.App.1990); <i>Radkay v. Confalone,</i> 133 N.H. 294, 575 A.2d 355, 357-58 (N.H.1990); <i>Donnelly v. United Fruit Co.,</i> 75 N.J.Super. 383, 183 A.2d 415, 419 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1962); <i>Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Straus,</i> 116 N.M. 412, 863 P.2d 447, 451 (N.M.1993); <i>State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Heights,</i> 95 Ohio St.3d 59, 765 N.E.2d 345, 355 (Ohio 2002); <i>Carver v. Heikkila,</i> 465 N.W.2d 183, 186 (S.D.1991); <i>Martin v. Martin, Martin &amp; Richards, Inc.,</i> 989 S.W.2d 357, 359 (Tex.1998). Several states have used similar reasoning and adopted essentially the same rule, but without mentioning the Restatement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cooke v. Gaidry,</i> 309 Ky. 727, 218 S.W.2d 960, 962 (Ky.1949); <i>Warwick v. Pearl River Valley Water Supply Dist.,</i> 271 So.2d 94, 96 (Miss.1972); <i>In re Cox,</i> 97 N.C.App. 312, 388 S.E.2d 199, 201 (N.C.Ct.App. 1990); <i>Okla. Alcoholic Bev. Control Bd. v. Cent. Liquor Co.,</i> 421 P.2d 244, 247 (Okla. 1966); <i>Robison v. Asbill,</i> 328 S.C. 450, 492 S.E.2d 400, 401 (S.C.Ct.App.1997); <i>Klaus v. Vander Heyden,</i> 106 Wis.2d 353, 316 N.W.2d 664, 672 (Wis.1982). In addition, a number of federal courts, applying state law, have adopted the Restatement's approach. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Stericycle, Inc. v. City of Delavan,</i> 120 F.3d 657, 659 (7th Cir.1997) (applying Wisconsin law); <i>Harborside Refrig. Servs., Inc. v. Vogel,</i> 959 F.2d 368, 373 (2d Cir.1992) (explaining that \"both federal and New York law recognize the declaratory judgment exception articulated in the Restatement\"); <i>Cimasi v. City of Fenton,</i> 838 F.2d 298, 299 (8th Cir.1988) (applying Missouri law); <i>Buckeye Cmty. Hope Found. v. City of Cuyahoga Falls,</i> 970 F.Supp. 1289, 1303 (N.D.Ohio 1997) (applying Ohio law); <i>Umhey v. County of Orange,</i> 957 F.Supp. 525, 528 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (applying New York law). Last but not leasta myriad of federal courts have opined that federal common law embraces the rule. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. J. Transp., Inc.,</i> 880 F.2d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.1989); <i>Smith v. City of Chicago,</i> 820 F.2d 916, 919 (7th Cir.1987); <i>Kaspar Wire Works, Inc. v. Leco Eng'g &amp; Mach., Inc.,</i> 575 F.2d 530, 536-37 (5th Cir.1978); <i>Lube 495, Inc. v. Jiffy Lube,</i> 813 F.Supp. 100, 111-12 (D.Mass.1993); <i>Horn &amp; Hardart Co. v. Nat'l R.R. Pass. Corp.,</i> 659 F.Supp. 1258, 1265 (D.D.C.1987); <i>In re Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig.,</i> 623 F.Supp. 1466, 1473 (W.D.Wash.1985); <i>Solomon v. Emanuelson,</i> 586 F.Supp. 280, 283 (D.Conn.1984).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> Some courts have ruled to the contrary but they are relatively few in number. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Boyer v. Mealins,</i> 83 Ariz. 30, 315 P.2d 878, 880 (Ariz.1957); <i>Hurst v. Rice,</i> 278 Ark. 94, 643 S.W.2d 563, 564 (Ark.1982); <i>Downen v. Country Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 181 Ill.App.3d 716, 130 Ill.Dec. 378, 537 N.E.2d 445, 447 (Ill.App.Ct.1989); <i>Hofmann v. Auto Club Ins. Ass'n,</i> 211 Mich.App. 55, 535 N.W.2d 529, 548 (Mich. Ct.App.1955); <i>State v. Joseph,</i> 636 N.W.2d 322, 327 (Minn.2001). Hartford's attempt to pad this list is unavailing: the other cases that it musters are off-point. Some stand for the uncontroversial proposition, wholly consistent with section 33, that claim preclusion applies to matters actually litigated and decided in the original declaratory judgment action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fournier v. Ill. Cas. Co.,</i> 391 N.W.2d 258, 260-61 (Iowa 1986). Others are cases that do not address whether the declaratory judgment context makes a difference. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith v. Barfield,</i> 157 Ga.App. 231, 276 S.E.2d 899, 900 (Ga.Ct.App.1981).</p>\n<p>We also have examined the leading treatises. In general, they subscribe to the view that declaratory judgments should be accorded less preclusive effect than other final judgments. The preeminent authority is the Second Restatement itself (which, of course, articulates the very rule on which Robinson's appeal hinges). Other texts march to the same beat. <i>See</i> David L. Shapiro, <i>Civil Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions</i> 63 (2001) (\"[I]ssues not litigated in the declaratory actionperhaps because they were not foreseeable or because the plaintiff was seeking only a limited clarification of his rights and dutiesshould not be foreclosed in a later coercive action arising out of the same controversy.\"); <i>see also</i> Rosemary Gregor et al., <i>American Jurisprudence 2d Declaratory Judgments</i> § 248 (2d ed.2003) (similar); James Wm. Moore, <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> § 131.24[3] (3d ed.2008) (noting that public policy goals are \"furthered when a plaintiff who has sought solely declarative relief is allowed to seek additional coercive relief based on the same claim\"); Charles A. Wright &amp; Mary K. Kane, <i>Law of Federal Courts</i> 723-24 (6th ed.2002) (similar). <i>But cf.</i> 18A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 4446 (2d ed.2002) (noting that \"traditional doctrine has refused to apply claim preclusion to an action for declaratory relief alone,\" yet criticizing that practice).</p>\n<p>Hartford's response consists mainly of citation to law review articles and notes, most of ancient vintage, that lament the difficulties inherent in the Restatement approach. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Note, <i>Declaratory Judgment and Matured Causes of Action,</i> 53 Colum. L.Rev. 1130, 1132-33 (1953); <i>Developments in the Law: Declaratory Judgments 1941-1949,</i> 62 Harv. L.Rev. 787, 843 (1949); <i>Developments in the Law: Res Judicata,</i> 65 Harv. L.Rev. 818, 881-82 (1952); <i>Recent Decisions,</i> 52 Mich. L.Rev. 139, 143 (1953).<sup>[7]</sup> The short answer to these musty lamentations is that the American Law Institute subsequently rejected them and reaffirmed the special rule of claim preclusion for declaratory judgments. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 33.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> This brings us to policy rationales that may bear upon the question. The upshot of that consideration is a mixed bag. On the one hand, claim preclusion is a widely recognized means of husbanding judicial resources. <i>See </i><i>Heacock v. Heacock,</i> 402 Mass. 21, 520 N.E.2d 151, 153 (Mass.1988) (observing that claim preclusion is \"based on the idea that the party to be precluded has had the incentive and opportunity to litigate the matter fully in the first lawsuit\"). On the other hand, judicial resources also are conserved by the availability of a declaratory judgment mechanism; the prompt and efficient use of that mechanism enables courts \"to clarify the legal relationships of parties before they have been disturbed thereby tending towards avoidance of full-blown litigation.\" <i>Harborside,</i> 959 F.2d at 373. It would frustrate this latter policy were parties required to bring, as part of a declaratory judgment action, all conceivable claims and counterclaims on pain of preclusion. The Second Restatement has weighed these competing policy rationales and concluded sensibly, in our viewthat, on balance, public policy is furthered rather than retarded by the ready availability of a no-strings-attached declaratory remedy that is simpler, faster, and less nuclear than a suit for coercive relief. <i>Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 33 cmt. c.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, we note that the provision of Massachusetts law that authorizes declaratory judgments specifically anticipates the possibility of further proceedings. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, § 5 (allowing \"[f]urther relief based on a declaratory judgment\" whenever necessary or proper). This provision sets in place a structure for declaratory judgments that is at odds with the rigid deployment of conventional principles of claim preclusion. <i>Cf. Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 26(1)(d) (delineating an exception to the normal rules of claim preclusion for cases in which a statutory scheme permits a splitting of the claim).</p>\n<p>To this point, all roads lead to Rome. The district court, however, expressed concern that Robinson may have engaged in strategic litigation by intentionally splitting its claims between the original declaratory action and the later damages action. <i>See Robinson II,</i> 533 F.Supp.2d at 221. But every lawyeror, at least every competent lawyerfactors strategic considerations into decisions affecting his or her handling of litigation. Moreover, the type of claim-splitting that worried the district court is precisely what the Restatement rule contemplates. The antidote, if one is needed, should be administered in the <i>first</i> action, in which the judge can refuse to entertain the declaratory judgment petition absent joinder of coercive claims.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 33 cmt. c; <i>cf. </i><i>El Día, Inc. v. Hernández Colón,</i> 963 F.2d 488, 493 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that declaratory relief is a matter of discretion). Here, the trial justice in the first action saw no need to impose such a qualification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. After canvassing the Massachusetts cases, examining the precedents elsewhere, consulting scholarly literature, and weighing relevant policy rationales, we believe that we can predict with some assurance that the SJC, if faced with the question presented in this appeal, would likely follow the rule set out in section 33 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments. In other words, we do not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> think that the SJC would construe a final judgment in a declaratory action that did not raise coercive claims as barring a subsequent damages action asserting such claims, even though the latter arose out of the same transaction. Thus, we reverse the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The policy defined a pollutant as \"any solid, liquid, gaseous, or thermal irritant or containment, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals, and waste.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Neither side asked the district court to certify the controlling question to the Supreme Judicial Court. <i>See</i> S.J.C. Rule 1:03. On appeal, the parties have continued to eschew any such request.</p>\n<p>[3]  Our recent decision in <i>Herman v. Meiselman,</i> 541 F.3d 59 (1st Cir.2008), does not materially advance this inquiry. The preclusive judgment in <i>Herman</i> was not a declaratory judgment but a consent decree awarding among other things money damages. <i>See id.</i> at 62 n. 5.</p>\n<p>[4]  Section 77 states:\n</p>\n<p>Where an action is brought to obtain a declaration of the rights or other legal relations of the parties to the action, whether or not further relief is or could be prayed, a final and valid judgment declaring such rights or other relations is binding between the parties in subsequent actions.</p>\n<p>[5]  Hartford points to <i>Boyd</i> as a case applying conventional principles of claim preclusion to bar causes of action that could have been (but were not) brought in a prior declaratory action. While <i>Boyd</i> is far from a model of clarity, it relied upon a tentative draft of the transitional Restatement (now section 33) to find that the claims in the second action were barred as matters actually declared in the first action. 11 Ill.Dec. 229, 368 N.E.2d at 781. Anything else in the opinion is dictum. At a bare minimum this somewhat schizophrenic decision suggests that section 33 of the Second Restatement applies except when both the original and subsequent actions are for declaratory judgment. That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p>[6]  In this regard, Hartford's citation to <i>Fassas,</i> 233 N.E.2d at 924, is inapposite. In <i>Fassas,</i> the prior action sought primarily injunctive relief and thus did not implicate the special rule for claim preclusion with which we are concerned. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 33 cmt. d (explaining that actions dominated by claims for coercive relief should not be construed as declaratory judgment actions for purposes of section 33 merely because the complaint may contain an incidental prayer for declaratory relief).</p>\n<p>[7]  Two more recent law review notes advance policy arguments favoring Robinson's position. Ryan R. Dreyer, Note, <i>Civil Procedure Discouraging Declaratory Actions in Minnesota The Res Judicata Effect of Declaratory Judgments in Light of State v. Joseph,</i> 29 Wm. Mitchell L.Rev. 613, 626-27 &amp; nn. 112-116 (2002); Elizabeth L. Hisserich, Note, <i>The Collison of Declaratory Judgments and Res Judicata,</i> 48 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 159, 173-75 &amp; nn. 53-61 (2000).</p>\n<p>[8]  As Hartford points out, this may be advantageous because, once joined, those coercive claims can then be stayed. But to say that such a praxis has advantages is not to say that it is mandatory.</p>\n\n</div>",

The hostilities initially took the form of a garden-variety insurance disputebut the case has now morphed into an interesting question about the preclusive effect (if any) of a declaratory judgment on a subsequent action for damages arising out of the same nucleus of operative facts. The district court determined that a final judgment in the original declaratory action barred the maintenance of the subsequent suit. After careful consideration, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We glean the facts from the state court's rescript in the original declaratory judgment action and the plaintiffs' complaint in the subsequent suit.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs, appellants in this court, are a quartet of affiliated companies: Andrew Robinson International, Inc., Andrew Robinson International Financial Services, Inc., Andrew Robinson International Insurance Brokerage, Inc., and Andrew Robinson International Risk Management Consultants, Inc. (collectively, Robinson). The four corporations shared an office condominium at 165 Friend St., Boston, Massachusetts. On April 25, 2003, the occupant of a neighboring unit negligently discharged lead-laden dust into Robinson's unit. The incident proved costly: Robinson's premises were badly damaged and Robinson was forced to relocate until the clean-up was complete.</p>\n<p>In due course, Robinson filed a first-party claim against its insurer, Hartford Fire Insurance Co. Hartford denied the claim, asserting that the dust constituted a pollutant under its policy (which, subject to certain exceptions, excluded coverage \"for loss or damage caused by or resulting from the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release, or escape\" of pollutants).<sup>[1]</sup> Robinson responded by demanding an affirmation of coverage. Hartford demurred.</p>\n<p>At that juncture, Robinson repaired to the state superior court in search of a declaration of the parties' rights and liabilities under the insurance policy. Following some preliminary skirmishing (not relevant here), the court, acting on cross-motions for summary judgment, concluded that lead-laden dust released within a commercial building did not constitute pollution and, therefore, did not trigger the policy exclusion. <i>See Andrew Robinson Int'l, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.</i> (<i>Robinson I</i>), No. 03-1353, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1537382</span></span>, at *13 (Mass.Super.Ct. Feb. 6, 2006). Hartford allowed the declaratory judgment to become final and paid Robinson's first-party claim.</p>\n<p>Approximately eight months later, the other shoe dropped: Robinson again sued Hartford in the state court. This time, Robinson alleged that Hartford's stonewalling constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 11, and prayed for treble damages and attorneys' fees. Hartford removed the case to the federal district court based on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> amount. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a), 1441.</p>\n<p>Hartford's next step was to move for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that the chapter 93A suit was foreclosed by principles of res judicata. Robinson opposed the motion, arguing among other things that the Massachusetts courts would not give preclusive effect as to claims not actually litigated in a previous declaratory judgment action.<sup>[2]</sup> The district court sided with Hartford and dismissed the action. <i>See </i><i>Andrew Robinson Int'l, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.</i> (<i>Robinson II</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1506722\"><a href=\"/opinion/1506722/andrew-robinson-intern-v-hartford-fire-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 222 (D.Mass.2008). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. PERTINENT LEGAL PRINCIPLES</h2>\n<p>We begin with a précis of some pertinent legal principles.</p>\n<p>Our standard of review is familiar: we evaluate a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo, accepting all well-pleaded facts delineated in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the party contesting dismissal. <i>Palmer v. Champion Mortg.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202442\"><a href=\"/opinion/202442/palmer-v-champion-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Jorge v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201551\"><a href=\"/opinion/201551/jorge-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span>, 559 (1st Cir.2005). The motion will be granted unless the facts, evaluated in that plaintiff-friendly manner, contain enough meat to support a reasonable expectation that an actionable claim may exist. <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span>, 1965, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span> (2007); <i>Morales-Tañón v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203250\"><a href=\"/opinion/203250/morales-tanon-v-puerto-rico-elec-power-auth/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>In passing upon a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the reviewing court's focus on the well-pleaded facts is more expansive than might first be thought. Within that rubric, the court may consider matters fairly incorporated within the complaint and matters susceptible of judicial notice. <i>In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200395\"><a href=\"/opinion/200395/colonial-mortgage-v-banco/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, where the motion to dismiss is premised on a defense of res judicata as is true in the case at handthe court may take into account the record in the original action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>R.G. Fin. Corp. v. Vergara-Nuñez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202177\"><a href=\"/opinion/202177/rg-financial-v-vergara-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 183-84 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Boateng v. InterAm. Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198887\"><a href=\"/opinion/198887/boateng-v-interamerican-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>The fact that this is a diversity case adds another dimension to our task. A federal court sitting in diversity must apply state law to determine the preclusive effect of an earlier state court judgment. <i>Kathios v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515447\"><a href=\"/opinion/515447/dennis-kathios-v-general-motors-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>, 946 (1st Cir.1988). In the first instance, this means that the federal court looks to pronouncements of the highest court of the state. <i>Id.</i> When that court has not spoken directly to an issue, the federal court must make an informed prophecy as to the state court's likely stance. <i>See </i><i>Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l. Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196700\"><a href=\"/opinion/196700/blinzler-v-marriott-intl/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1151 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>In undertaking this inquiry, the federal court may draw upon a variety of sources that may reasonably be thought to influence the state court's decisional calculus. While these sources are not arranged in any rigid hierarchy, the federal court as a general matter will start by inspecting analogous decisions of the state's highest court; then consider decisions of the lower courts of that state; then examine the precedents in other jurisdictions; then survey the collected wisdom found in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> learned treatises; and finally, mull any relevant policy rationales. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blinzler,</i> 81 F.3d at 1151; <i>Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550084\"><a href=\"/opinion/550084/maury-a-ryan-dba-ryan-klimek-ryan-partnership-v-royal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 734-35 (1st Cir.1990). In conducting this tamisage, the federal court should pay particular attention to those sources that the state's highest court has endorsed in the past and to public policy considerations mentioned approvingly in that court's decisions. <i>See </i><i>Gibson v. City of Cranston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195652\"><a href=\"/opinion/195652/gibson-v-city-of-cranston/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 736 (1st Cir.1994). In the final analysis, the federal court's objective is not to choose the legal path that it deems best but, rather, to predict what path the state court would most likely travel. <i>See </i><i>Kathios,</i> 862 F.2d at 946.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts recognizes two distinct types of preclusion arising out of the maintenance of prior litigation: res judicata (claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (issue preclusion). <i>See </i><i>Kobrin v. Bd. of Regist. in Med.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></span>, 634 (Mass.2005). Both the parties and the district court have analyzed this case in terms of res judicata. We follow their lead.</p>\n<p>Res judicata \"makes a valid final judgment conclusive on the parties ... and prevents relitigation of all matters that were or could have been adjudicated in the action.\" <i>Id.</i> This doctrine is sometimes known as \"merger and bar,\" nomenclature that emphasizes the doctrine's role in guarding against claim-splitting. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> §§ 18, 19, 24 (1982).</p>\n<p>The operation of res judicata requires the presence of three elements: \"(1) the identity or privity of the parties to the present and prior actions, (2) identity of the cause of action, and (3) prior final judgment on the merits.\" <i>Kobrin,</i> 832 N.E.2d at 634; <i>see </i><i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202275\"><a href=\"/opinion/202275/mcdonough-v-city-of-quincy/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2006). Here, the parties are the same and the first action unarguably ended in a final judgment. That leaves the second element; Robinson's opening gambit is to suggest that the two actions it brought against Hartford fail to present the requisite identity of causes of action. We test that thesis.</p>\n<p>Massachusetts deems causes of action identical for claim preclusion purposes if they \"grow[] out of the same transaction, act, or agreement, and seek[] redress for the same wrong.\" <i>Brunson v. Wall,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></span>, 341 n. 9 (Mass. 1989) (quoting <i>Mackintosh v. Chambers,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></span>, 39 (Mass.1934)). Viewed against this backdrop, Robinson's premise is that because a violation of chapter 93A creates \"an action independent from the [insurance] contract,\" <i>Schwartz v. Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> 50 Mass.App.Ct. 672, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></span>, 1043 (Mass.App.Ct.2001), an action based on chapter 93A addresses a separate \"wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Massachusetts law is inhospitable to this premise. Discrete theories of liability may constitute identical causes of action for claim preclusion purposes if they are based on the same nucleus of operative facts. <i>See </i><i>Fassas v. First Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></span>, 925 (Mass. 1968) (explaining that \"[t]he statement of a different form of liability is not a different cause of action, provided it grows out of the same transaction\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Isaac v. Schwartz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"417770\"><a href=\"/opinion/417770/steve-isaac-v-william-schwartz/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1983) (interpreting Massachusetts law to hold that \"new legal theories, embodied in different statutes and different common law doctrines,\" are still identical causes of action for claim preclusion purposes).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> A review of the complaints in <i>Robinson I</i> and <i>Robinson II,</i> respectively, confirms that both actions arise from the same transaction. In the formerthe declaratory actionRobinson complained that Hartford wrongfully denied coverage for its first-party insurance claim. In the latter the chapter 93A actionRobinson complained that the same denial of coverage, undertaken \"willfully and in bad faith,\" amounted to an unfair trade practice. It is thus apparent that both suits arose out of the same underlying transaction. Consequently, the stated causes of action are identical within the meaning of the res judicata doctrine.</p>\n<p>This conclusion means that the customary ingredients for the application of res judicata are present. Robinson concedes that, under those principles, a final judgment ordinarily bars litigation of unmade claims arising out of the same transaction. The question, however, is whether some special rule obtains here.</p>\n<p>Robinson proposes such a special rule. It asseverates that normal principles of claim preclusion will not operate when the original action was for declaratory relief. The linchpin of this asseveration is section 33 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, which states that \"[a] valid and final judgment in an action brought to declare rights or other legal relations of the parties is conclusive in a subsequent action between them as to the matters declared.\" Under this prescription, \"[a] plaintiff who wins a declaratory judgment may go on to seek further relief, even in an action on the same claim which prompted the action for a declaratory judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> cmt. c. \"This further relief may include damages which had accrued at the time the declaratory relief was sought; it is irrelevant that the further relief could have been requested initially.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The serial Restatements are much-respected works. Nevertheless, the question is not one of doctrine in the abstract but, rather, whether the highest court of Massachusetts the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC)would follow the rule of the Second Restatement; that is, whether the SJC would hold that a valid and final judgment in an action brought to declare rights precludes the maintenance of a subsequent action between the same parties arising out of the same transaction and involving an issue that could have been, but was not, actually litigated in the former action.</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that we had answered this question in <i>Pasterczyk v. Fair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488583\"><a href=\"/opinion/488583/paul-peter-pasterczyk-v-michael-v-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1987). The court read <i>Pasterczyk</i> for the proposition that, notwithstanding the declaratory nature of an original action, the usual rules of claim preclusion apply. <i>See Robinson II,</i> 533 F.Supp.2d at 221. We think that the district court read <i>Pasterczyk</i> too aggressively.</p>\n<p>In that case, the plaintiff had filed a Massachusetts state court action seeking recalculation of his sentence. 819 at 13. After obtaining a declaration that he was entitled to credit for time served in other states, the plaintiff won his release. <i>Id.</i> He then sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for damages in consequence of his overlong incarceration. To escape a res judicata effect, he asserted that his first action was one for habeas corpus relief, in which he argued that he could not have advanced a claim for damages. <i>See id.</i> at 14; <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 26(1)(c) (providing for a \"competency\" exception to claim preclusion when a jurisdictional obstacle precludes plaintiff from raising an issue in the first action).</p>\n<p>We concluded that the plaintiff had mischaracterized the first action: it was an action for declaratory judgment, not one for habeas corpus. 819 F.2d at 15. Thus, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> the plaintiff's argument failed because the exception was \"inapplicable\" as Pasterczyk could have sought damages in the initial action. <i>Id.</i> No question was either asked or answered about the scope of claim preclusion following the adjudication of a declaratory action. It follows that <i>Pasterczyk</i> does not control here.</p>\n<p>We find equally inconclusive our decision in <i>Mulrain v. Board of Selectmen of Town of Leicester,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567920\"><a href=\"/opinion/567920/neil-t-mulrain-v-board-of-selectmen-of-the-town-of-leicester/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1991). At the end of the day, the panel in that case refused directly to consider claim preclusion in the declaratory judgment context. <i>See id.</i> at 25-26. The issue that Robinson advances on appeal is, therefore, an open issue in this circuit.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>With that introduction, we turn to the decisions of the Massachusetts courts. Although the SJC has never explicitly adopted section 33 of the Second Restatement, we start with a rebuttable presumption that it would be inclined to follow that course. We embrace that presumption for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we have noted, over and over again, that Massachusetts courts apply res judicata in a thoroughly conventional way. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mulrain,</i> 944 F.2d at 25; <i>Capraro v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445649\"><a href=\"/opinion/445649/36-fair-emplpraccas-1185-35-empl-prac-dec-p-34905-armando-capraro/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.1985); <i>Casagrande v. Agoritsas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444355\"><a href=\"/opinion/444355/carl-j-casagrande-v-james-agoritsas-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.1984); <i>Isaac,</i> 706 F.2d at 16. As a corollary of that proposition, we think it wholly appropriate to look, at least initially, to the Restatement as an accurate barometer of unarticulated Massachusetts law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pasterczyk,</i> 819 F.2d at 14 (\"Finding no Massachusetts case on point, we turn... to the Restatement.\"); <i>Isaac,</i> 706 F.2d at 16-17 (applying that principle). We see nothing in the situation at hand that would suggest the slightest reason for abandoning this course.</p>\n<p>Second, although no reported Massachusetts case explicitly adopts section 33 of the Second Restatement, at least four cases have cited approvingly to some incarnation of that section. Two of these are decisions of the SJC. The list follows.</p>\n<p>When defining the term \"binding\" in an unrelated statute, the SJC counted section 33's direct lineal ancestor, section 77 of the first <i>Restatement of Judgments</i> (1942),<sup>[4]</sup> as persuasive evidence. <i>Meunier's Case,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span>, 201 (Mass.1946). In another case, the SJC looked to section 77 of the first Restatement as authority for the proposition that declaratory judgments have binding force and effect. <i>Weingartner v. Town of N. Wales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></span>, 136 (Mass.1951). Interestingly, the <i>Weingartner</i> court cited a comment stating that \"[t]he effect of a declaratory judgment in subsequent controversies between the parties depends upon the scope of the declaration.... [A]s to matters not declared ... the parties are not so precluded.\" <i>Restatement of Judgments</i> § 77 cmt. b; <i>see</i> 101 N.E.2d at 132. We regard that statement as highly suggestive (if only by negative implication).</p>\n<p>Two opinions emanating from the state's intermediate appellate court also have exhibited a readiness to look to a corresponding provision contained in tentative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> drafts of the transitional Restatement. <i>See </i><i>Boyd v. Jamaica Plain Co-op. Bank,</i> 7 Mass.App.Ct. 153, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2066627\"><a href=\"/opinion/2066627/boyd-v-jamaica-plain-co-operative-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 779 (Mass.App.Ct.1979); <i>Albano v.

While decisions of a state's intermediate appellate court are not binding on a federal court sitting in diversity, such opinions are entitled to some weight.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>West v. AT &amp; T,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103402\"><a href=\"/opinion/103402/west-v-american-telephone-telegraph-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 237, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the end, this effort proves fruitless.</p>\n<p>Hartford's first proffer consists of cases holding that a final decree in a declaratory judgment action bars a subsequent action for declaratory relief arising out of the same transaction.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fassas,</i> 233 N.E.2d at 925; <i>Sadler v. Indus. Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></span>, 170-71 (Mass.1951). That line of cases provides Hartford no succor.</p>\n<p><i>Sadler</i> illustrates the point. That case involved two appeals to the SJC from orders dismissing similar declaratory judgment actions brought consecutively by a single plaintiff. <i>See</i> 97 N.E.2d at 170. The SJC held that the earlier declaratory judgment action was res judicata as to matters actually litigated in that action. <i>Id.</i> at 171. That ruling tracks the prescription of section 33.</p>\n<p>Hartford's next reference is to a pair of unpublished decisions. The first is <i>Lin v. Cahaly,</i> No. 307493, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1844619</span></span> (Mass.Land Ct. Aug.5, 2005), in which the court was confronted with an argument that claims for trespass and contract damages were precluded by an earlier suit to quiet title. The court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at *2. The judge, in dictum and without meaningful analysis, gratuitously rejected a declaratory judgment exception to the usual rules of claim preclusion. <i>See id.</i> at *3. The second case in this set, <i>Gleed v. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,</i> No. 93-12202, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">543204</span></span>, at *1 (D.Mass. Dec.20, 1993), is likewise bereft of any analysis. Neither decision has any precedential force.</p>\n<p>That ends our safari through Massachusetts case law. While not conclusive, the drift of these cases strengthens our initial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> intuition that the SJC would likely apply section 33 of the Second Restatement in this case. After all, Massachusetts courts generally follow the Restatement; those courts have cited earlier versions of this rule with approbation; and they have recognized that declaratory judgment actions evoke special claim preclusion principles. What remains, however, is to consult a broader spectrum of authorities.</p>\n<p>A canvass of the decisions in other jurisdictions is instructive. The vast majority of states that have addressed this problem unapologetically apply a special rule of claim preclusion, consistent with that of section 33 of the Second Restatement, in the declaratory judgment context. Many of these courts have cited explicitly to some edition of the Restatement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jackinsky v.

Hartford's attempt to pad this list is unavailing: the other cases that it musters are off-point. Some stand for the uncontroversial proposition, wholly consistent with section 33, that claim preclusion applies to matters actually litigated and decided in the original declaratory judgment action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fournier v. Ill. Cas. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1815325\"><a href=\"/opinion/1815325/fournier-v-illinois-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 260-61 (Iowa 1986). Others are cases that do not address whether the declaratory judgment context makes a difference. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith v.

In general, they subscribe to the view that declaratory judgments should be accorded less preclusive effect than other final judgments. The preeminent authority is the Second Restatement itself (which, of course, articulates the very rule on which Robinson's appeal hinges). Other texts march to the same beat. <i>See</i> David L. Shapiro, <i>Civil Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions</i> 63 (2001) (\"[I]ssues not litigated in the declaratory actionperhaps because they were not foreseeable or because the plaintiff was seeking only a limited clarification of his rights and dutiesshould not be foreclosed in a later coercive action arising out of the same controversy.\"); <i>see also</i> Rosemary Gregor et al., <i>American Jurisprudence 2d Declaratory Judgments</i> § 248 (2d ed.2003) (similar); James Wm. Moore, <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> § 131.24[3] (3d ed.2008) (noting that public policy goals are \"furthered when a plaintiff who has sought solely declarative relief is allowed to seek additional coercive relief based on the same claim\"); Charles A. Wright &amp; Mary K. Kane, <i>Law of Federal Courts</i> 723-24 (6th ed.2002) (similar). <i>But cf.</i> 18A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 4446 (2d ed.2002) (noting that \"traditional doctrine has refused to apply claim preclusion to an action for declaratory relief alone,\" yet criticizing that practice).</p>\n<p>Hartford's response consists mainly of citation to law review articles and notes, most of ancient vintage, that lament the difficulties inherent in the Restatement approach. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Note, <i>Declaratory Judgment and Matured Causes of Action,</i> 53 Colum. L.Rev. 1130, 1132-33 (1953); <i>Developments in the Law: Declaratory Judgments 1941-1949,</i> 62 Harv. L.Rev. 787, 843 (1949); <i>Developments in the Law: Res Judicata,</i> 65 Harv. L.Rev. 818, 881-82 (1952); <i>Recent Decisions,</i> 52 Mich. L.Rev. 139, 143 (1953).<sup>[7]</sup> The short answer to these musty lamentations is that the American Law Institute subsequently rejected them and reaffirmed the special rule of claim preclusion for declaratory judgments. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 33.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> This brings us to policy rationales that may bear upon the question. The upshot of that consideration is a mixed bag. On the one hand, claim preclusion is a widely recognized means of husbanding judicial resources. <i>See </i><i>Heacock v. Heacock,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></span>, 153 (Mass.1988) (observing that claim preclusion is \"based on the idea that the party to be precluded has had the incentive and opportunity to litigate the matter fully in the first lawsuit\"). On the other hand, judicial resources also are conserved by the availability of a declaratory judgment mechanism; the prompt and efficient use of that mechanism enables courts \"to clarify the legal relationships of parties before they have been disturbed thereby tending towards avoidance of full-blown litigation.\" <i>Harborside,</i> 959 F.2d at 373. It would frustrate this latter policy were parties required to bring, as part of a declaratory judgment action, all conceivable claims and counterclaims on pain of preclusion. The Second Restatement has weighed these competing policy rationales and concluded sensibly, in our viewthat, on balance, public policy is furthered rather than retarded by the ready availability of a no-strings-attached declaratory remedy that is simpler, faster, and less nuclear than a suit for coercive relief. <i>Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 33 cmt. c.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, we note that the provision of Massachusetts law that authorizes declaratory judgments specifically anticipates the possibility of further proceedings. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, § 5 (allowing \"[f]urther relief based on a declaratory judgment\" whenever necessary or proper). This provision sets in place a structure for declaratory judgments that is at odds with the rigid deployment of conventional principles of claim preclusion. <i>Cf. Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 26(1)(d) (delineating an exception to the normal rules of claim preclusion for cases in which a statutory scheme permits a splitting of the claim).</p>\n<p>To this point, all roads lead to Rome. The district court, however, expressed concern that Robinson may have engaged in strategic litigation by intentionally splitting its claims between the original declaratory action and the later damages action. <i>See Robinson II,</i> 533 F.Supp.2d at 221. But every lawyeror, at least every competent lawyerfactors strategic considerations into decisions affecting his or her handling of litigation. Moreover, the type of claim-splitting that worried the district court is precisely what the Restatement rule contemplates. The antidote, if one is needed, should be administered in the <i>first</i> action, in which the judge can refuse to entertain the declaratory judgment petition absent joinder of coercive claims.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 33 cmt. c; <i>cf. </i><i>El Día, Inc. v. Hernández Colón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583336\"><a href=\"/opinion/583336/el-dia-inc-v-rafael-hernandez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 493 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that declaratory relief is a matter of discretion). Here, the trial justice in the first action saw no need to impose such a qualification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. After canvassing the Massachusetts cases, examining the precedents elsewhere, consulting scholarly literature, and weighing relevant policy rationales, we believe that we can predict with some assurance that the SJC, if faced with the question presented in this appeal, would likely follow the rule set out in section 33 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments. In other words, we do not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> think that the SJC would construe a final judgment in a declaratory action that did not raise coercive claims as barring a subsequent damages action asserting such claims, even though the latter arose out of the same transaction. Thus, we reverse the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The policy defined a pollutant as \"any solid, liquid, gaseous, or thermal irritant or containment, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals, and waste.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Neither side asked the district court to certify the controlling question to the Supreme Judicial Court. <i>See</i> S.J.C. Rule 1:03. On appeal, the parties have continued to eschew any such request.</p>\n<p>[3]  Our recent decision in <i>Herman v. Meiselman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203478\"><a href=\"/opinion/203478/herman-v-meiselman/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2008), does not materially advance this inquiry. The preclusive judgment in <i>Herman</i> was not a declaratory judgment but a consent decree awarding among other things money damages. <i>See id.</i> at 62 n. 5.</p>\n<p>[4]  Section 77 states:\n</p>\n<p>Where an action is brought to obtain a declaration of the rights or other legal relations of the parties to the action, whether or not further relief is or could be prayed, a final and valid judgment declaring such rights or other relations is binding between the parties in subsequent actions.</p>\n<p>[5]  Hartford points to <i>Boyd</i> as a case applying conventional principles of claim preclusion to bar causes of action that could have been (but were not) brought in a prior declaratory action. While <i>Boyd</i> is far from a model of clarity, it relied upon a tentative draft of the transitional Restatement (now section 33) to find that the claims in the second action were barred as matters actually declared in the first action. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233523\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233523/estate-of-george-a-dzialowy-v-dzialowy/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 368 N.E.2d at 781. Anything else in the opinion is dictum. At a bare minimum this somewhat schizophrenic decision suggests that section 33 of the Second Restatement applies except when both the original and subsequent actions are for declaratory judgment. That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p>[6]  In this regard, Hartford's citation to <i>Fassas,</i> 233 N.E.2d at 924, is inapposite. In <i>Fassas,</i> the prior action sought primarily injunctive relief and thus did not implicate the special rule for claim preclusion with which we are concerned. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> § 33 cmt. d (explaining that actions dominated by claims for coercive relief should not be construed as declaratory judgment actions for purposes of section 33 merely because the complaint may contain an incidental prayer for declaratory relief).</p>\n<p>[7]  Two more recent law review notes advance policy arguments favoring Robinson's position. Ryan R. Dreyer, Note, <i>Civil Procedure Discouraging Declaratory Actions in Minnesota The Res Judicata Effect of Declaratory Judgments in Light of State v. Joseph,</i> 29 Wm. Mitchell L.Rev. 613, 626-27 &amp; nn. 112-116 (2002); Elizabeth L. Hisserich, Note, <i>The Collison of Declaratory Judgments and Res Judicata,</i> 48 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 159, 173-75 &amp; nn. 53-61 (2000).</p>\n<p>[8]  As Hartford points out, this may be advantageous because, once joined, those coercive claims can then be stayed. But to say that such a praxis has advantages is not to say that it is mandatory.</p>\n\n</div>",
