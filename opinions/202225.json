After a two-day jury trial, Lenard Gibson\n\nwas found guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(g)(1) and 924(e).         On appeal, Gibson\n\nchallenges the district court's denial of his motion for a new\n\ntrial.    Specifically, Gibson asserts that the government failed to\n\ndisprove his entrapment defense.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            We recite the facts relevant to Gibson's entrapment\n\ndefense as they are reflected in the record.          Kenneth Vieira was a\n\nfederally licensed dealer of firearms and proprietor at a gun store\n\nlocated in Riverside, Rhode Island.        On September 6, 2004, Gibson\n\nentered   Vieira's   store   and   inquired   about   gun   types   and,   in\n\nparticular, how he could purchase a Glock pistol.            Vieira showed\n\nGibson how to disassemble and clean the pistol; thereafter, Gibson\n\npracticed taking the gun apart.           Subsequently, Vieira informed\n\nGibson of the requirements for purchasing a gun, including two sets\n\nof criminal background checks.      Gibson asked if it was permissible\n\nfor another person to purchase a gun on his behalf, prompting\n\nVieira to ask Gibson if there was a problem.           Gibson told Vieira\n\nthat he was a felon, whereupon Vieira told Gibson he was prohibited\n\nfrom buying a gun and that he was not even allowed in the store.\n\nVieira informed Gibson that he would have to speak to \"his boss\".\n\nGibson gave Vieira a $100 cash deposit to ensure that Vieira did\n\nnot sell the Glock pistol to another buyer.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           Immediately after Gibson left the store, Vieira reported\n\nthe incident to an ATF agent.    At the agent's behest, Vieira called\n\nGibson on the following day to inform him that the purchase could\n\ngo forward.     Gibson returned to the store that same day, and in the\n\npresence of Vieira and the agent (who was posing as an employee),\n\nGibson   paid    the   outstanding   balance   for   the   Glock   pistol,\n\napproximately $400, and practiced disassembling the gun.            Gibson\n\nreiterated that a friend, Randi Scott, would complete the necessary\n\npaperwork for purchase of the Glock.\n\n           Later that same day, Gibson returned with Scott, who\n\nbegan filling out the paperwork.       In the meantime, Gibson selected\n\nanother firearm he wished to purchase, a .38 semiautomatic pistol.\n\nHe told Vieira that he wanted to purchase this gun and asked how\n\nthe gun functioned.      After Scott finished the paperwork, Vieira\n\ninformed them that he would contact them when the guns were ready\n\nfor pick up.\n\n           Around September 14, the ATF agent instructed Vieira to\n\ncall Gibson to tell him that the firearms would be ready on\n\nSeptember 16. Vieira called Gibson, who informed him that he would\n\nreturn to the store on the morning of the 16th.       When Gibson failed\n\nto appear by the afternoon of the 16th, Vieira called Gibson\n\n(acting on instructions from the ATF agent) to find out when he was\n\ncoming. Gibson explained that Scott was unavailable to pick up the\n\nguns and asked whether he could pick up the guns himself.            After\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fconsulting with the ATF agent, Vieira informed Gibson that this\n\nwould be acceptable.     Gibson arrived at the store approximately 30\n\nminutes later.     There, Gibson took possession of the two guns, and\n\nhe also purchased two boxes of ammunition and other accessories.\n\nGibson paid a total of $650 in cash, leaving a balance of $75,\n\nwhich he agreed to pay within a week.         On leaving the store with\n\nhis purchases, Gibson was arrested.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           A district court may grant a motion for a new trial if\n\nthe jury \"reached a seriously erroneous result.\"           United States v.\n\nRivera   Rangel,   396   F.3d   476,   486   (1st   Cir.   2005)   (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).             Review of a district\n\ncourt's \"denial of a motion for a new trial is for manifest abuse\n\nof discretion.\"    United States v. Glenn 389 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           We have held that there is entrapment when:\n\n     the criminal design originates with the officials of the\n     Government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent\n     person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and\n     induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\n     Using this definition, it is easy to see that there are\n     two necessary prongs to the entrapment defense:\n     government inducement of the crime, and a lack of\n     predisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in\n     the criminal conduct.\n\nUnited States v. Walter, 434 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2006).            Once a\n\ndefendant introduces a defense of entrapment, \"the government [can]\n\nsucceed on the entrapment issue if it prove[s] beyond a reasonable\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdoubt that either 1) there was no inducement; or 2) that the\n\ndefendant was predisposed.\"          Id.\n\n            Here, the government prevailed in defeating Gibson's\n\nentrapment defense at trial by presenting overwhelming evidence of\n\npredisposition.     A reasonable jury could conclude that Gibson: (1)\n\nvoluntarily      visited    the   store     for   the   first   time;    (2)    was\n\ndetermined to purchase a firearm despite the proprietor's concerns;\n\n(3) left a deposit on one firearm; (4)             raised the idea of using a\n\n\"straw\" buyer; (5) showed interest in a second gun; (6) provided\n\nthe   \"straw\"    buyer;    (7)    asked     for   demonstrations    of    how   to\n\ndisassemble and maintain the firearms, and practiced in the gun\n\nstore; and (8) using a substantial cash payment, purchased both\n\nfirearms.\n\n            Gibson asserts that on the day alleged in the indictment,\n\nSeptember 16th, he had a \"change of heart\" and testified to that\n\neffect during the trial -- in essence asserting that he lacked the\n\nnecessary predisposition.         He claims that he would not have taken\n\npossession of the firearms on that day except for the inducement on\n\nthe part of the government.          Given the evidence adduced at trial,\n\na reasonable jury was certainly free to reject his testimony and\n\nhis \"change of heart\" story.\n\n            In   summary,    there    was    no   discernible    error    by    the\n\ndistrict court, much less a manifest abuse of discretion, in its\n\ndenial of Gibson's motion for a new trial.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -6-\n\f",
