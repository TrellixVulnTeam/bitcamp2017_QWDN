Raymond Vargas-Dávila challenges\n\nas substantively unreasonable a sentence imposed in connection with\n\nthe revocation of a term of supervised release.              After careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm.\n\n           The facts are straightforward.        After the appellant pled\n\nguilty to a single count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics, see\n\n21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, the district court sentenced him to\n\neighty-four months in prison and a four-year term of supervised\n\nrelease.   The appellant began serving his supervised release term\n\non October 6, 2006.\n\n           Less than halfway through that term, he violated the\n\nconditions of his supervised release.           On January 13, 2009, the\n\ndistrict   court   revoked   the   grant   of   supervised      release   and\n\nsentenced him to an additional eleven months in prison, to be\n\nfollowed by a new two-year period of supervised release.                  The\n\nappellant unsuccessfully appealed this disposition.          United States\n\nv.   Vargas-Dávila,   No.    09-1303     (1st    Cir.   March    10,   2010)\n\n(unpublished judgment).\n\n           The appellant served the incarcerative portion of the\n\nrevocation sentence and began serving his new term of supervised\n\nrelease.    On May 12, 2010, a probation officer notified the\n\ndistrict court by motion that the appellant had again violated\n\nrelease conditions.    In this regard, the probation officer noted\n\nthe appellant's unauthorized departure from Puerto Rico and his\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\ffailure to advise the probation department prior to changing his\n\nplace of residence.\n\n          The district court issued an arrest warrant, and the\n\nauthorities detained the appellant in Chicago, Illinois, on May 14,\n\n2010.   Ten days later, the probation officer, in a supplementary\n\nfiling, alleged that the appellant had committed yet another\n\nviolation by neglecting to notify the probation department of his\n\nearlier May 7, 2010 arrest within the allotted time.\n\n          At the revocation hearing, the appellant conceded the\n\nviolations.   He asked that, should his existing term of supervised\n\nrelease be revoked, the court impose a sentence at the bottom of\n\nthe advisory guideline sentencing range (GSR).   The court rejected\n\nthis entreaty, revoked the period of supervision, and sentenced the\n\nappellant to a fresh twenty-four months in prison.   In explaining\n\nits rationale for eschewing the GSR (five to eleven months), the\n\ncourt noted that the guidelines were merely advisory and, given the\n\nappellant's \"history of non-compliance,\" a sentence beyond the GSR\n\nwas appropriate.\n\n          This timely appeal followed.      In it, the appellant\n\nchallenges his sentence as substantively unreasonable. Among other\n\nthings, he argues that the sentencing court improperly considered\n\ncertain information while failing to consider relevant sentencing\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\ffactors.       We review the sentence for abuse of discretion.1         United\n\nStates v. Santiago-Rivera, 594 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir. 2010); United\n\nStates v. McInnis, 429 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).              The touchstone\n\nof     abuse    of    discretion   review     in    federal    sentencing     is\n\nreasonableness.       Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 46 (2007).          In\n\nthis       context,   \"reasonableness    is   a    protean   concept,   not   an\n\nabsolute.\"       United States v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).       Thus, any one of several sentences may be reasonable in a\n\nparticular case.        Id.   Consequently, we will set aside a sentence\n\nonly if the district court's determination falls outside the\n\n\"expansive boundaries\" of the entire range of reasonable sentences.\n\nId.\n\n               Typically, the first step in reviewing the reasonableness\n\nof a sentence is an evaluation of its procedural orthodoxy.              Gall,\n\n552 U.S. at 51; United States v. Madera-Ortiz, 637 F.3d 26, 30 (1st\n\nCir. 2011).       Here, however, the appellant makes no claim that the\n\ndistrict court either miscalculated the GSR or otherwise committed\n\na procedural error.           Accordingly, we proceed directly to the\n\nsubstantive reasonableness of the sentence.\n\n               An inquiry into the substantive reasonableness of a\n\nsentence must \"take into account the totality of the circumstances,\n\nincluding the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\"\n\n\n       1\n      Of course, a material error of law invariably constitutes an\nabuse of discretion. See United States v. Anon. Deft., 629 F.3d\n68, 73 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fGall, 552 U.S. at 51.          We glean the sentencing court's rationale\n\nfrom the transcript of the sentencing hearing, see 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3553(c),    the   court's       written     statement     of       reasons,   id.\n\n§ 3553(c)(2), and an examination of the points argued by the\n\nparties     (including      those      memorialized     in       the     presentence\n\ninvestigation report).         See Martin, 520 F.3d at 93; United States\n\nv. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n            Congress enacted a specific statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e),\n\nto guide a sentencing court in the exercise of its discretion to\n\nmodify or revoke a term of supervised release.                     This provision\n\nexplicitly incorporates by reference some — but not all — of the\n\nsentencing     factors   described       in    18   U.S.C.   §     3553(a).       The\n\nenumerated factors include the nature and circumstances of the\n\noffense, id. § 3553(a)(1); the history and characteristics of the\n\noffender,      id.;   the       need    for     adequate      deterrence,         id.\n\n§   3553(a)(2)(B);       the     need     to    protect      the       public,    id.\n\n§ 3553(a)(2)(C); and the penological needs of the offender, such as\n\nthe need for special care or treatment, id. § 3553(a)(2)(D). While\n\nthe court must consider all of the incorporated section 3553(a)\n\nfactors, it need not do so mechanically.              United States v. Dixon,\n\n449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            In the case at hand, the record makes manifest that the\n\ndistrict court sufficiently considered the relevant factors.                      The\n\nhearing transcript reveals that the court assessed the nature and\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fcircumstances of the violations using the probation officer's\n\nfilings and the appellant's statements.              It also examined the\n\nappellant's past history of substance abuse.                 Emphasizing the\n\nappellant's   record      of   repeated      non-compliance     with    release\n\nconditions, the court found a term of imprisonment justified. This\n\nfinding implicitly took into account the need to afford adequate\n\ndeterrence and the need to protect the public from further crimes.\n\n           Against this background, the court mulled the GSR (five\n\nto eleven months), which was based on a Grade C violation and a\n\ncriminal   history   category     of   three.2      It    concluded    that   the\n\nappellant's checkered record of non-compliance called for a term of\n\nimmurement significantly beyond that contemplated by the GSR.                   It\n\nsettled upon a penalty of twenty-four months.\n\n           Given that this was the appellant's second series of\n\nsupervised release violations, we think that this sentence is well\n\nwithin the universe of reasonable sentences.             It is said that past\n\nis prologue, William Shakespeare, The Tempest act 2, sc. 1 (1611),\n\nand a sentencing court is entitled to give considerable weight to\n\na defendant's failure to abide by the conditions of previous\n\nsentences.    The length of an increased sentence is necessarily a\n\njudgment call and, within wide limits, deference is due to the\n\ntrier's on-the-spot perceptions.          Here, we are confident that the\n\n\n\n     2\n       The    appellant    does   not     dispute   the    accuracy    of     this\ntaxonomy.\n\n                                       -6-\n\flower court appropriately tailored the twenty-four month sentence\n\nto reflect both the past behavior of the offender and the other\n\nrealities of the situation.\n\n           Contrary to the appellant's protestations, the sentence\n\nimposed does not offend section 3583(e)(3).               The appellant's\n\nunderlying criminal conviction was for a Class B felony.             See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3559(a)(2).         Thus, section 3583(e)(3) permitted the\n\nsentencing court to impose a prison sentence of up to three years.\n\nSee United States v. Eirby, 515 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2008).              The\n\nsentence actually imposed was comfortably below this maximum.\n\n           The   appellant    also    contends    that   his   sentence   is\n\nunreasonable because the district court improperly considered the\n\ngovernment's statement at the revocation hearing that he had\n\n\"demonstrate[d] a lack of respect for the Court's order[s].\"\n\nRelatedly, he calumnizes the court's observation that he had a\n\n\"history of non-compliance with the supervised release conditions.\"\n\nIn his view, these points are off-limits because they substantially\n\noverlap   with   section   3553(a)(2)(A)'s       instruction   \"to   promote\n\nrespect for the law\" — an instruction not incorporated into the\n\ncompendium of factors specifically incorporated by reference in\n\nsection 3583(e).\n\n           This argument is unavailing. Although section 3583(e)(3)\n\nincorporates by reference, and thus encourages, consideration of\n\ncertain enumerated subsections of section 3553(a), it does not\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fforbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\n\nSee United States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 47 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\nMoreover, one of the incorporated provisions — the command that a\n\nsentencing   court    must    consider         the   need    \"to    afford   adequate\n\ndeterrence,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B) — leads inexorably to the\n\nconclusion    that    a    sentencing      court      properly      may   consider    a\n\ndefendant's history of non-compliance with conditions of supervised\n\nrelease.    See Williams, 443 F.3d at 48.\n\n            In a last-ditch argument, the appellant relies on United\n\nStates v.    Franquiz-Ortiz,       607     F.3d      280    (1st Cir.      2010)    (per\n\ncuriam).    This reliance is mislaid.             There, we vacated a sentence\n\nbecause the scant record provided no explanation for the district\n\ncourt's decision to impose the maximum sentence permitted.                     Id. at\n\n282.    Here, by contrast, the record satisfactorily reveals the\n\nbasis for the sentence imposed and the court sufficiently explained\n\nits sentencing rationale.\n\n            We need go no further.              \"Sentencing under an advisory\n\nguidelines regime is more art than science.\"                       United States v.\n\nAnon. Deft., 629 F.3d 68, 78 (1st Cir. 2010).                      In this instance,\n\nthe    district    court   used    its    superior         coign   of    vantage,    its\n\nfamiliarity with the appellant's case, and its experience in\n\nsentencing    to    arrive    at   a     sentence      within      the    universe    of\n\nacceptable outcomes. Grounding its sentencing determination in the\n\ntotality of the circumstances at hand, the court articulated a\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fplausible rationale and arrived at a sensible result.   No more is\n\nexigible.   See, e.g., id.; United States v. Carrasco-De-Jesús, 589\n\nF.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

Accordingly, we proceed directly to the\n\nsubstantive reasonableness of the sentence.\n\n               An inquiry into the substantive reasonableness of a\n\nsentence must \"take into account the totality of the circumstances,\n\nincluding the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\"\n\n\n       1\n      Of course, a material error of law invariably constitutes an\nabuse of discretion.

This provision\n\nexplicitly incorporates by reference some — but not all — of the\n\nsentencing     factors   described       in    18   U.S.C.   §     3553(a).       The\n\nenumerated factors include the nature and circumstances of the\n\noffense, id. § 3553(a)(1); the history and characteristics of the\n\noffender,      id.;   the       need    for     adequate      deterrence,         id.\n\n§   3553(a)(2)(B);       the     need     to    protect      the       public,    id.\n\n§ 3553(a)(2)(C); and the penological needs of the offender, such as\n\nthe need for special care or treatment, id. § 3553(a)(2)(D). While\n\nthe court must consider all of the incorporated section 3553(a)\n\nfactors, it need not do so mechanically.              United States v. Dixon,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202231\"><a href=\"/opinion/202231/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            In the case at hand, the record makes manifest that the\n\ndistrict court sufficiently considered the relevant factors.                      The\n\nhearing transcript reveals that the court assessed the nature and\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fcircumstances of the violations using the probation officer's\n\nfilings and the appellant's statements.              It also examined the\n\nappellant's past history of substance abuse.                 Emphasizing the\n\nappellant's   record      of   repeated      non-compliance     with    release\n\nconditions, the court found a term of imprisonment justified. This\n\nfinding implicitly took into account the need to afford adequate\n\ndeterrence and the need to protect the public from further crimes.\n\n           Against this background, the court mulled the GSR (five\n\nto eleven months), which was based on a Grade C violation and a\n\ncriminal   history   category     of   three.2      It    concluded    that   the\n\nappellant's checkered record of non-compliance called for a term of\n\nimmurement significantly beyond that contemplated by the GSR.                   It\n\nsettled upon a penalty of twenty-four months.\n\n           Given that this was the appellant's second series of\n\nsupervised release violations, we think that this sentence is well\n\nwithin the universe of reasonable sentences.             It is said that past\n\nis prologue, William Shakespeare, The Tempest act 2, sc. 1 (1611),\n\nand a sentencing court is entitled to give considerable weight to\n\na defendant's failure to abide by the conditions of previous\n\nsentences.    The length of an increased sentence is necessarily a\n\njudgment call and, within wide limits, deference is due to the\n\ntrier's on-the-spot perceptions.          Here, we are confident that the\n\n\n\n     2\n       The    appellant    does   not     dispute   the    accuracy    of     this\ntaxonomy.\n\n                                       -6-\n\flower court appropriately tailored the twenty-four month sentence\n\nto reflect both the past behavior of the offender and the other\n\nrealities of the situation.\n\n           Contrary to the appellant's protestations, the sentence\n\nimposed does not offend section 3583(e)(3).               The appellant's\n\nunderlying criminal conviction was for a Class B felony.             See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3559(a)(2).         Thus, section 3583(e)(3) permitted the\n\nsentencing court to impose a prison sentence of up to three years.\n\nSee United States v. Eirby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203139\"><a href=\"/opinion/203139/united-states-v-eirby/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36 (1st Cir. 2008).              The\n\nsentence actually imposed was comfortably below this maximum.\n\n           The   appellant    also    contends    that   his   sentence   is\n\nunreasonable because the district court improperly considered the\n\ngovernment's statement at the revocation hearing that he had\n\n\"demonstrate[d] a lack of respect for the Court's order[s].\"\n\nRelatedly, he calumnizes the court's observation that he had a\n\n\"history of non-compliance with the supervised release conditions.\"\n\nIn his view, these points are off-limits because they substantially\n\noverlap   with   section   3553(a)(2)(A)'s       instruction   \"to   promote\n\nrespect for the law\" — an instruction not incorporated into the\n\ncompendium of factors specifically incorporated by reference in\n\nsection 3583(e).\n\n           This argument is unavailing. Although section 3583(e)(3)\n\nincorporates by reference, and thus encourages, consideration of\n\ncertain enumerated subsections of section 3553(a), it does not\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fforbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\n\nSee United States v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793858\"><a href=\"/opinion/793858/united-states-v-paul-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\nMoreover, one of the incorporated provisions — the command that a\n\nsentencing   court    must    consider         the   need    \"to    afford   adequate\n\ndeterrence,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B) — leads inexorably to the\n\nconclusion    that    a    sentencing      court      properly      may   consider    a\n\ndefendant's history of non-compliance with conditions of supervised\n\nrelease.    See Williams, 443 F.3d at 48.\n\n            In a last-ditch argument, the appellant relies on United\n\nStates v.    Franquiz-Ortiz,       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148234\"><a href=\"/opinion/148234/united-states-v-franquiz-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>      <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">    (1st Cir.      2010)    (per\n\ncuriam).    This reliance is mislaid.             There, we vacated a sentence\n\nbecause the scant record provided no explanation for the district\n\ncourt's decision to impose the maximum sentence permitted.                     Id. at\n\n282.    Here, by contrast, the record satisfactorily reveals the\n\nbasis for the sentence imposed and the court sufficiently explained\n\nits sentencing rationale.\n\n            We need go no further.              \"Sentencing under an advisory\n\nguidelines regime is more art than science.\"                       United States v.\n\nAnon.
