Appellant Rosaura Gonzalez-Rucci\n\nbrought this action, pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(\"FTCA\") and the Bivens doctrine, see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named\n\nAgents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), against\n\nthe United States, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(\"INS\"),1 and a number of immigration officers.                    The complaint\n\nasserts       claims   for    malicious    prosecution,    abuse    of   process,\n\nnegligence,      intentional      infliction    of   emotional     distress,   and\n\nviolations of various constitutional rights.                The upshot of the\n\ncomplaint       is   that    because   Gonzalez   turned   down    the   romantic\n\novertures of defendant immigration officer Andres Nuñez, Nuñez and\n\nhis colleagues used their official positions to destroy her law\n\npractice, to obtain warrants to search her home and office, to\n\nprocure her arrest, and to secure a criminal indictment against\n\nher.       The alleged harassment began in 1995; peaked with Gonzalez's\n\nindictment for various criminal offenses on September 26, 1996; and\n\ncontinued for some months after her acquittal on February 6, 1997.\n\n\n\n               On July 31, 2002, the district court granted defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss and entered judgment, concluding that all of\n\nGonzalez's claims were cognizable either under the FTCA or as\n\n\n\n       1\n      In March 2003, the relevant functions of INS were assumed by\nthe Department of Homeland Security in a reorganized Bureau of\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement. We will continue to refer to\nINS for simplicity throughout this opinion.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fBivens claims, but that both the FTCA and Bivens claims were\n\nuntimely.    On August 15, 2002, Gonzalez moved for relief from\n\njudgment under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 60(b) as to her FTCA claims,\n\narguing that the district court miscalculated the filing date. The\n\ngovernment responded that even if the FTCA claims were timely,\n\nGonzalez's motion should be denied because she failed to state\n\nclaims under the FTCA upon which relief could be granted.\n\n            In its order addressing Gonzalez's Rule 60(b) motion, the\n\ndistrict court reaffirmed its holding that the Bivens claims were\n\ntime-barred,    but   agreed   that    the    FTCA     claims   were   timely.\n\nNonetheless, the court denied the motion because, in its view, the\n\nmalicious prosecution and abuse of process claims were inadequately\n\npleaded under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6). The court held that the\n\nindictment \"conclusively\" established the existence of probable\n\ncause, foreclosing the malicious prosecution claim. The court also\n\nheld that the abuse of process claim was not cognizable because\n\nonly defendant Nuñez was alleged to have had a bad motive; bringing\n\na lawsuit was not an abuse of process; it was too speculative to\n\nconclude that a grand jury handed down an indictment to coerce\n\nGonzalez into a relationship with Nuñez; and that the probable\n\ncause determination     preempted      any   alleged    improper   collateral\n\nobjectives by the defendants.         Gonzalez's notice of appeal, filed\n\non January 26, 2004, refers only to the order denying the Rule\n\n60(b) motion.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f             On appeal, Gonzalez argues that her claims for malicious\n\nprosecution and abuse of process were adequately pleaded, her\n\nBivens claims were not time-barred, and the district court failed\n\nto address several of her other FTCA claims.             Appellees respond\n\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\n\nRule 60(b)2 motion because the abuse of process and malicious\n\nprosecution claims were foreclosed by the indictment and/or were\n\ninadequately pleaded, and that no timely appeal was taken as to the\n\nBivens claims.\n\n             We begin by considering which issues are properly before\n\nus.       Gonzalez did not timely appeal from the July 31, 2002\n\njudgment.    See Fed. R. App. P. 4 (a); Garcia-Velazquez v. Frito Lay\n\nSnacks Caribbean, 358 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 2004).             Thus, we only\n\nhave jurisdiction to consider the order denying Rule 60(b) relief.\n\nSee Frito Lay, 358 F.3d at 11.        While the Bivens timeliness issue\n\nwas not     clearly   raised   in   Gonzalez's   Rule   60(b)   motion,   the\n\ndistrict court nonetheless considered it in its order.           Therefore,\n\nwe conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider all of Gonzalez's\n\nclaims.\n\n\n\n      2\n       We note that Appellant did not specify whether her motion to\nreconsider was brought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 or Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60. There is some indication in the record that the district judge\nthought the former, while the parties on appeal assert the latter.\nAs neither side raises any issue about this matter, we will let it\npass.   However, we caution that the two rules are not freely\ninterchangeable.     See generally Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux\nRecords, 370 F.3d 183, 188-89 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             A district court's denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is\n\ntypically reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Caissie v. Dubois,\n\n346   F.3d    213,     215-16     (1st   Cir.       2003).   Rule    60(b)    relief      is\n\n\"extraordinary in nature,\" and to warrant such relief a movant must\n\ndemonstrate       \"that    (1)    the    motion      is   timely,    (2)     exceptional\n\ncircumstances        justify      granting      extraordinary        relief,      and    (3)\n\nvacating the judgment will not cause unfair prejudice to the\n\nopposing party.\"          Id. at 215.         Moreover, a district court should\n\nonly grant Rule 60(b) relief if the moving party demonstrates that\n\nthe underlying claims have a reasonable chance of success on the\n\nmerits.      See id.\n\n             We can dispense with Gonzalez's Bivens contentions in\n\nshort order. Gonzalez's claims accrued no later than February 6,\n\n1997 (with her acquittal), yet she filed no claims(administrative\n\nor judicial) for nearly two years.                  As Bivens actions are subject\n\nto a one-year limitations period, see Roman v. Townsend, 224 F.3d\n\n24,   29   (1st    Cir.    2000),       the    district      court   did    not    err    in\n\nconcluding that these claims were time-barred.                             The district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Gonzalez's FTCA claims were inadequately\n\npleaded is more problematic.\n\n              Under the FTCA, we look to \"law of the place\" where the\n\nalleged wrongful actions occurred, see Rodriguez v. United States,\n\n54 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1995), so Puerto Rico law provides the\n\nrelevant     standards      for    the    substantive        claims.       To     state    a\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\fmalicious prosecution claim, a plaintiff must allege four elements:\n\n\"1) that a criminal action was initiated or instigated by the\n\ndefendants; 2) that the criminal action terminated in favor of\n\nplaintiff[s]; 3) that defendants acted with malice and without\n\nprobable    cause;       and    4)    that    plaintiff[s]         suffered   damages.\"\n\nNogueras-Cartagena v. United States, 172 F. Supp. 2d 296, 315\n\n(D.P.R. 2001).     The only issue here is whether the existence of the\n\ngrand jury indictment was sufficient to defeat the lack of probable\n\ncause requirement.\n\n            Generally,          a     grand        jury    indictment      definitively\n\nestablishes probable cause.                See Abreu-Guzman v. Ford, 69 F. Supp.\n\n2d 274, 285 (D.P.R. 1999)(an indictment \"fair upon its face\" and\n\n\"returned    by    a     properly      constituted         grand    jury   conclusively\n\ndetermines the existence of probable cause\") (citation and internal\n\nquotation omitted).            However, courts have recognized an exception\n\nif law enforcement defendants wrongfully obtained the indictment by\n\nknowingly presenting false testimony to the grand jury. See, e.g.,\n\nRothstein v. Carriere, 373 F.3d 275, 282-83 (2d Cir. 2004)(applying\n\nNew York law); Camiolo v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 334 F.3d\n\n345, 363 (3d Cir. 2003)(applying Pennsylvania law); Moran v.\n\nClarke,    296    F.3d    638,       657    (8th    Cir.   2002)(applying     Missouri\n\nlaw);see also Nogueras-Cartagena, 172 F. Supp. 2d at 315-16.                       Such\n\nallegations are sufficient, at the pleading stage, to rebut the\n\npresumption of probable              cause    established      by    the   grand   jury\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\findictment. Nogueras-Cartagena, 172 F. Supp. 2d at 315-16; cf.\n\nRivera-Marcano v. Normeat Royal Dane Quality A/S, 998 F.2d 34, 38-\n\n39 (1st Cir. 1993)(non-state actor would not be immunized from a\n\nmalicious    prosecution    claim    by    the   independent   prosecutor's\n\ndecision to commence a criminal action if he effectively instigates\n\nthe prosecution by knowingly providing false information to the\n\nauthorities); Negron-Rivera v. Rivera-Claudio, 204 F.3d 287, 290 n.\n\n1 (1st Cir. 2000)(similar); Aponte Matos v. Toledo Davila, 135 F.3d\n\n182, 187-89 (1st Cir. 1998)(an officer is not entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action if there is an issue of fact\n\nas to whether he obtained the warrant relied upon by knowingly\n\npresenting false evidence).          Because Gonzalez alleges that the\n\ndefendants obtained the indictment, as well as the various search\n\nand arrest warrants, through the use of false testimony, she has\n\npleaded a viable claim for malicious prosecution.\n\n            We reach a similar conclusion as to the abuse of process\n\nclaim.   Under Puerto Rico law, \"[t]he two basic elements of abuse\n\nof process are a bad motive, and the use of a legal process for an\n\nimproper,   collateral     objective.\"     Microsoft   Corp.   v.   Computer\n\nWarehouse, 83 F. Supp. 2d 256, 261 (D.P.R. 2000)(citation and\n\ninternal quotation omitted).        Further, while malicious prosecution\n\nclaims are generally directed to a legal action as a whole, abuse\n\nof process typically covers challenges to the legal action's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fprocedural components (e.g., discovery mechanisms or subpoenas).\n\nSee Nogueras-Cartagena, 172 F. Supp. 2d at 316.\n\n            The district court is correct in observing that only\n\nNuñez is specifically alleged to have had a bad motive.             However,\n\nthis is not fatal to Gonzalez's claim, as a wrongful motive in an\n\nabuse of process claim can be inferred from a wrongful act, see\n\nSimon v. Navon, 71 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 1995), and Gonzalez alleges\n\na   host   of   wrongful   acts   committed   by   the   other   defendants.\n\nFurther, while simply bringing a lawsuit may not be an abuse of\n\nprocess, obtaining search and arrest warrants by means of false\n\ntestimony is a proper basis for a claim of abuse of process (at\n\nleast for pleading purposes).        See generally Nogueras-Cartagena,\n\n172 F. Supp. 2d at 316.\n\n            Concerning the \"collateral objective element,\" Gonzalez\n\nalleged that Nuñez sought to punish her for rejecting him and that\n\nthe other defendants were retaliating against her for exercising\n\nher   civil     rights.    These    are    adequate   improper    collateral\n\nobjectives for pleading purposes.           Thus, Gonzalez has stated a\n\nviable abuse of process claim.\n\n              In sum, the district court acknowledged that it was\n\nmistaken in initially holding Gonzalez's FTCA claims time-barred,\n\nbut ruled that she was nevertheless not entitled to relief from\n\njudgment because her malicious prosecution and abuse of process\n\nclaims were inadequately pleaded. As described above, Gonzalez has\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fin fact stated viable malicious prosecution and abuse of process\n\nclaims.     The   district   court    therefore   should   have   granted\n\nGonzalez's motion for relief from judgment.3\n\n\n\n           Affirmed as to Plaintiff's Bivens claims and vacated and\n\nremanded   as     to   Plaintiff's     FTCA   claims.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       In so ruling, we note that the district court failed to\naddress many of Gonzalez's other FTCA claims, including negligence\nand false arrest. Because we are remanding this case for further\nproceedings, the viability of these claims should also be reviewed.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

To state a malicious prosecution claim, a plaintiff must allege four elements: \"1) that a criminal action was initiated or instigated by the defendants; 2) that the criminal action terminated in favor of plaintiff[s]; 3) that defendants acted with malice and without probable cause; and 4) that plaintiff[s] suffered damages.\" <i>Nogueras-Cartagena v. United States,</i> 172 F.Supp.2d 296, 315 (D.P.R.2001). The only issue here is whether the existence of the grand jury indictment was sufficient to defeat the lack of probable cause requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, a grand jury indictment definitively establishes probable cause. <i>See Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> 69 F.Supp.2d 274, 285 (D.P.R.1999)(an indictment \"fair upon its face\" and \"returned by a properly constituted grand jury conclusively determines the existence of probable cause\") (citation and internal quotation omitted). However, courts have recognized an exception if law enforcement defendants wrongfully obtained the indictment by knowingly presenting false testimony to the grand jury. <i>See, e.g., Rothstein v. Carriere,</i> 373 F.3d 275, 282-83 (2d Cir.2004)(applying New York law); <i>Camiolo v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.,</i> 334 F.3d 345, 363 (3d Cir.2003)(applying Pennsylvania law); <i>Moran v. Clarke,</i> 296 F.3d 638, 657 (8th Cir.2002)(applying Missouri law); <i>see also Nogueras-Cartagena,</i> 172 F.Supp.2d at 315-16. Such allegations are sufficient, at the pleading stage, to rebut the presumption of probable cause established by the grand jury indictment. <i>Nogueras-Cartagena,</i> 172 F.Supp.2d at 315-16; <i>cf. Rivera-Marcano v. Normeat Royal Dane Quality a/s,</i> 998 F.2d 34, 38-39 (1st Cir.1993)(non-state actor would not be immunized from a malicious prosecution claim by the independent prosecutor's decision to commence a criminal action if he effectively instigates the prosecution by knowingly providing false information to the authorities); <i>Negron-Rivera v. Rivera-Claudio,</i> 204 F.3d 287, 290 n. 1 (1st Cir.2000)(similar); <i>Aponte Matos v. Toledo Davila,</i> 135 F.3d 182, 187-89 (1st Cir.1998)(an officer is not entitled to qualified immunity in a 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 action if there is an issue of fact as to whether he obtained the warrant relied upon by knowingly presenting false evidence). Because Gonzalez alleges that the defendants obtained the indictment, as well as the various search and arrest warrants, through the use of false testimony, she has pleaded a viable claim for malicious prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach a similar conclusion as to the abuse of process claim. Under Puerto Rico law, \"[t]he two basic elements of abuse of process are a bad motive, and the use of a legal process for an improper, collateral objective.\" <i>Microsoft Corp. v. Computer Warehouse,</i> 83 F.Supp.2d 256, 261 (D.P.R.2000) (citation and internal quotation omitted). Further, while malicious prosecution claims are generally directed to a legal action as a whole, abuse of process typically covers challenges to the legal action's procedural components (e.g., discovery mechanisms or subpoenas). <i>See Nogueras-Cartagena,</i> 172 F.Supp.2d at 316.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court is correct in observing that only Nunez is specifically alleged to have had a bad motive. However, this is not fatal to Gonzalez's claim, as a wrongful motive in an abuse of process claim can be inferred from a wrongful act, <i>see Simon v. Navon,</i> 71 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir.1995), and Gonzalez alleges a host of wrongful acts committed by the other defendants. Further, while simply bringing a lawsuit may not be an abuse of process, obtaining search and arrest warrants by means of false testimony is a proper basis for a claim of abuse of process (at least for pleading purposes). <i>See generally Nogueras-Cartagena,</i> 172 F.Supp.2d at 316.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerning the \"collateral objective element,\" Gonzalez alleged that Nunez sought to punish her for rejecting him and that the other defendants were retaliating against her for exercising her civil rights.

The complaint asserts claims for malicious prosecution, abuse of process, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violations of various constitutional rights. The upshot of the complaint is that because Gonzalez turned down the romantic overtures of defendant immigration officer Andres Nunez, Nunez and his colleagues used their official positions to destroy her law practice, to obtain warrants to search her home and office, to procure her arrest, and to secure a criminal indictment against her. The alleged harassment began in 1995; peaked with Gonzalez's indictment for various criminal offenses on September 26, 1996; and continued for some months after her acquittal on February 6, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, 2002, the district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss and entered judgment, concluding that all of Gonzalez's claims were cognizable either under the FTCA or as <i>Bivens</i> claims, but that both the FTCA and <i>Bivens</i> claims were untimely. On August 15, 2002, Gonzalez moved for relief from judgment under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 60(b) as to her FTCA claims, arguing that the district court miscalculated the filing date. The government responded that even if the FTCA claims were timely, Gonzalez's motion should be denied because she failed to state claims under the FTCA upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order addressing Gonzalez's Rule 60(b) motion, the district court reaffirmed its holding that the <i>Bivens</i> claims were time-barred, but agreed that the FTCA claims were timely. Nonetheless, the court denied the motion because, in its view, the malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims were inadequately pleaded under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6). The court held that the indictment \"conclusively\" established the existence of probable cause, foreclosing the malicious prosecution claim. The court also held that the abuse of process claim was not cognizable because only defendant Nunez was alleged to have had a bad motive; bringing a lawsuit was not an abuse of process; it was too speculative to conclude that a grand jury handed down an indictment to coerce Gonzalez into a relationship with Nunez; and that the probable cause determination preempted any alleged improper collateral objectives by the defendants. Gonzalez's notice of appeal, filed on January 26, 2004, refers only to the order denying the Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gonzalez argues that her claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process were adequately pleaded, her <i>Bivens</i> claims were not time-barred, and the district court failed to address several of her other FTCA claims. Appellees respond that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rule 60(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> motion because the abuse of process and malicious prosecution claims were foreclosed by the indictment and/or were inadequately pleaded, and that no timely appeal was taken as to the <i>Bivens</i> claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by considering which issues are properly before us. Gonzalez did not timely appeal from the July 31, 2002 judgment. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a); <i>Garcia-Velazquez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200837\"><a href=\"/opinion/200837/garcia-velazquez-v-frito-lay-snacks-car/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2004). Thus, we only have jurisdiction to consider the order denying Rule 60(b) relief. <i>See Frito Lay,</i> 358 F.3d at 11. While the <i>Bivens</i> timeliness issue was not clearly raised in Gonzalez's Rule 60(b) motion, the district court nonetheless considered it in its order. Therefore, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider all of Gonzalez's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is typically reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See Caisse v. Dubois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200675\"><a href=\"/opinion/200675/caisse-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 215-16 (1st Cir.2003). Rule 60(b) relief is \"extraordinary in nature,\" and to warrant such relief a movant must demonstrate \"that (1) the motion is timely, (2) exceptional circumstances justify granting extraordinary relief, and (3) vacating the judgment will not cause unfair prejudice to the opposing party.\" <i>Id.</i> at 215. Moreover, a district court should only grant Rule 60(b) relief if the moving party demonstrates that the underlying claims have a reasonable chance of success on the merits. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can dispense with Gonzalez's <i>Bivens</i> contentions in short order. Gonzalez's claims accrued no later than February 6, 1997 (with her acquittal), yet she filed no claims(administrative or judicial) for nearly two years. As <i>Bivens</i> actions are subject to a one-year limitations period, <i>see Roman v. Townsend,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199060\"><a href=\"/opinion/199060/roman-v-townsend/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2000), the district court did not err in concluding that these claims were time-barred.
