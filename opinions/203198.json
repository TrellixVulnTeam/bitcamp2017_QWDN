BELTON,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Selya, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Paul J. Garrity for appellant.\n     Joseph N. Laplante, First Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 21, 2008\n\f             CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.     Appellant Bruce Belton\n\nappeals from his convictions for drug trafficking, drug conspiracy,\n\nand multiple weapons charges following a jury trial in the United\n\nState District Court for the District of New Hampshire.            Belton\n\nchallenges the court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence of\n\ndrugs, weapons and cash found in his Franklin, New Hampshire\n\nresidence on the ground that the affidavit submitted in support of\n\nthe request for the search warrant contained material omissions.\n\nBelton also contends that the court violated the Speedy Trial Act.\n\nWe affirm the convictions.\n\n             In regard to the district court's denial of Belton's\n\nmotion to suppress, we have carefully considered the record and\n\nappellant's arguments in light of the district court's detailed\n\nOrder published as United States v. Belton, 414 F. Supp. 2d 101\n\n(D.N.H. 2006).     We find the court's analysis in its order to be\n\nconvincing. Belton presented below, and now repeats, the arguments\n\nthat   the   warrant   application    was   fatally   flawed   because   it\n\nintentionally or recklessly left out critical facts that were\n\nneeded for a proper understanding of the facts set out in the\n\napplication.     Had these facts been included, Belton says, the\n\naffidavit would have then been insufficient to demonstrate probable\n\ncause for the issuance of a search warrant.               See Franks v.\n\nDelaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978); United States v. Higgins,\n\n995 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"When a defendant offers proof of an\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fomission, the 'issue is whether, even had the omitted statements\n\nbeen included in the affidavit, there was still probable cause to\n\nissue the warrant.'\" (quoting United States v. Rumney, 867 F.2d\n\n714, 720-21 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n            The    district   court   rejected      this    argument.       After\n\nexamining each of the alleged omissions, and with the benefit of an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the court determined that to the extent the\n\nalleged omissions could be characterized as omissions, they were\n\nnot material omissions within Franks.            Belton, 414 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n110.     The court concluded that, even after taking the asserted\n\nomissions into account, the warrant application was not so lacking\n\nin indicia of probable cause as to preclude the government's\n\nreliance on the good-faith exception set out in United States v.\n\nLeon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).       Belton, 414 F. Supp. 2d at 113.\n\n            On    appeal,   Belton    repeats     much   the   same   arguments\n\nrelative to the omission of certain items as he made below.                   In\n\nmaking    those   arguments   now,    he    is   burdened   with   the    adverse\n\nfindings of the district court, which, at this later stage, carry\n\nwith them significant, although not conclusive, weight.                  We apply\n\na mixed standard of review to the district court's denial of a\n\nmotion to suppress, reviewing findings of fact for clear error and\n\nconclusions of law, including whether a particular set of facts\n\nconstitutes probable cause, de novo.             United States v. Dickerson,\n\n514 F.3d 60, 65-66 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing United States v.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fWoodbury, 511 F.3d 93, 95 (1st Cir. 2007)).              To prevail, Belton\n\nmust show that no reasonable view of the evidence supports the\n\ndenial of the motion to suppress.             United States v. Materas, 483\n\nF.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2007).           This he has not done.\n\n             Given the district court's careful assessment of Belton's\n\nspecific     arguments    in     its   well-considered   opinion,   and   our\n\nsubstantial agreement with the court's view of these matters, we\n\nsee no need to undertake herein our own separate exegesis. Suffice\n\nit to say that we have carefully considered appellant's critiques\n\nof the omissions from the affidavit and are satisfied with the\n\ndistrict court's response to, and disposition of, each of them. In\n\nthe end, the district court found that the omitted facts were\n\ninsufficient, had they been included, to cause the affidavit to\n\nfall short of demonstrating probable cause.            Belton, 414 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 110.    We believe that its assessment of Belton's contentions\n\nwas   correct    and     amply     supported.       Accordingly,    following\n\nsubstantially the same path as did the district court in its Order,\n\nwe affirm its denial of the suppression motion.\n\n             Belton also argues that the district court violated the\n\nSpeedy Trial Act in granting three continuances at the request of\n\nBelton himself.     He has waived that argument by failing to seek a\n\ndismissal pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act in the district court.\n\nSee United States v. Rodriguez-Duran, 507 F.3d 749, 768 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (\"Although the sanction for a Speedy Trial Act violation is\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fdismissal of the indictment, the right to dismissal is waived if a\n\ndefendant fails to move for dismissal prior to trial, and even\n\nplain error review is unavailable.\") (citations omitted).   We need\n\ngo no further.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
