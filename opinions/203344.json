Paul A. DeCologero (\"Paul A.\"), his\n\nnephews Paul J. DeCologero (\"Paul J.\") and John P. DeCologero, Jr.\n\n(\"John Jr.\"), and their friend Joseph F. Pavone appeal their\n\nassorted RICO,1 robbery, drug dealing, witness tampering, firearms,\n\nand related conspiracy convictions.   After a thirty-nine day trial\n\non eighteen counts, each defendant was found guilty on some and\n\nacquitted on other of the charges. Each now raises multiple claims\n\non appeal regarding the management of the trial, evidentiary\n\nrulings, the sufficiency of the evidence against them, and other\n\ndiscrete matters.\n\n          We affirm the convictions and also reject John Jr.'s\n\nsentencing appeal.\n\n                                I.\n\n          Because three of the defendants question the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence behind their convictions, we relate the facts in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict.    United States v. Soto-\n\nBeníquez, 356 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2004).     We trace the general\n\ncontours of the case here and leave further recounting for the\n\nanalysis of particular arguments.\n\n          Paul A. ran a criminal enterprise (the \"DeCologero crew\")\n\nbased out of a gym he operated in Woburn, Massachusetts.   Paul J.,\n\nJohn Jr., Pavone, and other associates assisted Paul A. in his\n\n\n\n     1\n          Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18\nU.S.C. § 1961 et seq.\n\n                                -3-\n\fefforts to control a portion of Boston's drug trade.              Part of the\n\ncrew's modus operandi was to beat up and to steal drugs and cash\n\nfrom other drug dealers.         Aislin Silva, a young woman who was a\n\nfriend of crew member Stephen DiCenso, was murdered and dismembered\n\nin an effort to protect the crew's activities.\n\n            Each defendant was convicted of conspiracy to engage in\n\na pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), as well as\n\nthe substantive offense of engaging in a pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).         These convictions required that\n\neach defendant be found to have committed at least two predicate\n\nracketeering acts, which could be either state or federal crimes.\n\nA table of the counts and racketeering acts is provided in the\n\nappendix.    We summarize the racketeering acts for which at least\n\nsome of the defendants were convicted.\n\nA.          Soccorso Robbery - 19952\n\n            In 1995, Paul A. sent John Jr. and Thomas Regan to the\n\nhouse of Philip Soccorso, a marijuana dealer, to steal drugs from\n\nhim. Regan tricked Soccorso into leaving his house and then forced\n\nhim into their car at gun point.      When Soccorso refused to disclose\n\nthe location of his drugs, Regan and John Jr. drove to Paul A.'s\n\nhouse to pick him up and, as Regan recounted, Paul A. \"read\n\n[Soccorso]   the   riot   act\"    about    dealing   drugs   in    Paul   A.'s\n\n\n     2\n          There was conflicting testimony about the exact date of\nthis criminal episode, but it appears to have occurred at some\npoint in 1995.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fterritory.   To add emphasis, John Jr. hit Soccorso with a handgun.\n\nEventually Soccorso told them that his supplier, Gary Ramus, who\n\nwas back at Soccorso's house, might have some drugs. They returned\n\nto the house, and Regan forced Ramus into the car at gunpoint.3\n\nAfter some more haranguing (also at gunpoint), Soccorso and Ramus\n\nagreed to give Paul A. the marijuana stashed at Soccorso's house.\n\n            Regan, Ramus, and Soccorso testified for the government\n\nat trial.    The jury found that Paul A. and John Jr. had committed\n\nthe racketeering acts of armed robbery, the kidnaping of Soccorso\n\nand Ramus, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.\n\nB.          Pesaturo Robbery - November 1995\n\n            Around November 1995, Paul A. agreed with Regan that\n\nRichie Pesaturo, another drug dealer, needed to be taught a lesson\n\nbecause he owed Regan money and had been \"running his mouth\" about\n\nthe crew.    On Paul A.'s orders, Regan, Paul J., and John Jr. went\n\nto Pesaturo's apartment, where John Jr. and Regan beat Pesaturo and\n\nRegan \"read[] him the riot act.\"        The three crew members then\n\nransacked the apartment until they found Pesaturo's cocaine supply\n\nand $11,000.   Before leaving, the three men bound Pesaturo and his\n\nroommate Richard Bentley, who had returned home during the course\n\nof the robbery, with duct tape.    They then went to Paul A.'s place\n\nto divide up the proceeds.\n\n\n     3\n          This is Regan's version of the order of events. Soccorso\nand Ramus testified that Paul A. was picked up after Ramus was\nforced into the car.\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            Regan and Bentley testified at trial about this robbery\n\nand beating.    The jury found that Paul A., John Jr., and Paul J.\n\nhad committed the racketeering acts of robbery under the Hobbs\n\nAct,4 the kidnaping of Pesaturo and Bentley, and possession of\n\ncocaine with intent to distribute.\n\nC.          Finethy Extortion - January/February 1996\n\n            In January or February 1996, Paul A. sent John Jr. and\n\nPavone to the house of Shane Finethy, who sold marijuana on Paul\n\nA.'s behalf.    Finethy had kept $8000 in proceeds from drug sales\n\nwithout Paul A.'s permission, using it for a down payment on a\n\nhouse, and had failed to pay Paul A. back.   Upon arrival, John Jr.\n\nrealized that Finethy had sold the house in question and was\n\npreparing to move.     John Jr. became angry, and he and Pavone hit\n\nFinethy until his face was covered with blood; after Finethy's wife\n\nand baby came into the room, Finethy left the house and John Jr.\n\nand Pavone followed.    Out on the street, they attempted to force\n\nFinethy into their car, with John Jr. threatening Finethy at\n\ngunpoint.   The arrival of a police cruiser broke up the scene, and\n\nFinethy returned to his house.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          See 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (\"Whoever in any way or degree\nobstructs, delays or affects commerce or the movement of any\narticle or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or\nattempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical\nviolence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or\npurpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined\n. . . or imprisoned . . . .\").\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            Finethy and his wife testified at trial, and the jury\n\nfound   that   Paul   A.,   John   Jr.,     and   Pavone   had   committed   the\n\nracketeering act of extortion.\n\nD.          Sapochetti Robbery - October 1996\n\n            In the fall of 1996, Kevin Meuse and Derek Capozzi were\n\nreleased from jail and joined the DeCologero crew.               That October,\n\nthe crew planned to rob and kill Albert \"Big Al\" Sapochetti, a\n\nbookmaker and drug dealer.         With Paul A.'s agreement, John Jr. and\n\nMeuse robbed Sapochetti at gunpoint and beat him, leaving him, his\n\nneighbor, and his girlfriend hog tied with duct tape and wires.\n\nJohn Jr. and Meuse threatened to return for more money and told\n\nSapochetti they were sparing his life because of his girlfriend's\n\npresence.\n\n            Sapochetti's girlfriend testified at trial.            In addition\n\nto finding that Paul A. and John Jr. had committed the racketeering\n\nacts of kidnaping all three victims, the jury also convicted them\n\nof using or carrying a firearm, or aiding and abetting such use,\n\nduring the commission of a violent crime.             The government alleged\n\nthat Paul J. participated in this robbery as well, but the jury\n\nfound his participation not proved.\n\nE.          Stevens Robbery - October 1996\n\n            Also in October 1996, the crew targeted Michael \"Slim\"\n\nStevens, who was selling marijuana in Paul A.'s territory. Paul A.\n\ngave guns to Regan, Capozzi, and Meuse and sent them with Stephen\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fDiCenso, another member of the DeCologero crew, to Stevens's\n\ntownhouse.    Regan and Capozzi beat Stevens and threatened to cut\n\noff his ear with a knife.     Stevens eventually turned over what\n\nmoney he had and led Regan and Capozzi to a stash of marijuana.\n\nBefore leaving, Regan and Capozzi tied up Stevens, his girlfriend,\n\nand another friend of Stevens who had arrived during the robbery.\n\n          Stevens, his girlfriend, Regan, and DiCenso testified\n\nabout this incident at trial.      The jury convicted Paul A. of\n\nrobbery under the Hobbs Act, possession of marijuana with the\n\nintent to distribute, and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm\n\nduring the commission of a violent crime. These crimes, along with\n\narmed robbery and kidnaping, were also proved as to Paul A. as\n\nracketeering acts under RICO.\n\nF.        North Burglary - October 1996\n\n          The crew also burgled the home of Jeffrey North, another\n\nmarijuana dealer, that same October.      When DiCenso told Paul A.\n\nthat North was in jail pending bail, Paul A. sent DiCenso, Paul J.,\n\nand Regan to burgle North's apartment.      DiCenso broke into the\n\napartment and, with the help of the others, found a cache of\n\nweapons, two safes, night vision goggles, and about ten pounds of\n\nmarijuana.5   The burglars packed most of the goods into duffel bags\n\n     5\n          DiCenso testified that all three men were inside North's\napartment. Regan, however, testified that only he and DiCenso went\ninside the apartment. Paul J.'s father, John P. DeCologero, Sr.,\nalso testified that his son had told him that he had remained\noutside the apartment.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fand heaved the safes over the balcony of the apartment to the yard\n\nbelow.   They then loaded \"the bags, a box of grenades, and the\n\nsafes\" into a car and returned to Paul A.'s house.            There Meuse\n\npried open the safes in the presence of the others.            The safes\n\ncontained   various   firearms,   including   two   MAC-11s   (submachine\n\ngun/pistol), an Uzi (submachine gun), and another machine gun with\n\na silencer, as well as money and more drugs.6       Paul A. gave most of\n\nthe guns to DiCenso to store in the home of Aislin Silva, a\n\nnineteen-year-old woman who permitted her friend DiCenso to keep\n\ndrugs in her apartment on behalf of the crew.\n\n            In connection with this burglary, Paul A. and Paul J.\n\nwere found guilty of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to\n\ndistribute, which the jury also found to be a racketeering act, and\n\nof being felons in possession of a firearm.\n\nG.          Silva Witness Tampering and Murder - November 1996\n\n            Paul A. went to Silva's apartment later that month with\n\nDiCenso and Vincent Marino (a.k.a. Gigi Portalla) to show Marino\n\nthe guns.    On November 5, when DiCenso and Paul J. returned to\n\nSilva's apartment on Paul A.'s instructions to pick up some of the\n\nguns, they found the police, who had received a tip about the guns,\n\n\n\n     6\n          DiCenso testified that other guns obtained in the North\nrobbery included an AK-47 (assault rifle), an AR-15 (semi-automatic\nrifle), and a Desert Eagle (semi-automatic pistol), as well as some\nhandguns.    Regan put the number of weapons removed from the\napartment, other than those in the safes, at six to eight rifles in\naddition to a box of hand grenades.\n\n                                   -9-\n\falready there. When DiCenso and Paul J. entered the apartment, the\n\nguns   were    in   plain   view   on    the   floor   and   the   police   were\n\nquestioning Silva; they questioned Paul J. and DiCenso as well and\n\nthen allowed them to leave.\n\n              DiCenso and Paul J. reported back to Paul A. and the crew\n\n-- Pavone, Meuse, Regan, Capozzi, and John P. DeCologero, Sr.\n\n(\"John Sr.\"), the father of John Jr. and Paul J. -- who were\n\ngathered at Pavone's house. Paul A. instructed Pavone and Meuse to\n\nrent a motel room and sent DiCenso and Capozzi to pick up Silva.\n\nAlso on Paul A.'s instructions, DiCenso stayed with Silva for the\n\nnext two nights in different motel rooms.              On November 7, another\n\nmeeting was held at Pavone's house with Silva present.                 DiCenso\n\ntestified that he, Capozzi, Meuse, Pavone, and Paul A. were there,\n\nthough he could not remember at what point Pavone arrived.             Paul A.\n\ntold Silva that their \"attorneys were out of town, but they would\n\ntake care of everything,\" and that in the meantime, Paul A. would\n\narrange for Silva to be taken on a shopping spree in New York City,\n\naccompanied by DiCenso. Pavone drove DiCenso and Silva to New York\n\nthat night in a limousine that Paul A. had borrowed from an\n\nassociate, Anthony (\"Tony\") Bucci. Pavone returned to Boston while\n\nDiCenso and Silva spent five nights in New York City.\n\n              When DiCenso and Silva returned to Boston on November 12,\n\nthey went to Pavone's house, where the others were gathered.\n\nThere, DiCenso, Paul A., and Meuse spoke privately in the kitchen.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fDiCenso told Paul A. that he did not think Silva would \"hold up\"\n\nunder police questioning, to which Paul A. responded, \"She has to\n\nbe killed.\"    Paul A.'s first plan was for DiCenso to give Silva\n\nsome high-grade heroin, telling her it was \"really good cocaine\";\n\nDiCenso was then to wait until Silva was dead before calling 911 to\n\nreport the overdose.     If Silva did not ingest sufficient heroin to\n\ncause a fatal overdose, Meuse was to blow more of it up her nose.\n\nTo this end, Paul A. sent Paul J. to Antonio Centeno, a heroin\n\ndealer in Lowell.      Centeno testified that Paul J. asked him for\n\nheroin \"strong enough for an overdose\" and that he sold Paul J.\n\nthirty bags of heroin.        Although Silva did ingest some of this\n\nheroin, it did not have its intended effect.         Moving to a new plan,\n\nPaul A. told Meuse to kill her.\n\n          The morning of November 13, Meuse arrived at DiCenso's\n\napartment,    where   Silva   was   staying,   and   sent   DiCenso   to   the\n\nhardware store to buy a hacksaw and sheet metal cutters.                   When\n\nDiCenso returned, Silva was dead, and Meuse told DiCenso he had\n\nbroken her neck.       Capozzi arrived to help, and the three men\n\ndismembered Silva's body in the bathtub and packed her remains into\n\ntrash bags.   They drove north, stopping at a Home Depot to purchase\n\nlime and a shovel, and buried Silva's remains in the woods along\n\nthe North Shore.      They then disposed of the remaining evidence in\n\na dumpster in Danvers, washed the car, and stopped at a department\n\nstore to buy three pairs of sneakers and three sweatsuits.\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f               DiCenso testified to the details of the murder described\n\nabove at trial; his testimony was supported by physical evidence\n\nrecovered by the police.           Paul A., Paul J., and Pavone were all\n\nconvicted of conspiracy to tamper with a witness and tampering with\n\na witness by misleading conduct; Paul A. and Paul J. were also\n\nconvicted of tampering with a witness by attempted murder, and Paul\n\nA. was convicted of tampering with a witness by murder.                  These\n\ncrimes, along with the state-law crimes of murder, attempted\n\nmurder, and conspiracy to murder, were also found as racketeering\n\nacts under the substantive RICO charge.\n\n                                         II.\n\n               Paul A., Paul J., John Jr., Pavone, John Sr., and Capozzi\n\nwere       indicted   by   a   federal   grand   jury   in   the   District   of\n\nMassachusetts on October 17, 2001.7\n\n               Paul A. moved to dismiss the RICO charges against him on\n\ndouble jeopardy grounds, an argument based on an earlier trial.\n\nThe motion was denied; the denial was appealed.              In United States\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           On the government's motion, a seventh co-defendant,\nDaniel Tsoukalas, was severed from the case and tried separately.\n           Shortly after Silva's murder, DiCenso and his friends\noverdosed on the heroin originally intended to kill Silva. Two of\nthe friends died; DiCenso survived but suffered serious and\npermanent injuries. Once the government was able to prove Dicenso\nwas still competent enough to stand trial, DiCenso agreed to plead\nguilty and testified at this trial through the use of special\nequipment.\n           Regan also agreed to testify for the government as part\nof a plea agreement. Meuse hanged himself in 1997.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fv. DeCologero, 364 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2004), this court rejected\n\nthat appeal.   We explain the background.\n\n          In an earlier trial, United States v. Carrozza, No. 4:97-\n\ncr-40009-NMG (D. Mass. 1999), Paul A. was prosecuted for helping\n\nthe Carrozza faction of the Patriarca crime family undertake a\n\nviolent \"war\" between 1989 and 1994 in an attempt to wrest control\n\nof that criminal organization from Frank Salemme's faction.     See\n\nUnited States v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 19-21 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(describing the factual background of the Carrozza case).   Paul A.\n\nwas acquitted of all charges in that case, and he argued in his\n\npre-trial motion in this case that the present indictment violated\n\nhis double jeopardy rights because it alleged the same conspiracy.\n\nDeCologero, 364 F.3d at 16-17.    The district court disagreed, and\n\non interlocutory appeal this court affirmed, holding that the two\n\ncases dealt with different patterns of racketeering activity.   Id.\n\nat 19.   That double jeopardy claim is renewed here based on the\n\nevidence actually introduced at trial.\n\n          John Sr. pled guilty to a RICO charge on February 28,\n\n2003, and testified for the government at trial.   United States v.\n\nCapozzi (Capozzi II), 486 F.3d 711, 714 (1st Cir. 2007).    In July\n\n2004, Capozzi moved to disqualify the attorneys for Paul A., Paul\n\nJ., and John Jr., arguing they had conflicts of interests.      Id.\n\nThe attorneys for the three defendants then withdrew, and because\n\nof the delay required for the new attorneys to prepare for trial,\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fthe district court, on the government's motion, severed Capozzi's\n\ncase so that his trial could begin as planned in September 2004.\n\nId. The court gave the remaining four defendants fifteen months to\n\nprepare, with the present trial beginning on January 9, 2006.              The\n\njury returned its verdict on March 20, 2006.              The district court\n\nsentenced Paul A. to life imprisonment, Paul J. to 25 years\n\nimprisonment, John Jr. to 210 months imprisonment, and Pavone to 72\n\nmonths imprisonment.     This appeal followed.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            Because Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone raise similar and\n\noverlapping issues on appeal, we consider their claims together.\n\nA.          Severance and Mistrial\n\n            Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone argue that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying their motions, based on\n\nseveral grounds, to sever their trial from that of Paul A. or to\n\ndeclare a mistrial.8         Those grounds include Paul A.'s alleged\n\nadmission   to   being   a   gang   leader,   his   odd    behavior   in   the\n\ncourtroom, his responsibility for the heinous act of the murder of\n\nAislin Silva, and the risk of jury confusion.         We find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          The government asserts that John Jr. waived these\narguments because his attempt to incorporate the arguments of his\nco-defendants under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(i) was\ninsufficient. We do not reach this or other waiver questions as we\ndo not find an abuse of discretion on the merits.\n\n                                    -14-\n\f           1.      Standard of Review\n\n           Trial judges' decisions regarding severance and mistrial\n\nare   treated   with   a    considerable    amount   of   deference    because\n\nappellate courts lack the \"first-hand exposure to a case\" that\n\nbetter enables trial judges to \"strike the delicate balance between\n\nfending off prejudice, on the one hand, and husbanding judicial\n\nresources, on the other hand.\" United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d\n\n21, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1993).          Thus we review a district court's\n\ndenial of a motion for severance or motion for mistrial under the\n\nsame standard: manifest abuse of discretion.               United States v.\n\nTejeda, 481 F.3d 44, 54 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct.\n\n612 (2007); United States v. Glenn, 389 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           The risks of prejudice and jury confusion in this case\n\nwere not negligible, but they were not uncommon either.               By their\n\nnature, RICO cases involve many defendants, sometimes with family\n\nrelationships, and often include multiple repulsive acts.                There\n\nare ways, with skillful trial management and diligent counsel, to\n\nprevent these risks from growing into actual harm.             Trial judges\n\n\"have broad power to cope with the complexities and contingencies\n\ninherent in the adversary process.\"          Geders v. United States, 425\n\nU.S. 80, 86 (1976).        The trial judge in this case was particularly\n\naware of and sensitive to the complexity of this case and the\n\npossibility of jury confusion.         DeCologero, 364 F.3d at 20.        (An\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fearlier case management order splitting off some of the charges\n\ninto a separate trial was vacated by this court to avoid double\n\njeopardy problems.    Id. at 21-25.)\n\n          As to severance, \"the general rule is that those indicted\n\ntogether are tried together to prevent inconsistent verdicts and to\n\nconserve judicial and prosecutorial resources.\" Soto-Beníquez, 356\n\nF.3d at 29.    The district court can, however, sever defendants'\n\ntrials or provide other relief if \"there is a serious risk that a\n\njoint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the\n\ndefendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment\n\nabout guilt or innocence.\"     Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534,\n\n539 (1993); see also Fed R. Crim. P. 14(a).      If the district court\n\ndecides not to sever the trial, the defendant bears the burden of\n\nmaking a strong showing that prejudice resulted from the denial of\n\nseverance, and prejudice in this context \"means more than just a\n\nbetter chance of acquittal at a separate trial.\"      United States v.\n\nBoylan, 898 F.2d 230, 246 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting United States v.\n\nMartinez, 479 F.2d 824, 828 (1st Cir. 1973)) (internal quotation\n\nmark omitted); accord Zafiro,       506 U.S. at 540.       \"This is a\n\ndifficult battle for a defendant to win.\"      Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246.\n\n          2.        Severance Based on Antagonistic Defenses\n\n          Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone argue strenuously that as\n\nthe trial went on it became clear that Paul A.'s defense was\n\nantagonistic   to    theirs.    Antagonistic    defenses   can   require\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fseverance    when   they    are    truly    irreconcilable,      or    at    least\n\nsubstantially incompatible.        Tejeda, 481 F.3d at 55; United States\n\nv. Peña-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 34 (1st Cir. 2000).               \"[W]here there is\n\nmerely some dissonance,\" however, \"we will usually not reverse a\n\ntrial court's denial of severance.\"         Tejeda, 481 F.3d at 55.          Here,\n\nthe   defenses   were   not      truly   irreconcilable,       nor    were   they\n\nsubstantially incompatible.\n\n            The other defendants characterize Paul A.'s testimony as\n\nadmitting that he ran a criminal enterprise during the time in\n\nquestion.    This, they say, was incompatible with their defense of\n\nnon-criminality.           The     record     does     not     support       their\n\ncharacterization.\n\n            Paul A. testified that he had originally, back in the\n\n1980s, delivered drugs on behalf of Whitey Bulger and Stephen\n\nFlemmi, two infamous Boston-area organized crime bosses, but he\n\ndescribed his connection with them as minimal and explained that he\n\nhad refused to continue even in this minimal role after he served\n\nhis first term in prison (from 1984 to 1992).                Paul A. asserted\n\nthat his refusal irked the mob leaders.              His primary defense was\n\nthat Regan worked for what had become the Salemme faction of the\n\nPatriarca Family and was thus motivated to testify falsely against\n\nPaul A., setting him up to take the fall for crimes in fact\n\ncommitted by Regan and other followers of Salemme.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            In developing this defense, Paul A. did bring up his\n\nprior indictment in the Carrozza case, as well as the allegation\n\nthat the Carrozza and Salemme factions were at odds.   In Paul A.'s\n\ncross-examination of Regan, there were also some references to \"the\n\nDeCologero crew,\" but these were references to what others had\n\nalleged, such as the language of the indictment.    While this tack\n\nmight have muddied the waters for the jury, it did not (contrary to\n\nhis co-defendants' arguments) set Paul A. up before the jury as \"an\n\nopen and notorious underworld figure.\"\n\n            Instead, the jury heard Paul A. flatly deny running a\n\ncriminal enterprise (the alleged DeCologero crew), insist that he\n\nwas not affiliated with any organized criminals, and explain\n\nrepeatedly that only his son (and, on rare occasion, his brother\n\nJohn Sr.) assisted him in his drug deals after his release from\n\nprison.    While Paul A. admitted that he had continued some limited\n\ndrug dealing in the mid-1990s, he explained that he stopped such\n\nactivity once his side business selling high-protein muffins to\n\nother gyms started doing well enough to meet his gym's operating\n\ndeficit.    Paul A. admitted knowing Regan, DiCenso, and Meuse, but\n\nhe denied ever asking them for assistance in any criminal conduct.\n\n            The jury could accept Paul A.'s testimony that he was an\n\noccasional drug dealer, and even that he was disliked and targeted\n\nby mob leaders, while also accepting the other defendants' claims\n\nthat they had engaged in no criminal wrongdoing.    Paul A. did not\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fimplicate the others, nor did his defense as presented to the jury,\n\nif accepted, preclude acquittal of the others.                  There was no\n\nsubstantial incompatibility.\n\n             3.      Severance Based on \"Spillover\" Effects and\n                     Mistrial Based on Paul A.'s Courtroom Antics\n\n             At the core, these three defendants argue that Paul A.'s\n\nadmitted criminality, the more severe crimes with which he was\n\ncharged, and his inappropriate courtroom behavior cast a pall over\n\nall four defendants, prejudicing his co-defendants before the jury.\n\nThis tack also fails.\n\n             As Justice Jackson famously noted, co-defendants in a\n\nconspiracy trial like this one occupy \"an uneasy seat.                 There\n\ngenerally will be evidence of wrongdoing by somebody.                  It is\n\ndifficult for the individual to make his own case stand on its own\n\nmerits in the minds of jurors who are ready to believe that birds\n\nof a feather are flocked together.\"         Krulewitch v. United States,\n\n336   U.S.   440,    454   (1949)   (Jackson,    J.,   concurring).     Such\n\nuneasiness is inherent in joint RICO trials, and the unsavoriness\n\nof one's co-defendant (including past criminal conduct) is not\n\nenough, by itself, to mandate severance.          Tejeda, 481 F.3d at 56.\n\nDefendants    must   still   make   a   strong   showing   of   prejudice   to\n\noverturn the trial court's decision not to sever.\n\n             Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone have also not met that\n\nburden with their argument that they suffered from a \"spillover\"\n\neffect due to Paul A.'s prosecution for Aislin Silva's gruesome\n\n                                     -19-\n\fmurder.   While only Paul A. was on trial for the actual murder of\n\nSilva, Paul J. and Pavone were charged with closely related crimes\n\n(attempted murder and tampering with a witness) involving the same\n\nvictim.   Further, all four men were convicted of RICO conspiracy,\n\nand the scope of that conspiracy included protecting their criminal\n\nenterprise by silencing witnesses like Silva. Thus even if some of\n\nthe defendants were not directly charged with Silva's murder, the\n\nmurder was still relevant to the RICO counts as it tended to prove\n\nthe existence and nature of the RICO enterprise and conspiracy.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52, 103 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\nAs a result, even if the defendants had received separate trials,\n\nevidence of the murder would have been independently admissible\n\nagainst each, and it is far from clear that the potentially\n\nprejudicial      impact      of    that    evidence      would       have   rendered   it\n\ninadmissible        under   Federal       Rule    of   Evidence      403.     See   Soto-\n\nBeníquez, 356 F.3d at 29-30.                This is why, \"[i]n the context of\n\nconspiracy, severance will rarely, if ever, be required\" due to\n\nevidentiary spillover.             United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d\n\n319, 325 (1st Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              The defendants' fear of being found guilty by association\n\nwith   Paul    A.    has    a     third   aspect:      his    distracting     courtroom\n\nbehavior.        Paul       A.'s    testimony      was       often    unresponsive     or\n\ntangential, provoking repeated objections from the prosecution and\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\frebukes from the bench.     During the prosecution's case, the judge\n\nadmonished Paul A. for interfering with the work of his defense\n\ncounsel, warning that his disruptive behavior was hurting rather\n\nthan helping him in the eyes of the jury.       Generally, however, if\n\n\"a defendant misbehaves in the jury's presence, the misbehavior\n\nusually will not compel a separate trial for his codefendants\";\n\nrather,    the   co-defendant   seeking   severance   or    mistrial   must\n\n\"demonstrate the existence of some special prejudice\" that the\n\ncourt could not remedy through other means.           United States v.\n\nPierro, 32 F.3d 611, 616 (1st Cir. 1994).             If the rule were\n\notherwise, co-defendants could provoke mistrials at will.          United\n\nStates v. Tashjian, 660 F.2d 829, 838 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n            Paul A.'s co-defendants do not point to any specific\n\nprejudice, asserting more generally that they \"were prejudiced by\n\nhis conduct and the court's inability to rein him in.\"         Nor do they\n\nprovide any case law to support their argument that such behavior\n\nwarrants a mistrial.     Rather, under the case law, Paul A.'s conduct\n\nis not comparable to the severity of other co-defendant outbursts\n\nanalyzed in prior cases in which we upheld denials of severance\n\nmotions.   See United States v. Mazza, 792 F.2d 1210, 1224 (1st Cir.\n\n1986) (no abuse of discretion in refusal to sever even though co-\n\ndefendant shouted in middle of witness testimony, \"He is lying.           I\n\ngot shot for you, you mother piece of shit.                This is my pay\n\nback.\"); Tashjian, 660 F.2d at 837 (no abuse of discretion in\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fdenial of mistrial even though defendant threatened a witness in\n\nfront of the jury and yelled that his co-defendants were in the\n\nmafia).    Paul     A.'s   unruly    behavior   in   the   courtroom   was\n\nunfortunate, but his co-defendants have not made a sufficient\n\nshowing of prejudice.\n\n          Paul A.'s conduct also did not go unchecked by the\n\ndistrict court.   The court, outside the presence of the jury, told\n\nPaul A. to change his behavior, and this had at least some effect\n\non him.   For example, before Paul A. began his second day of\n\ntestimony, the court warned him -- again outside the presence of\n\nthe jury -- that:\n\n                 [T]his is not fun and games. . . .\n          This is a court of law, and there are rules .\n          . . . [Y]ou will answer only the questions\n          that are put to you and not blurt out a whole\n          bunch of other stuff.\n                 I do believe that you are doing that on\n          purpose.\n                 Number one, it doesn't help you. You\n          may wish to look at the jury at times, and you\n          will see that they are not buying it; and,\n          number two, it is improper and inappropriate\n          for you to do that.\n                 It is important for you that the story\n          be told in some reasonably coherent fashion,\n          and you're making it impossible for the story\n          to be told in a coherent fashion; apart from\n          which you are violating the orders of the\n          Court every time you go off on a frolic of\n          your own. So stop doing that. If you don't\n          stop doing it, I will need to take further\n          steps.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fPaul A.'s subsequent testimony, though still subject to objections\n\nand occasional reprimands, was more restrained.9\n\n          4.        Severance Based on Jury Confusion\n\n          In another line of arguments, Paul J., John Jr., and\n\nPavone assert that severance was warranted because of Paul A.'s\n\nmuch greater degree of culpability, the number of crimes for which\n\nonly Paul A. was on trial, and the similarity of the defendants'\n\nnames.   All of these factors, defendants argue, could easily lead\n\nto jury confusion, a type of prejudice that can be grounds for\n\nseverance.   See United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d 1, 26\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).      Again, we cannot say that the district court\n\nabused its discretion.\n\n          It   is    true   that   \"markedly   different   degrees   of\n\nculpability\" among co-defendants can \"heighten[]\" the risk of\n\nprejudice.   Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539.     But again, disparity between\n\nthe relative culpability of co-defendants does not entitle a\n\ndefendant to severance.      Soto-Beníquez, 356 F.3d at 30; United\n\nStates v. Welch, 15 F.3d 1202, 1210 (1st Cir. 1993).         Prejudice\n\nmust be shown, and \"[e]ven where large amounts of testimony are\n\nirrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement\n\n\n     9\n          Defendants also accuse the trial court of refusing to\nconsider their motions for mistrial, and they cite to one instance\nwhere the judge denied a mistrial motion on the spot.         This\nargument is off the mark: an instantaneous ruling does not mean\nthat a judge has refused to exercise her discretion. A trial judge\nimmersed in a case is quite capable of ruling on in-court motions\nquickly, even immediately.\n\n                                   -23-\n\f. . . is far less than the involvement of others, we have been\n\nreluctant to secondguess severance denials.\"   Boylan, 898 F.2d at\n\n246.\n\n          Further, such disparity is not uncommon in RICO cases,\n\nnor is it unusual in such cases for a co-defendant to be charged\n\nwith only a subset of the crimes alleged in the indictment.     In\n\nFlores-Rivera, for example, this court found no abuse of discretion\n\nin the denial of severance for a defendant \"named in less than ten\n\npercent of all overt acts charged in the indictment.\"   56 F.3d at\n\n325; see also United States v. Welch, 97 F.3d 142, 147 (6th Cir.\n\n1996) (no abuse of discretion in denial of severance even though\n\ndefendant was only charged with three of the twenty-nine counts of\n\nthe indictment).   The RICO counts, of which all defendants were\n\ncharged and all were convicted, provided the logical scope and\n\noverarching unity for the indictment.   See, e.g., United States v.\n\nTurkette, 656 F.2d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n          As for the defendants' similar names, defendants appear\n\nto assume that the similarities resulted in jury confusion.     We\n\ncannot make such an assumption, especially as the jury spent two\n\nmonths in the same room with these defendants and their distinct\n\npersonalities.   See United States v. Castillo, 77 F.3d 1480, 1491\n\nn.20 (5th Cir. 1996) (dismissing defendants' arguments of jury\n\nconfusion in trial involving a Thomas Brown, Sr., and a Thomas\n\nBrown, Jr., in addition to three other defendants who shared the\n\n\n                               -24-\n\flast name of Castillo).       The defendants here have failed to\n\ndemonstrate any prejudice greater than the \"possible risk of\n\nprejudice that almost always exists when multiple defendants with\n\ndifferent roles are tried together.\"     United States v. Cresta, 825\n\nF.2d 538, 554-55 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n          Two additional factors cut against the defendants' jury\n\nconfusion argument. First, the district court noted to the jury at\n\nthe outset of the trial that the jury must be careful to consider\n\neach defendant separately, a point repeated several times during\n\nthe jury instructions at the trial's close. See, e.g., Zafiro, 506\n\nU.S. at 540-41 (noting that proper jury instructions can alleviate\n\nrisk of prejudice).\n\n          Second, and more tellingly, the jury returned highly\n\nindividualized verdicts: there were some charges for which the jury\n\nacquitted all defendants, and others for which the jury convicted\n\nsome defendants while acquitting others.     Even within some of the\n\ncharged racketeering acts under the substantive RICO count, the\n\njury found some but not all of the individual, closely related\n\npredicate acts proved.   See Appendix.    These were not the verdicts\n\nof a jury confused about the identity and culpability of the\n\nindividual defendants. See United States v. Houle, 237 F.3d 71, 75\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (\"With regard to the jury's ability to segregate\n\nthe evidence and understand the judge's instructions, the verdict\n\nitself is often quite telling. . . .     This discriminating verdict\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fshows that the jury was able to compartmentalize evidence and apply\n\nit to each defendant . . . .\"); Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246; Turkette,\n\n656 F.2d at 9.   Given the considerable discretion a district court\n\nhas to decide a motion for severance or mistrial, these additional\n\nfactors further indicate that the district court did not abuse that\n\ndiscretion.   In sum, we will not second guess the court's decision\n\nwithout a greater showing of prejudice.              See United States v.\n\nDeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 63-64 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nB.        Judge's Trial Demeanor\n\n          Paul   J.,   John   Jr.,    and   Pavone   next   argue   that   the\n\ndistrict court judge's criticisms of their counsel in the presence\n\nof the jury deprived them of a fair trial.            With allegations of\n\njudicial bias, we consider whether the comments were improper and,\n\nif so, whether the complaining party can show serious prejudice.\n\nOwens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 66 (1st Cir. 2007).            \"Charges\n\nof partiality should be judged not on an isolated comment or two,\n\nbut on the record as a whole.\"        United States v. Polito, 856 F.2d\n\n414, 418 (1st Cir. 1988); accord United States v. Candelaria-Silva,\n\n166 F.3d 19, 35 (1st Cir. 1999).       As the Supreme Court has noted in\n\nthe context of the recusal of judges, \"judicial remarks during the\n\ncourse of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even\n\nhostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not\n\nsupport a bias or partiality challenge. . . .           A judge's ordinary\n\nefforts at courtroom administration -- even a stern and short-\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\ftempered judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration --\n\nremain immune.\"       Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555-56\n\n(1994).    This was a complex and lengthy trial, handled with skill\n\nby a seasoned trial judge who did not let things get out of\n\ncontrol.     The defendants have exaggerated; the record does not\n\nsupport their claims.          The comments of which defendants complain\n\nwere   few    (eleven     comments      spread       over    thirty-six      days    of\n\ntestimony), balanced, and reasonable in context.\n\n             Defendants first argue that the judge referred to their\n\nobjections     as    \"picky\"    in     front    of     the    jury.      During     the\n\ngovernment's     direct     examination        of    DiCenso,      defense    counsel\n\nrepeatedly objected to leading questions, objections which the\n\ncourt sustained.       After the fourth sustained defense objection in\n\na brief stretch of questioning, the judge addressed the jury:\n\n             Let me explain, members of the jury. I told\n             you yesterday that leading questions in\n             general are a no-no when counsel conducted\n             direct examination, but you can also be too\n             picky about that. So, part of the reason that\n             I have not always sustained the objection is\n             because I thought at times it was a bit too\n             picky. There is a certain judgment call that\n             one has to make. However, at the moment, [the\n             prosecutor] is leading [DiCenso] rather too\n             much.\n\nImmediately    thereafter,       the    court       ruled    sua   sponte    that   the\n\ngovernment was asking another leading question.                          The court's\n\n\"picky\"    comment    had   very     little     to    do    with   the   defense;    if\n\nanything, the court was reprimanding the government.\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\f           Defendants also accuse the court of unfair, sua sponte\n\nrulings that defense questions were argumentative.              The court was\n\neven-handed: at times it raised sua sponte concerns about the\n\ngovernment's questioning.          There was no preferential treatment.\n\nFurther, the rulings were correct.              The court was trying, in this\n\ndifficult case, to keep the focus on the evidence.\n\n           We   do       not   address     additional   exchanges     regarding\n\nobjections, but we do note that the court emphasized in its final\n\ninstructions to the jury that it should not take into account the\n\nexchanges between counsel and the bench regarding evidentiary\n\nmatters:\n\n           In the course of the trial, you have heard\n           many times when counsel rose to object. You\n           should not hold that against them or their\n           clients.    It is their right to do that.\n           Indeed, it is their duty to do it. It's the\n           way in which counsel bring to the attention of\n           the Court when they think one or another of\n           what you now know are very complicated rules\n           are not being adhered to.\n\nSee Candelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d at 36 (\"Assuming arguendo that the\n\ntrial court exhibited frustration from time to time during this\n\nrather lengthy, heated trial, the strong instructions given by the\n\ntrial   court   .    .    .    should    have    eliminated   any   conceivable\n\nprejudice.\"); Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1046-47 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(\"jury instructions can be a means of allaying potential prejudice\"\n\nin this context).         In sum, the court's treatment of objections\n\nraised by both sides was even-handed and not unfair.\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f             The three defendants also take issue with comments by the\n\ncourt   that,   they   argue,   suggested   they   curtail   their   cross-\n\nexamination of witnesses.        These comments, too, when taken in\n\ncontext, were appropriate.        Defendants do not argue, nor could\n\nthey, that the district court cut their cross-examination short at\n\nany point.    Instead, the court at times encouraged counsel to move\n\nmore rapidly after lengthy questioning about minimally relevant\n\ninformation.     We read a comment that counsel should limit his\n\ncross-examination to \"thirty seconds\" as a reflection of the late\n\nhour; the court dismissed the jury shortly thereafter, and when\n\nquestioning resumed the next day, the attorney -- who indeed had\n\nvery few questions -- was given all the time he needed, without\n\nfurther comment. The same explanation holds for a similar incident\n\nearlier in the trial, when the court asked defense counsel to try\n\nto conclude cross-examination of a witness that day: the judge's\n\ncomment that some defense counsel might skip cross-examination\n\naltogether might have been a light quip, a reference to the\n\nimminent end of the trial day, or an acknowledgment that the\n\nremaining counsel might have few or no questions for the witness --\n\nindeed, one counsel did not have any questions, the other two had\n\nvery few, and no one's questioning was curtailed by the judge.\n\n             \"Trial judges are justifiably accorded broad latitude to\n\nensure proper courtroom behavior.\"          United States v. Rodríguez-\n\nRivera, 473 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v.\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fGomes, 177 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 1999)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Even if such comments could be read as rebukes, a judge,\n\nin managing a trial, may rebuke counsel for inappropriate behavior\n\nand may reasonably limit cross-examination.         Id.; see also Boylan,\n\n898 F.2d at 254.      The comments of concern here were appropriate\n\nexercises of the court's responsibilities to manage the trial.            As\n\nthe comments were not improper, we do not reach the question of\n\nprejudice.\n\nC.          Evidentiary Rulings\n\n            1.      Testimonial Exclusions\n\n            Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone argue that several of the\n\ntrial   court's    evidentiary    rulings    were   in   error    and   were\n\nprejudicial.     We review the district court's interpretation of the\n\nrules of evidence de novo, but we review the court's application of\n\nthose rules for abuse of discretion.            United States v. Muñoz-\n\nFranco, 487 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir. 2007).            We start with their\n\nobjections to the court's exclusion of certain testimony.\n\n            a.      Hearsay.      Defendants    object    that    the court\n\nexcluded as hearsay statements which were not.           The hearsay rule\n\napplies to out-of-court statements \"offered in evidence to prove\n\nthe truth of the matter asserted.\"        Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).    However,\n\n\"[i]f the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the\n\nfact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of\n\nanything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.\"              Fed. R.\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fEvid. 801(c) advisory committee's note.   Defendants argue that two\n\nconversations that allegedly occurred at Paul A.'s gym fall into\n\nthis latter category. The district court's rulings to the contrary\n\nwere not an abuse of discretion.\n\n           Paul A. attempted to introduce these gym conversations\n\nthrough his own testimony and the testimony of his sister JoAnne\n\nand a gym employee named Peter Ippolito.10        We summarize the\n\ntestimony that defendants desired to introduce.       In the first\n\nconversation, DiCenso and Silva allegedly came to Paul A. at his\n\ngym to seek his help because the guns had been discovered in\n\nSilva's apartment and because DiCenso was afraid of how Regan would\n\nrespond.   Paul A., who claimed the guns were not his, asserted that\n\nhe got angry when he learned that DiCenso was storing the guns for\n\nBobby Luisi, a member of the Salemme faction; Paul A. yelled out\n\nLuisi's name and told them, \"Get out of here.      Those people are\n\ntrying to kill me.\"   In the end, Paul A. agreed to help DiCenso get\n\na lawyer and called Tony Bucci to request a limousine on their\n\nbehalf.    In the second conversation, Meuse and Regan came to Paul\n\nA. and, in a heated argument, told him to \"stay out of their\n\nbusiness, that that business with Stephen DiCenso and Aislin Silva\n\nwas their business and had nothing to do with [Paul A.].\"\n\n\n\n\n     10\n          Paul A. also objects to the district court's hearsay\nrulings pertaining to these two conversations, and we incorporate\nhis arguments here.\n\n                                -31-\n\f          The court allowed Ippolito to testify that DiCenso and\n\nSilva came to the gym, that Paul A. got angry, and that Paul A.\n\nyelled out someone's name.    But the court did not allow testimony\n\nas to the name he yelled out (allegedly \"Bobby Luisi\").    Ippolito\n\nwas also allowed to testify that the conversation between Meuse,\n\nRegan, and Paul A. took place and that they were \"very, very\n\nangry,\" but not to the content of that conversation.       Paul A.\n\ntestified that the conversation with DiCenso and Silva took place,\n\nthat he tried calling an attorney for them, and that he called\n\nBucci to order the limousine for DiCenso.    JoAnne was allowed to\n\ntestify to much more regarding the first conversation: that the\n\nthree of them were talking about guns, that Paul A. yelled at\n\nDiCenso, \"Well, why are you coming to me\" because \"these are people\n\nwho are after us,\" that Paul A. told them to leave the gym, and\n\nthat he then tried to help DiCenso get in touch with an attorney\n\nand called for a limousine.\n\n          The rest of the conversations the court excluded on\n\nhearsay grounds.   Further details from the first conversation, it\n\nruled, were only offered for \"the truth that DiCenso had another\n\nagenda\": that is, to establish that the guns were not Paul A.'s and\n\nthat DiCenso was not working for Paul A.        As for the second\n\nconversation, Paul A. argued it was relevant because it showed he\n\n\"was not in a conspiracy with Regan and Meuse.      He was not the\n\nleader of an organization where he gave them orders, that they had\n\n\n                                -32-\n\ftheir own thing going.\"       The court reasoned, however, that this\n\nproffered relevance required the content of the statements -- that\n\nthe guns and Silva had nothing to do with Paul A. -- to be true.\n\nThese exclusion rulings were correct.\n\n            Defendants argue that the statements should have been\n\nadmitted as verbal acts, but that label applies to statements which\n\n\"affect[] the legal rights of the parties.\"          Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)\n\nadvisory committee's note; see also United States v. Stover, 329\n\nF.3d 859, 870 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (\"[Verbal] acts are limited to\n\nstatements    that   have   independent   legal    significance,    such   as\n\ncontractual offers or inter vivos gifts.\").\n\n            The defendants perhaps mean to refer more broadly to the\n\ncategory of statements that are not hearsay because they are not\n\noffered for their truth.      See Stover, 329 F.3d at 870.         At trial,\n\nPaul A. argued that the conversations were offered to provide\n\ncontext for other actions and events, not to prove the truth of the\n\nstatements.    See United States v. Page, 521 F.3d 101, 106-07 (1st\n\nCir. 2008); United States v. Meserve, 271 F.3d 314, 319 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).     Statements that provide \"context\" only if they are true,\n\nhowever, are still considered hearsay.            See Stover, 329 F.3d at\n\n870.\n\n            The only relevant context the defendants could point to\n\nhere was the need to explain why Paul A. called a lawyer for\n\nDiCenso.    Based on this argument, the court allowed into evidence\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\ftestimony to the effect that Paul A. called a lawyer for DiCenso,\n\nnot because DiCenso worked for him, but as a favor when DiCenso\n\ncame to him with legal troubles.              Defendants have put forward no\n\nfurther   argument    as   to   what    other    contextual       background   the\n\nremaining, excluded statements might provide without relying on the\n\ntruth of those statements.\n\n           Contrary to defendants' assertion, the court did not make\n\nbroad rulings regarding hearsay, but carefully parsed each proffer,\n\noften ruling in defendants' favor in unclear situations. There was\n\nno abuse of discretion.11\n\n           b.        Impeachment. In arguments that overlap with their\n\nhearsay   arguments,    defendants      assert     that     the   district   court\n\nimproperly excluded testimony meant to challenge the credibility of\n\ngovernment witnesses.\n\n           The ability to use extrinsic evidence to impeach a\n\nwitness by contradiction is linked to the question of hearsay.\n\nGenerally, extrinsic evidence (such as the testimony of another\n\nwitness) cannot be used to impeach a witness if it relates only to\n\na collateral matter.       Marino, 277 F.3d at 24.          This common law rule\n\nis a manifestation of the district court's general discretion to\n\nexclude otherwise relevant evidence \"if its probative value is\n\nsubstantially   outweighed      by     the    danger   of    unfair   prejudice,\n\n\n     11\n          It is also not immediately clear how the exclusion of\nthis testimony, which was meant to further Paul A.'s defense,\ncaused any harm to the other three defendants.\n\n                                       -34-\n\fconfusion of the issues, . . . or by considerations of undue delay\n\n[or] waste of time.\"     Fed. R. Evid. 403; see also United States v.\n\nBeauchamp, 986 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing United States v.\n\nTarantino, 846 F.2d 1384, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1988)).                Evidence is\n\ncollateral if it is relevant only because it contradicts the in-\n\ncourt testimony of another witness.         Marino, 277 F.3d at 24.        If\n\nwhat makes the statement otherwise relevant and thus not collateral\n\nrelies on the truth of the statement, then the statement is hearsay\n\nand inadmissable on that ground.12         See 28 Wright & Gold, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure: Evidence § 6206, at 537 n.14 (1993).              The\n\ndecision on whether a matter is collateral or material is within\n\nthe district court's discretion.        Marino, 277 F.3d at 24.\n\n            Defendants take issue with the court's refusal to let a\n\ndefense witness recount a conversation in which Agent John Mercer\n\nallegedly tried to coerce him into testifying for the government.\n\nThe court ruled that the testimony was only relevant to the extent\n\nit   bore    on   Mercer's   credibility    and     was   thus    collateral.\n\nDefendants note that \"a witness's self-interest or motive to\n\ntestify falsely is generally considered to be a non-collateral\n\nissue.\"     Beauchamp, 986 F.2d at 4.       If the argument is that the\n\ndefendants    were    attempting   to     impeach    Mercer      not   through\n\n\n\n     12\n          For this reason, the gym conversations excluded on\nhearsay grounds could also not be used to attack the credibility of\nRegan or DiCenso: the conversations only bear on the witnesses'\nmotive to lie if the content of those conversations is true.\n\n                                   -35-\n\fcontradiction but by establishing his bias against defendants and\n\nhis motive to lie, this argument was not fully developed on appeal\n\nand is thus waived.         United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n\n(\"[I]ssues    adverted     to    in   a    perfunctory     manner   [on   appeal],\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\"). Further, while extrinsic evidence is admissible to show\n\nbias, the trial judge still has discretion under Rule 403 to\n\nexclude such evidence if it would distract from the main issues of\n\nthe case.    Gomes, 177 F.3d at 81.          This ruling was well within the\n\ncourt's discretion given the court's interest in avoiding a mini-\n\ntrial on Mercer's conduct, which could distract the jury in an\n\nalready complex case.       See Beauchamp, 986 F.2d at 4.\n\n             Defendants also argue that the district court should have\n\nissued bench warrants for three witnesses. The court refused to do\n\nso because the witnesses would only testify to collateral matters\n\nin order to contradict government witnesses, such as DiCenso and\n\nRegan.     The court was correct that the witnesses would not be\n\nallowed,     under   the   rules      of   evidence,     to   testify     on   those\n\ncollateral     matters.         Further,     the   court   did   not    abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in determining that the proposed testimony of the\n\nwitnesses, as proffered by Paul A., regarded only collateral\n\nmatters.13\n\n\n     13\n          The court also did not abuse its discretion in\ndetermining that it was not material whether DiCenso's sister had\ntold State Trooper Robert Irwin that she knew DiCenso was dating\n\n                                          -36-\n\f           2.       Pre-Trial Identification\n\n           John Jr. appeals the denial of his motions to suppress\n\npre-trial identifications made by Soccorso and Bentley, which he\n\nargues were based on an impermissibly suggestive photo array.\n\nThere was no violation of John Jr.'s due process rights in the\n\npresentation of this identification evidence to the jury.\n\n           Our review of a district court's decision to deny a\n\nsuppression motion as to identification is plenary, but with the\n\nusual   deference   to   any   findings   of   fact.   United   States   v.\n\nBrennick, 405 F.3d 96, 99-100 (1st Cir. 2005).           A court should\n\nexclude an out-of-court identification based on a photo array only\n\nin those \"extraordinary cases\" where there is \"a very substantial\n\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification,\" a situation which\n\ncould result in an unfair trial in violation of the defendant's due\n\nprocess rights.     United States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 100 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (quoting United States v. de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672,\n\n677 (1st Cir. 1993)); see also United States v. Holliday, 457 F.3d\n\n121, 125 (1st Cir. 2006).       \"Short of that point, such evidence is\n\nfor the jury to weigh . . . , for evidence with some element of\n\nuntrustworthiness is customary grist for the jury mill. Juries are\n\n\n\nSilva, so it was not improper for the court to curtail the cross-\nexamination of Irwin on this point. Defendants note additional\ninstances of defense witnesses not being allowed to testify to\nconversations but do not explain why those conversations were\nrelevant, how the court abused its discretion, or why they were\nprejudiced as a result. See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n                                   -37-\n\fnot so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the\n\nweight of identification testimony that has some questionable\n\nfeature.\"    Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 116 (1977).\n\n            John Jr. moved before trial to suppress the Bentley and\n\nSoccorso pretrial identifications, but the district court denied\n\nboth motions, holding that \"these matters are properly addressed\n\nthrough cross-examination.\"   The district court did not explicitly\n\ngo through the two-step analysis described below.\n\n            At trial, Soccorso and Bentley both testified that they\n\npicked John Jr. out of a six-photo array, more than three years\n\nafter the robbery in Soccorso's case and over two years later for\n\nBentley.    That photo array was provided for the jury.   John Jr.'s\n\ncounsel cross-examined both witnesses extensively.   He walked each\n\nof them through the characteristics of the six photographed men,\n\narguing that four of them clearly did not match the age or hair-\n\nstyle descriptions that the witnesses had provided the police.\n\nUnder defense counsel's questioning, Soccorso acknowledged that it\n\nwas dark at the time of his abduction and that John Jr. was sitting\n\nbehind him for much of their encounter; from Bentley, counsel drew\n\na description of the pain medications Bentley had been taking at\n\nthe time he made the identification as well as during the trial,\n\nand Bentley acknowledged that his doctor had written a letter to\n\nthe effect that Bentley should not testify because the medications\n\nseverely affected his recall.\n\n\n                                -38-\n\f           John Jr. also produced an expert witness, Dr. Steven\n\nPenrod, to testify about factors that decrease the reliability of\n\nwitness identifications, many of which factors John Jr. argued to\n\nthe jury were present in this case.       Neither Bentley nor Soccorso\n\nmade an in-court identification.\n\n           John Jr. renewed his motion to suppress before the court\n\ncharged the jury; that motion was also denied.            John Jr.'s counsel\n\nthen argued repeatedly and at length during his closing that the\n\nidentifications were unreliable and should be discredited.                   The\n\ncourt,   during   its   charge,   instructed   the       jury   that   \"if   the\n\ngovernment's theory is that a particular defendant was a principal,\n\n. . . then you need to decide whether the evidence shows he was\n\nthere, and if so, was he identified by the victim, was it a good or\n\na questionable identification.\"\n\n           We use a two-step analysis when considering whether a\n\npretrial   identification    procedure    raises     a    \"very   substantial\n\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification\": we first determine\n\nwhether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive,\n\nand if it was, we then look to the totality of the circumstances to\n\ndecide whether the identification was still reliable.              Henderson,\n\n320 F.3d at 100; see also Holliday, 457 F.3d at 125.              At the first\n\nstep, we consider whether the photo array included, as far as was\n\npracticable, a reasonable number of persons similar in appearance\n\nto the suspect.         Holliday, 457 F.3d at 125-26.             \"The police\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\fauthorities are required to make every effort reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances to conduct a fair and balanced presentation of\n\nalternative possibilities for identification.

State,    175   N.W.2d   646,   652   (Wisc.    1970))\n\n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           As for the second step's totality-of-the-circumstances\n\nanalysis, the Supreme Court in Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188\n\n(1972), enumerated five factors for consideration:\n\n           (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the\n           criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the\n           witness' degree of attention to the crime; (3)\n           the accuracy of the witness' prior description\n           of the defendant; (4) the level of certainty\n           demonstrated    by   the   witness    at   the\n           confrontation; and (5) the length of time\n           between the crime and confrontation.\n\nHenderson, 320 F.3d at 100 (summarizing Biggers, 409 U.S. at 199-\n\n200).\n\n           Starting with the first step, the photo array for John\n\nJr. was impermissibly suggestive. John Jr. has no unusual features\n\nthat    might   complicate   the    search    for   others      with    similar\n\nappearances, yet the other photos in the array were not of men who\n\nlooked similar to John Jr. beyond being white men with short hair.\n\nComparison with the eight-photo array used for the identification\n\nof Paul J. is informative.        In that array, the eight men appear to\n\nbe of the same age group, seven of the eight have fairly similar\n\nhair, and the overall impression is one of resemblance.                The array\n\n                                    -40-\n\fused for John Jr., however, included only six photos, two of which\n\nare of men who appear younger than John Jr. and two of which are of\n\nmen clearly older; one of the latter has a noticeably receding\n\nhairline.     Two of the men appear more heavyset than John Jr., and\n\nat    least   two   have   hair   that   is   markedly   different   and   not\n\ninterchangeable with that of the defendant.              In all, only one of\n\nthe five photos depicts a man as similar to John Jr. as the photos\n\nin Paul J.'s array are to Paul J.             Further, given the familial\n\nresemblance between the brothers, the existence of the other photos\n\nin Paul J.'s array makes all the more clear that the police should\n\nnot have had trouble locating men who resembled John Jr. more\n\nclosely.\n\n              However, given the totality of the circumstances, we\n\nconclude that the array did not raise a substantial likelihood of\n\nmisidentification and that the remaining question of reliability\n\nwas appropriately left to the jury.           Cf. Biggers, 409 U.S. at 200-\n\n01.    Soccorso spent a substantial amount of time in the car with\n\nhis assailant; Bentley watched as the crew ransacked his apartment\n\nand tied him up.     Both witnesses were victims of the crimes and not\n\naccidental eyewitnesses whose attention might have been distracted.\n\nOn cross-examination, despite thorough questioning, both witnesses\n\nstood by their identifications.          Some of the Bigger factors cut in\n\ndefendant's favor -- Bentley did incorrectly describe two of the\n\nrobbers as being the same height, and (more significantly) there\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\fwas a lengthy time delay between the crimes and the identifications\n\n-- but not all the Biggers factors must point in one direction for\n\nan identification to be upheld.   See Henderson, 320 F.3d at 100.\n\n\"[I]t is only in extraordinary cases that identification evidence\n\nshould be withheld from the jury,\" id. (quoting de Jesus-Rios, 990\n\nF.2d at 677), and this is not one of them.\n\n          The weighing of the factors in this case, however, is a\n\nclose question, so we also note that the jury was provided with\n\nextensive information about the identifications with which to make\n\nits own reliability determination.    The defendant's counsel did a\n\nhighly competent examination, eliciting testimony from multiple\n\nwitnesses that cast doubt on the identifications of John Jr.,\n\nespecially in terms of the Biggers factors.    The jury was clearly\n\nand properly instructed on the question and had before it a\n\nthorough record of why the identification might be untrustworthy.\n\nWe are thus further reassured that John Jr.'s due process rights\n\nwere not violated by the submission of the identification evidence,\n\nwith all of defendant's caveats, to the jury.\n\n          3.     Pavone's Claim of Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n          Pavone argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights\n\nwere violated by prosecutorial misconduct.    We start by describing\n\nthe underlying dispute.\n\n          Pavone alleges that an old acquaintance, John Dana, and\n\nhis colleague Wayne David Collins approached him around the time of\n\n\n                               -42-\n\fhis indictment and offered to hire an attorney on his behalf.                    That\n\nattorney, John Cicilline, did briefly take over Pavone's case.\n\nAccording    to    Pavone,      Collins    claimed      to   have     a    special,\n\npreferential relationship with the FBI, and Dana and Cicilline\n\nrepeatedly asked Pavone to cooperate with the government.                     After\n\nhis initial detention hearing, Pavone was approached by another\n\ninmate, Arlindo Dossantos, who warned Pavone that Collins and Dana\n\nwere FBI informants who hired attorneys for criminal defendants in\n\norder to obtain confidential information that they could then pass\n\non to the government.            Pavone confronted Cicilline, Cicilline\n\nwithdrew as counsel, and Pavone's former counsel was reappointed.\n\n            Pavone moved to dismiss the indictment against him.                   He\n\nasserted    that   he     had    shared    confidential      information         with\n\nCicilline, that Cicilline transmitted that information to Collins\n\nand Dana, and that all three \"acted with the knowledge and approval\n\nof   the   government.\"         He   supported   this   motion      with   his    own\n\naffidavit and that of his mother, who had spoken with Dana on\n\nmultiple occasions during the time in question.              Pavone also moved\n\nfor discovery of sealed documents filed in Dossantos's prosecution\n\nregarding similar accusations against Collins, Dana, and the U.S.\n\nAttorney's Office.\n\n            In response, the government submitted affidavits from the\n\nthree Assistant U.S. Attorneys who prosecuted this case.                         They\n\ndenied having ever met or communicated with Dana or Collins and\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fasserted that, to the best of their knowledge, no one involved in\n\nthe investigation had obtained any information from Dana, Collins,\n\nor Cicilline.        One of them also explained that the case was\n\ninvestigated not by the FBI, but by the Drug Enforcement Agency\n\n(\"DEA\"), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives\n\n(\"ATF\"),     and     the   Massachusetts           State   Police.       The   lead\n\ninvestigators from the ATF (Mercer) and the Massachusetts State\n\nPolice (Irwin) also submitted affidavits, stating that neither they\n\nnor, to the best of their knowledge, anyone else working on the\n\ninvestigation had ever sought or received information from Dana,\n\nCollins, or Cicilline.\n\n           The district court denied Pavone's motions to dismiss the\n\nindictment.        Based on the government's affidavits \"and in the\n\nabsence of any contradictory factual support,\" the court was \"not\n\npersuaded\" that Pavone could show that the government received any\n\nconfidential       information,      even    if    he   were   allowed   access   to\n\ndocuments in the Dossantos case.               It is this denial that Pavone\n\nappeals.\n\n           \"[T]he government's intrusion into the attorney-client\n\nrelationship\" is not a per se Sixth Amendment violation; there must\n\nalso be some demonstration of resulting prejudice.                   United States\n\nv. Mastroianni, 749 F.2d 900, 907 (1st Cir. 1984).                   Because such\n\nintrusions    pose    a    serious    risk    to    defendants'    constitutional\n\nrights, and because it would be unreasonably difficult for most\n\n\n                                        -44-\n\fdefendants to prove prejudice, we only require defendants to make\n\na prima facie showing of prejudice by \"prov[ing] that confidential\n\ncommunications        were    conveyed     as   a   result\"   of   the    government\n\nintrusion into the attorney-client relationship.                    Id. at 907-08.\n\nThe burden then shifts to the government to show that the defendant\n\nwas not prejudiced; that burden is a demanding one.                    Id. at 908.\n\n              Even taking all his allegations as true, Pavone did not\n\nshow or even allege that Collins and Dana passed any confidential\n\ninformation they received from Cicilline on to the government.\n\n\"[U]nless      [the    informant]    communicated       the    substance     of   the\n\n[attorney-client] conversations [to the government] and thereby\n\ncreated   at    least    a    realistic     possibility       of   injury   to    [the\n\ndefendant] or benefit to the State, there can be no Sixth Amendment\n\nviolation.\"      Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 558 (1977); see\n\nalso Greater Newburyport Clamshell Alliance v. Pub. Serv. Co. of\n\nN.H.,   838     F.2d    13,    20   (1st    Cir.     1988)    (\"Only     information\n\ncommunicated to the prosecutor is capable of prejudicing a criminal\n\ndefendant's sixth amendment rights at trial.\"); United States v.\n\nDyer, 821 F.2d 35, 38 (1st Cir. 1987) (where \"no confidential\n\nattorney-client information was relayed to, or obtained by, the\n\nprosecution,\" \"[t]he defense suffered no prejudice\" and thus no\n\nSixth Amendment violation).              We affirm the denial of Pavone's\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\f           Pavone also makes a related argument that the government\n\nimproperly withheld Brady material (the Dossantos files) which he\n\nclaims \"contain[] certain and definitive exculpatory material,\"\n\npresumably    evidence   that   Collins   and   Dana   were   government\n\ninformants.    Under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), \"the\n\nsuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused\n\nupon request violates due process where the evidence is material\n\neither to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or\n\nbad faith of the prosecution.\"       Id. at 87.    But \"Brady did not\n\ncreate\" a \"general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal\n\ncase.\"   Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 559.     \"To establish a violation of\n\nBrady, a defendant must provide the court with some indication that\n\nthe materials to which he or she needs access contain material and\n\npotentially exculpatory evidence.\"        United States v. Brandon, 17\n\nF.3d 409, 456 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           \"[M]ethods    of   enforcing   disclosure   requirements   in\n\ncriminal trials are generally left to the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt,\" and we review Brady determinations for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Caro-Muñiz, 406 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir. 2005).         The\n\ndistrict court here concluded that the Dossantos documents would\n\nnot \"suffice to sustain Pavone's burden\" in establishing his prima\n\nfacie case of a Sixth Amendment violation.      In light of the record\n\ncreated by the prosecution that there was no contact by the\n\nprosecution with Collins and Dana in this case, and in the absence\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\fof any allegation by Pavone to the contrary, this ruling was\n\nplainly correct.\n\nD.        Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          Paul     J.,   John   Jr.,     and   Pavone   all    appeal    their\n\nconvictions on one or more charges, arguing that the government\n\npresented insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find them\n\nguilty.\n\n          We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,\n\nscrutinizing   the   record     as   a   whole,   drawing     all   reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the verdict, and avoiding any credibility\n\njudgments, to determine whether any rational factfinder could have\n\nfound each element of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nMuñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d at 41.        \"To uphold a conviction, the court\n\nneed not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could\n\nsensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty\n\nverdict finds support in 'a plausible rendition of the record.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)).   Further, \"evidence sufficient to convict may be entirely\n\ncircumstantial, with the factfinder remaining free to choose among\n\nreasonable interpretations of the evidence.\"             United States v.\n\nWight, 968 F.2d 1393, 1395 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -47-\n\f           1.       Tampering with Witness by Misleading Conduct\n\n           Pavone and Paul J. argue there was insufficient evidence\n\nto convict them of witness tampering (of Silva) by misleading\n\nconduct.      The   witness-tampering     law    prohibits   \"engag[ing]   in\n\nmisleading conduct toward another person, with intent to . . .\n\nhinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement\n\nofficer . . . of the United States of information relating to the\n\ncommission . . . of a Federal offense.\"            18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3).\n\n\"Misleading conduct\" is further defined, as relevant here, as\n\n\"knowingly making a false statement\" or \"intentionally omitting\n\ninformation from a statement and thereby causing a portion of such\n\nstatement to be misleading, or intentionally concealing a material\n\nfact, and thereby creating a false impression by such statement.\"\n\nId. § 1515(a)(3)(A)-(B).       These two defendants were indicted for\n\nand convicted of conspiracy to tamper with a witness through\n\nmisleading conduct, as well as the substantive crime of tampering\n\nwith a witness or aiding and abetting another to do so; tampering\n\nwith a witness was also found to be a racketeering act for each\n\nunder RICO.\n\n           At   trial,   the   government       argued   that   the   relevant\n\nmisleading conduct was the isolation of Silva, \"all the while\n\ntelling her that everything would be okay, their lawyers would take\n\n[] care [of everything] -- their lawyers would be back in town\n\nsoon, telling her those things to mislead her about her situation.\"\n\n\n                                   -48-\n\fAccording to the government's trial theory, Pavone and Paul J.\n\nfurthered that plan by being at the meetings where decisions about\n\nwhat to do with Silva were made, by renting hotel rooms, and by\n\nobtaining the heroin.\n\n           The jury heard testimony that Paul A. and the crew were\n\nworried   about   what   Silva    had   already    told   the   police,   made\n\nsignificant efforts to keep her away from the police while weighing\n\nthe likelihood that she would betray them, and, to encourage her\n\ncontinued isolation and silence, reassured her repeatedly that\n\ntheir   lawyers   were   away    temporarily      but   would   take   care   of\n\neverything upon their return.\n\n           As for Pavone specifically, DiCenso testified that Pavone\n\nwas present at the first meeting of the crew right after Silva had\n\nbeen discovered talking with the police; that DiCenso and Paul J.\n\ntold \"everybody [present] what had happened in relation to the\n\ndiscovery of the guns\"; and that the mood of that meeting was \"[a]n\n\noverall   general   feeling      of   shock.\"     Regan   and   DiCenso   both\n\ntestified that following the first meeting and at Paul A.'s behest,\n\nPavone rented a motel room for Silva (which removed her from the\n\napartment where she had met with the police), and Pavone did not\n\ndeny driving DiCenso and Silva from Boston to New York (an act\n\nwhich made it even less likely that the police could find her).\n\nGiven that Pavone participated in multiple parts of the scheme,\n\nthat he spent several hours in a confined space with DiCenso and\n\n\n                                      -49-\n\fSilva during the drive to New York, that all three meetings about\n\nhow to handle Silva occurred at Pavone's house, and that he was in\n\nthe right place at the right time on multiple occasions to have\n\nheard the crew discuss the problem of Silva, a reasonable jury\n\ncould have inferred that he knew the crew was misleading Silva to\n\nkeep her from talking further with the police.   The jury could have\n\neasily concluded that Pavone, rather than acting as a simple\n\n\"gofer,\" was knowingly assisting with that scheme.\n\n          As for Paul J., he was with DiCenso when they went to\n\nSilva's apartment and discovered Silva being questioned by the\n\npolice.   He and DiCenso debriefed the crew about Silva's contact\n\nwith the police at the first meeting.     It was reasonable for the\n\njury to infer that the plan to prevent Silva from talking further\n\nwith the police was hatched at this meeting and that Paul J. was\n\nprivy to it.   Further, when the crew decided to kill Silva with an\n\noverdose to ensure that she would not betray them to the police, it\n\nwas Paul J. who went to buy the heroin.    He knew what it was for\n\n(he asked Centeno, the dealer, for heroin \"strong enough for an\n\noverdose\"), and it is a permissible inference that he knew the\n\nheroin would be provided to Silva under the guise of being a non-\n\nlethal drug.    From all of this, a reasonable jury could have\n\nconcluded that Paul J. knew of the scheme to convince Silva not to\n\ntalk to the authorities and to prevent her from doing so, and that\n\nhe knowingly assisted with that effort.\n\n\n                                -50-\n\f          These convictions of Pavone and Paul J. are affirmed.\n\n          2.        Felon in Possession of a Firearm\n\n          Paul J. also appeals his conviction under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(1) for being a felon in possession of a firearm.14 He does\n\nnot dispute that he is a felon under the terms of the statute or\n\nthat the firearms in question were related to interstate commerce.\n\nSee Wight, 968 F.2d at 1397.    Instead he argues that the government\n\ndid not provide sufficient evidence that he knowingly possessed the\n\nsix firearms, derived from the North burglary, that it accused him\n\nof possessing.\n\n          Knowing possession under § 922(g)(1) can be established\n\nby proving that the defendant had constructive possession of a\n\nfirearm; that is, that he \"knowingly ha[d] the power and the\n\nintention at a given time of exercising dominion and control over\n\na firearm . . . , directly or through others.\"              Id. at 1398\n\n(emphasis added).     Constructive possession can be joint, does not\n\nrequire actual ownership of the firearm, and can be established\n\nthrough   circumstantial    evidence,   though    \"mere    presence    or\n\nassociation    with   another   who   possessed   the     contraband   is\n\ninsufficient.\" Id. at 1397; see also United States v. Liranzo, 385\n\n\n     14\n          18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) provides that \"[i]t shall be\nunlawful for any person -- (1) who has been convicted in any court\nof [] a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\nyear . . . to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce,\nor possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or\nto receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or\ntransported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n\n                                 -51-\n\fF.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 2004).               Possession, whether actual or\n\nconstructive, can be extremely brief: \"a minute of possession is as\n\nmuch an offense as a year of possession.\"           United States v. Zavala\n\nMaldonado, 23 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n             There was enough evidence for the jury to find that Paul\n\nJ. knowingly possessed the North firearms at some point.                 While\n\nother testimony was to the contrary, DiCenso testified that Paul J.\n\nwas with him in North's apartment during the burglary.               See Wight,\n\n968   F.2d   at    1395   (credibility     issues   resolved    in    favor    of\n\ngovernment).      Even if Paul J. was outside the apartment and helped\n\nthe other two burglars load the stolen goods into the car, the jury\n\ncould have reasonably inferred that he knew the duffel bags with\n\nthe stolen goods contained guns.           Paul A. sent them to search for\n\ndrugs and guns, the weight and shape of the duffel bags would have\n\nbelied their contents, and the box of grenades, which was loaded\n\ninto the car separately, would have made clear that the expected\n\nweaponry had been found and stolen. The jury could have concluded,\n\nthen, that Paul J. physically possessed the guns at that time.\n\n             Second, a jury could have found that after the North\n\nrobbery, when the crew was opening the safes in the garage and\n\nexamining    the    weapons,   Paul   J.     constructively    possessed      the\n\nfirearms.     A defendant has the power to exercise dominion over a\n\nfirearm if he was \"close enough to pick it up at any time.\"             United\n\nStates v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 504 (1st Cir. 2005).                     Regan\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\fdescribed the guns as laid out \"all over the garage floor\" and\n\nspecified that at least he and Meuse were physically handling the\n\nweapons; it could be inferred that Paul J. had the same access to\n\nthem.   As for the intent to exercise dominion over the firearms,\n\nalthough Paul A. stopped Regan from keeping some of the weapons,\n\nthe jury could still have concluded that the weapons were being\n\nkept for the use of the crew as a whole.            As DiCenso put it,\n\n\"because the guns belonged to the crew, . . . that means they\n\nbelonged to me, too,\" as a member of the crew.\n\n          The   basis    for   a   joint   possession   finding   is   also\n\ndemonstrated by Paul J. and DiCenso having gone to retrieve the\n\nweapons from Silva's apartment on behalf of the crew: they assumed\n\nthat they would be able to remove the weapons at will.       The weapons\n\ndid not belong to Silva; the weapons belonged to the crew, and Paul\n\nJ. acted as a member of the crew.\n\n          We affirm this conviction.\n\n          3.      Use of a Firearm in Relation to Crime of Violence\n\n          John Jr. appeals his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\n\nfor using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to any\n\ncrime of violence . . . for which he may be prosecuted in a court\n\nof the United States.\"    The government based its § 924(c) charge on\n\nJohn Jr.'s robbery of Sapochetti in alleged violation of the Hobbs\n\nAct.    Thus the government had to prove that John Jr. used or\n\ncarried a firearm, that his use of the firearm was in relation to\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\fthe robbery, and that he did in fact commit a Hobbs Act robbery.\n\nTo prove a Hobbs Act robbery, the government had to establish that\n\nthe   Sapochetti   robbery   \"in   any    way   or   degree   obstruct[ed],\n\ndelay[ed], or affect[ed] commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). John Jr.\n\nargues the government failed to prove this nexus with interstate\n\ncommerce.\n\n            \"The Hobbs Act's scope extends to the limit of Congress'\n\nCommerce Clause authority.\"    United States v. Capozzi (Capozzi I),\n\n347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir. 2003).         Because of this, and because\n\nthe Hobbs Act by its terms criminalizes robberies that affect\n\ninterstate commerce \"in any way or degree,\" the government need\n\nonly show that the robbery created \"a realistic probability of a de\n\nminimis effect on interstate commerce.\"15            Id. (quoting United\n\nStates v. Butt, 955 F.2d 77, 80 n.2 (1st Cir. 1992)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    This required showing is \"not onerous.\"\n\nCapozzi II, 486 F.3d at 726 (quoting United States v. DiGregorio,\n\n605 F.2d 1184, 1191 (1st Cir. 1979)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            A reasonable jury could have concluded that John Jr.\n\nrobbed Sapochetti and that the probable effect of that robbery was\n\nan impact on interstate commerce, albeit largely illicit commerce.\n\nThe robbing of a drug dealer typically has the required nexus with\n\n\n      15\n          This standard is unaffected by United States v. Lopez,\n514 U.S. 549 (1995), and United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598\n(2000). Capozzi I, 347 F.3d at 336 & n.3.\n\n                                   -54-\n\finterstate commerce.     See, e.g., id.; United States v. Parkes, 497\n\nF.3d 220, 231 (2d Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 1320 (2008);\n\nUnited States v. Ostrander, 411 F.3d 684, 692 (6th Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Williams, 342 F.3d 350, 355 (4th Cir. 2003) (\"Drug\n\ndealing . . . is an inherently economic enterprise that affects\n\ninterstate commerce.\"); United States v. Bailey, 227 F.3d 792, 798-\n\n99 (7th Cir. 2000); United States v. Box, 50 F.3d 345, 353 (5th\n\nCir. 1995).      A robbery can affect interstate commerce when it\n\ndepletes the assets of a business, even if the business is that of\n\ndrug dealing.     See, e.g., Capozzi II, 486 F.3d at 726; Williams,\n\n342 F.3d at 354-55; Bailey, 227 F.3d at 798.         It was sufficient for\n\nthe government to demonstrate that the robbery of cocaine dealers\n\ngenerally affects interstate commerce and that John Jr. intended to\n\nrob Sapochetti of money he believed was derived from or intended to\n\nfinance cocaine sales.       See Bailey, 227 F.3d at 798.16\n\n            DiCenso and Regan both testified that Sapochetti was a\n\nknown cocaine dealer.        The interstate aspect was nailed down by a\n\nDEA agent who, testifying as an expert witness, explained that the\n\ncoca plant from which cocaine is derived is native to South America\n\nand   is   not   (to   his    knowledge)   capable   of   being   grown   in\n\nMassachusetts.    From this the jury could conclude that Sapochetti\n\n\n\n      16\n          Thus, contrary to John Jr.'s assertion, under the\ndepletion-of-the-assets theory the government did not have to\nprovide specific proof that the stolen money was connected to\nSapochetti's interstate commerce activity.\n\n                                    -55-\n\fwas engaged in a business that affected interstate commerce.\n\nFurther, the government presented plentiful evidence that the\n\ncrew's modus operandi was to rob rival drug dealers of their drugs\n\nand drug proceeds, both to decrease competition and to increase the\n\ncrew's supplies for their own sales.              Both DiCenso and Regan\n\ntestified that the crew obtained around $18,000 from Sapochetti.\n\nThe jury could have reasonably inferred that John Jr. intended to\n\nand did deplete Sapochetti's business assets, thereby affecting\n\ninterstate commerce to some degree.\n\n            John    Jr.   makes   a   related   argument    that    the   jury's\n\n\"inconsistent\" verdict demonstrated that it did not find an effect\n\non interstate commerce but was confused about the elements of\n\n§ 924(c) because the judge's instructions on this charge were\n\nconvoluted.     This argument fails.         Although the jury did acquit\n\nJohn Jr. on the substantive offense of a Hobbs Act robbery of\n\nSapochetti, \"inconsistent verdicts are not sufficient grounds for\n\nreversing a criminal conviction as long as the appellate court is\n\nsatisfied    that   there   was   sufficient     evidence    to    support   the\n\nconviction.\" United States v. Richard, 234 F.3d 763, 768 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    This is so even where, as here, the jury acquits the\n\ndefendant of a predicate felony while convicting on the compound\n\nfelony.     United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 67-68 (1984).              We\n\nhave held that a defendant can be convicted under § 924(c) even if\n\nhe was acquitted of the drug trafficking crime on which the\n\n\n                                      -56-\n\f§   924(c)     charge   was   premised.       United       States   v.    Figueroa-\n\nEncarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir. 2003).                At least one other\n\ncircuit has addressed the specific situation presented by this case\n\nand affirmed a § 924(c) conviction where the jury acquitted on the\n\npredicate Hobbs Act robbery. United States v. Smith, 182 F.3d 452,\n\n458 (6th Cir. 1999).          Because there was sufficient evidence to\n\nestablish the jurisdictional element of a Hobbs Act robbery, John\n\nJr.'s      conviction   for   using   or   carrying    a    firearm      during   the\n\ncommission of that offense must be affirmed.                   See generally 3\n\nWright, King & Klein, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal\n\n§ 514, at 27-28 (3d ed. 2004) (collecting cases).\n\n              Further, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected any\n\nrole for individualized assessments of inconsistent verdicts when\n\na defendant argues the inconsistency was caused by a trial error,\n\nsuch as the argument here that the jury instructions were unclear.\n\nThis is because such inquiries \"would be based either on pure\n\nspeculation,      or    would    require     inquiries       into     the    jury's\n\ndeliberations that courts generally will not undertake.\"                    Powell,\n\n469 U.S. at 66.     Indeed, much of defendant's argument on this point\n\ntakes the form of speculation about what the jury might or might\n\nnot have believed about the law or concluded about the facts of the\n\ncase.17\n\n\n      17\n          We also see no error in the court's instructions. The\ncourt explained the Hobbs Act, including its jurisdictional\nelement, clearly and at length; contrasted it to the state law\n\n                                      -57-\n\f            John Jr.'s conviction under § 924(c) is affirmed.\n\nE.          Sentencing\n\n            Finally, John Jr. appeals his sentence on one basis. The\n\njury    found   that   the   government   had   not   proved   John   Jr.'s\n\ninvolvement in racketeering act 13, possession of cocaine with\n\nintent to distribute.        However, John Jr. had pled guilty to the\n\nsame offense conduct in 1997 and was sentenced to 249 days of\n\nimprisonment.     John Jr. argues that the time he served for that\n\ncrime -- in which calculation he also includes the twenty-one\n\nmonths he served for violating the terms of his supervised release\n\nfollowing his 249-day sentence -- should have been taken into\n\naccount as a sort of mitigating factor in his sentencing in this\n\ncase.    As he put it in his sentencing memorandum to the district\n\ncourt, \"[a]t a minimum, an innocent man who serves time should be\n\nremunerated for the time he served.        [The district court] should\n\nsentence below the guideline sentencing range by the same amount of\n\ntime that the defendant served for the crime that he did not\n\ncommit, 29 months . . . .\"      The district court, however, concluded\n\nthat it \"cannot give credit for time served on a sentence that\n\nsomeone else imposed in a case in which Mr. DeCologero admitted\n\nguilt\" and sentenced John Jr. to 210 months of imprisonment.\n\n\ncrime of armed robbery; and explained that a Hobbs Act robbery\nconstituted a violent federal crime under § 924(c).      While the\ninstructions were complicated, so was the case, and the jury had to\nassist it the redacted indictment and a chart of elements for each\ncrime charged.\n\n                                   -58-\n\f             We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence\n\nfor abuse of discretion, but we first consider whether the court\n\nbelow committed a \"significant procedural error, such as . . .\n\ntreating the Guidelines as mandatory.\"           Gall v. United States, ___\n\nU.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597 (2007).           To the extent that John Jr.\n\nargues that the trial court did not believe it could grant him a\n\nvariance     based   on    this   particular    factor,      that   argument    is\n\npreserved.    On appeal, John Jr. focuses on the trial judge's use of\n\nthe word \"cannot\" in her decision not to take the prior conviction\n\ninto account.\n\n             When considering a sentencing appeal, however, we do not\n\nlook at comments in isolation but consider the sentencing record as\n\na whole.     Cf. United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc) (\"[A] court's reasoning can often be\n\ninferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained\n\nin the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\").               It is clear\n\nthat   the   trial    court   did    not   consider    the   Guidelines    to   be\n\nmandatory.     The court sentenced John Jr. below the Guidelines\n\nrange, which it calculated to be between 324 and 405 months.                    It\n\nbased this lower sentence on a number of the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\nfactors, especially § 3553(a)(1), and on other factors specific to\n\nJohn Jr.'s case: that the conviction came ten years after the\n\ncommission     of    the   crimes,    that    Paul    A.   and   other   \"elders\"\n\n(presumably including his father) had \"subjected\" John Jr. \"to\n\n\n                                       -59-\n\fcruel control . . . most of his life,\" that John Jr. had \"made\n\nstrides\" in changing his life, and that the formal Guidelines\n\ncalculation     double-counted    some    of   the   underlying     offenses,\n\nresulting in an \"artificially high\" Guidelines range.               We do not\n\ndoubt that the trial court recognized its discretion to take John\n\nJr.'s prior conviction and imprisonment into account; the court\n\nsimply did not agree with defendant that his previous incarceration\n\nfor a crime to which he pled guilty should lead to a sentence\n\nreduction.\n\n             To the extent that John Jr. argues that the district\n\ncourt committed a Guidelines error by not taking into account a\n\npossible downward departure under U.S.S.G. §§ 5G1.3 and 5K2.23, he\n\ndid not present that argument to the trial court.            We thus review\n\nthe sentence on this ground for plain error only.          United States v.\n\nGoodhue, 486 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Wallace,\n\n461 F.3d 15, 35 & n.11 (1st Cir. 2006).          We pass over the questions\n\nof   which   Guidelines   apply   (the   trial    court   applied   the   1995\n\nGuidelines, in effect at the time of the offense conduct) and\n\nwhether, if the 1995 Guidelines do apply, the later amendments\n\nrelevant here were retroactive.          Even taking these questions in\n\ndefendant's favor, John Jr.'s argument does not survive the plain\n\nterms of § 5G1.3.\n\n             Under the current Guidelines, § 5G1.3(b) provides for an\n\nadjustment of the sentence to account for an undischarged term of\n\n\n                                   -60-\n\fimprisonment that \"resulted from another offense that is relevant\n\nconduct to the instant offense of conviction . . . and that was the\n\nbasis        for    an   increase   in   the    offense     level   for   the   instant\n\noffense.\"          Id. (emphasis added).        Application note 4, which cross-\n\nreferences and uses the same language as § 5K2.23, approves the use\n\nof a downward departure when the prior term of imprisonment has\n\nbeen     fully       discharged,    as   long    as   the   other   requirements    of\n\n§ 5G1.3(b) are met.           Neither section is applicable here, then, as\n\nthe offense underlying racketeering act 13 was not taken into\n\naccount in the Guidelines calculation; much less was it a \"basis\n\nfor an increase in the offense level\" in this case.18                      See United\n\nStates v. Kornegay, 410 F.3d 89, 99 (1st Cir. 2005); see also\n\nUnited States v. Parker, 512 F.3d 1037, 1040 (8th Cir. 2008).\n\n                   The sentence is affirmed.\n\n                                           IV.\n\n                   We turn to Paul A.'s appeals but find them likewise\n\nunavailing.\n\n\n\n\n        18\n          The language in the 1995 Guidelines differs slightly but\nnot in a material way. The older version of § 5G1.3(b) covered an\n\"undischarged term of imprisonment [that] resulted from offense(s)\nthat have been fully taken into account in the determination of the\noffense level for the instant offense.\" Again, the alleged offense\nconduct covered by racketeering act 13 was not taken into account\nin the trial court's Guidelines determination.\n          The parties also dispute whether that offense conduct, to\nwhich John Jr. pled guilty in 1997, was relevant conduct to the\ninstant offense. We do not need to resolve that question.\n\n                                           -61-\n\fA.         Double Jeopardy\n\n           This court rejected Paul A.'s pre-trial double jeopardy\n\nclaims.    DeCologero, 364 F.3d at 19.       Paul A. renews his double\n\njeopardy claim in this post-conviction appeal based on the evidence\n\nactually presented at trial.      See United States v. Laguna-Estela,\n\n394 F.3d 54, 59 (1st Cir. 2005).         Our review is de novo.   United\n\nStates v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo, 70 F.3d 706, 714 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           In our prior consideration of this issue, we noted that\n\n\"double jeopardy only bars successive RICO charges involving both\n\nthe same enterprise and the same pattern of racketeering activity.\"\n\nDeCologero, 364 F.3d at 18.        The court recognized that it was\n\nperhaps a \"hard question\" whether the enterprises in the Carrozza\n\ncase and this case were the same, but concluded that the patterns\n\nof racketeering activity were not.           Id.   Having assessed the\n\nevidence post-trial, we reach the same conclusion.\n\n           In comparing the charged patterns of racketeering, we\n\nconsider   the    totality   of   the    circumstances,   including   the\n\nsimilarities of \"the time, the place, the people, and the nature\n\nand scope of the activities involved in each indictment.\"             Id.\n\nPaul A. first argues that the time periods covered by the two\n\ntrials overlap.    We recognized in our earlier opinion the overlap\n\nin the time periods covered by the two indictments but found it\n\ninsubstantial.     Id. at 19.      We noted then that the Carrozza\n\nindictment focused on 1989 to 1994 but that the Carrozza trial\n\nincluded evidence of events occurring as late as 1998.          Id.   The\n\n                                  -62-\n\fDeCologero indictment focused on the years 1995 to 1997, but the\n\nprosecution   introduced   evidence   reaching   back   to   1994.   For\n\nexample, there was conflicting testimony about whether the Soccorso\n\nrobbery occurred in late 1994 or late 1995, and the prosecution\n\nsought to establish that Finethy incurred his drug debt in 1994 as\n\nbackground for the alleged 1996 extortion.       These exceptions were\n\nminor, however, and Paul A. points to no other instances of\n\nproffers of pre-1995 evidence.    We again conclude that the overlap\n\nbetween the time periods is insubstantial.       Cf. United States v.\n\nCiancaglini, 858 F.2d 923, 929 (3d Cir. 1988) (finding distinct\n\npatterns of racketeering activity despite overlap of twenty-five\n\nmonths).\n\n           Paul A. concedes that he is the only common defendant\n\nbetween the two indictments, but he argues that does not end the\n\nanalysis of common participants.      We need not address his premise,\n\nfor in any event, the only common character Paul A. points to is\n\nVincent Marino, a Carrozza defendant, who Paul A. argues is a\n\nmissing link in the Silva murder.     That connection is tenuous, and\n\nit does not even suggest that the two indictments charged the same\n\npattern of racketeering activity.       Cf. United States v. Russotti,\n\n717 F.2d 27, 33 (2d Cir. 1983) (finding different patterns of\n\nracketeering activity even though two individuals were named in\n\nboth indictments).\n\n           Finally, Paul A. points to references in the Carrozza\n\ncase to robberies of drug dealers in arguing that the two cases\n\n                                 -63-\n\fdealt with the same types of crime.                First, the references in\n\nCarrozza     are    not   new   information,       derived    from   the    actual\n\nprosecution of this case, and thus would not affect the conclusion\n\nwe reached in the interlocutory appeal.               Second, the overlap of\n\nsome types of crimes between two indictments does not necessarily\n\nmean the indictments charge the same pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity. See, e.g., United States v. Ruggiero, 754 F.2d 927, 933-\n\n34 (11th Cir. 1985) (finding different patterns of racketeering\n\nactivity even though both indictments charged crimes under the same\n\ngambling, drug, and robbery statutes).             Third, the alleged overlap\n\nwas minimal.\n\n           We thus conclude again that, whether or not the same\n\nenterprise    was    involved,     the    indictments   did    charge      and   the\n\ngovernment did try two different patterns of racketeering activity.\n\nTaken as a whole and based on the trial records, the Carrozza case\n\n\"focused on the systematic murder of rival mafia members . . . to\n\nseize control of the Patriarca family,\" while this case focused on\n\n\"a more conventional collection of robberies and drug trafficking\n\noffenses, the single murder being merely a means of protecting the\n\nconspiracy from the police.\" DeCologero, 364 F.3d at 18-19. There\n\nhas been no violation of Paul A.'s double jeopardy rights by his\n\nstanding trial in this case.\n\nB.         Ability to Present Defense\n\n           Paul     A.    raises   several      arguments    pertaining     to   his\n\nability to present his defense theory in full.               He claims that the\n\n                                         -64-\n\fdistrict court curtailed the testimony of witnesses in violation of\n\nhis Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, that the court failed to\n\ncompel the production of a witness in violation of his Sixth\n\nAmendment rights, and that the prosecution withheld exculpatory\n\nevidence in contravention of its Brady duties and in violation of\n\nhis Fifth Amendment rights.        These arguments all fall short.\n\n            1.         Trial Management and Evidentiary Rulings\n\n            Paul A.'s primary defense was that Regan was aligned with\n\nthe Salemme faction of the Patriarca Family and thus would not have\n\nbeen working with Paul A. if Paul A. was, as the government had\n\npreviously alleged, aligned with the Carrozza faction.             Paul A.\n\ncomplains that the trial judge curtailed his ability to present\n\nthis defense by restricting his cross-examination of Regan and\n\nother witnesses and by cutting short his own testimony.           He argues\n\nthat these rulings violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to\n\npresent his defense.\n\n            \"Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the\n\n[Fifth] Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation\n\nclauses   of     the   Sixth   Amendment,   the   Constitution   guarantees\n\ncriminal defendants 'a meaningful opportunity to present a complete\n\ndefense.'\"       Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 682, 690 (1986) (quoting\n\nCalifornia v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984)) (citations\n\nomitted).      What constitutes the \"basic elements\" of a fair trial\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment is determined \"largely through the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\fseveral        provisions       of    the   Sixth    Amendment.\"        Strickland      v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 685 (1984).19\n\n                However,       \"[a]   defendant's     right      to   present   relevant\n\nevidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable\n\nrestrictions.\"              United States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308\n\n(1998).        For example, the Supreme Court has \"never questioned the\n\npower of States to exclude evidence through the application of\n\nevidentiary rules that themselves serve the interests of fairness\n\nand reliability -- even if the defendant would prefer to see that\n\nevidence admitted.\"              Crane, 476 U.S. at 690.                Thus, \"federal\n\nrulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish\n\nrules excluding evidence from criminal trials. . . . so long as\n\n[those rules] are not 'arbitrary' or 'disproportionate to the\n\npurposes they are designed to serve.'\"                    Scheffer, 523 U.S. at 308\n\n(quoting Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 56 (1987)).\n\n                The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle recently,\n\nemphasizing that \"well-established rules of evidence [that] permit\n\ntrial        judges    to    exclude    evidence     if   its    probative      value   is\n\noutweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice,\n\nconfusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury\" do not\n\nnormally breach defendants' constitutional rights. Holmes v. South\n\nCarolina,        547    U.S.    319,    326    (2006).      In    Holmes,    the   Court\n\n\n        19\n          As relevant here, the Sixth Amendment protects the\naccused's right, in a criminal trial, \"to be confronted with the\nwitnesses against him\" and \"to have compulsory process for\nobtaining witnesses in his favor.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI.\n\n                                              -66-\n\fspecifically noted as one such \"well-established rule\" the rule\n\nthat a court may exclude a defendant's evidence proffered to show\n\nthat someone else committed the crime in question if that evidence\n\nis too speculative, remote, or immaterial.           Id. at 327, 330.\n\n             Paul A. argues that he was unable to question Regan fully\n\nduring     cross-examination    about   his   affiliation     with   Salemme's\n\ngroup.     But the court did allow Regan to be questioned about the\n\nstructure of the Patriarca family, his association with Frank\n\nSalemme Jr., and related issues despite continued objections by the\n\nprosecution.      The limits which were placed on questioning were\n\nbased on the judge's well-founded concerns about relevance and were\n\nwithin     her   discretion.     The    prohibited    questions      pertained\n\nprimarily to events that occurred before 1995 and thus before the\n\ncrimes alleged in the indictment.             There was a risk of jury\n\nconfusion from this line of questioning in an already complex and\n\nconfusing case.     See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 219\n\nF.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"The district court 'retains wide\n\nlatitude to impose reasonable limits' on cross-examination in order\n\nto   avoid   confusion   of    the   issues   or   extended   discussion   of\n\nmarginally relevant material.\" (quoting United States v. Twomey,\n\n806 F.2d 1136, 1139 (1st Cir. 1986))).20\n\n\n\n      20\n          Paul A. also complains of restrictions on his ability to\npresent evidence that Regan was somehow involved in Silva's murder,\nbut he does not specify any objectionable rulings. Regardless, the\nevidence in question is highly tangential and circumstantial; there\nwould have been no abuse of discretion in its exclusion.\n\n                                     -67-\n\f             Paul A.'s objection to the court's curtailing of his own\n\ntestimony is also misplaced. Regardless of what theory a defendant\n\nmight wish to present, that does not entitle him to provide non-\n\nresponsive (and provocative) answers, even to his own attorney's\n\nquestions.        In addition, much of the information pertinent to Paul\n\nA.'s defense came in through the cross-examination of Regan.\n\nFinally,     Paul     A.    complains     of     the   court's   rulings     on    the\n\ninadmissibility        of    most    testimony         pertaining   to     the     gym\n\nconversations, but we have already found those rulings not to be in\n\nerror.21\n\n             Paul A. was able to present his defense, and the court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in restricting the admission of a\n\nfraction of his evidence.           Cf. O'Brien v. Marshall, 453 F.3d 13,\n\n19-20      (1st    Cir.     2006)   (no    constitutional        violation        where\n\ndefendant's evidence that someone else committed the crime was\n\nrestricted based on traditional hearsay rules); DiBenedetto v.\n\nHall, 272 F.3d 1, 7-9 (1st Cir. 2001) (no constitutional violation\n\nwhere defendant's evidence that others had motive in mob killing\n\nand that key government witness was lying to regain favor with mob\n\nfaction was excluded because it was unreliable and tangential).\n\n             2.        Denial of Compulsory Process\n\n\n\n\n     21\n          Paul A. also alleges that the trial court curtailed his\nopening and closing arguments, but our review of the record\nrevealed no basis for these allegations.\n\n                                          -68-\n\f            Paul A. also attempted at trial to show that Vincent\n\nMarino, a.k.a. Gigi Portalla, was involved in the North burglary\n\nand in Silva's murder, a showing presumably meant to exonerate Paul\n\nA.      He argues that the district court's refusal to expedite\n\nMarino's transport from a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania or\n\nto provide a continuance until Marino's presence could be secured\n\ndeprived him of compulsory process under the Sixth Amendment.\n\n            Paul A. filed his motion for Marino's transport to\n\ntestify on February 28, two days before the prosecution rested.\n\nThe district court allowed the motion, but refused to order the\n\nU.S. Marshals to expedite their transport process or to provide\n\nextra funds to do so.      Paul A. moved for a continuance, which the\n\ncourt also denied.\n\n            If the court had denied Paul A.'s motion to transport\n\nMarino, our review would be for abuse of discretion. United States\n\nv. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1117 (1st Cir. 1989).                    As the court\n\ngranted the motion but simply refused to expedite the request, we\n\nsee no reason why a more stringent standard of review should be\n\nused.     Trial judges are best situated to weigh the competing\n\ndemands    of   trial   management   --     \"factors   such   as    timeliness,\n\nmateriality, relevancy, competency, practicality, and utility\" --\n\nand thus we accord the trial court's determinations in these areas\n\n\"considerable respect.\"      Id. at 1118.\n\n            As the trial court noted, Paul A. submitted his request\n\nquite belatedly.        There was no reason for that delay.               Other\n\n                                     -69-\n\fcircuits faced with similar circumstances have found no abuse of\n\ndiscretion.          Where a defendant waited until seven business days\n\nbefore    the    trial      started   to    request    the   production      of    an\n\nincarcerated witness, the Eighth Circuit concluded that, \"[i]n view\n\nof the modest benefit that [the] testimony might have offered, . .\n\n. the district court correctly ruled that the countervailing public\n\ninterests       in    the   efficient      administration    of    justice        were\n\nsufficient reason to deny the motion for a continuance of the\n\ntrial.\"     United States v. Sparkman, 500 F.3d 678, 683 (8th Cir.\n\n2007).    The Eighth Circuit also found no abuse of discretion where\n\nthe trial court denied a further continuance when the marshals\n\ncould not locate witnesses subpoenaed at government expense (under\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(b)), given that the defendant\n\nhad waited until the day before trial to request the subpoena.\n\nUnited States v. DeCoteau, 648 F.2d 1191, 1192-93 (8th Cir. 1981).\n\nAs the Second Circuit succinctly stated, where the defendant had\n\nwaited until two business days before the beginning of trial to\n\nrequest a continuance so that an incarcerated prisoner could be\n\nproduced, \"any detriment suffered by [the defendant] resulted from\n\nhis own dilatory conduct and not from the court's ruling.\"                   United\n\nStates v. King, 762 F.2d 232, 235 (2d Cir. 1985).                  In all these\n\ncases,    the    defendants'      efforts      to   secure   the   testimony       of\n\nincarcerated witnesses were considered tardy even though they were\n\nmade prior to the commencement of trial; Paul A. waited until the\n\ntwenty-ninth day of trial to make his request.               The comparison is\n\n                                        -70-\n\fnot in his favor.     Further, the proffered testimony of Marino was\n\ntangential   and    potentially     cumulative.      Any   benefit   of   the\n\ntestimony would have been slight.\n\n           The Compulsory Process Clause is more a sword than a\n\nshield because \"[t]he decision whether to employ it in a particular\n\ncase rests solely with the defendant.        The very nature of the right\n\nrequires that its effective use be preceded by deliberate planning\n\nand affirmative conduct.\"     Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 410\n\n(1988).   The fault here lies with Paul A.\n\n           3.       Brady Disclosures\n\n           Finally, Paul A. alleges that the prosecution withheld\n\nexculpatory evidence in contravention of its Brady obligations.\n\nAgain, we review Brady determinations for abuse of discretion.\n\nCaro-Muñiz, 406 F.3d at 29. Paul A. repeatedly requested materials\n\npertaining   to    investigations    of    Vincent   Marino,   specifically\n\nevidence linking Marino to Silva's death, but the prosecution\n\nopposed and the court denied the motions.\n\n           The prosecution represented that it had disclosed all\n\npotentially exculpatory material.22        Paul A. points to no specific\n\nmaterials or information he believes are in the prosecution's\n\npossession that would exculpate him.            Without such a specific\n\nrequest, it is the prosecution \"that decides which information must\n\n\n     22\n          This included alerting the defense in 2001 and 2002 that\na witness (DiCenso) linked Marino to a gun deal gone bad and that\na confidential informant had linked Marino to the guns being stored\nby Silva.\n\n                                    -71-\n\fbe disclosed.     Unless defense counsel becomes aware that other\n\nexculpatory evidence was withheld and brings it to the court's\n\nattention, the prosecutor's decision on [Brady] disclosure is\n\nfinal.\"   Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 59 (1987) (footnote\n\nomitted); see also Brandon, 17 F.3d at 456 (finding insufficient a\n\ndefendant's \"speculat[ion] that the . . . files might contain\n\nexculpatory evidence\" without \"any supporting evidence or arguments\n\nto indicate this was, in fact, the case\").          There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in crediting the prosecution's adamant assertion that it\n\nhad no further material and exculpatory evidence.\n\nC.         Conflict of Interest\n\n           Paul   A.   requests   a   new   trial   based   on   his   trial\n\nattorney's alleged conflicts of interest and the trial court's\n\nunwillingness to hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter.              We\n\nreview this question de novo.         Reyes-Vejerano v. United States,\n\n276 F.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Paul A. alleges that his counsel, John Salsberg, suffered\n\nfrom two conflicts of interests: that his law partner previously\n\nrepresented Jon Minotti, a potential defense witness, and that his\n\nassociate had previously worked for an attorney who had represented\n\nVincent Marino in the Carrozza case. See United States v. Ramirez-\n\nBenitez, 292 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"Representation of co-\n\nindictees by members of the same law firm may create a conflict of\n\ninterest similar to that when a single attorney represents two or\n\nmore co-defendants.\"). Paul A. argues there was some evidence that\n\n                                  -72-\n\fMinotti had additional information about Silva's murder, owned some\n\nof   the   guns    found     in    Silva's     apartment,     and    had    told   an\n\nacquaintance that he had participated in the Stevens robbery.\n\nSalsberg's partner withdrew his representation of Minotti when\n\nSalsberg was appointed to represent Paul A.                Salsberg's motion for\n\na writ of habeas corpus to procure Minotti's testimony was denied\n\nbecause    the     court     concluded    that     his     testimony       would   be\n\ninadmissible.      As for Marino, Paul A. does not describe what, if\n\nany, work Salsberg's associate might have done on Marino's case at\n\nhis prior firm. The court did approve Salsberg's motion requesting\n\nMarino's transport from prison to testify but did not order the\n\nmarshals   to     expedite    the    process;    as    a   result,   Marino    never\n\ntestified.\n\n            Prior to jury impanelment, Paul A. filed a pro se motion\n\nrequesting new counsel, but that motion and the in-court discussion\n\nit generated focused on whether Salsberg was prepared for trial.\n\nTowards the very end of the trial, Paul A. filed a series of pro se\n\nmotions requesting new counsel; those motions focused on Salsberg's\n\nalleged conflicts of interest.            The court summarily denied these\n\nlater pro se motions.\n\n            On appeal, Paul A. is mistaken as to the law: reversal is\n\nnot automatic when a trial judge fails to conduct a proper inquiry\n\ninto a potential conflict of interest.                See Mickens v. Taylor, 535\n\nU.S. 162, 170-73 (2002); United States v. Newton, 326 F.3d 253,\n\n263-64 (1st Cir. 2003).           This is because, as the Supreme Court has\n\n                                        -73-\n\fexplained,   \"defects      in   assistance    [of   counsel]   that   have    no\n\nprobable   effect   upon    the   trial's    outcome   do   not   establish   a\n\nconstitutional violation.\"        Mickens, 535 U.S. at 166.       Even if the\n\npossibility of a conflict of interest was apparent enough to\n\nrequire the trial court to conduct a formal inquiry into the issue\n\n-- a question that is not immediately clear on the facts of this\n\ncase -- \"the trial court's failure to make [that] inquiry does not\n\nreduce [Paul A.'s] burden of proof.\"          Id. at 173-74; see also id.\n\nat 168-69 (discussing when a court has a duty to inquire into a\n\npotential conflict of interest).            Paul A. still bears the burden\n\nof showing that the conflict of interest he alleges went beyond a\n\n\"mere theoretical division of loyalties\" and in fact \"adversely\n\naffected his counsel's performance.\"          Id. at 171, 174.23\n\n           This showing by a defendant of an actual conflict is less\n\nburdensome than that required to establish ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claims.    United States v. Burgos-Chaparro, 309 F.3d 50,\n\n52 (1st Cir. 2002).     Here the defendant must demonstrate that his\n\n\n     23\n          Contrary to Paul A.'s assertions, nothing in Mickens\nsuggests that the Court intended its holding to apply to only those\ncases in which the defendant did not raise a conflict of interest\nconcern during the trial, nor does the automatic reversal rule of\nHolloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475 (1978) -- which the Mickens\nCourt cabined very narrowly -- apply here where counsel did not\nhimself object at trial. See Mickens, 535 U.S. at 168 (Holloway's\nautomatic reversal rule applies \"only where defense counsel is\nforced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless\nthe trial court has determined that there is no conflict\" (emphasis\nadded)). While Salsberg did raise other concerns before the trial\ncourt about his ability to represent Paul A., he never informed the\ncourt that he himself believed that he was unable to represent Paul\nA. due to a conflict of interest.\n\n                                     -74-\n\fcounsel's performance was affected by the conflict, but need not\n\nalso establish that the difference in performance prejudiced him in\n\nthe same sense as in an ineffective assistance claim.                    Id.24\n\nShowing an adverse effect, however, still requires more than mere\n\nspeculation,   id.   at   53;   the    defendant   \"must   show   that   [the\n\nattorney] might plausibly have pursued an alternative defense\n\nstrategy, and that the alternative strategy was in conflict with,\n\nor may not have been pursued because of, [the attorney's] other\n\nloyalties or interests,\" Ramirez-Benitez, 292 F.3d at 30; see also\n\nUnited States v. Lachman, 521 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir. 2008).               This\n\nPaul A. fails to do.\n\n          Paul A. makes no viable argument as to what Salsberg\n\nmight have done differently.      He accuses Salsberg of not obtaining\n\nMinotti's testimony, but Salsberg did attempt to procure Minotti's\n\ntestimony; that the court denied the request for evidentiary\n\nreasons is unrelated to the question of Salsberg's allegedly\n\ndivided loyalties.    As for Marino, Paul A. accuses Salsberg of not\n\nactively interviewing Marino or requesting his appearance in a\n\ntimely manner.   This, however, is not an accusation that Salsberg\n\n\n\n     24\n          The Supreme Court in Mickens expressly did not reach the\nquestion of whether this \"actual conflict\" standard, requiring some\nshowing of an actual adverse effect but not of prejudice, should\napply to cases of successive representation, such as this one.\nMickens, 535 U.S. at 176. Like the Mickens Court, we reserve this\nquestion for another day and grant Paul A. the benefit of the\nassumption that the actual conflict standard is available to him;\nfrom the record before us, we doubt Paul A. could otherwise muster\na showing of prejudice.\n\n                                      -75-\n\ffailed to pursue an alternative defense strategy, but that he did\n\nnot pursue Paul A.'s desired strategy to Paul A.'s satisfaction.\n\nCf. Lachman, 521 F.3d at 21-22 (finding no conflict of interest\n\nwhere counsel did present defendant's desired defense theory).25\n\nNor does Paul A. clarify how any inaction on Salsberg's part was in\n\nfact the manifestation of divided loyalties.26 Cf. Burgos-Chaparro,\n\n309 F.3d at 53 (defendant must offer some showing that attorney's\n\nalleged shortcomings were in fact due to divided loyalties).\n\n            There   is   thus   no    showing    of   an   actual   conflict    of\n\ninterest.    This claim fails.\n\nD.          Pre-Indictment Delay\n\n            Paul A. complains that the government could have brought\n\nthe robbery- and drug-related charges in this case at the same time\n\nas the charges prosecuted in the Carrozza trial.               He asserts that\n\nthe failure to press these charges earlier was a tactical decision\n\nby the government and that he was prejudiced by having to mount a\n\nseparate defense at the later DeCologero trial.                   We review the\n\ndistrict    court's   refusal    to    dismiss    the   charges     due   to   pre-\n\n\n     25\n          Such allegations might instead go to the effectiveness of\nSalsberg's representation, but that tack would likely fail for lack\nof prejudice -- required to establish an ineffectiveness of counsel\nclaim -- resulting from these alleged shortcomings.\n     26\n          Paul A.'s argument that the failure of Tony Bucci to\ntestify for the defense had anything to do with Salsberg's alleged\nconflicts of interest is simply not borne out by the record. The\ndebate over Bucci's testimony revolved primarily around Bucci's\nFifth Amendment rights; there is no indication that Salsberg tried\nto prevent Bucci from testifying due to the role of Minotti as a\ngovernment witness in Bucci's concurrent criminal case.\n\n                                      -76-\n\findictment delay for abuse of discretion.             Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d\n\nat 58.   The court correctly determined there was no constitutional\n\nviolation here.\n\n           Pre-indictment        delay   does   not   implicate       the     Sixth\n\nAmendment's Speedy Trial provision, but the Supreme Court has\n\nacknowledged that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\n\n\"has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive [pre-\n\nindictment] delay.\"        United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 789\n\n(1977) (summarizing United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 324\n\n(1971)).     The Due Process Clause has only a limited role in this\n\ncontext because the statutes of limitations provide the primary\n\nprotection    against    undue    pre-indictment      delays.         Id.;    Soto-\n\nBeníquez, 356 F.3d at 25.         To rise to the level of a due process\n\nviolation despite the applicable statute of limitations not having\n\nrun, the delay (1) must have \"caused substantial prejudice to\n\n[defendant's] rights to a fair trial\" and (2) \"was an intentional\n\ndevice\" used by the prosecution \"to gain tactical advantage over\n\nthe accused.\" Marion, 404 U.S. at 324; see also Soto-Beníquez, 356\n\nF.3d at 25. \"Substantial prejudice\" means more than inconvenience;\n\nit   requires   a   showing      of   actual    prejudice,      and    even     the\n\nunavailability of witnesses or evidence might not be sufficient to\n\nmeet this burden.       See Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d at 59.\n\n           Paul A. argues that the separate trials prevented him\n\nfrom developing his defense -- that Regan worked for Salemme and\n\nwas framing Paul A. in the context of the war between the Carrozza\n\n                                      -77-\n\fand Salemme factions -- in the second case.                The exclusion of some\n\nevidence in the present trial did not cause Paul A. substantial\n\nprejudice, as he was still allowed to present his defense theory to\n\nthe jury, even if not to the full extent he desired.\n\n            There is also no evidence suggesting a prosecutorial\n\npurpose of obtaining tactical advantage as there is no evidence\n\nthat the prosecution knew in 1997 what Paul A.'s defense would be\n\nin the present case.\n\n            There is, on the other hand, a reasonable explanation for\n\nthe prosecution's delay.           As Lovasco makes clear, prosecutors\n\nretain    discretion     to    delay   charges     until    investigations      are\n\ncomplete and all other considerations have been weighed.                    Lovasco,\n\n431 U.S. at 790-91.           Paul A. attempts to distinguish Lovasco by\n\narguing    that   the    delay     here    was     not     due   to   an    ongoing\n\ninvestigation.      First, ongoing investigations are not the only\n\nconstitutionally acceptable explanations for pre-indictment delays.\n\nSee id. 792-95.     Second, Paul A. concedes that the investigation\n\ninto Silva's murder was not completed at the time of the Carrozza\n\ntrial.    Contrary to Paul A.'s characterization, that crime was\n\nclosely   related   to    the     other   crimes    charged      in   the   present\n\nindictment: Silva's murder was an effort to avoid prosecution for\n\nand was thus part of the conspiracy to commit the robberies, drug\n\ndealing, and other crimes that Paul A. argues should have been\n\nprosecuted sooner.       There was no unconstitutional pre-indictment\n\ndelay.\n\n                                       -78-\n\f-79-\n\fE.         Denial of Continuances\n\n           We turn to the final issue on appeal.           After the court\n\nappointed Paul A. a new lawyer on September 23, 2004, it pushed the\n\ntrial back from that week until January 9, 2006 -- a delay of\n\nfifteen months.     Defense counsel requested a further six-month\n\ncontinuance in November 2005, which the court denied.             On January\n\n6, 2006, Paul A.'s attorney sought a one- or two-week continuance,\n\nwhich the court again denied.          Paul A. argues on appeal that the\n\ncourt's refusal to grant these continuances violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel.           We disagree.\n\n           We review for abuse of discretion a district court's\n\ndenial of a motion for continuance. Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d at\n\n21-22. \"[B]road discretion must be granted trial courts on matters\n\nof continuances; only an unreasoning and arbitrary 'insistence upon\n\nexpeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay'\n\nviolates the right to assistance of counsel.\"            Morris v. Slappy,\n\n461 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1983) (quoting Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575,\n\n589 (1964)).   \"A defendant is generally not entitled to a new trial\n\nunless he or she can identify specific ways in which the court's\n\nerroneous denial of a continuance prejudiced his or her defense.\"\n\nRodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d at 22.\n\n           Paul A. points to no such prejudice.         Instead, he argues\n\nin general terms that his counsel did not have enough time to\n\nprepare.    This   was   a   complex    case   with   extensive   discovery.\n\nHowever, counsel was given twice as long as Paul A.'s formal\n\n                                   -80-\n\fcounsel had estimated would be necessary (even accounting for the\n\nnew counsel's participation in another lengthy trial during those\n\nfifteen months).   As the district court pointed out, conscientious\n\nlawyers will always feel that they could do more to prepare.   The\n\ndistrict court's decision to go forward after a fifteen-month delay\n\nwas well within its discretion.27\n\n                                 V.\n\n          After careful review, we deny all appeals and affirm the\n\ndistrict court and the convictions on all counts.\n\n\n\n\n     27\n          Paul A. also argues that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying his motion for a continuance on the first day\nof trial so he could seek advice on his lawyer's potential conflict\nof interest, see supra. This motion was untimely, especially as\nthe question of his representation had been thoroughly canvassed in\npre-trial motion practice. See, e.g., Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d\nat 22.    It was also, in the district court's view, a purely\ndilatory tactic.\n\n                                -81-\n\f                                    Appendix\n\nKey:\n\nG = Guilty\n\nNG = Not Guilty\n\nRA = Racketeering Act\n\n(Some   counts   for   which   no   defendants   were    convicted   are       not\n\ndiscussed in this opinion.)\n\nCount    Crime                       Paul A.

DeCologero (\"Paul A.\"), his nephews Paul J. DeCologero (\"Paul J.\") and John P. DeCologero, Jr. (\"John Jr.\"), and their friend Joseph F. Pavone appeal their assorted RICO,<sup>[1]</sup> robbery, drug dealing, witness tampering, firearms, and related <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> conspiracy convictions. After a thirty-nine day trial on eighteen counts, each defendant was found guilty on some and acquitted on other of the charges. Each now raises multiple claims on appeal regarding the management of the trial, evidentiary rulings, the sufficiency of the evidence against them, and other discrete matters.</p>\n<p>We affirm the convictions and also reject John Jr.'s sentencing appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because three of the defendants question the sufficiency of the evidence behind their convictions, we relate the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2004). We trace the general contours of the case here and leave further recounting for the analysis of particular arguments.</p>\n<p>Paul A. ran a criminal enterprise (the \"DeCologero crew\") based out of a gym he operated in Woburn, Massachusetts. Paul J., John Jr., Pavone, and other associates assisted Paul A. in his efforts to control a portion of Boston's drug trade. Part of the crew's modus operandi was to beat up and to steal drugs and cash from other drug dealers. Aislin Silva, a young woman who was a friend of crew member Stephen DiCenso, was murdered and dismembered in an effort to protect the crew's activities.</p>\n<p>Each defendant was convicted of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), as well as the substantive offense of engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). These convictions required that each defendant be found to have committed at least two predicate racketeering acts, which could be either state or federal crimes. A table of the counts and racketeering acts is provided in the appendix. We summarize the racketeering acts for which at least some of the defendants were convicted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Soccorso Robbery1995</i><sup>[2]</sup></h2>\n<p>In 1995, Paul A. sent John Jr. and Thomas Regan to the house of Philip Soccorso, a marijuana dealer, to steal drugs from him. Regan tricked Soccorso into leaving his house and then forced him into their car at gun point. When Soccorso refused to disclose the location of his drugs, Regan and John Jr. drove to Paul A.'s house to pick him up and, as Regan recounted, Paul A. \"read [Soccorso] the riot act\" about dealing drugs in Paul A.'s territory. To add emphasis, John Jr. hit Soccorso with a handgun. Eventually Soccorso told them that his supplier, Gary Ramus, who was back at Soccorso's house, might have some drugs. They returned to the house, and Regan forced Ramus into the car at gunpoint.<sup>[3]</sup> After some more haranguing (also at gunpoint), Soccorso and Ramus agreed to give Paul A. the marijuana stashed at Soccorso's house.</p>\n<p>Regan, Ramus, and Soccorso testified for the government at trial. The jury found that Paul A. and John Jr. had committed the racketeering acts of armed robbery, the kidnaping of Soccorso and Ramus, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Pesaturo RobberyNovember 1995</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Around November 1995, Paul A. agreed with Regan that Richie Pesaturo, another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> drug dealer, needed to be taught a lesson because he owed Regan money and had been \"running his mouth\" about the crew. On Paul A.'s orders, Regan, Paul J., and John Jr. went to Pesaturo's apartment, where John Jr. and Regan beat Pesaturo and Regan \"read[] him the riot act.\" The three crew members then ransacked the apartment until they found Pesaturo's cocaine supply and $11,000. Before leaving, the three men bound Pesaturo and his roommate Richard Bentley, who had returned home during the course of the robbery, with duct tape. They then went to Paul A.'s place to divide up the proceeds.</p>\n<p>Regan and Bentley testified at trial about this robbery and beating. The jury found that Paul A., John Jr., and Paul J. had committed the racketeering acts of robbery under the Hobbs Act,<sup>[4]</sup> the kidnaping of Pesaturo and Bentley, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Finethy ExtortionJanuary/February 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In January or February 1996, Paul A. sent John Jr. and Pavone to the house of Shane Finethy, who sold marijuana on Paul A.'s behalf. Finethy had kept $8000 in proceeds from drug sales without Paul A.'s permission, using it for a down payment on a house, and had failed to pay Paul A. back. Upon arrival, John Jr. realized that Finethy had sold the house in question and was preparing to move. John Jr. became angry, and he and Pavone hit Finethy until his face was covered with blood; after Finethy's wife and baby came into the room, Finethy left the house and John Jr. and Pavone followed. Out on the street, they attempted to force Finethy into their car, with John Jr. threatening Finethy at gunpoint. The arrival of a police cruiser broke up the scene, and Finethy returned to his house.</p>\n<p>Finethy and his wife testified at trial, and the jury found that Paul A., John Jr., and Pavone had committed the racketeering act of extortion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Sapochetti RobberyOctober 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In the fall of 1996, Kevin Meuse and Derek Capozzi were released from jail and joined the DeCologero crew. That October, the crew planned to rob and kill Albert \"Big Al\" Sapochetti, a bookmaker and drug dealer. With Paul A.'s agreement, John Jr. and Meuse robbed Sapochetti at gunpoint and beat him, leaving him, his neighbor, and his girlfriend hog tied with duct tape and wires. John Jr. and Meuse threatened to return for more money and told Sapochetti they were sparing his life because of his girlfriend's presence.</p>\n<p>Sapochetti's girlfriend testified at trial. In addition to finding that Paul A. and John Jr. had committed the racketeering acts of kidnaping all three victims, the jury also convicted them of using or carrying a firearm, or aiding and abetting such use, during the commission of a violent crime. The government alleged that Paul J. participated in this robbery as well, but the jury found his participation not proved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Stevens RobberyOctober 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Also in October 1996, the crew targeted Michael \"Slim\" Stevens, who was selling marijuana in Paul A.'s territory. Paul A. gave guns to Regan, Capozzi, and Meuse and sent them with Stephen DiCenso, another member of the DeCologero crew, to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> Stevens's townhouse. Regan and Capozzi beat Stevens and threatened to cut off his ear with a knife. Stevens eventually turned over what money he had and led Regan and Capozzi to a stash of marijuana. Before leaving, Regan and Capozzi tied up Stevens, his girlfriend, and another friend of Stevens who had arrived during the robbery.</p>\n<p>Stevens, his girlfriend, Regan, and DiCenso testified about this incident at trial. The jury convicted Paul A. of robbery under the Hobbs Act, possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. These crimes, along with armed robbery and kidnaping, were also proved as to Paul A. as racketeering acts under RICO.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>North BurglaryOctober 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The crew also burgled the home of Jeffrey North, another marijuana dealer, that same October. When DiCenso told Paul A. that North was in jail pending bail, Paul A. sent DiCenso, Paul J., and Regan to burgle North's apartment. DiCenso broke into the apartment and, with the help of the others, found a cache of weapons, two safes, night vision goggles, and about ten pounds of marijuana.<sup>[5]</sup> The burglars packed most of the goods into duffel bags and heaved the safes over the balcony of the apartment to the yard below. They then loaded \"the bags, a box of grenades, and the safes\" into a car and returned to Paul A.'s house. There Meuse pried open the safes in the presence of the others. The safes contained various firearms, including two MAC-11s (submachine gun/pistol), an Uzi (submachine gun), and another machine gun with a silencer, as well as money and more drugs.<sup>[6]</sup> Paul A. gave most of the guns to DiCenso to store in the home of Aislin Silva, a nineteen-year-old woman who permitted her friend DiCenso to keep drugs in her apartment on behalf of the crew.</p>\n<p>In connection with this burglary, Paul A. and Paul J. were found guilty of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, which the jury also found to be a racketeering act, and of being felons in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>G. <i>Silva Witness Tampering and MurderNovember 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. went to Silva's apartment later that month with DiCenso and Vincent Marino (a.k.a. Gigi Portalla) to show Marino the guns. On November 5, when DiCenso and Paul J. returned to Silva's apartment on Paul A.'s instructions to pick up some of the guns, they found the police, who had received a tip about the guns, already there. When DiCenso and Paul J. entered the apartment, the guns were in plain view on the floor and the police were questioning Silva; they questioned Paul J. and DiCenso as well and then allowed them to leave.</p>\n<p>DiCenso and Paul J. reported back to Paul A. and the crewPavone, Meuse, Regan, Capozzi, and John P. DeCologero, Sr. (\"John Sr.\"), the father of John Jr. and Paul J.who were gathered at Pavone's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> house. Paul A. instructed Pavone and Meuse to rent a motel room and sent DiCenso and Capozzi to pick up Silva. Also on Paul A.'s instructions, DiCenso stayed with Silva for the next two nights in different motel rooms. On November 7, another meeting was held at Pavone's house with Silva present. DiCenso testified that he, Capozzi, Meuse, Pavone, and Paul A. were there, though he could not remember at what point Pavone arrived. Paul A. told Silva that their \"attorneys were out of town, but they would take care of everything,\" and that in the meantime, Paul A. would arrange for Silva to be taken on a shopping spree in New York City, accompanied by DiCenso. Pavone drove DiCenso and Silva to New York that night in a limousine that Paul A. had borrowed from an associate, Anthony (\"Tony\") Bucci. Pavone returned to Boston while DiCenso and Silva spent five nights in New York City.</p>\n<p>When DiCenso and Silva returned to Boston on November 12, they went to Pavone's house, where the others were gathered. There, DiCenso, Paul A., and Meuse spoke privately in the kitchen. DiCenso told Paul A. that he did not think Silva would \"hold up\" under police questioning, to which Paul A. responded, \"She has to be killed.\" Paul A.'s first plan was for DiCenso to give Silva some high-grade heroin, telling her it was \"really good cocaine\"; DiCenso was then to wait until Silva was dead before calling 911 to report the overdose. If Silva did not ingest sufficient heroin to cause a fatal overdose, Meuse was to blow more of it up her nose. To this end, Paul A. sent Paul J. to Antonio Centeno, a heroin dealer in Lowell. Centeno testified that Paul J. asked him for heroin \"strong enough for an overdose\" and that he sold Paul J. thirty bags of heroin. Although Silva did ingest some of this heroin, it did not have its intended effect. Moving to a new plan, Paul A. told Meuse to kill her.</p>\n<p>The morning of November 13, Meuse arrived at DiCenso's apartment, where Silva was staying, and sent DiCenso to the hardware store to buy a hacksaw and sheet metal cutters. When DiCenso returned, Silva was dead, and Meuse told DiCenso he had broken her neck. Capozzi arrived to help, and the three men dismembered Silva's body in the bathtub and packed her remains into trash bags. They drove north, stopping at a Home Depot to purchase lime and a shovel, and buried Silva's remains in the woods along the North Shore. They then disposed of the remaining evidence in a dumpster in Danvers, washed the car, and stopped at a department store to buy three pairs of sneakers and three sweatsuits.</p>\n<p>DiCenso testified to the details of the murder described above at trial; his testimony was supported by physical evidence recovered by the police. Paul A., Paul J., and Pavone were all convicted of conspiracy to tamper with a witness and tampering with a witness by misleading conduct; Paul A. and Paul J. were also convicted of tampering with a witness by attempted murder, and Paul A. was convicted of tampering with a witness by murder. These crimes, along with the state-law crimes of murder, attempted murder, and conspiracy to murder, were also found as racketeering acts under the substantive RICO charge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Paul A., Paul J., John Jr., Pavone, John Sr., and Capozzi were indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts on October 17, 2001.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> Paul A. moved to dismiss the RICO charges against him on double jeopardy grounds, an argument based on an earlier trial. The motion was denied; the denial was appealed. In <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d 12 (1st Cir.2004), this court rejected that appeal. We explain the background.</p>\n<p>In an earlier trial, <i>United States v. Carrozza,</i> No. 4:97-cr-40009-NMG (D.Mass. 1999), Paul A. was prosecuted for helping the Carrozza faction of the Patriarca crime family undertake a violent \"war\" between 1989 and 1994 in an attempt to wrest control of that criminal organization from Frank Salemme's faction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 19-21 (1st Cir.2002) (describing the factual background of the <i>Carrozza</i> case). Paul A. was acquitted of all charges in that case, and he argued in his pre-trial motion in this case that the present indictment violated his double jeopardy rights because it alleged the same conspiracy. <i>DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d at 16-17. The district court disagreed, and on interlocutory appeal this court affirmed, holding that the two cases dealt with different patterns of racketeering activity. <i>Id.</i> at 19. That double jeopardy claim is renewed here based on the evidence actually introduced at trial.</p>\n<p>John Sr. pled guilty to a RICO charge on February 28, 2003, and testified for the government at trial. <i>United States v. Capozzi</i> (<i>Capozzi II</i>), 486 F.3d 711, 714 (1st Cir.2007). In July 2004, Capozzi moved to disqualify the attorneys for Paul A., Paul J., and John Jr., arguing they had conflicts of interests. <i>Id.</i> The attorneys for the three defendants then withdrew, and because of the delay required for the new attorneys to prepare for trial, the district court, on the government's motion, severed Capozzi's case so that his trial could begin as planned in September 2004. <i>Id.</i> The court gave the remaining four defendants fifteen months to prepare, with the present trial beginning on January 9, 2006. The jury returned its verdict on March 20, 2006. The district court sentenced Paul A. to life imprisonment, Paul J. to 25 years imprisonment, John Jr. to 210 months imprisonment, and Pavone to 72 months imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone raise similar and overlapping issues on appeal, we consider their claims together.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Severance and Mistrial</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motions, based on several grounds, to sever their trial from that of Paul A. or to declare a mistrial.<sup>[8]</sup> Those grounds include Paul A.'s alleged admission to being a gang leader, his odd behavior in the courtroom, his responsibility for the heinous act of the murder of Aislin Silva, and the risk of jury confusion. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> 1. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Trial judges' decisions regarding severance and mistrial are treated with a considerable amount of deference because appellate courts lack the \"first-hand exposure to a case\" that better enables trial judges to \"strike the delicate balance between fending off prejudice, on the one hand, and husbanding judicial resources, on the other hand.\" <i>United States v. O'Bryant,</i> 998 F.2d 21, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1993). Thus we review a district court's denial of a motion for severance or motion for mistrial under the same standard: manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Tejeda,</i> 481 F.3d 44, 54 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 612, 169 L.Ed.2d 393 (2007); <i>United States v. Glenn,</i> 389 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The risks of prejudice and jury confusion in this case were not negligible, but they were not uncommon either. By their nature, RICO cases involve many defendants, sometimes with family relationships, and often include multiple repulsive acts. There are ways, with skillful trial management and diligent counsel, to prevent these risks from growing into actual harm. Trial judges \"have broad power to cope with the complexities and contingencies inherent in the adversary process.\" <i>Geders v. United States,</i> 425 U.S. 80, 86, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 47 L.Ed.2d 592 (1976). The trial judge in this case was particularly aware of and sensitive to the complexity of this case and the possibility of jury confusion. <i>DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d at 20. (An earlier case management order splitting off some of the charges into a separate trial was vacated by this court to avoid double jeopardy problems. <i>Id.</i> at 21-25.)</p>\n<p>As to severance, \"the general rule is that those indicted together are tried together to prevent inconsistent verdicts and to conserve judicial and prosecutorial resources.\" <i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 29. The district court can, however, sever defendants' trials or provide other relief if \"there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\" <i>Zafiro v. United States,</i> 506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993); <i>see also</i> Fed R.Crim. P. 14(a). If the district court decides not to sever the trial, the defendant bears the burden of making a strong showing that prejudice resulted from the denial of severance, and prejudice in this context \"means more than just a better chance of acquittal at a separate trial.\" <i>United States v. Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d 230, 246 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting <i>United States v. Martinez,</i> 479 F.2d 824, 828 (1st Cir.1973)) (internal quotation mark omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Zafiro,</i> 506 U.S. at 540, 113 S.Ct. 933. \"This is a difficult battle for a defendant to win.\" <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Severance Based on Antagonistic Defenses</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone argue strenuously that as the trial went on it became clear that Paul A.'s defense was antagonistic to theirs. Antagonistic defenses can require severance when they are truly irreconcilable, or at least substantially incompatible. <i>Tejeda,</i> 481 F.3d at 55; <i>United States v. Peña-Lora,</i> 225 F.3d 17, 34 (1st Cir.2000). \"[W]here there is merely some dissonance,\" however, \"we will usually not reverse a trial court's denial of severance.\" <i>Tejeda,</i> 481 F.3d at 55. Here, the defenses were not truly irreconcilable, nor were they substantially incompatible.</p>\n<p>The other defendants characterize Paul A.'s testimony as admitting that he ran a criminal enterprise during the time in question. This, they say, was incompatible with their defense of non-criminality. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> record does not support their characterization.</p>\n<p>Paul A. testified that he had originally, back in the 1980s, delivered drugs on behalf of Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, two infamous Boston-area organized crime bosses, but he described his connection with them as minimal and explained that he had refused to continue even in this minimal role after he served his first term in prison (from 1984 to 1992). Paul A. asserted that his refusal irked the mob leaders. His primary defense was that Regan worked for what had become the Salemme faction of the Patriarca Family and was thus motivated to testify falsely against Paul A., setting him up to take the fall for crimes in fact committed by Regan and other followers of Salemme.</p>\n<p>In developing this defense, Paul A. did bring up his prior indictment in the <i>Carrozza</i> case, as well as the allegation that the Carrozza and Salemme factions were at odds. In Paul A.'s cross-examination of Regan, there were also some references to \"the DeCologero crew,\" but these were references to what others had alleged, such as the language of the indictment. While this tack might have muddied the waters for the jury, it did not (contrary to his co-defendants' arguments) set Paul A. up before the jury as \"an open and notorious underworld figure.\"</p>\n<p>Instead, the jury heard Paul A. flatly deny running a criminal enterprise (the alleged DeCologero crew), insist that he was not affiliated with any organized criminals, and explain repeatedly that only his son (and, on rare occasion, his brother John Sr.) assisted him in his drug deals after his release from prison. While Paul A. admitted that he had continued some limited drug dealing in the mid-1990s, he explained that he stopped such activity once his side business selling high-protein muffins to other gyms started doing well enough to meet his gym's operating deficit. Paul A. admitted knowing Regan, DiCenso, and Meuse, but he denied ever asking them for assistance in any criminal conduct.</p>\n<p>The jury could accept Paul A.'s testimony that he was an occasional drug dealer, and even that he was disliked and targeted by mob leaders, while also accepting the other defendants' claims that they had engaged in no criminal wrongdoing. Paul A. did not implicate the others, nor did his defense as presented to the jury, if accepted, preclude acquittal of the others. There was no substantial incompatibility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Severance Based on \"Spillover\" Effects and Mistrial Based on Paul A.'s Courtroom Antics</i>\n</h2>\n<p>At the core, these three defendants argue that Paul A.'s admitted criminality, the more severe crimes with which he was charged, and his inappropriate courtroom behavior cast a pall over all four defendants, prejudicing his co-defendants before the jury. This tack also fails.</p>\n<p>As Justice Jackson famously noted, co-defendants in a conspiracy trial like this one occupy \"an uneasy seat. There generally will be evidence of wrongdoing by somebody. It is difficult for the individual to make his own case stand on its own merits in the minds of jurors who are ready to believe that birds of a feather are flocked together.\" <i>Krulewitch v. United States,</i> 336 U.S. 440, 454, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring). Such uneasiness is inherent in joint RICO trials, and the unsavoriness of one's co-defendant (including past criminal conduct) is not enough, by itself, to mandate severance. <i>Tejeda,</i> 481 F.3d at 56. Defendants must still make a strong showing of prejudice to overturn the trial court's decision not to sever.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone have also not met that burden with their argument that they suffered from a \"spillover\" effect due to Paul A.'s prosecution for Aislin Silva's gruesome murder. While only Paul A. was on trial for the actual murder of Silva, Paul J. and Pavone were charged with closely related crimes (attempted murder and tampering with a witness) involving the same victim. Further, all four men were convicted of RICO conspiracy, and the scope of that conspiracy included protecting their criminal enterprise by silencing witnesses like Silva. Thus even if some of the defendants were not directly charged with Silva's murder, the murder was still relevant to the RICO counts as it tended to prove the existence and nature of the RICO enterprise and conspiracy. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Diaz,</i> 176 F.3d 52, 103 (2d Cir.1999). As a result, even if the defendants had received separate trials, evidence of the murder would have been independently admissible against each, and it is far from clear that the potentially prejudicial impact of that evidence would have rendered it inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. <i>See </i><i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 29-30. This is why, \"[i]n the context of conspiracy, severance will rarely, if ever, be required\" due to evidentiary spillover. <i>United States v. DeLuca,</i> 137 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d 319, 325 (1st Cir.1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The defendants' fear of being found guilty by association with Paul A. has a third aspect: his distracting courtroom behavior. Paul A.'s testimony was often unresponsive or tangential, provoking repeated objections from the prosecution and rebukes from the bench. During the prosecution's case, the judge admonished Paul A. for interfering with the work of his defense counsel, warning that his disruptive behavior was hurting rather than helping him in the eyes of the jury. Generally, however, if \"a defendant misbehaves in the jury's presence, the misbehavior usually will not compel a separate trial for his codefendants\"; rather, the co-defendant seeking severance or mistrial must \"demonstrate the existence of some special prejudice\" that the court could not remedy through other means. <i>United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 616 (1st Cir.1994). If the rule were otherwise, co-defendants could provoke mistrials at will. <i>United States v. Tashjian,</i> 660 F.2d 829, 838 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p>Paul A.'s co-defendants do not point to any specific prejudice, asserting more generally that they \"were prejudiced by his conduct and the court's inability to rein him in.\" Nor do they provide any case law to support their argument that such behavior warrants a mistrial. Rather, under the case law, Paul A.'s conduct is not comparable to the severity of other co-defendant outbursts analyzed in prior cases in which we upheld denials of severance motions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mazza,</i> 792 F.2d 1210, 1224 (1st Cir.1986) (no abuse of discretion in refusal to sever even though co-defendant shouted in middle of witness testimony, \"He is lying. I got shot for you, you mother piece of shit. This is my pay back.\"); <i>Tashjian,</i> 660 F.2d at 837 (no abuse of discretion in denial of mistrial even though defendant threatened a witness in front of the jury and yelled that his co-defendants were in the mafia). Paul A.'s unruly behavior in the courtroom was unfortunate, but his co-defendants have not made a sufficient showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p>Paul A.'s conduct also did not go unchecked by the district court. The court, outside the presence of the jury, told Paul A. to change his behavior, and this had at least some effect on him. For example, before Paul A. began his second day of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> testimony, the court warned himagain outside the presence of the jurythat:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]his is not fun and games.... This is a court of law, and there are rules.... [Y]ou will answer only the questions that are put to you and not blurt out a whole bunch of other stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I do believe that you are doing that on purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Number one, it doesn't help you. You may wish to look at the jury at times, and you will see that they are not buying it; and, number two, it is improper and inappropriate for you to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It is important for you that the story be told in some reasonably coherent fashion, and you're making it impossible for the story to be told in a coherent fashion; apart from which you are violating the orders of the Court every time you go off on a frolic of your own. So stop doing that. If you don't stop doing it, I will need to take further steps.</blockquote>\n<p>Paul A.'s subsequent testimony, though still subject to objections and occasional reprimands, was more restrained.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Severance Based on Jury Confusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In another line of arguments, Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone assert that severance was warranted because of Paul A.'s much greater degree of culpability, the number of crimes for which only Paul A. was on trial, and the similarity of the defendants' names. All of these factors, defendants argue, could easily lead to jury confusion, a type of prejudice that can be grounds for severance. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d 1, 26 (1st Cir.2004). Again, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p>It is true that \"markedly different degrees of culpability\" among co-defendants can \"heighten[]\" the risk of prejudice. <i>Zafiro,</i> 506 U.S. at 539, 113 S.Ct. 933. But again, disparity between the relative culpability of co-defendants does not <i>entitle</i> a defendant to severance. <i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 30; <i>United States v. Welch,</i> 15 F.3d 1202, 1210 (1st Cir.1993). Prejudice must be shown, and \"[e]ven where large amounts of testimony are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement ... is far less than the involvement of others, we have been reluctant to secondguess severance denials.\" <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246.</p>\n<p>Further, such disparity is not uncommon in RICO cases, nor is it unusual in such cases for a co-defendant to be charged with only a subset of the crimes alleged in the indictment. In <i>Flores-Rivera,</i> for example, this court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of severance for a defendant \"named in less than ten percent of all overt acts charged in the indictment.\" 56 F.3d at 325; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Welch,</i> 97 F.3d 142, 147 (6th Cir.1996) (no abuse of discretion in denial of severance even though defendant was only charged with three of the twenty-nine counts of the indictment). The RICO counts, of which all defendants were charged and all were convicted, provided the logical scope and overarching unity for the indictment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Turkette,</i> 656 F.2d 5, 9 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p>As for the defendants' similar names, defendants appear to assume that the similarities resulted in jury confusion. We cannot make such an assumption, especially as the jury spent two months in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> same room with these defendants and their distinct personalities. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Castillo,</i> 77 F.3d 1480, 1491 n. 20 (5th Cir.1996) (dismissing defendants' arguments of jury confusion in trial involving a Thomas Brown, Sr., and a Thomas Brown, Jr., in addition to three other defendants who shared the last name of Castillo). The defendants here have failed to demonstrate any prejudice greater than the \"possible risk of prejudice that almost always exists when multiple defendants with different roles are tried together.\" <i>United States v. Cresta,</i> 825 F.2d 538, 554-55 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>Two additional factors cut against the defendants' jury confusion argument. First, the district court noted to the jury at the outset of the trial that the jury must be careful to consider each defendant separately, a point repeated several times during the jury instructions at the trial's close. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Zafiro,</i> 506 U.S. at 540-41, 113 S.Ct. 933 (noting that proper jury instructions can alleviate risk of prejudice).</p>\n<p>Second, and more tellingly, the jury returned highly individualized verdicts: there were some charges for which the jury acquitted all defendants, and others for which the jury convicted some defendants while acquitting others. Even within some of the charged racketeering acts under the substantive RICO count, the jury found some but not all of the individual, closely related predicate acts proved. <i>See</i> Appendix. These were not the verdicts of a jury confused about the identity and culpability of the individual defendants. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Houle,</i> 237 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir.2001) (\"With regard to the jury's ability to segregate the evidence and understand the judge's instructions, the verdict itself is often quite telling.... This discriminating verdict shows that the jury was able to compartmentalize evidence and apply it to each defendant....\"); <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246; <i>Turkette,</i> 656 F.2d at 9. Given the considerable discretion a district court has to decide a motion for severance or mistrial, these additional factors further indicate that the district court did not abuse that discretion. In sum, we will not second guess the court's decision without a greater showing of prejudice. <i>See </i><i>United States v. DeLeon,</i> 187 F.3d 60, 63-64 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Judge's Trial Demeanor</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone next argue that the district court judge's criticisms of their counsel in the presence of the jury deprived them of a fair trial. With allegations of judicial bias, we consider whether the comments were improper and, if so, whether the complaining party can show serious prejudice. <i>Owens v. United States,</i> 483 F.3d 48, 66 (1st Cir. 2007). \"Charges of partiality should be judged not on an isolated comment or two, but on the record as a whole.\" <i>United States v. Polito,</i> 856 F.2d 414, 418 (1st Cir.1988); <i>accord </i><i>United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d 19, 35 (1st Cir.1999). As the Supreme Court has noted in the context of the recusal of judges, \"judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.... A judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration even a stern and short-tempered judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administrationremain immune.\" <i>Liteky v. United States,</i> 510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). This was a complex and lengthy trial, handled with skill by a seasoned trial judge who did not let things get out of control. The defendants have exaggerated; the record does not support their claims. The comments of which defendants complain were few <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> (eleven comments spread over thirty-six days of testimony), balanced, and reasonable in context.</p>\n<p>Defendants first argue that the judge referred to their objections as \"picky\" in front of the jury. During the government's direct examination of DiCenso, defense counsel repeatedly objected to leading questions, objections which the court sustained. After the fourth sustained defense objection in a brief stretch of questioning, the judge addressed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote>Let me explain, members of the jury. I told you yesterday that leading questions in general are a no-no when counsel conducted direct examination, but you can also be too picky about that. So, part of the reason that I have not always sustained the objection is because I thought at times it was a bit too picky. There is a certain judgment call that one has to make. However, at the moment, [the prosecutor] is leading [DiCenso] rather too much.</blockquote>\n<p>Immediately thereafter, the court ruled sua sponte that the government was asking another leading question. The court's \"picky\" comment had very little to do with the defense; if anything, the court was reprimanding the government.</p>\n<p>Defendants also accuse the court of unfair, sua sponte rulings that defense questions were argumentative. The court was even-handed: at times it raised sua sponte concerns about the government's questioning. There was no preferential treatment. Further, the rulings were correct. The court was trying, in this difficult case, to keep the focus on the evidence.</p>\n<p>We do not address additional exchanges regarding objections, but we do note that the court emphasized in its final instructions to the jury that it should not take into account the exchanges between counsel and the bench regarding evidentiary matters:</p>\n<blockquote>In the course of the trial, you have heard many times when counsel rose to object. You should not hold that against them or their clients. It is their right to do that. Indeed, it is their duty to do it. It's the way in which counsel bring to the attention of the Court when they think one or another of what you now know are very complicated rules are not being adhered to.</blockquote>\n<p><i>See </i><i>Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d at 36 (\"Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the trial court exhibited frustration from time to time during this rather lengthy, heated trial, the strong instructions given by the trial court... should have eliminated any conceivable prejudice.\"); <i>Logue v. Dore,</i> 103 F.3d 1040, 1046-47 (1st Cir.1997) (\"jury instructions can be a means of allaying potential prejudice\" in this context). In sum, the court's treatment of objections raised by both sides was even-handed and not unfair.</p>\n<p>The three defendants also take issue with comments by the court that, they argue, suggested they curtail their cross-examination of witnesses. These comments, too, when taken in context, were appropriate. Defendants do not argue, nor could they, that the district court cut their cross-examination short at any point. Instead, the court at times encouraged counsel to move more rapidly after lengthy questioning about minimally relevant information. We read a comment that counsel should limit his cross-examination to \"thirty seconds\" as a reflection of the late hour; the court dismissed the jury shortly thereafter, and when questioning resumed the next day, the attorneywho indeed had very few questionswas given all the time he needed, without further comment. The same explanation holds for a similar incident earlier in the trial, when the court asked defense counsel to try to conclude cross-examination of a witness that day: the judge's comment that some defense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> counsel might skip cross-examination altogether might have been a light quip, a reference to the imminent end of the trial day, or an acknowledgment that the remaining counsel might have few or no questions for the witnessindeed, one counsel did not have any questions, the other two had very few, and no one's questioning was curtailed by the judge.</p>\n<p>\"Trial judges are justifiably accorded broad latitude to ensure proper courtroom behavior.\" <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Rivera,</i> 473 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Gomes,</i> 177 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir.1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if such comments could be read as rebukes, a judge, in managing a trial, may rebuke counsel for inappropriate behavior and may reasonably limit cross-examination. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 254. The comments of concern here were appropriate exercises of the court's responsibilities to manage the trial. As the comments were not improper, we do not reach the question of prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Evidentiary Rulings</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Testimonial Exclusions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone argue that several of the trial court's evidentiary rulings were in error and were prejudicial. We review the district court's interpretation of the rules of evidence de novo, but we review the court's application of those rules for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Muñoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir.2007). We start with their objections to the court's exclusion of certain testimony.</p>\n<p>a. <i>Hearsay.</i> Defendants object that the court excluded as hearsay statements which were not. The hearsay rule applies to out-of-court statements \"offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). However, \"[i]f the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note. Defendants argue that two conversations that allegedly occurred at Paul A.'s gym fall into this latter category. The district court's rulings to the contrary were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Paul A. attempted to introduce these gym conversations through his own testimony and the testimony of his sister JoAnne and a gym employee named Peter Ippolito.<sup>[10]</sup> We summarize the testimony that defendants desired to introduce. In the first conversation, DiCenso and Silva allegedly came to Paul A. at his gym to seek his help because the guns had been discovered in Silva's apartment and because DiCenso was afraid of how Regan would respond. Paul A., who claimed the guns were not his, asserted that he got angry when he learned that DiCenso was storing the guns for Bobby Luisi, a member of the Salemme faction; Paul A. yelled out Luisi's name and told them, \"Get out of here. Those people are trying to kill me.\" In the end, Paul A. agreed to help DiCenso get a lawyer and called Tony Bucci to request a limousine on their behalf. In the second conversation, Meuse and Regan came to Paul A. and, in a heated argument, told him to \"stay out of their business, that that business with Stephen DiCenso and Aislin Silva was their business and had nothing to do with [Paul A.].\"</p>\n<p>The court allowed Ippolito to testify that DiCenso and Silva came to the gym, that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> Paul A. got angry, and that Paul A. yelled out someone's name. But the court did not allow testimony as to the name he yelled out (allegedly \"Bobby Luisi\"). Ippolito was also allowed to testify that the conversation between Meuse, Regan, and Paul A. took place and that they were \"very, very angry,\" but not to the content of that conversation. Paul A. testified that the conversation with DiCenso and Silva took place, that he tried calling an attorney for them, and that he called Bucci to order the limousine for DiCenso. JoAnne was allowed to testify to much more regarding the first conversation: that the three of them were talking about guns, that Paul A. yelled at DiCenso, \"Well, why are you coming to me\" because \"these are people who are after us,\" that Paul A. told them to leave the gym, and that he then tried to help DiCenso get in touch with an attorney and called for a limousine.</p>\n<p>The rest of the conversations the court excluded on hearsay grounds. Further details from the first conversation, it ruled, were only offered for \"the truth that DiCenso had another agenda\": that is, to establish that the guns were not Paul A.'s and that DiCenso was not working for Paul A. As for the second conversation, Paul A. argued it was relevant because it showed he \"was not in a conspiracy with Regan and Meuse. He was not the leader of an organization where he gave them orders, that they had their own thing going.\" The court reasoned, however, that this proffered relevance required the content of the statementsthat the guns and Silva had nothing to do with Paul A.to be true. These exclusion rulings were correct.</p>\n<p>Defendants argue that the statements should have been admitted as verbal acts, but that label applies to statements which \"affect[] the legal rights of the parties.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Stover,</i> 329 F.3d 859, 870 (D.C.Cir.2003) (\"[Verbal] acts are limited to statements that have independent legal significance, such as contractual offers or inter vivos gifts.\").</p>\n<p>The defendants perhaps mean to refer more broadly to the category of statements that are not hearsay because they are not offered for their truth. <i>See </i><i>Stover,</i> 329 F.3d at 870. At trial, Paul A. argued that the conversations were offered to provide context for other actions and events, not to prove the truth of the statements. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Page,</i> 521 F.3d 101, 106-07 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d 314, 319 (1st Cir.2001). Statements that provide \"context\" only if they are true, however, are still considered hearsay. <i>See </i><i>Stover,</i> 329 F.3d at 870.</p>\n<p>The only relevant context the defendants could point to here was the need to explain why Paul A. called a lawyer for DiCenso. Based on this argument, the court allowed into evidence testimony to the effect that Paul A. called a lawyer for DiCenso, not because DiCenso worked for him, but as a favor when DiCenso came to him with legal troubles. Defendants have put forward no further argument as to what other contextual background the remaining, excluded statements might provide without relying on the truth of those statements.</p>\n<p>Contrary to defendants' assertion, the court did not make broad rulings regarding hearsay, but carefully parsed each proffer, often ruling in defendants' favor in unclear situations. There was no abuse of discretion.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> b. <i>Impeachment.</i> In arguments that overlap with their hearsay arguments, defendants assert that the district court improperly excluded testimony meant to challenge the credibility of government witnesses.</p>\n<p>The ability to use extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction is linked to the question of hearsay. Generally, extrinsic evidence (such as the testimony of another witness) cannot be used to impeach a witness if it relates only to a collateral matter. <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 24. This common law rule is a manifestation of the district court's general discretion to exclude otherwise relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, ... or by considerations of undue delay [or] waste of time.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1993) (citing <i>United States v. Tarantino,</i> 846 F.2d 1384, 1409 (D.C.Cir.1988)). Evidence is collateral if it is relevant only because it contradicts the in-court testimony of another witness. <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 24. If what makes the statement otherwise relevant and thus not collateral relies on the truth of the statement, then the statement is hearsay and inadmissable on that ground.<sup>[12]</sup><i>See</i> 28 Wright &amp; Gold, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence</i> § 6206, at 537 n. 14 (1993). The decision on whether a matter is collateral or material is within the district court's discretion. <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>Defendants take issue with the court's refusal to let a defense witness recount a conversation in which Agent John Mercer allegedly tried to coerce him into testifying for the government. The court ruled that the testimony was only relevant to the extent it bore on Mercer's credibility and was thus collateral. Defendants note that \"a witness's self-interest or motive to testify falsely is generally considered to be a non-collateral issue.\" <i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4. If the argument is that the defendants were attempting to impeach Mercer not through contradiction but by establishing his bias against defendants and his motive to lie, this argument was not fully developed on appeal and is thus waived. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner [on appeal], unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Further, while extrinsic evidence is admissible to show bias, the trial judge still has discretion under Rule 403 to exclude such evidence if it would distract from the main issues of the case. <i>Gomes,</i> 177 F.3d at 81. This ruling was well within the court's discretion given the court's interest in avoiding a mini-trial on Mercer's conduct, which could distract the jury in an already complex case. <i>See </i><i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4.</p>\n<p>Defendants also argue that the district court should have issued bench warrants for three witnesses. The court refused to do so because the witnesses would only testify to collateral matters in order to contradict government witnesses, such as DiCenso and Regan. The court was correct that the witnesses would not be allowed, under the rules of evidence, to testify on those collateral matters. Further, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the proposed testimony of the witnesses, as proffered by Paul <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> A., regarded only collateral matters.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Pre-Trial Identification</i>\n</h2>\n<p>John Jr. appeals the denial of his motions to suppress pre-trial identifications made by Soccorso and Bentley, which he argues were based on an impermissibly suggestive photo array. There was no violation of John Jr.'s due process rights in the presentation of this identification evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p>Our review of a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion as to identification is plenary, but with the usual deference to any findings of fact. <i>United States v. Brennick,</i> 405 F.3d 96, 99-100 (1st Cir.2005). A court should exclude an out-of-court identification based on a photo array only in those \"extraordinary cases\" where there is \"a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\" a situation which could result in an unfair trial in violation of the defendant's due process rights. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting <i>United States v. de Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir.1993)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d 121, 125 (1st Cir.2006). \"Short of that point, such evidence is for the jury to weigh ..., for evidence with some element of untrustworthiness is customary grist for the jury mill. Juries are not so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the weight of identification testimony that has some questionable feature.\" <i>Manson v. Brathwaite,</i> 432 U.S. 98, 116, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977).</p>\n<p>John Jr. moved before trial to suppress the Bentley and Soccorso pretrial identifications, but the district court denied both motions, holding that \"these matters are properly addressed through cross-examination.\" The district court did not explicitly go through the two-step analysis described below.</p>\n<p>At trial, Soccorso and Bentley both testified that they picked John Jr. out of a six-photo array, more than three years after the robbery in Soccorso's case and over two years later for Bentley. That photo array was provided for the jury. John Jr.'s counsel cross-examined both witnesses extensively. He walked each of them through the characteristics of the six photographed men, arguing that four of them clearly did not match the age or hair-style descriptions that the witnesses had provided the police. Under defense counsel's questioning, Soccorso acknowledged that it was dark at the time of his abduction and that John Jr. was sitting behind him for much of their encounter; from Bentley, counsel drew a description of the pain medications Bentley had been taking at the time he made the identification as well as during the trial, and Bentley acknowledged that his doctor had written a letter to the effect that Bentley should not testify because the medications severely affected his recall.</p>\n<p>John Jr. also produced an expert witness, Dr. Steven Penrod, to testify about factors that decrease the reliability of witness identifications, many of which factors John Jr. argued to the jury were present in this case. Neither Bentley nor Soccorso made an in-court identification.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> John Jr. renewed his motion to suppress before the court charged the jury; that motion was also denied. John Jr.'s counsel then argued repeatedly and at length during his closing that the identifications were unreliable and should be discredited. The court, during its charge, instructed the jury that \"if the government's theory is that a particular defendant was a principal,... then you need to decide whether the evidence shows he was there, and if so, was he identified by the victim, was it a good or a questionable identification.\"</p>\n<p>We use a two-step analysis when considering whether a pretrial identification procedure raises a \"very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\": we first determine whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, and if it was, we then look to the totality of the circumstances to decide whether the identification was still reliable. <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100; <i>see also </i><i>Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 125. At the first step, we consider whether the photo array included, as far as was practicable, a reasonable number of persons similar in appearance to the suspect. <i>Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 125-26. \"The police authorities are required to make every effort reasonable under the circumstances to conduct a fair and balanced presentation of alternative possibilities for identification. The police are <i>not</i> required to search for identical twins....\" <i>Id.</i> at 126 n. 5 (quoting <i>Wright v. State,</i> 46 Wis.2d 75, 175 N.W.2d 646, 652 (1970)) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>As for the second step's totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, the Supreme Court in <i>Neil v. Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), enumerated five factors for consideration:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention to the crime; (3) the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the defendant; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; and (5) the length of time between the crime and confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100 (summarizing <i>Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375).</p>\n<p>Starting with the first step, the photo array for John Jr. was impermissibly suggestive. John Jr. has no unusual features that might complicate the search for others with similar appearances, yet the other photos in the array were not of men who looked similar to John Jr. beyond being white men with short hair. Comparison with the eight-photo array used for the identification of Paul J. is informative. In that array, the eight men appear to be of the same age group, seven of the eight have fairly similar hair, and the overall impression is one of resemblance. The array used for John Jr., however, included only six photos, two of which are of men who appear younger than John Jr. and two of which are of men clearly older; one of the latter has a noticeably receding hairline. Two of the men appear more heavyset than John Jr., and at least two have hair that is markedly different and not interchangeable with that of the defendant. In all, only one of the five photos depicts a man as similar to John Jr. as the photos in Paul J.'s array are to Paul J. Further, given the familial resemblance between the brothers, the existence of the other photos in Paul J.'s array makes all the more clear that the police should not have had trouble locating men who resembled John Jr. more closely.</p>\n<p>However, given the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the array did not raise a <i>substantial</i> likelihood of misidentification and that the remaining question of reliability was appropriately left to the jury. <i>Cf. </i><i>Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. at 200-01, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> 93 S.Ct. 375. Soccorso spent a substantial amount of time in the car with his assailant; Bentley watched as the crew ransacked his apartment and tied him up. Both witnesses were victims of the crimes and not accidental eyewitnesses whose attention might have been distracted. On cross-examination, despite thorough questioning, both witnesses stood by their identifications. Some of the <i>Biggers</i> factors cut in defendant's favor  Bentley did incorrectly describe two of the robbers as being the same height, and (more significantly) there was a lengthy time delay between the crimes and the identifications  but not all the <i>Biggers</i> factors must point in one direction for an identification to be upheld. <i>See </i><i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100. \"[I]t is only in extraordinary cases that identification evidence should be withheld from the jury,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>de Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d at 677), and this is not one of them.</p>\n<p>The weighing of the factors in this case, however, is a close question, so we also note that the jury was provided with extensive information about the identifications with which to make its own reliability determination. The defendant's counsel did a highly competent examination, eliciting testimony from multiple witnesses that cast doubt on the identifications of John Jr., especially in terms of the <i>Biggers</i> factors. The jury was clearly and properly instructed on the question and had before it a thorough record of why the identification might be untrustworthy. We are thus further reassured that John Jr.'s due process rights were not violated by the submission of the identification evidence, with all of defendant's caveats, to the jury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Pavone's Claim of Prosecutorial Misconduct</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Pavone argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by prosecutorial misconduct. We start by describing the underlying dispute.</p>\n<p>Pavone alleges that an old acquaintance, John Dana, and his colleague Wayne David Collins approached him around the time of his indictment and offered to hire an attorney on his behalf. That attorney, John Cicilline, did briefly take over Pavone's case. According to Pavone, Collins claimed to have a special, preferential relationship with the FBI, and Dana and Cicilline repeatedly asked Pavone to cooperate with the government. After his initial detention hearing, Pavone was approached by another inmate, Arlindo Dossantos, who warned Pavone that Collins and Dana were FBI informants who hired attorneys for criminal defendants in order to obtain confidential information that they could then pass on to the government. Pavone confronted Cicilline, Cicilline withdrew as counsel, and Pavone's former counsel was reappointed.</p>\n<p>Pavone moved to dismiss the indictment against him. He asserted that he had shared confidential information with Cicilline, that Cicilline transmitted that information to Collins and Dana, and that all three \"acted with the knowledge and approval of the government.\" He supported this motion with his own affidavit and that of his mother, who had spoken with Dana on multiple occasions during the time in question. Pavone also moved for discovery of sealed documents filed in Dossantos's prosecution regarding similar accusations against Collins, Dana, and the U.S. Attorney's Office.</p>\n<p>In response, the government submitted affidavits from the three Assistant U.S. Attorneys who prosecuted this case. They denied having ever met or communicated with Dana or Collins and asserted that, to the best of their knowledge, no one involved in the investigation had obtained any information from Dana, Collins, or Cicilline. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> One of them also explained that the case was investigated not by the FBI, but by the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives (\"ATF\"), and the Massachusetts State Police. The lead investigators from the ATF (Mercer) and the Massachusetts State Police (Irwin) also submitted affidavits, stating that neither they nor, to the best of their knowledge, anyone else working on the investigation had ever sought or received information from Dana, Collins, or Cicilline.</p>\n<p>The district court denied Pavone's motions to dismiss the indictment. Based on the government's affidavits \"and in the absence of any contradictory factual support,\" the court was \"not persuaded\" that Pavone could show that the government received any confidential information, even if he were allowed access to documents in the Dossantos case. It is this denial that Pavone appeals.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he government's intrusion into the attorney-client relationship\" is not a <i>per se</i> Sixth Amendment violation; there must also be some demonstration of resulting prejudice. <i>United States v. Mastroianni,</i> 749 F.2d 900, 907 (1st Cir.1984). Because such intrusions pose a serious risk to defendants' constitutional rights, and because it would be unreasonably difficult for most defendants to prove prejudice, we only require defendants to make a prima facie showing of prejudice by \"prov[ing] that confidential communications were conveyed as a result\" of the government intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. <i>Id.</i> at 907-08. The burden then shifts to the government to show that the defendant was not prejudiced; that burden is a demanding one. <i>Id.</i> at 908.</p>\n<p>Even taking all his allegations as true, Pavone did not show or even allege that Collins and Dana passed any confidential information they received from Cicilline on to the government. \"[U]nless [the informant] communicated the substance of the [attorney-client] conversations [to the government] and thereby created at least a realistic possibility of injury to [the defendant] or benefit to the State, there can be no Sixth Amendment violation.\" <i>Weatherford v. Bursey,</i> 429 U.S. 545, 558, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977); <i>see also </i><i>Greater Newburyport Clamshell Alliance v. Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H.,</i> 838 F.2d 13, 20 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Only information <i>communicated</i> to the prosecutor is capable of prejudicing a criminal defendant's sixth amendment rights at trial.\"); <i>United States v. Dyer,</i> 821 F.2d 35, 38 (1st Cir.1987) (where \"no confidential attorney-client information was relayed to, or obtained by, the prosecution,\" \"[t]he defense suffered no prejudice\" and thus no Sixth Amendment violation). We affirm the denial of Pavone's motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>Pavone also makes a related argument that the government improperly withheld <i>Brady</i> material (the Dossantos files) which he claims \"contain[ ] certain and definitive exculpatory material,\" presumably evidence that Collins and Dana were government informants. Under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. But \"<i>Brady</i> did not create\" a \"general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case.\" <i>Weatherford,</i> 429 U.S. at 559, 97 S.Ct. 837. \"To establish a violation of <i>Brady,</i> a defendant must provide the court with some indication that the materials to which he or she needs access contain material and potentially exculpatory evidence.\" <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> <i>States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 456 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>\"[M]ethods of enforcing disclosure requirements in criminal trials are generally left to the discretion of the trial court,\" and we review <i>Brady</i> determinations for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Caro-Muñiz,</i> 406 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir.2005). The district court here concluded that the Dossantos documents would not \"suffice to sustain Pavone's burden\" in establishing his prima facie case of a Sixth Amendment violation. In light of the record created by the prosecution that there was no contact by the prosecution with Collins and Dana in this case, and in the absence of any allegation by Pavone to the contrary, this ruling was plainly correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone all appeal their convictions on one or more charges, arguing that the government presented insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find them guilty.</p>\n<p>We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, scrutinizing the record as a whole, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, and avoiding any credibility judgments, to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found each element of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Muñoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 41. \"To uphold a conviction, the court need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in `a plausible rendition of the record.'\" <i>United States v. Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992)). Further, \"evidence sufficient to convict may be entirely circumstantial, with the factfinder remaining free to choose among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Wight,</i> 968 F.2d 1393, 1395 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Tampering with Witness by Misleading Conduct</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Pavone and Paul J. argue there was insufficient evidence to convict them of witness tampering (of Silva) by misleading conduct. The witness-tampering law prohibits \"engag[ing] in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to ... hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer ... of the United States of information relating to the commission ... of a Federal offense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3). \"Misleading conduct\" is further defined, as relevant here, as \"knowingly making a false statement\" or \"intentionally omitting information from a statement and thereby causing a portion of such statement to be misleading, or intentionally concealing a material fact, and thereby creating a false impression by such statement.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1515(a)(3)(A)-(B). These two defendants were indicted for and convicted of conspiracy to tamper with a witness through misleading conduct, as well as the substantive crime of tampering with a witness or aiding and abetting another to do so; tampering with a witness was also found to be a racketeering act for each under RICO.</p>\n<p>At trial, the government argued that the relevant misleading conduct was the isolation of Silva, \"all the while telling her that everything would be okay, their lawyers would take [ ] care [of everything] their lawyers would be back in town soon, telling her those things to mislead her about her situation.\" According to the government's trial theory, Pavone and Paul J. furthered that plan by being at the meetings where decisions about what to do with Silva were made, by renting hotel rooms, and by obtaining the heroin.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> The jury heard testimony that Paul A. and the crew were worried about what Silva had already told the police, made significant efforts to keep her away from the police while weighing the likelihood that she would betray them, and, to encourage her continued isolation and silence, reassured her repeatedly that their lawyers were away temporarily but would take care of everything upon their return.</p>\n<p>As for Pavone specifically, DiCenso testified that Pavone was present at the first meeting of the crew right after Silva had been discovered talking with the police; that DiCenso and Paul J. told \"everybody [present] what had happened in relation to the discovery of the guns\"; and that the mood of that meeting was \"[a]n overall general feeling of shock.\" Regan and DiCenso both testified that following the first meeting and at Paul A.'s behest, Pavone rented a motel room for Silva (which removed her from the apartment where she had met with the police), and Pavone did not deny driving DiCenso and Silva from Boston to New York (an act which made it even less likely that the police could find her). Given that Pavone participated in multiple parts of the scheme, that he spent several hours in a confined space with DiCenso and Silva during the drive to New York, that all three meetings about how to handle Silva occurred at Pavone's house, and that he was in the right place at the right time on multiple occasions to have heard the crew discuss the problem of Silva, a reasonable jury could have inferred that he knew the crew was misleading Silva to keep her from talking further with the police. The jury could have easily concluded that Pavone, rather than acting as a simple \"gofer,\" was knowingly assisting with that scheme.</p>\n<p>As for Paul J., he was with DiCenso when they went to Silva's apartment and discovered Silva being questioned by the police. He and DiCenso debriefed the crew about Silva's contact with the police at the first meeting. It was reasonable for the jury to infer that the plan to prevent Silva from talking further with the police was hatched at this meeting and that Paul J. was privy to it. Further, when the crew decided to kill Silva with an overdose to ensure that she would not betray them to the police, it was Paul J. who went to buy the heroin. He knew what it was for (he asked Centeno, the dealer, for heroin \"strong enough for an overdose\"), and it is a permissible inference that he knew the heroin would be provided to Silva under the guise of being a non-lethal drug. From all of this, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Paul J. knew of the scheme to convince Silva not to talk to the authorities and to prevent her from doing so, and that he knowingly assisted with that effort.</p>\n<p>These convictions of Pavone and Paul J. are affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Felon in Possession of a Firearm</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J. also appeals his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) for being a felon in possession of a firearm.<sup>[14]</sup> He does not dispute that he is a felon under the terms of the statute or that the firearms in question were related to interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>Wight,</i> 968 F.2d at 1397. Instead he argues that the government did not provide sufficient evidence that he knowingly possessed the six firearms, derived <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> from the North burglary, that it accused him of possessing.</p>\n<p>Knowing possession under § 922(g)(1) can be established by proving that the defendant had constructive possession of a firearm; that is, that he \"knowingly ha[d] the <i>power</i> and the <i>intention</i> at a given time of exercising dominion and control over a firearm ..., directly or through others.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1398 (emphasis added). Constructive possession can be joint, does not require actual ownership of the firearm, and can be established through circumstantial evidence, though \"mere presence or association with another who possessed the contraband is insufficient.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1397; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> 385 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir.2004). Possession, whether actual or constructive, can be extremely brief: \"a minute of possession is as much an offense as a year of possession.\" <i>United States v. Zavala Maldonado,</i> 23 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>There was enough evidence for the jury to find that Paul J. knowingly possessed the North firearms at some point. While other testimony was to the contrary, DiCenso testified that Paul J. was with him in North's apartment during the burglary. <i>See </i><i>Wight,</i> 968 F.2d at 1395 (credibility issues resolved in favor of government). Even if Paul J. was outside the apartment and helped the other two burglars load the stolen goods into the car, the jury could have reasonably inferred that he knew the duffel bags with the stolen goods contained guns. Paul A. sent them to search for drugs and guns, the weight and shape of the duffel bags would have belied their contents, and the box of grenades, which was loaded into the car separately, would have made clear that the expected weaponry had been found and stolen. The jury could have concluded, then, that Paul J. physically possessed the guns at that time.</p>\n<p>Second, a jury could have found that after the North robbery, when the crew was opening the safes in the garage and examining the weapons, Paul J. constructively possessed the firearms. A defendant has the power to exercise dominion over a firearm if he was \"close enough to pick it up at any time.\" <i>United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 504 (1st Cir.2005). Regan described the guns as laid out \"all over the garage floor\" and specified that at least he and Meuse were physically handling the weapons; it could be inferred that Paul J. had the same access to them. As for the intent to exercise dominion over the firearms, although Paul A. stopped Regan from keeping some of the weapons, the jury could still have concluded that the weapons were being kept for the use of the crew as a whole. As DiCenso put it, \"because the guns belonged to the crew, ... that means they belonged to me, too,\" as a member of the crew.</p>\n<p>The basis for a joint possession finding is also demonstrated by Paul J. and DiCenso having gone to retrieve the weapons from Silva's apartment on behalf of the crew: they assumed that they would be able to remove the weapons at will. The weapons did not belong to Silva; the weapons belonged to the crew, and Paul J. acted as a member of the crew.</p>\n<p>We affirm this conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Use of a Firearm in Relation to Crime of Violence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>John Jr. appeals his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) for using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to any crime of violence ... for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\" The government based its § 924(c) charge on John Jr.'s robbery of Sapochetti in alleged violation of the Hobbs Act. Thus the government had to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> prove that John Jr. used or carried a firearm, that his use of the firearm was in relation to the robbery, and that he did in fact commit a Hobbs Act robbery. To prove a Hobbs Act robbery, the government had to establish that the Sapochetti robbery \"in any way or degree obstruct[ed], delay[ed], or affect[ed] commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). John Jr. argues the government failed to prove this nexus with interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>\"The Hobbs Act's scope extends to the limit of Congress' Commerce Clause authority.\" <i>United States v. Capozzi</i> (<i>Capozzi I</i>), 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.2003). Because of this, and because the Hobbs Act by its terms criminalizes robberies that affect interstate commerce \"in any way or degree,\" the government need only show that the robbery created \"a realistic probability of a <i>de minimis</i> effect on interstate commerce.\"<sup>[15]</sup><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> 955 F.2d 77, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This required showing is \"not onerous.\" <i>Capozzi II,</i> 486 F.3d at 726 (quoting <i>United States v. DiGregorio,</i> 605 F.2d 1184, 1191 (1st Cir.1979)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>A reasonable jury could have concluded that John Jr. robbed Sapochetti and that the probable effect of that robbery was an impact on interstate commerce, albeit largely illicit commerce. The robbing of a drug dealer typically has the required nexus with interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., id.; </i><i>United States v. Parkes,</i> 497 F.3d 220, 231 (2d Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1320, 170 L.Ed.2d 133 (2008); <i>United States v. Ostrander,</i> 411 F.3d 684, 692 (6th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 342 F.3d 350, 355 (4th Cir.2003) (\"Drug dealing ... is an inherently economic enterprise that affects interstate commerce.\"); <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 227 F.3d 792, 798-99 (7th Cir. 2000); <i>United States v. Box,</i> 50 F.3d 345, 353 (5th Cir.1995). A robbery can affect interstate commerce when it depletes the assets of a business, even if the business is that of drug dealing. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Capozzi II,</i> 486 F.3d at 726; <i>Williams,</i> 342 F.3d at 354-55; <i>Bailey,</i> 227 F.3d at 798. It was sufficient for the government to demonstrate that the robbery of cocaine dealers generally affects interstate commerce and that John Jr. intended to rob Sapochetti of money he believed was derived from or intended to finance cocaine sales. <i>See </i><i>Bailey,</i> 227 F.3d at 798.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>DiCenso and Regan both testified that Sapochetti was a known cocaine dealer. The interstate aspect was nailed down by a DEA agent who, testifying as an expert witness, explained that the coca plant from which cocaine is derived is native to South America and is not (to his knowledge) capable of being grown in Massachusetts. From this the jury could conclude that Sapochetti was engaged in a business that affected interstate commerce. Further, the government presented plentiful evidence that the crew's modus operandi was to rob rival drug dealers of their drugs and drug proceeds, both to decrease competition and to increase the crew's supplies for their own sales. Both DiCenso and Regan testified that the crew obtained around $18,000 from Sapochetti. The jury could have reasonably inferred that John Jr. intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> to and did deplete Sapochetti's business assets, thereby affecting interstate commerce to some degree.</p>\n<p>John Jr. makes a related argument that the jury's \"inconsistent\" verdict demonstrated that it did not find an effect on interstate commerce but was confused about the elements of § 924(c) because the judge's instructions on this charge were convoluted. This argument fails. Although the jury did acquit John Jr. on the substantive offense of a Hobbs Act robbery of Sapochetti, \"inconsistent verdicts are not sufficient grounds for reversing a criminal conviction as long as the appellate court is satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction.\" <i>United States v. Richard,</i> 234 F.3d 763, 768 (1st Cir.2000). This is so even where, as here, the jury acquits the defendant of a predicate felony while convicting on the compound felony. <i>United States v. Powell,</i> 469 U.S. 57, 67-68, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984). We have held that a defendant can be convicted under § 924(c) even if he was acquitted of the drug trafficking crime on which the § 924(c) charge was premised. <i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir. 2003). At least one other circuit has addressed the specific situation presented by this case and affirmed a § 924(c) conviction where the jury acquitted on the predicate Hobbs Act robbery. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 182 F.3d 452, 458 (6th Cir.1999). Because there was sufficient evidence to establish the jurisdictional element of a Hobbs Act robbery, John Jr.'s conviction for using or carrying a firearm during the commission of that offense must be affirmed. <i>See generally</i> 3 Wright, King &amp; Klein, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal</i> § 514, at 27-28 (3d ed.2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>Further, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected any role for individualized assessments of inconsistent verdicts when a defendant argues the inconsistency was caused by a trial error, such as the argument here that the jury instructions were unclear. This is because such inquiries \"would be based either on pure speculation, or would require inquiries into the jury's deliberations that courts generally will not undertake.\" <i>Powell,</i> 469 U.S. at 66, 105 S.Ct. 471. Indeed, much of defendant's argument on this point takes the form of speculation about what the jury might or might not have believed about the law or concluded about the facts of the case.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>John Jr.'s conviction under § 924(c) is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Sentencing</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, John Jr. appeals his sentence on one basis. The jury found that the government had not proved John Jr.'s involvement in racketeering act 13, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. However, John Jr. had pled guilty to the same offense conduct in 1997 and was sentenced to 249 days of imprisonment. John Jr. argues that the time he served for that crime  in which calculation he also includes the twenty-one months he served for violating the terms of his supervised release following his 249-day sentence should have been taken into account as a sort of mitigating factor in his sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> in this case. As he put it in his sentencing memorandum to the district court, \"[a]t a minimum, an innocent man who serves time should be remunerated for the time he served. [The district court] should sentence below the guideline sentencing range by the same amount of time that the defendant served for the crime that he did not commit, 29 months....\" The district court, however, concluded that it \"cannot give credit for time served on a sentence that someone else imposed in a case in which Mr. DeCologero admitted guilt\" and sentenced John Jr. to 210 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, but we first consider whether the court below committed a \"significant procedural error, such as ... treating the Guidelines as mandatory.\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). To the extent that John Jr. argues that the trial court did not believe it could grant him a variance based on this particular factor, that argument is preserved. On appeal, John Jr. focuses on the trial judge's use of the word \"cannot\" in her decision not to take the prior conviction into account.</p>\n<p>When considering a sentencing appeal, however, we do not look at comments in isolation but consider the sentencing record as a whole. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc) (\"[A] court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\"). It is clear that the trial court did not consider the Guidelines to be mandatory. The court sentenced John Jr. below the Guidelines range, which it calculated to be between 324 and 405 months. It based this lower sentence on a number of the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, especially § 3553(a)(1), and on other factors specific to John Jr.'s case: that the conviction came ten years after the commission of the crimes, that Paul A. and other \"elders\" (presumably including his father) had \"subjected\" John Jr. \"to cruel control ... most of his life,\" that John Jr. had \"made strides\" in changing his life, and that the formal Guidelines calculation double-counted some of the underlying offenses, resulting in an \"artificially high\" Guidelines range. We do not doubt that the trial court recognized its discretion to take John Jr.'s prior conviction and imprisonment into account; the court simply did not agree with defendant that his previous incarceration for a crime to which he pled guilty should lead to a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p>To the extent that John Jr. argues that the district court committed a Guidelines error by not taking into account a possible downward departure under U.S.S.G. §§ 5G1.3 and 5K2.23, he did not present that argument to the trial court. We thus review the sentence on this ground for plain error only. <i>United States v. Goodhue,</i> 486 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d 15, 35 &amp; n. 11 (1st Cir.2006). We pass over the questions of which Guidelines apply (the trial court applied the 1995 Guidelines, in effect at the time of the offense conduct) and whether, if the 1995 Guidelines do apply, the later amendments relevant here were retroactive. Even taking these questions in defendant's favor, John Jr.'s argument does not survive the plain terms of § 5G1.3.</p>\n<p>Under the current Guidelines, § 5G1.3(b) provides for an adjustment of the sentence to account for an undischarged term of imprisonment that \"resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction ... and that was <i>the basis for an increase in the offense level for the</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> <i>instant offense.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Application note 4, which cross-references and uses the same language as § 5K2.23, approves the use of a downward departure when the prior term of imprisonment has been fully discharged, as long as the other requirements of § 5G1.3(b) are met. Neither section is applicable here, then, as the offense underlying racketeering act 13 was not taken into account in the Guidelines calculation; much less was it a \"basis for an increase in the offense level\" in this case.<sup>[18]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Kornegay,</i> 410 F.3d 89, 99 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Parker,</i> 512 F.3d 1037, 1040 (8th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>We turn to Paul A.'s appeals but find them likewise unavailing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Double Jeopardy</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This court rejected Paul A.'s pre-trial double jeopardy claims. <i>DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d at 19. Paul A. renews his double jeopardy claim in this post-conviction appeal based on the evidence actually presented at trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Laguna-Estela,</i> 394 F.3d 54, 59 (1st Cir. 2005). Our review is de novo. <i>United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo,</i> 70 F.3d 706, 714 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>In our prior consideration of this issue, we noted that \"double jeopardy only bars successive RICO charges involving both the same enterprise <i>and</i> the same pattern of racketeering activity.\" <i>DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d at 18. The court recognized that it was perhaps a \"hard question\" whether the enterprises in the <i>Carrozza</i> case and this case were the same, but concluded that the patterns of racketeering activity were not. <i>Id.</i> Having assessed the evidence post-trial, we reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>In comparing the charged patterns of racketeering, we consider the totality of the circumstances, including the similarities of \"the time, the place, the people, and the nature and scope of the activities involved in each indictment.\" <i>Id.</i> Paul A. first argues that the time periods covered by the two trials overlap. We recognized in our earlier opinion the overlap in the time periods covered by the two indictments but found it insubstantial. <i>Id.</i> at 19. We noted then that the <i>Carrozza</i> indictment focused on 1989 to 1994 but that the <i>Carrozza</i> trial included evidence of events occurring as late as 1998. <i>Id.</i> The <i>DeCologero</i> indictment focused on the years 1995 to 1997, but the prosecution introduced evidence reaching back to 1994. For example, there was conflicting testimony about whether the Soccorso robbery occurred in late 1994 or late 1995, and the prosecution sought to establish that Finethy incurred his drug debt in 1994 as background for the alleged 1996 extortion. These exceptions were minor, however, and Paul A. points to no other instances of proffers of pre-1995 evidence. We again conclude that the overlap between the time periods is insubstantial. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Ciancaglini,</i> 858 F.2d 923, 929 (3d Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> 1988) (finding distinct patterns of racketeering activity despite overlap of twenty-five months).</p>\n<p>Paul A. concedes that he is the only common defendant between the two indictments, but he argues that does not end the analysis of common participants. We need not address his premise, for in any event, the only common character Paul A. points to is Vincent Marino, a <i>Carrozza</i> defendant, who Paul A. argues is a missing link in the Silva murder. That connection is tenuous, and it does not even suggest that the two indictments charged the same pattern of racketeering activity. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Russotti,</i> 717 F.2d 27, 33 (2d Cir.1983) (finding different patterns of racketeering activity even though two individuals were named in both indictments).</p>\n<p>Finally, Paul A. points to references in the <i>Carrozza</i> case to robberies of drug dealers in arguing that the two cases dealt with the same types of crime. First, the references in <i>Carrozza</i> are not new information, derived from the actual prosecution of this case, and thus would not affect the conclusion we reached in the interlocutory appeal. Second, the overlap of some types of crimes between two indictments does not necessarily mean the indictments charge the same pattern of racketeering activity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ruggiero,</i> 754 F.2d 927, 933-34 (11th Cir.1985) (finding different patterns of racketeering activity even though both indictments charged crimes under the same gambling, drug, and robbery statutes). Third, the alleged overlap was minimal.</p>\n<p>We thus conclude again that, whether or not the same enterprise was involved, the indictments did charge and the government did try two different patterns of racketeering activity. Taken as a whole and based on the trial records, the <i>Carrozza</i> case \"focused on the systematic murder of rival mafia members ... to seize control of the Patriarca family,\" while this case focused on \"a more conventional collection of robberies and drug trafficking offenses, the single murder being merely a means of protecting the conspiracy from the police.\" <i>DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d at 18-19. There has been no violation of Paul A.'s double jeopardy rights by his standing trial in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Ability To Present Defense</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. raises several arguments pertaining to his ability to present his defense theory in full. He claims that the district court curtailed the testimony of witnesses in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, that the court failed to compel the production of a witness in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, and that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence in contravention of its <i>Brady</i> duties and in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. These arguments all fall short.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Trial Management and Evidentiary Rulings</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A.'s primary defense was that Regan was aligned with the Salemme faction of the Patriarca Family and thus would not have been working with Paul A. if Paul A. was, as the government had previously alleged, aligned with the Carrozza faction. Paul A. complains that the trial judge curtailed his ability to present this defense by restricting his cross-examination of Regan and other witnesses and by cutting short his own testimony. He argues that these rulings violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to present his defense.</p>\n<p>\"Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the [Fifth] Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful opportunity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986) (quoting <i>California v. Trombetta,</i> 467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984)) (citations omitted). What constitutes the \"basic elements\" of a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment is determined \"largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 685, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>However, \"[a] defendant's right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\" <i>United States v. Scheffer,</i> 523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). For example, the Supreme Court has \"never questioned the power of States to exclude evidence through the application of evidentiary rules that themselves serve the interests of fairness and reliability  even if the defendant would prefer to see that evidence admitted.\" <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142. Thus, \"federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials .... so long as [those rules] are not `arbitrary' or `disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.'\" <i>Scheffer,</i> 523 U.S. at 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261 (quoting <i>Rock v. Arkansas,</i> 483 U.S. 44, 56, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987)).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle recently, emphasizing that \"well-established rules of evidence [that] permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury\" do not normally breach defendants' constitutional rights. <i>Holmes v. South Carolina,</i> 547 U.S. 319, 326, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 164 L.Ed.2d 503 (2006). In <i>Holmes,</i> the Court specifically noted as one such \"well-established rule\" the rule that a court may exclude a defendant's evidence proffered to show that someone else committed the crime in question if that evidence is too speculative, remote, or immaterial. <i>Id.</i> at 327, 330, 126 S.Ct. 1727.</p>\n<p>Paul A. argues that he was unable to question Regan fully during cross-examination about his affiliation with Salemme's group. But the court did allow Regan to be questioned about the structure of the Patriarca family, his association with Frank Salemme Jr., and related issues despite continued objections by the prosecution. The limits which were placed on questioning were based on the judge's well-founded concerns about relevance and were within her discretion. The prohibited questions pertained primarily to events that occurred before 1995 and thus before the crimes alleged in the indictment. There was a risk of jury confusion from this line of questioning in an already complex and confusing case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> 219 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir.2000) (\"The district court `retains wide latitude to impose reasonable limits' on cross-examination in order to avoid confusion of the issues or extended discussion of marginally relevant material.\" (quoting <i>United States v. Twomey,</i> 806 F.2d 1136, 1139 (1st Cir.1986))).<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> Paul A.'s objection to the court's curtailing of his own testimony is also misplaced. Regardless of what theory a defendant might wish to present, that does not entitle him to provide non-responsive (and provocative) answers, even to his own attorney's questions. In addition, much of the information pertinent to Paul A.'s defense came in through the cross-examination of Regan. Finally, Paul A. complains of the court's rulings on the inadmissibility of most testimony pertaining to the gym conversations, but we have already found those rulings not to be in error.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>Paul A. was able to present his defense, and the court did not abuse its discretion in restricting the admission of a fraction of his evidence. <i>Cf. </i><i>O'Brien v. Marshall,</i> 453 F.3d 13, 19-20 (1st Cir.2006) (no constitutional violation where defendant's evidence that someone else committed the crime was restricted based on traditional hearsay rules); <i>DiBenedetto v. Hall,</i> 272 F.3d 1, 7-9 (1st Cir.2001) (no constitutional violation where defendant's evidence that others had motive in mob killing and that key government witness was lying to regain favor with mob faction was excluded because it was unreliable and tangential).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Denial of Compulsory Process</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. also attempted at trial to show that Vincent Marino, a.k.a. Gigi Portalla, was involved in the North burglary and in Silva's murder, a showing presumably meant to exonerate Paul A. He argues that the district court's refusal to expedite Marino's transport from a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania or to provide a continuance until Marino's presence could be secured deprived him of compulsory process under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Paul A. filed his motion for Marino's transport to testify on February 28, two days before the prosecution rested. The district court allowed the motion, but refused to order the U.S. Marshals to expedite their transport process or to provide extra funds to do so. Paul A. moved for a continuance, which the court also denied.</p>\n<p>If the court had denied Paul A.'s motion to transport Marino, our review would be for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Nivica,</i> 887 F.2d 1110, 1117 (1st Cir.1989). As the court <i>granted</i> the motion but simply refused to expedite the request, we see no reason why a more stringent standard of review should be used. Trial judges are best situated to weigh the competing demands of trial management  \"factors such as timeliness, materiality, relevancy, competency, practicality, and utility\"  and thus we accord the trial court's determinations in these areas \"considerable respect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1118.</p>\n<p>As the trial court noted, Paul A. submitted his request quite belatedly. There was no reason for that delay. Other circuits faced with similar circumstances have found no abuse of discretion. Where a defendant waited until seven business days before the trial started to request the production of an incarcerated witness, the Eighth Circuit concluded that, \"[i]n view of the modest benefit that [the] testimony might have offered, ... the district court correctly ruled that the countervailing public interests in the efficient administration of justice were sufficient reason to deny the motion for a continuance of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Sparkman,</i> 500 F.3d 678, 683 (8th Cir.2007). The Eighth Circuit also found no abuse of discretion where the trial court denied a further continuance when the marshals could not locate witnesses subpoenaed at government expense (under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> Procedure 17(b)), given that the defendant had waited until the day before trial to request the subpoena. <i>United States v. DeCoteau,</i> 648 F.2d 1191, 1192-93 (8th Cir. 1981). As the Second Circuit succinctly stated, where the defendant had waited until two business days before the beginning of trial to request a continuance so that an incarcerated prisoner could be produced, \"any detriment suffered by [the defendant] resulted from his own dilatory conduct and not from the court's ruling.\" <i>United States v. King,</i> 762 F.2d 232, 235 (2d Cir.1985). In all these cases, the defendants' efforts to secure the testimony of incarcerated witnesses were considered tardy even though they were made prior to the commencement of trial; Paul A. waited until the twenty-ninth day of trial to make his request. The comparison is not in his favor. Further, the proffered testimony of Marino was tangential and potentially cumulative. Any benefit of the testimony would have been slight.</p>\n<p>The Compulsory Process Clause is more a sword than a shield because \"[t]he decision whether to employ it in a particular case rests solely with the defendant. The very nature of the right requires that its effective use be preceded by deliberate planning and affirmative conduct.\" <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988). The fault here lies with Paul A.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Brady Disclosures</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, Paul A. alleges that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence in contravention of its <i>Brady</i> obligations. Again, we review <i>Brady</i> determinations for abuse of discretion. <i>Caro-Muñiz,</i> 406 F.3d at 29. Paul A. repeatedly requested materials pertaining to investigations of Vincent Marino, specifically evidence linking Marino to Silva's death, but the prosecution opposed and the court denied the motions.</p>\n<p>The prosecution represented that it had disclosed all potentially exculpatory material.<sup>[22]</sup> Paul A. points to no specific materials or information he believes are in the prosecution's possession that would exculpate him. Without such a specific request, it is the prosecution \"that decides which information must be disclosed. Unless defense counsel becomes aware that other exculpatory evidence was withheld and brings it to the court's attention, the prosecutor's decision on [<i>Brady</i>] disclosure is final.\" <i>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. 39, 59, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987) (footnote omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 456 (finding insufficient a defendant's \"speculat[ion] that the... files might contain exculpatory evidence\" without \"any supporting evidence or arguments to indicate this was, in fact, the case\"). There was no abuse of discretion in crediting the prosecution's adamant assertion that it had no further material and exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Conflict of Interest</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. requests a new trial based on his trial attorney's alleged conflicts of interest and the trial court's unwillingness to hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter. We review this question de novo. <i>Reyes-Vejerano v. United States,</i> 276 F.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Paul A. alleges that his counsel, John Salsberg, suffered from two conflicts of interests: that his law partner previously represented Jon Minotti, a potential defense witness, and that his associate had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> previously worked for an attorney who had represented Vincent Marino in the <i>Carrozza</i> case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ramirez-Benitez,</i> 292 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir.2002) (\"Representation of co-indictees by members of the same law firm may create a conflict of interest similar to that when a single attorney represents two or more co-defendants.\"). Paul A. argues there was some evidence that Minotti had additional information about Silva's murder, owned some of the guns found in Silva's apartment, and had told an acquaintance that he had participated in the Stevens robbery. Salsberg's partner withdrew his representation of Minotti when Salsberg was appointed to represent Paul A. Salsberg's motion for a writ of habeas corpus to procure Minotti's testimony was denied because the court concluded that his testimony would be inadmissible. As for Marino, Paul A. does not describe what, if any, work Salsberg's associate might have done on Marino's case at his prior firm. The court did approve Salsberg's motion requesting Marino's transport from prison to testify but did not order the marshals to expedite the process; as a result, Marino never testified.</p>\n<p>Prior to jury impanelment, Paul A. filed a pro se motion requesting new counsel, but that motion and the in-court discussion it generated focused on whether Salsberg was prepared for trial. Towards the very end of the trial, Paul A. filed a series of pro se motions requesting new counsel; those motions focused on Salsberg's alleged conflicts of interest. The court summarily denied these later pro se motions.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Paul A. is mistaken as to the law: reversal is <i>not</i> automatic when a trial judge fails to conduct a proper inquiry into a potential conflict of interest. <i>See </i><i>Mickens v. Taylor,</i> 535 U.S. 162, 170-73, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002); <i>United States v. Newton,</i> 326 F.3d 253, 263-64 (1st Cir.2003). This is because, as the Supreme Court has explained, \"defects in assistance [of counsel] that have no probable effect upon the trial's outcome do not establish a constitutional violation.\" <i>Mickens,</i> 535 U.S. at 166, 122 S.Ct. 1237. Even if the possibility of a conflict of interest was apparent enough to require the trial court to conduct a formal inquiry into the issue  a question that is not immediately clear on the facts of this case  \"the trial court's failure to make [that] inquiry does not reduce [Paul A.'s] burden of proof.\" <i>Id.</i> at 173-74, 122 S.Ct. 1237; <i>see also id.</i> at 168-69, 122 S.Ct. 1237 (discussing when a court has a duty to inquire into a potential conflict of interest). Paul A. still bears the burden of showing that the conflict of interest he alleges went beyond a \"mere theoretical division of loyalties\" and in fact \"adversely affected his counsel's performance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 171, 174, 122 S.Ct. 1237.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>This showing by a defendant of an actual conflict is less burdensome than that required to establish ineffective assistance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> of counsel claims. <i>United States v. Burgos-Chaparro,</i> 309 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2002). Here the defendant must demonstrate that his counsel's performance was affected by the conflict, but need not also establish that the difference in performance prejudiced him in the same sense as in an ineffective assistance claim. <i>Id.</i><sup>[24]</sup> Showing an adverse effect, however, still requires more than mere speculation, <i>id.</i> at 53; the defendant \"must show that [the attorney] might plausibly have pursued an alternative defense strategy, and that the alternative strategy was in conflict with, or may not have been pursued because of, [the attorney's] other loyalties or interests,\" <i>Ramirez-Benitez,</i> 292 F.3d at 30; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Lachman,</i> 521 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir.2008). This Paul A. fails to do.</p>\n<p>Paul A. makes no viable argument as to what Salsberg might have done differently. He accuses Salsberg of not obtaining Minotti's testimony, but Salsberg did attempt to procure Minotti's testimony; that the court denied the request for evidentiary reasons is unrelated to the question of Salsberg's allegedly divided loyalties. As for Marino, Paul A. accuses Salsberg of not actively interviewing Marino or requesting his appearance in a timely manner. This, however, is not an accusation that Salsberg failed to pursue an alternative defense strategy, but that he did not pursue Paul A.'s desired strategy to Paul A.'s satisfaction. <i>Cf. </i><i>Lachman,</i> 521 F.3d at 21-22 (finding no conflict of interest where counsel did present defendant's desired defense theory).<sup>[25]</sup> Nor does Paul A. clarify how any inaction on Salsberg's part was in fact the manifestation of divided loyalties.<sup>[26]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>Burgos-Chaparro,</i> 309 F.3d at 53 (defendant must offer some showing that attorney's alleged shortcomings were in fact due to divided loyalties).</p>\n<p>There is thus no showing of an actual conflict of interest. This claim fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Pre-Indictment Delay</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. complains that the government could have brought the robbery- and drug-related charges in this case at the same time as the charges prosecuted in the <i>Carrozza</i> trial. He asserts that the failure to press these charges earlier was a tactical decision by the government and that he was prejudiced by having to mount a separate defense at the later <i>DeCologero</i> trial. We review the district court's refusal to dismiss the charges due to pre-indictment delay for abuse of discretion. <i>Muñoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 58. The court correctly determined there was no constitutional violation here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> Pre-indictment delay does not implicate the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial provision, but the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \"has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive [pre-indictment] delay.\" <i>United States v. Lovasco,</i> 431 U.S. 783, 789, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (summarizing <i>United States v. Marion,</i> 404 U.S. 307, 324, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971)). The Due Process Clause has only a limited role in this context because the statutes of limitations provide the primary protection against undue pre-indictment delays. <i>Id.; </i><i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 25. To rise to the level of a due process violation despite the applicable statute of limitations not having run, the delay (1) must have \"caused substantial prejudice to [defendant's] rights to a fair trial\" and (2) \"was an intentional device\" used by the prosecution \"to gain tactical advantage over the accused.\" <i>Marion,</i> 404 U.S. at 324, 92 S.Ct. 455; <i>see also </i><i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 25. \"Substantial prejudice\" means more than inconvenience; it requires a showing of actual prejudice, and even the unavailability of witnesses or evidence might not be sufficient to meet this burden. <i>See </i><i>Muñoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 59.</p>\n<p>Paul A. argues that the separate trials prevented him from developing his defense  that Regan worked for Salemme and was framing Paul A. in the context of the war between the Carrozza and Salemme factions  in the second case. The exclusion of some evidence in the present trial did not cause Paul A. substantial prejudice, as he was still allowed to present his defense theory to the jury, even if not to the full extent he desired.</p>\n<p>There is also no evidence suggesting a prosecutorial purpose of obtaining tactical advantage as there is no evidence that the prosecution knew in 1997 what Paul A.'s defense would be in the present case.</p>\n<p>There is, on the other hand, a reasonable explanation for the prosecution's delay. As <i>Lovasco</i> makes clear, prosecutors retain discretion to delay charges until investigations are complete and all other considerations have been weighed. <i>Lovasco,</i> 431 U.S. at 790-91, 97 S.Ct. 2044. Paul A. attempts to distinguish <i>Lovasco</i> by arguing that the delay here was not due to an ongoing investigation. First, ongoing investigations are not the only constitutionally acceptable explanations for pre-indictment delays. <i>See id.</i> at 792-95, 97 S.Ct. 2044. Second, Paul A. concedes that the investigation into Silva's murder was not completed at the time of the <i>Carrozza</i> trial. Contrary to Paul A.'s characterization, that crime was closely related to the other crimes charged in the present indictment: Silva's murder was an effort to avoid prosecution for and was thus part of the conspiracy to commit the robberies, drug dealing, and other crimes that Paul A. argues should have been prosecuted sooner. There was no unconstitutional pre-indictment delay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Denial of Continuances</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn to the final issue on appeal. After the court appointed Paul A. a new lawyer on September 23, 2004, it pushed the trial back from that week until January 9, 2006  a delay of fifteen months. Defense counsel requested a further six-month continuance in November 2005, which the court denied. On January 6, 2006, Paul A.'s attorney sought a one- or two-week continuance, which the court again denied. Paul A. argues on appeal that the court's refusal to grant these continuances violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p>We review for abuse of discretion a district court's denial of a motion for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> continuance. <i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 21-22. \"[B]road discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances; only an unreasoning and arbitrary `insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay' violates the right to assistance of counsel.\" <i>Morris v. Slappy,</i> 461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983) (quoting <i>Ungar v. Sarafite,</i> 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964)). \"A defendant is generally not entitled to a new trial unless he or she can identify specific ways in which the court's erroneous denial of a continuance prejudiced his or her defense.\" <i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 22.</p>\n<p>Paul A. points to no such prejudice. Instead, he argues in general terms that his counsel did not have enough time to prepare. This was a complex case with extensive discovery. However, counsel was given twice as long as Paul A.'s formal counsel had estimated would be necessary (even accounting for the new counsel's participation in another lengthy trial during those fifteen months). As the district court pointed out, conscientious lawyers will always feel that they could do more to prepare. The district court's decision to go forward after a fifteen-month delay was well within its discretion.<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>After careful review, we deny all appeals and affirm the district court and the convictions on all counts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Appendix</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nKey: G = Guilty NG = Not Guilty RA = Racketeering Act (Some counts for which no defendants were convicted are not discussed in this opinion.)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nCount    Crime                     Paul A.

by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  There was conflicting testimony about the exact date of this criminal episode, but it appears to have occurred at some point in 1995.</p>\n<p>[3]  This is Regan's version of the order of events. Soccorso and Ramus testified that Paul A. was picked up after Ramus was forced into the car.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (\"Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined ... or imprisoned....\").</p>\n<p>[5]  DiCenso testified that all three men were inside North's apartment. Regan, however, testified that only he and DiCenso went inside the apartment. Paul J.'s father, John P. DeCologero, Sr., also testified that his son had told him that he had remained outside the apartment.</p>\n<p>[6]  DiCenso testified that other guns obtained in the North robbery included an AK-47 (assault rifle), an AR-15 (semi-automatic rifle), and a Desert Eagle (semi-automatic pistol), as well as some handguns. Regan put the number of weapons removed from the apartment, other than those in the safes, at six to eight rifles in addition to a box of hand grenades.</p>\n<p>[7]  On the government's motion, a seventh co-defendant, Daniel Tsoukalas, was severed from the case and tried separately.\n</p>\n<p>Shortly after Silva's murder, DiCenso and his friends overdosed on the heroin originally intended to kill Silva. Two of the friends died; DiCenso survived but suffered serious and permanent injuries. Once the government was able to prove DiCenso was still competent enough to stand trial, DiCenso agreed to plead guilty and testified at this trial through the use of special equipment.</p>\n<p>Regan also agreed to testify for the government as part of a plea agreement. Meuse hanged himself in 1997.</p>\n<p>[8]  The government asserts that John Jr. waived these arguments because his attempt to incorporate the arguments of his co-defendants under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(i) was insufficient. We do not reach this or other waiver questions as we do not find an abuse of discretion on the merits.</p>\n<p>[9]  Defendants also accuse the trial court of refusing to consider their motions for mistrial, and they cite to one instance where the judge denied a mistrial motion on the spot. This argument is off the mark: an instantaneous ruling does not mean that a judge has refused to exercise her discretion. A trial judge immersed in a case is quite capable of ruling on in-court motions quickly, even immediately.</p>\n<p>[10]  Paul A. also objects to the district court's hearsay rulings pertaining to these two conversations, and we incorporate his arguments here.</p>\n<p>[11]  It is also not immediately clear how the exclusion of this testimony, which was meant to further Paul A.'s defense, caused any harm to the other three defendants.</p>\n<p>[12]  For this reason, the gym conversations excluded on hearsay grounds could also not be used to attack the credibility of Regan or DiCenso: the conversations only bear on the witnesses' motive to lie if the content of those conversations is true.</p>\n<p>[13]  The court also did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was not material whether DiCenso's sister had told State Trooper Robert Irwin that she knew DiCenso was dating Silva, so it was not improper for the court to curtail the cross-examination of Irwin on this point. Defendants note additional instances of defense witnesses not being allowed to testify to conversations but do not explain why those conversations were relevant, how the court abused its discretion, or why they were prejudiced as a result. <i>See </i><i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>[14]  18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) provides that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person  (1) who has been convicted in any court of [] a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"</p>\n<p>[15]  This standard is unaffected by <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). <i>Capozzi I,</i> 347 F.3d at 336 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p>[16]  Thus, contrary to John Jr.'s assertion, under the depletion-of-the-assets theory the government did not have to provide specific proof that the stolen money was connected to Sapochetti's interstate commerce activity.</p>\n<p>[17]  We also see no error in the court's instructions. The court explained the Hobbs Act, including its jurisdictional element, clearly and at length; contrasted it to the state law crime of armed robbery; and explained that a Hobbs Act robbery constituted a violent federal crime under § 924(c). While the instructions were complicated, so was the case, and the jury had to assist it the redacted indictment and a chart of elements for each crime charged.</p>\n<p>[18]  The language in the 1995 Guidelines differs slightly but not in a material way. The older version of § 5G1.3(b) covered an \"undischarged term of imprisonment [that] resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense.\" Again, the alleged offense conduct covered by racketeering act 13 was not taken into account in the trial court's Guidelines determination.\n</p>\n<p>The parties also dispute whether that offense conduct, to which John Jr. pled guilty in 1997, was relevant conduct to the instant offense. We do not need to resolve that question.</p>\n<p>[19]  As relevant here, the Sixth Amendment protects the accused's right, in a criminal trial, \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him\" and \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI.</p>\n<p>[20]  Paul A. also complains of restrictions on his ability to present evidence that Regan was somehow involved in Silva's murder, but he does not specify any objectionable rulings. Regardless, the evidence in question is highly tangential and circumstantial; there would have been no abuse of discretion in its exclusion.</p>\n<p>[21]  Paul A. also alleges that the trial court curtailed his opening and closing arguments, but our review of the record revealed no basis for these allegations.</p>\n<p>[22]  This included alerting the defense in 2001 and 2002 that a witness (DiCenso) linked Marino to a gun deal gone bad and that a confidential informant had linked Marino to the guns being stored by Silva.</p>\n<p>[23]  Contrary to Paul A.'s assertions, nothing in <i>Mickens</i> suggests that the Court intended its holding to apply to only those cases in which the defendant did not raise a conflict of interest concern during the trial, nor does the automatic reversal rule of <i>Holloway v. Arkansas,</i> 435 U.S. 475, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978)  which the <i>Mickens</i> Court cabined very narrowly  apply here where counsel did not himself object at trial. <i>See </i><i>Mickens,</i> 535 U.S. at 168, 122 S.Ct. 1237 (<i>Holloway'</i>s automatic reversal rule applies \"<i>only</i> where defense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless the trial court has determined that there is no conflict\" (emphasis added)). While Salsberg did raise other concerns before the trial court about his ability to represent Paul A., he never informed the court that he himself believed that he was unable to represent Paul A. due to a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>[24]  The Supreme Court in <i>Mickens</i> expressly did not reach the question of whether this \"actual conflict\" standard, requiring some showing of an actual adverse effect but not of prejudice, should apply to cases of successive representation, such as this one. <i>Mickens,</i> 535 U.S. at 176, 122 S.Ct. 1237. Like the <i>Mickens</i> Court, we reserve this question for another day and grant Paul A. the benefit of the assumption that the actual conflict standard is available to him; from the record before us, we doubt Paul A. could otherwise muster a showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p>[25]  Such allegations might instead go to the effectiveness of Salsberg's representation, but that tack would likely fail for lack of prejudice  required to establish an ineffectiveness of counsel claim  resulting from these alleged shortcomings.</p>\n<p>[26]  Paul A.'s argument that the failure of Tony Bucci to testify for the defense had anything to do with Salsberg's alleged conflicts of interest is simply not borne out by the record. The debate over Bucci's testimony revolved primarily around Bucci's Fifth Amendment rights; there is no indication that Salsberg tried to prevent Bucci from testifying due to the role of Minotti as a government witness in Bucci's concurrent criminal case.</p>\n<p>[27]  Paul A. also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a continuance on the first day of trial so he could seek advice on his lawyer's potential conflict of interest, <i>see supra.</i> This motion was untimely, especially as the question of his representation had been thoroughly canvassed in pre-trial motion practice. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 22. It was also, in the district court's view, a purely dilatory tactic.</p>\n<p>[28]  This RA charged a robbery of North prior to the October 1996 burglary of North's apartment.</p>\n\n</div>",

Soto-Beníquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784866\"><a href=\"/opinion/784866/united-states-v-william-soto-beniquez-united-states-of-america-v-juan/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2004). We trace the general contours of the case here and leave further recounting for the analysis of particular arguments.</p>\n<p>Paul A. ran a criminal enterprise (the \"DeCologero crew\") based out of a gym he operated in Woburn, Massachusetts. Paul J., John Jr., Pavone, and other associates assisted Paul A. in his efforts to control a portion of Boston's drug trade. Part of the crew's modus operandi was to beat up and to steal drugs and cash from other drug dealers. Aislin Silva, a young woman who was a friend of crew member Stephen DiCenso, was murdered and dismembered in an effort to protect the crew's activities.</p>\n<p>Each defendant was convicted of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), as well as the substantive offense of engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). These convictions required that each defendant be found to have committed at least two predicate racketeering acts, which could be either state or federal crimes. A table of the counts and racketeering acts is provided in the appendix. We summarize the racketeering acts for which at least some of the defendants were convicted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Soccorso Robbery1995</i><sup>[2]</sup></h2>\n<p>In 1995, Paul A. sent John Jr. and Thomas Regan to the house of Philip Soccorso, a marijuana dealer, to steal drugs from him. Regan tricked Soccorso into leaving his house and then forced him into their car at gun point. When Soccorso refused to disclose the location of his drugs, Regan and John Jr. drove to Paul A.'s house to pick him up and, as Regan recounted, Paul A. \"read [Soccorso] the riot act\" about dealing drugs in Paul A.'s territory. To add emphasis, John Jr. hit Soccorso with a handgun. Eventually Soccorso told them that his supplier, Gary Ramus, who was back at Soccorso's house, might have some drugs. They returned to the house, and Regan forced Ramus into the car at gunpoint.<sup>[3]</sup> After some more haranguing (also at gunpoint), Soccorso and Ramus agreed to give Paul A. the marijuana stashed at Soccorso's house.</p>\n<p>Regan, Ramus, and Soccorso testified for the government at trial. The jury found that Paul A. and John Jr. had committed the racketeering acts of armed robbery, the kidnaping of Soccorso and Ramus, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Pesaturo RobberyNovember 1995</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Around November 1995, Paul A. agreed with Regan that Richie Pesaturo, another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> drug dealer, needed to be taught a lesson because he owed Regan money and had been \"running his mouth\" about the crew. On Paul A.'s orders, Regan, Paul J., and John Jr. went to Pesaturo's apartment, where John Jr. and Regan beat Pesaturo and Regan \"read[] him the riot act.\" The three crew members then ransacked the apartment until they found Pesaturo's cocaine supply and $11,000. Before leaving, the three men bound Pesaturo and his roommate Richard Bentley, who had returned home during the course of the robbery, with duct tape. They then went to Paul A.'s place to divide up the proceeds.</p>\n<p>Regan and Bentley testified at trial about this robbery and beating. The jury found that Paul A., John Jr., and Paul J. had committed the racketeering acts of robbery under the Hobbs Act,<sup>[4]</sup> the kidnaping of Pesaturo and Bentley, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Finethy ExtortionJanuary/February 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In January or February 1996, Paul A. sent John Jr. and Pavone to the house of Shane Finethy, who sold marijuana on Paul A.'s behalf. Finethy had kept $8000 in proceeds from drug sales without Paul A.'s permission, using it for a down payment on a house, and had failed to pay Paul A. back. Upon arrival, John Jr. realized that Finethy had sold the house in question and was preparing to move. John Jr. became angry, and he and Pavone hit Finethy until his face was covered with blood; after Finethy's wife and baby came into the room, Finethy left the house and John Jr. and Pavone followed. Out on the street, they attempted to force Finethy into their car, with John Jr. threatening Finethy at gunpoint. The arrival of a police cruiser broke up the scene, and Finethy returned to his house.</p>\n<p>Finethy and his wife testified at trial, and the jury found that Paul A., John Jr., and Pavone had committed the racketeering act of extortion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Sapochetti RobberyOctober 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In the fall of 1996, Kevin Meuse and Derek Capozzi were released from jail and joined the DeCologero crew. That October, the crew planned to rob and kill Albert \"Big Al\" Sapochetti, a bookmaker and drug dealer. With Paul A.'s agreement, John Jr. and Meuse robbed Sapochetti at gunpoint and beat him, leaving him, his neighbor, and his girlfriend hog tied with duct tape and wires. John Jr. and Meuse threatened to return for more money and told Sapochetti they were sparing his life because of his girlfriend's presence.</p>\n<p>Sapochetti's girlfriend testified at trial. In addition to finding that Paul A. and John Jr. had committed the racketeering acts of kidnaping all three victims, the jury also convicted them of using or carrying a firearm, or aiding and abetting such use, during the commission of a violent crime. The government alleged that Paul J. participated in this robbery as well, but the jury found his participation not proved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Stevens RobberyOctober 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Also in October 1996, the crew targeted Michael \"Slim\" Stevens, who was selling marijuana in Paul A.'s territory. Paul A. gave guns to Regan, Capozzi, and Meuse and sent them with Stephen DiCenso, another member of the DeCologero crew, to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> Stevens's townhouse. Regan and Capozzi beat Stevens and threatened to cut off his ear with a knife. Stevens eventually turned over what money he had and led Regan and Capozzi to a stash of marijuana. Before leaving, Regan and Capozzi tied up Stevens, his girlfriend, and another friend of Stevens who had arrived during the robbery.</p>\n<p>Stevens, his girlfriend, Regan, and DiCenso testified about this incident at trial. The jury convicted Paul A. of robbery under the Hobbs Act, possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. These crimes, along with armed robbery and kidnaping, were also proved as to Paul A. as racketeering acts under RICO.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>North BurglaryOctober 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The crew also burgled the home of Jeffrey North, another marijuana dealer, that same October. When DiCenso told Paul A. that North was in jail pending bail, Paul A. sent DiCenso, Paul J., and Regan to burgle North's apartment. DiCenso broke into the apartment and, with the help of the others, found a cache of weapons, two safes, night vision goggles, and about ten pounds of marijuana.<sup>[5]</sup> The burglars packed most of the goods into duffel bags and heaved the safes over the balcony of the apartment to the yard below. They then loaded \"the bags, a box of grenades, and the safes\" into a car and returned to Paul A.'s house. There Meuse pried open the safes in the presence of the others. The safes contained various firearms, including two MAC-11s (submachine gun/pistol), an Uzi (submachine gun), and another machine gun with a silencer, as well as money and more drugs.<sup>[6]</sup> Paul A. gave most of the guns to DiCenso to store in the home of Aislin Silva, a nineteen-year-old woman who permitted her friend DiCenso to keep drugs in her apartment on behalf of the crew.</p>\n<p>In connection with this burglary, Paul A. and Paul J. were found guilty of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, which the jury also found to be a racketeering act, and of being felons in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>G. <i>Silva Witness Tampering and MurderNovember 1996</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. went to Silva's apartment later that month with DiCenso and Vincent Marino (a.k.a. Gigi Portalla) to show Marino the guns. On November 5, when DiCenso and Paul J. returned to Silva's apartment on Paul A.'s instructions to pick up some of the guns, they found the police, who had received a tip about the guns, already there. When DiCenso and Paul J. entered the apartment, the guns were in plain view on the floor and the police were questioning Silva; they questioned Paul J. and DiCenso as well and then allowed them to leave.</p>\n<p>DiCenso and Paul J. reported back to Paul A. and the crewPavone, Meuse, Regan, Capozzi, and John P. DeCologero, Sr. (\"John Sr.\"), the father of John Jr. and Paul J.who were gathered at Pavone's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> house. Paul A. instructed Pavone and Meuse to rent a motel room and sent DiCenso and Capozzi to pick up Silva. Also on Paul A.'s instructions, DiCenso stayed with Silva for the next two nights in different motel rooms. On November 7, another meeting was held at Pavone's house with Silva present. DiCenso testified that he, Capozzi, Meuse, Pavone, and Paul A. were there, though he could not remember at what point Pavone arrived. Paul A. told Silva that their \"attorneys were out of town, but they would take care of everything,\" and that in the meantime, Paul A. would arrange for Silva to be taken on a shopping spree in New York City, accompanied by DiCenso. Pavone drove DiCenso and Silva to New York that night in a limousine that Paul A. had borrowed from an associate, Anthony (\"Tony\") Bucci. Pavone returned to Boston while DiCenso and Silva spent five nights in New York City.</p>\n<p>When DiCenso and Silva returned to Boston on November 12, they went to Pavone's house, where the others were gathered. There, DiCenso, Paul A., and Meuse spoke privately in the kitchen. DiCenso told Paul A. that he did not think Silva would \"hold up\" under police questioning, to which Paul A. responded, \"She has to be killed.\" Paul A.'s first plan was for DiCenso to give Silva some high-grade heroin, telling her it was \"really good cocaine\"; DiCenso was then to wait until Silva was dead before calling 911 to report the overdose. If Silva did not ingest sufficient heroin to cause a fatal overdose, Meuse was to blow more of it up her nose. To this end, Paul A. sent Paul J. to Antonio Centeno, a heroin dealer in Lowell. Centeno testified that Paul J. asked him for heroin \"strong enough for an overdose\" and that he sold Paul J. thirty bags of heroin. Although Silva did ingest some of this heroin, it did not have its intended effect. Moving to a new plan, Paul A. told Meuse to kill her.</p>\n<p>The morning of November 13, Meuse arrived at DiCenso's apartment, where Silva was staying, and sent DiCenso to the hardware store to buy a hacksaw and sheet metal cutters. When DiCenso returned, Silva was dead, and Meuse told DiCenso he had broken her neck. Capozzi arrived to help, and the three men dismembered Silva's body in the bathtub and packed her remains into trash bags. They drove north, stopping at a Home Depot to purchase lime and a shovel, and buried Silva's remains in the woods along the North Shore. They then disposed of the remaining evidence in a dumpster in Danvers, washed the car, and stopped at a department store to buy three pairs of sneakers and three sweatsuits.</p>\n<p>DiCenso testified to the details of the murder described above at trial; his testimony was supported by physical evidence recovered by the police. Paul A., Paul J., and Pavone were all convicted of conspiracy to tamper with a witness and tampering with a witness by misleading conduct; Paul A. and Paul J. were also convicted of tampering with a witness by attempted murder, and Paul A. was convicted of tampering with a witness by murder. These crimes, along with the state-law crimes of murder, attempted murder, and conspiracy to murder, were also found as racketeering acts under the substantive RICO charge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Paul A., Paul J., John Jr., Pavone, John Sr., and Capozzi were indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts on October 17, 2001.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> Paul A. moved to dismiss the RICO charges against him on double jeopardy grounds, an argument based on an earlier trial. The motion was denied; the denial was appealed. In <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785749\"><a href=\"/opinion/785749/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-paul-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), this court rejected that appeal. We explain the background.</p>\n<p>In an earlier trial, <i>United States v. Carrozza,</i> No. 4:97-cr-40009-NMG (D.Mass. 1999), Paul A. was prosecuted for helping the Carrozza faction of the Patriarca crime family undertake a violent \"war\" between 1989 and 1994 in an attempt to wrest control of that criminal organization from Frank Salemme's faction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 19-21 (1st Cir.2002) (describing the factual background of the <i>Carrozza</i> case). Paul A. was acquitted of all charges in that case, and he argued in his pre-trial motion in this case that the present indictment violated his double jeopardy rights because it alleged the same conspiracy. <i>DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d at 16-17. The district court disagreed, and on interlocutory appeal this court affirmed, holding that the two cases dealt with different patterns of racketeering activity. <i>Id.</i> at 19. That double jeopardy claim is renewed here based on the evidence actually introduced at trial.</p>\n<p>John Sr. pled guilty to a RICO charge on February 28, 2003, and testified for the government at trial. <i>United States v. Capozzi</i> (<i>Capozzi II</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202795\"><a href=\"/opinion/202795/united-states-v-capozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, 714 (1st Cir.2007). In July 2004, Capozzi moved to disqualify the attorneys for Paul A., Paul J., and John Jr., arguing they had conflicts of interests. <i>Id.</i> The attorneys for the three defendants then withdrew, and because of the delay required for the new attorneys to prepare for trial, the district court, on the government's motion, severed Capozzi's case so that his trial could begin as planned in September 2004. <i>Id.</i> The court gave the remaining four defendants fifteen months to prepare, with the present trial beginning on January 9, 2006. The jury returned its verdict on March 20, 2006. The district court sentenced Paul A. to life imprisonment, Paul J. to 25 years imprisonment, John Jr. to 210 months imprisonment, and Pavone to 72 months imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone raise similar and overlapping issues on appeal, we consider their claims together.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Severance and Mistrial</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motions, based on several grounds, to sever their trial from that of Paul A. or to declare a mistrial.<sup>[8]</sup> Those grounds include Paul A.'s alleged admission to being a gang leader, his odd behavior in the courtroom, his responsibility for the heinous act of the murder of Aislin Silva, and the risk of jury confusion. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> 1. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Trial judges' decisions regarding severance and mistrial are treated with a considerable amount of deference because appellate courts lack the \"first-hand exposure to a case\" that better enables trial judges to \"strike the delicate balance between fending off prejudice, on the one hand, and husbanding judicial resources, on the other hand.\" <i>United States v.

Antagonistic defenses can require severance when they are truly irreconcilable, or at least substantially incompatible. <i>Tejeda,</i> 481 F.3d at 55; <i>United States v. Peña-Lora,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770240\"><a href=\"/opinion/770240/united-states-v-luis-manuel-pea-lora-united-states-of-america-v-jorge/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2000). \"[W]here there is merely some dissonance,\" however, \"we will usually not reverse a trial court's denial of severance.\" <i>Tejeda,</i> 481 F.3d at 55. Here, the defenses were not truly irreconcilable, nor were they substantially incompatible.</p>\n<p>The other defendants characterize Paul A.'s testimony as admitting that he ran a criminal enterprise during the time in question. This, they say, was incompatible with their defense of non-criminality. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> record does not support their characterization.</p>\n<p>Paul A. testified that he had originally, back in the 1980s, delivered drugs on behalf of Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, two infamous Boston-area organized crime bosses, but he described his connection with them as minimal and explained that he had refused to continue even in this minimal role after he served his first term in prison (from 1984 to 1992). Paul A. asserted that his refusal irked the mob leaders. His primary defense was that Regan worked for what had become the Salemme faction of the Patriarca Family and was thus motivated to testify falsely against Paul A., setting him up to take the fall for crimes in fact committed by Regan and other followers of Salemme.</p>\n<p>In developing this defense, Paul A. did bring up his prior indictment in the <i>Carrozza</i> case, as well as the allegation that the Carrozza and Salemme factions were at odds. In Paul A.'s cross-examination of Regan, there were also some references to \"the DeCologero crew,\" but these were references to what others had alleged, such as the language of the indictment. While this tack might have muddied the waters for the jury, it did not (contrary to his co-defendants' arguments) set Paul A. up before the jury as \"an open and notorious underworld figure.\"</p>\n<p>Instead, the jury heard Paul A. flatly deny running a criminal enterprise (the alleged DeCologero crew), insist that he was not affiliated with any organized criminals, and explain repeatedly that only his son (and, on rare occasion, his brother John Sr.) assisted him in his drug deals after his release from prison. While Paul A. admitted that he had continued some limited drug dealing in the mid-1990s, he explained that he stopped such activity once his side business selling high-protein muffins to other gyms started doing well enough to meet his gym's operating deficit. Paul A. admitted knowing Regan, DiCenso, and Meuse, but he denied ever asking them for assistance in any criminal conduct.</p>\n<p>The jury could accept Paul A.'s testimony that he was an occasional drug dealer, and even that he was disliked and targeted by mob leaders, while also accepting the other defendants' claims that they had engaged in no criminal wrongdoing. Paul A. did not implicate the others, nor did his defense as presented to the jury, if accepted, preclude acquittal of the others. There was no substantial incompatibility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Severance Based on \"Spillover\" Effects and Mistrial Based on Paul A.'s Courtroom Antics</i>\n</h2>\n<p>At the core, these three defendants argue that Paul A.'s admitted criminality, the more severe crimes with which he was charged, and his inappropriate courtroom behavior cast a pall over all four defendants, prejudicing his co-defendants before the jury. This tack also fails.</p>\n<p>As Justice Jackson famously noted, co-defendants in a conspiracy trial like this one occupy \"an uneasy seat. There generally will be evidence of wrongdoing by somebody. It is difficult for the individual to make his own case stand on its own merits in the minds of jurors who are ready to believe that birds of a feather are flocked together.\" <i>Krulewitch v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104646\"><a href=\"/opinion/104646/krulewitch-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 454, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104646\"><a href=\"/opinion/104646/krulewitch-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span> (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring). Such uneasiness is inherent in joint RICO trials, and the unsavoriness of one's co-defendant (including past criminal conduct) is not enough, by itself, to mandate severance. <i>Tejeda,</i> 481 F.3d at 56. Defendants must still make a strong showing of prejudice to overturn the trial court's decision not to sever.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone have also not met that burden with their argument that they suffered from a \"spillover\" effect due to Paul A.'s prosecution for Aislin Silva's gruesome murder. While only Paul A. was on trial for the actual murder of Silva, Paul J. and Pavone were charged with closely related crimes (attempted murder and tampering with a witness) involving the same victim. Further, all four men were convicted of RICO conspiracy, and the scope of that conspiracy included protecting their criminal enterprise by silencing witnesses like Silva. Thus even if some of the defendants were not directly charged with Silva's murder, the murder was still relevant to the RICO counts as it tended to prove the existence and nature of the RICO enterprise and conspiracy. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763759\"><a href=\"/opinion/763759/united-states-v-jose-diaz-also-known-as-jolly-jesse-rodriguez-also-known/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 103 (2d Cir.1999). As a result, even if the defendants had received separate trials, evidence of the murder would have been independently admissible against each, and it is far from clear that the potentially prejudicial impact of that evidence would have rendered it inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. <i>See </i><i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 29-30. This is why, \"[i]n the context of conspiracy, severance will rarely, if ever, be required\" due to evidentiary spillover. <i>United States v. DeLuca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751763\"><a href=\"/opinion/751763/united-states-v-robert-p-deluca-sr-united-states-of-america-v-gerard/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196112\"><a href=\"/opinion/196112/united-states-v-flores-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 325 (1st Cir.1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The defendants' fear of being found guilty by association with Paul A. has a third aspect: his distracting courtroom behavior. Paul A.'s testimony was often unresponsive or tangential, provoking repeated objections from the prosecution and rebukes from the bench. During the prosecution's case, the judge admonished Paul A. for interfering with the work of his defense counsel, warning that his disruptive behavior was hurting rather than helping him in the eyes of the jury. Generally, however, if \"a defendant misbehaves in the jury's presence, the misbehavior usually will not compel a separate trial for his codefendants\"; rather, the co-defendant seeking severance or mistrial must \"demonstrate the existence of some special prejudice\" that the court could not remedy through other means. <i>United States v. Pierro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 616 (1st Cir.1994). If the rule were otherwise, co-defendants could provoke mistrials at will. <i>United States v. Tashjian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"395176\"><a href=\"/opinion/395176/united-states-v-charles-tashjian-united-states-of-america-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span>, 838 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p>Paul A.'s co-defendants do not point to any specific prejudice, asserting more generally that they \"were prejudiced by his conduct and the court's inability to rein him in.\" Nor do they provide any case law to support their argument that such behavior warrants a mistrial. Rather, under the case law, Paul A.'s conduct is not comparable to the severity of other co-defendant outbursts analyzed in prior cases in which we upheld denials of severance motions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mazza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471592\"><a href=\"/opinion/471592/united-states-v-antonio-j-mazza-united-states-of-america-v-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span>, 1224 (1st Cir.1986) (no abuse of discretion in refusal to sever even though co-defendant shouted in middle of witness testimony, \"He is lying. I got shot for you, you mother piece of shit. This is my pay back.\"); <i>Tashjian,</i> 660 F.2d at 837 (no abuse of discretion in denial of mistrial even though defendant threatened a witness in front of the jury and yelled that his co-defendants were in the mafia). Paul A.'s unruly behavior in the courtroom was unfortunate, but his co-defendants have not made a sufficient showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p>Paul A.'s conduct also did not go unchecked by the district court. The court, outside the presence of the jury, told Paul A. to change his behavior, and this had at least some effect on him. For example, before Paul A. began his second day of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> testimony, the court warned himagain outside the presence of the jurythat:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]his is not fun and games.... This is a court of law, and there are rules.... [Y]ou will answer only the questions that are put to you and not blurt out a whole bunch of other stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I do believe that you are doing that on purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Number one, it doesn't help you. You may wish to look at the jury at times, and you will see that they are not buying it; and, number two, it is improper and inappropriate for you to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It is important for you that the story be told in some reasonably coherent fashion, and you're making it impossible for the story to be told in a coherent fashion; apart from which you are violating the orders of the Court every time you go off on a frolic of your own. So stop doing that. If you don't stop doing it, I will need to take further steps.</blockquote>\n<p>Paul A.'s subsequent testimony, though still subject to objections and occasional reprimands, was more restrained.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Severance Based on Jury Confusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In another line of arguments, Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone assert that severance was warranted because of Paul A.'s much greater degree of culpability, the number of crimes for which only Paul A. was on trial, and the similarity of the defendants' names. All of these factors, defendants argue, could easily lead to jury confusion, a type of prejudice that can be grounds for severance. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788441\"><a href=\"/opinion/788441/united-states-v-jose-rodriguez-marrero-united-states-of-america-v-omar/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2004). Again, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p>It is true that \"markedly different degrees of culpability\" among co-defendants can \"heighten[]\" the risk of prejudice. <i>Zafiro,</i> 506 U.S. at 539, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112812\"><a href=\"/opinion/112812/zafiro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></a></span>. But again, disparity between the relative culpability of co-defendants does not <i>entitle</i> a defendant to severance. <i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 30; <i>United States v. Welch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195118\"><a href=\"/opinion/195118/united-states-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span>, 1210 (1st Cir.1993). Prejudice must be shown, and \"[e]ven where large amounts of testimony are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement ... is far less than the involvement of others, we have been reluctant to secondguess severance denials.\" <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246.</p>\n<p>Further, such disparity is not uncommon in RICO cases, nor is it unusual in such cases for a co-defendant to be charged with only a subset of the crimes alleged in the indictment. In <i>Flores-Rivera,</i> for example, this court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of severance for a defendant \"named in less than ten percent of all overt acts charged in the indictment.\" 56 F.3d at 325; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Welch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727244\"><a href=\"/opinion/727244/united-states-v-vincent-welch-95-3484-michael-clemmons-95-3676/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span>, 147 (6th Cir.1996) (no abuse of discretion in denial of severance even though defendant was only charged with three of the twenty-nine counts of the indictment). The RICO counts, of which all defendants were charged and all were convicted, provided the logical scope and overarching unity for the indictment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Turkette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392968\"><a href=\"/opinion/392968/united-states-v-novia-turkette-jr-united-states-of-america-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p>As for the defendants' similar names, defendants appear to assume that the similarities resulted in jury confusion. We cannot make such an assumption, especially as the jury spent two months in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> same room with these defendants and their distinct personalities. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Castillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714124\"><a href=\"/opinion/714124/united-states-v-ysidro-castillo-jr-aka-curly-aka-big-un-gary-rhudy/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></a></span>, 1491 n. 20 (5th Cir.1996) (dismissing defendants' arguments of jury confusion in trial involving a Thomas Brown, Sr., and a Thomas Brown, Jr., in addition to three other defendants who shared the last name of Castillo). The defendants here have failed to demonstrate any prejudice greater than the \"possible risk of prejudice that almost always exists when multiple defendants with different roles are tried together.\" <i>United States v. Cresta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492349\"><a href=\"/opinion/492349/united-states-v-robert-d-cresta-united-states-of-america-v-john-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 554-55 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>Two additional factors cut against the defendants' jury confusion argument. First, the district court noted to the jury at the outset of the trial that the jury must be careful to consider each defendant separately, a point repeated several times during the jury instructions at the trial's close. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Zafiro,</i> 506 U.S. at 540-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112812\"><a href=\"/opinion/112812/zafiro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></a></span> (noting that proper jury instructions can alleviate risk of prejudice).</p>\n<p>Second, and more tellingly, the jury returned highly individualized verdicts: there were some charges for which the jury acquitted all defendants, and others for which the jury convicted some defendants while acquitting others. Even within some of the charged racketeering acts under the substantive RICO count, the jury found some but not all of the individual, closely related predicate acts proved. <i>See</i> Appendix. These were not the verdicts of a jury confused about the identity and culpability of the individual defendants. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Houle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199243\"><a href=\"/opinion/199243/united-states-v-houle/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2001) (\"With regard to the jury's ability to segregate the evidence and understand the judge's instructions, the verdict itself is often quite telling.... This discriminating verdict shows that the jury was able to compartmentalize evidence and apply it to each defendant....\"); <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246; <i>Turkette,</i> 656 F.2d at 9. Given the considerable discretion a district court has to decide a motion for severance or mistrial, these additional factors further indicate that the district court did not abuse that discretion. In sum, we will not second guess the court's decision without a greater showing of prejudice. <i>See </i><i>United States v. DeLeon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198562\"><a href=\"/opinion/198562/united-states-v-deleon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 63-64 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Judge's Trial Demeanor</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone next argue that the district court judge's criticisms of their counsel in the presence of the jury deprived them of a fair trial. With allegations of judicial bias, we consider whether the comments were improper and, if so, whether the complaining party can show serious prejudice. <i>Owens v.

As the Supreme Court has noted in the context of the recusal of judges, \"judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.... A judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration even a stern and short-tempered judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administrationremain immune.\" <i>Liteky v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span> (1994). This was a complex and lengthy trial, handled with skill by a seasoned trial judge who did not let things get out of control. The defendants have exaggerated; the record does not support their claims. The comments of which defendants complain were few <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> (eleven comments spread over thirty-six days of testimony), balanced, and reasonable in context.</p>\n<p>Defendants first argue that the judge referred to their objections as \"picky\" in front of the jury. During the government's direct examination of DiCenso, defense counsel repeatedly objected to leading questions, objections which the court sustained. After the fourth sustained defense objection in a brief stretch of questioning, the judge addressed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote>Let me explain, members of the jury. I told you yesterday that leading questions in general are a no-no when counsel conducted direct examination, but you can also be too picky about that. So, part of the reason that I have not always sustained the objection is because I thought at times it was a bit too picky. There is a certain judgment call that one has to make. However, at the moment, [the prosecutor] is leading [DiCenso] rather too much.</blockquote>\n<p>Immediately thereafter, the court ruled sua sponte that the government was asking another leading question. The court's \"picky\" comment had very little to do with the defense; if anything, the court was reprimanding the government.</p>\n<p>Defendants also accuse the court of unfair, sua sponte rulings that defense questions were argumentative. The court was even-handed: at times it raised sua sponte concerns about the government's questioning. There was no preferential treatment. Further, the rulings were correct. The court was trying, in this difficult case, to keep the focus on the evidence.</p>\n<p>We do not address additional exchanges regarding objections, but we do note that the court emphasized in its final instructions to the jury that it should not take into account the exchanges between counsel and the bench regarding evidentiary matters:</p>\n<blockquote>In the course of the trial, you have heard many times when counsel rose to object. You should not hold that against them or their clients. It is their right to do that. Indeed, it is their duty to do it. It's the way in which counsel bring to the attention of the Court when they think one or another of what you now know are very complicated rules are not being adhered to.</blockquote>\n<p><i>See </i><i>Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d at 36 (\"Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the trial court exhibited frustration from time to time during this rather lengthy, heated trial, the strong instructions given by the trial court... should have eliminated any conceivable prejudice.\"); <i>Logue v. Dore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197149\"><a href=\"/opinion/197149/logue-v-dore/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1046-47 (1st Cir.1997) (\"jury instructions can be a means of allaying potential prejudice\" in this context). In sum, the court's treatment of objections raised by both sides was even-handed and not unfair.</p>\n<p>The three defendants also take issue with comments by the court that, they argue, suggested they curtail their cross-examination of witnesses. These comments, too, when taken in context, were appropriate. Defendants do not argue, nor could they, that the district court cut their cross-examination short at any point. Instead, the court at times encouraged counsel to move more rapidly after lengthy questioning about minimally relevant information. We read a comment that counsel should limit his cross-examination to \"thirty seconds\" as a reflection of the late hour; the court dismissed the jury shortly thereafter, and when questioning resumed the next day, the attorneywho indeed had very few questionswas given all the time he needed, without further comment. The same explanation holds for a similar incident earlier in the trial, when the court asked defense counsel to try to conclude cross-examination of a witness that day: the judge's comment that some defense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> counsel might skip cross-examination altogether might have been a light quip, a reference to the imminent end of the trial day, or an acknowledgment that the remaining counsel might have few or no questions for the witnessindeed, one counsel did not have any questions, the other two had very few, and no one's questioning was curtailed by the judge.</p>\n<p>\"Trial judges are justifiably accorded broad latitude to ensure proper courtroom behavior.\" <i>United States v.

We review the district court's interpretation of the rules of evidence de novo, but we review the court's application of those rules for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Muñoz-Franco,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2007). We start with their objections to the court's exclusion of certain testimony.</p>\n<p>a. <i>Hearsay.</i> Defendants object that the court excluded as hearsay statements which were not. The hearsay rule applies to out-of-court statements \"offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). However, \"[i]f the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note. Defendants argue that two conversations that allegedly occurred at Paul A.'s gym fall into this latter category. The district court's rulings to the contrary were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Paul A. attempted to introduce these gym conversations through his own testimony and the testimony of his sister JoAnne and a gym employee named Peter Ippolito.<sup>[10]</sup> We summarize the testimony that defendants desired to introduce. In the first conversation, DiCenso and Silva allegedly came to Paul A. at his gym to seek his help because the guns had been discovered in Silva's apartment and because DiCenso was afraid of how Regan would respond. Paul A., who claimed the guns were not his, asserted that he got angry when he learned that DiCenso was storing the guns for Bobby Luisi, a member of the Salemme faction; Paul A. yelled out Luisi's name and told them, \"Get out of here. Those people are trying to kill me.\" In the end, Paul A. agreed to help DiCenso get a lawyer and called Tony Bucci to request a limousine on their behalf. In the second conversation, Meuse and Regan came to Paul A. and, in a heated argument, told him to \"stay out of their business, that that business with Stephen DiCenso and Aislin Silva was their business and had nothing to do with [Paul A.].\"</p>\n<p>The court allowed Ippolito to testify that DiCenso and Silva came to the gym, that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> Paul A. got angry, and that Paul A. yelled out someone's name. But the court did not allow testimony as to the name he yelled out (allegedly \"Bobby Luisi\"). Ippolito was also allowed to testify that the conversation between Meuse, Regan, and Paul A. took place and that they were \"very, very angry,\" but not to the content of that conversation. Paul A. testified that the conversation with DiCenso and Silva took place, that he tried calling an attorney for them, and that he called Bucci to order the limousine for DiCenso. JoAnne was allowed to testify to much more regarding the first conversation: that the three of them were talking about guns, that Paul A. yelled at DiCenso, \"Well, why are you coming to me\" because \"these are people who are after us,\" that Paul A. told them to leave the gym, and that he then tried to help DiCenso get in touch with an attorney and called for a limousine.</p>\n<p>The rest of the conversations the court excluded on hearsay grounds. Further details from the first conversation, it ruled, were only offered for \"the truth that DiCenso had another agenda\": that is, to establish that the guns were not Paul A.'s and that DiCenso was not working for Paul A. As for the second conversation, Paul A. argued it was relevant because it showed he \"was not in a conspiracy with Regan and Meuse. He was not the leader of an organization where he gave them orders, that they had their own thing going.\" The court reasoned, however, that this proffered relevance required the content of the statementsthat the guns and Silva had nothing to do with Paul A.to be true. These exclusion rulings were correct.</p>\n<p>Defendants argue that the statements should have been admitted as verbal acts, but that label applies to statements which \"affect[] the legal rights of the parties.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Stover,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185932\"><a href=\"/opinion/185932/united-states-v-stover-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span>, 870 (D.C.Cir.2003) (\"[Verbal] acts are limited to statements that have independent legal significance, such as contractual offers or inter vivos gifts.\").</p>\n<p>The defendants perhaps mean to refer more broadly to the category of statements that are not hearsay because they are not offered for their truth. <i>See </i><i>Stover,</i> 329 F.3d at 870. At trial, Paul A. argued that the conversations were offered to provide context for other actions and events, not to prove the truth of the statements. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Page,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1302436\"><a href=\"/opinion/1302436/united-states-v-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 106-07 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v.

Statements that provide \"context\" only if they are true, however, are still considered hearsay. <i>See </i><i>Stover,</i> 329 F.3d at 870.</p>\n<p>The only relevant context the defendants could point to here was the need to explain why Paul A. called a lawyer for DiCenso. Based on this argument, the court allowed into evidence testimony to the effect that Paul A. called a lawyer for DiCenso, not because DiCenso worked for him, but as a favor when DiCenso came to him with legal troubles. Defendants have put forward no further argument as to what other contextual background the remaining, excluded statements might provide without relying on the truth of those statements.</p>\n<p>Contrary to defendants' assertion, the court did not make broad rulings regarding hearsay, but carefully parsed each proffer, often ruling in defendants' favor in unclear situations. There was no abuse of discretion.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> b. <i>Impeachment.</i> In arguments that overlap with their hearsay arguments, defendants assert that the district court improperly excluded testimony meant to challenge the credibility of government witnesses.</p>\n<p>The ability to use extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction is linked to the question of hearsay. Generally, extrinsic evidence (such as the testimony of another witness) cannot be used to impeach a witness if it relates only to a collateral matter. <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 24. This common law rule is a manifestation of the district court's general discretion to exclude otherwise relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, ... or by considerations of undue delay [or] waste of time.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Beauchamp,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600392\"><a href=\"/opinion/600392/united-states-v-michael-w-beauchamp/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1993) (citing <i>United States v. Tarantino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506169\"><a href=\"/opinion/506169/united-states-v-john-c-tarantino-united-states-of-america-v-robert-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1384</span></a></span>, 1409 (D.C.Cir.1988)). Evidence is collateral if it is relevant only because it contradicts the in-court testimony of another witness. <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 24. If what makes the statement otherwise relevant and thus not collateral relies on the truth of the statement, then the statement is hearsay and inadmissable on that ground.<sup>[12]</sup><i>See</i> 28 Wright &amp; Gold, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence</i> § 6206, at 537 n. 14 (1993). The decision on whether a matter is collateral or material is within the district court's discretion. <i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>Defendants take issue with the court's refusal to let a defense witness recount a conversation in which Agent John Mercer allegedly tried to coerce him into testifying for the government. The court ruled that the testimony was only relevant to the extent it bore on Mercer's credibility and was thus collateral. Defendants note that \"a witness's self-interest or motive to testify falsely is generally considered to be a non-collateral issue.\" <i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4. If the argument is that the defendants were attempting to impeach Mercer not through contradiction but by establishing his bias against defendants and his motive to lie, this argument was not fully developed on appeal and is thus waived. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner [on appeal], unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Further, while extrinsic evidence is admissible to show bias, the trial judge still has discretion under Rule 403 to exclude such evidence if it would distract from the main issues of the case. <i>Gomes,</i> 177 F.3d at 81. This ruling was well within the court's discretion given the court's interest in avoiding a mini-trial on Mercer's conduct, which could distract the jury in an already complex case. <i>See </i><i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4.</p>\n<p>Defendants also argue that the district court should have issued bench warrants for three witnesses. The court refused to do so because the witnesses would only testify to collateral matters in order to contradict government witnesses, such as DiCenso and Regan. The court was correct that the witnesses would not be allowed, under the rules of evidence, to testify on those collateral matters. Further, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the proposed testimony of the witnesses, as proffered by Paul <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> A., regarded only collateral matters.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Pre-Trial Identification</i>\n</h2>\n<p>John Jr. appeals the denial of his motions to suppress pre-trial identifications made by Soccorso and Bentley, which he argues were based on an impermissibly suggestive photo array. There was no violation of John Jr.'s due process rights in the presentation of this identification evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p>Our review of a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion as to identification is plenary, but with the usual deference to any findings of fact. <i>United States v. Brennick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201556\"><a href=\"/opinion/201556/united-states-v-brennick/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 99-100 (1st Cir.2005). A court should exclude an out-of-court identification based on a photo array only in those \"extraordinary cases\" where there is \"a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\" a situation which could result in an unfair trial in violation of the defendant's due process rights. <i>United States v.

That photo array was provided for the jury. John Jr.'s counsel cross-examined both witnesses extensively. He walked each of them through the characteristics of the six photographed men, arguing that four of them clearly did not match the age or hair-style descriptions that the witnesses had provided the police. Under defense counsel's questioning, Soccorso acknowledged that it was dark at the time of his abduction and that John Jr. was sitting behind him for much of their encounter; from Bentley, counsel drew a description of the pain medications Bentley had been taking at the time he made the identification as well as during the trial, and Bentley acknowledged that his doctor had written a letter to the effect that Bentley should not testify because the medications severely affected his recall.</p>\n<p>John Jr. also produced an expert witness, Dr. Steven Penrod, to testify about factors that decrease the reliability of witness identifications, many of which factors John Jr. argued to the jury were present in this case. Neither Bentley nor Soccorso made an in-court identification.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> John Jr. renewed his motion to suppress before the court charged the jury; that motion was also denied. John Jr.'s counsel then argued repeatedly and at length during his closing that the identifications were unreliable and should be discredited. The court, during its charge, instructed the jury that \"if the government's theory is that a particular defendant was a principal,... then you need to decide whether the evidence shows he was there, and if so, was he identified by the victim, was it a good or a questionable identification.\"</p>\n<p>We use a two-step analysis when considering whether a pretrial identification procedure raises a \"very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\": we first determine whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, and if it was, we then look to the totality of the circumstances to decide whether the identification was still reliable. <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100; <i>see also </i><i>Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 125. At the first step, we consider whether the photo array included, as far as was practicable, a reasonable number of persons similar in appearance to the suspect. <i>Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 125-26. \"The police authorities are required to make every effort reasonable under the circumstances to conduct a fair and balanced presentation of alternative possibilities for identification. The police are <i>not</i> required to search for identical twins....\" <i>Id.</i> at 126 n. 5 (quoting <i>Wright v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span> (1972), enumerated five factors for consideration:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention to the crime; (3) the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the defendant; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; and (5) the length of time between the crime and confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100 (summarizing <i>Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. at 199-200, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>Starting with the first step, the photo array for John Jr. was impermissibly suggestive. John Jr. has no unusual features that might complicate the search for others with similar appearances, yet the other photos in the array were not of men who looked similar to John Jr. beyond being white men with short hair. Comparison with the eight-photo array used for the identification of Paul J. is informative. In that array, the eight men appear to be of the same age group, seven of the eight have fairly similar hair, and the overall impression is one of resemblance. The array used for John Jr., however, included only six photos, two of which are of men who appear younger than John Jr. and two of which are of men clearly older; one of the latter has a noticeably receding hairline. Two of the men appear more heavyset than John Jr., and at least two have hair that is markedly different and not interchangeable with that of the defendant. In all, only one of the five photos depicts a man as similar to John Jr. as the photos in Paul J.'s array are to Paul J. Further, given the familial resemblance between the brothers, the existence of the other photos in Paul J.'s array makes all the more clear that the police should not have had trouble locating men who resembled John Jr. more closely.</p>\n<p>However, given the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the array did not raise a <i>substantial</i> likelihood of misidentification and that the remaining question of reliability was appropriately left to the jury. <i>Cf. </i><i>Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. at 200-01, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>. Soccorso spent a substantial amount of time in the car with his assailant; Bentley watched as the crew ransacked his apartment and tied him up. Both witnesses were victims of the crimes and not accidental eyewitnesses whose attention might have been distracted. On cross-examination, despite thorough questioning, both witnesses stood by their identifications. Some of the <i>Biggers</i> factors cut in defendant's favor  Bentley did incorrectly describe two of the robbers as being the same height, and (more significantly) there was a lengthy time delay between the crimes and the identifications  but not all the <i>Biggers</i> factors must point in one direction for an identification to be upheld. <i>See </i><i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100. \"[I]t is only in extraordinary cases that identification evidence should be withheld from the jury,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>de Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d at 677), and this is not one of them.</p>\n<p>The weighing of the factors in this case, however, is a close question, so we also note that the jury was provided with extensive information about the identifications with which to make its own reliability determination. The defendant's counsel did a highly competent examination, eliciting testimony from multiple witnesses that cast doubt on the identifications of John Jr., especially in terms of the <i>Biggers</i> factors. The jury was clearly and properly instructed on the question and had before it a thorough record of why the identification might be untrustworthy. We are thus further reassured that John Jr.'s due process rights were not violated by the submission of the identification evidence, with all of defendant's caveats, to the jury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Pavone's Claim of Prosecutorial Misconduct</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Pavone argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by prosecutorial misconduct. We start by describing the underlying dispute.</p>\n<p>Pavone alleges that an old acquaintance, John Dana, and his colleague Wayne David Collins approached him around the time of his indictment and offered to hire an attorney on his behalf. That attorney, John Cicilline, did briefly take over Pavone's case. According to Pavone, Collins claimed to have a special, preferential relationship with the FBI, and Dana and Cicilline repeatedly asked Pavone to cooperate with the government. After his initial detention hearing, Pavone was approached by another inmate, Arlindo Dossantos, who warned Pavone that Collins and Dana were FBI informants who hired attorneys for criminal defendants in order to obtain confidential information that they could then pass on to the government. Pavone confronted Cicilline, Cicilline withdrew as counsel, and Pavone's former counsel was reappointed.</p>\n<p>Pavone moved to dismiss the indictment against him. He asserted that he had shared confidential information with Cicilline, that Cicilline transmitted that information to Collins and Dana, and that all three \"acted with the knowledge and approval of the government.\" He supported this motion with his own affidavit and that of his mother, who had spoken with Dana on multiple occasions during the time in question. Pavone also moved for discovery of sealed documents filed in Dossantos's prosecution regarding similar accusations against Collins, Dana, and the U.S. Attorney's Office.</p>\n<p>In response, the government submitted affidavits from the three Assistant U.S. Attorneys who prosecuted this case. They denied having ever met or communicated with Dana or Collins and asserted that, to the best of their knowledge, no one involved in the investigation had obtained any information from Dana, Collins, or Cicilline. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> One of them also explained that the case was investigated not by the FBI, but by the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives (\"ATF\"), and the Massachusetts State Police. The lead investigators from the ATF (Mercer) and the Massachusetts State Police (Irwin) also submitted affidavits, stating that neither they nor, to the best of their knowledge, anyone else working on the investigation had ever sought or received information from Dana, Collins, or Cicilline.</p>\n<p>The district court denied Pavone's motions to dismiss the indictment. Based on the government's affidavits \"and in the absence of any contradictory factual support,\" the court was \"not persuaded\" that Pavone could show that the government received any confidential information, even if he were allowed access to documents in the Dossantos case. It is this denial that Pavone appeals.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he government's intrusion into the attorney-client relationship\" is not a <i>per se</i> Sixth Amendment violation; there must also be some demonstration of resulting prejudice. <i>United States v. Mastroianni,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445229\"><a href=\"/opinion/445229/united-states-v-david-mastroianni-united-states-of-america-v-dennis/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span>, 907 (1st Cir.1984). Because such intrusions pose a serious risk to defendants' constitutional rights, and because it would be unreasonably difficult for most defendants to prove prejudice, we only require defendants to make a prima facie showing of prejudice by \"prov[ing] that confidential communications were conveyed as a result\" of the government intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. <i>Id.</i> at 907-08. The burden then shifts to the government to show that the defendant was not prejudiced; that burden is a demanding one. <i>Id.</i> at 908.</p>\n<p>Even taking all his allegations as true, Pavone did not show or even allege that Collins and Dana passed any confidential information they received from Cicilline on to the government. \"[U]nless [the informant] communicated the substance of the [attorney-client] conversations [to the government] and thereby created at least a realistic possibility of injury to [the defendant] or benefit to the State, there can be no Sixth Amendment violation.\" <i>Weatherford v.

The district court here concluded that the Dossantos documents would not \"suffice to sustain Pavone's burden\" in establishing his prima facie case of a Sixth Amendment violation. In light of the record created by the prosecution that there was no contact by the prosecution with Collins and Dana in this case, and in the absence of any allegation by Pavone to the contrary, this ruling was plainly correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J., John Jr., and Pavone all appeal their convictions on one or more charges, arguing that the government presented insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find them guilty.</p>\n<p>We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, scrutinizing the record as a whole, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, and avoiding any credibility judgments, to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found each element of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Muñoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 41. \"To uphold a conviction, the court need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in `a plausible rendition of the record.'\" <i>United States v.

Further, \"evidence sufficient to convict may be entirely circumstantial, with the factfinder remaining free to choose among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Wight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586812\"><a href=\"/opinion/586812/united-states-v-phillip-a-wight/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1393</span></a></span>, 1395 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Tampering with Witness by Misleading Conduct</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Pavone and Paul J. argue there was insufficient evidence to convict them of witness tampering (of Silva) by misleading conduct. The witness-tampering law prohibits \"engag[ing] in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to ... hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer ... of the United States of information relating to the commission ... of a Federal offense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3). \"Misleading conduct\" is further defined, as relevant here, as \"knowingly making a false statement\" or \"intentionally omitting information from a statement and thereby causing a portion of such statement to be misleading, or intentionally concealing a material fact, and thereby creating a false impression by such statement.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1515(a)(3)(A)-(B). These two defendants were indicted for and convicted of conspiracy to tamper with a witness through misleading conduct, as well as the substantive crime of tampering with a witness or aiding and abetting another to do so; tampering with a witness was also found to be a racketeering act for each under RICO.</p>\n<p>At trial, the government argued that the relevant misleading conduct was the isolation of Silva, \"all the while telling her that everything would be okay, their lawyers would take [ ] care [of everything] their lawyers would be back in town soon, telling her those things to mislead her about her situation.\" According to the government's trial theory, Pavone and Paul J. furthered that plan by being at the meetings where decisions about what to do with Silva were made, by renting hotel rooms, and by obtaining the heroin.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> The jury heard testimony that Paul A. and the crew were worried about what Silva had already told the police, made significant efforts to keep her away from the police while weighing the likelihood that she would betray them, and, to encourage her continued isolation and silence, reassured her repeatedly that their lawyers were away temporarily but would take care of everything upon their return.</p>\n<p>As for Pavone specifically, DiCenso testified that Pavone was present at the first meeting of the crew right after Silva had been discovered talking with the police; that DiCenso and Paul J. told \"everybody [present] what had happened in relation to the discovery of the guns\"; and that the mood of that meeting was \"[a]n overall general feeling of shock.\" Regan and DiCenso both testified that following the first meeting and at Paul A.'s behest, Pavone rented a motel room for Silva (which removed her from the apartment where she had met with the police), and Pavone did not deny driving DiCenso and Silva from Boston to New York (an act which made it even less likely that the police could find her). Given that Pavone participated in multiple parts of the scheme, that he spent several hours in a confined space with DiCenso and Silva during the drive to New York, that all three meetings about how to handle Silva occurred at Pavone's house, and that he was in the right place at the right time on multiple occasions to have heard the crew discuss the problem of Silva, a reasonable jury could have inferred that he knew the crew was misleading Silva to keep her from talking further with the police. The jury could have easily concluded that Pavone, rather than acting as a simple \"gofer,\" was knowingly assisting with that scheme.</p>\n<p>As for Paul J., he was with DiCenso when they went to Silva's apartment and discovered Silva being questioned by the police. He and DiCenso debriefed the crew about Silva's contact with the police at the first meeting. It was reasonable for the jury to infer that the plan to prevent Silva from talking further with the police was hatched at this meeting and that Paul J. was privy to it. Further, when the crew decided to kill Silva with an overdose to ensure that she would not betray them to the police, it was Paul J. who went to buy the heroin. He knew what it was for (he asked Centeno, the dealer, for heroin \"strong enough for an overdose\"), and it is a permissible inference that he knew the heroin would be provided to Silva under the guise of being a non-lethal drug. From all of this, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Paul J. knew of the scheme to convince Silva not to talk to the authorities and to prevent her from doing so, and that he knowingly assisted with that effort.</p>\n<p>These convictions of Pavone and Paul J. are affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Felon in Possession of a Firearm</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul J. also appeals his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) for being a felon in possession of a firearm.<sup>[14]</sup> He does not dispute that he is a felon under the terms of the statute or that the firearms in question were related to interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>Wight,</i> 968 F.2d at 1397. Instead he argues that the government did not provide sufficient evidence that he knowingly possessed the six firearms, derived <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> from the North burglary, that it accused him of possessing.</p>\n<p>Knowing possession under § 922(g)(1) can be established by proving that the defendant had constructive possession of a firearm; that is, that he \"knowingly ha[d] the <i>power</i> and the <i>intention</i> at a given time of exercising dominion and control over a firearm ..., directly or through others.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1398 (emphasis added). Constructive possession can be joint, does not require actual ownership of the firearm, and can be established through circumstantial evidence, though \"mere presence or association with another who possessed the contraband is insufficient.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1397; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201265\"><a href=\"/opinion/201265/united-states-v-liranzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.2004). Possession, whether actual or constructive, can be extremely brief: \"a minute of possession is as much an offense as a year of possession.\" <i>United States v. Zavala Maldonado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669099\"><a href=\"/opinion/669099/united-states-v-rafael-angel-zavala-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>There was enough evidence for the jury to find that Paul J. knowingly possessed the North firearms at some point. While other testimony was to the contrary, DiCenso testified that Paul J. was with him in North's apartment during the burglary. <i>See </i><i>Wight,</i> 968 F.2d at 1395 (credibility issues resolved in favor of government). Even if Paul J. was outside the apartment and helped the other two burglars load the stolen goods into the car, the jury could have reasonably inferred that he knew the duffel bags with the stolen goods contained guns. Paul A. sent them to search for drugs and guns, the weight and shape of the duffel bags would have belied their contents, and the box of grenades, which was loaded into the car separately, would have made clear that the expected weaponry had been found and stolen. The jury could have concluded, then, that Paul J. physically possessed the guns at that time.</p>\n<p>Second, a jury could have found that after the North robbery, when the crew was opening the safes in the garage and examining the weapons, Paul J. constructively possessed the firearms. A defendant has the power to exercise dominion over a firearm if he was \"close enough to pick it up at any time.\" <i>United States v. McLean,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790402\"><a href=\"/opinion/790402/united-states-v-dale-mclean-united-states-of-america-v-manolin-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 504 (1st Cir.2005). Regan described the guns as laid out \"all over the garage floor\" and specified that at least he and Meuse were physically handling the weapons; it could be inferred that Paul J. had the same access to them. As for the intent to exercise dominion over the firearms, although Paul A. stopped Regan from keeping some of the weapons, the jury could still have concluded that the weapons were being kept for the use of the crew as a whole. As DiCenso put it, \"because the guns belonged to the crew, ... that means they belonged to me, too,\" as a member of the crew.</p>\n<p>The basis for a joint possession finding is also demonstrated by Paul J. and DiCenso having gone to retrieve the weapons from Silva's apartment on behalf of the crew: they assumed that they would be able to remove the weapons at will. The weapons did not belong to Silva; the weapons belonged to the crew, and Paul J. acted as a member of the crew.</p>\n<p>We affirm this conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Use of a Firearm in Relation to Crime of Violence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>John Jr. appeals his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) for using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to any crime of violence ... for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\" The government based its § 924(c) charge on John Jr.'s robbery of Sapochetti in alleged violation of the Hobbs Act. Thus the government had to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> prove that John Jr. used or carried a firearm, that his use of the firearm was in relation to the robbery, and that he did in fact commit a Hobbs Act robbery. To prove a Hobbs Act robbery, the government had to establish that the Sapochetti robbery \"in any way or degree obstruct[ed], delay[ed], or affect[ed] commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). John Jr. argues the government failed to prove this nexus with interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>\"The Hobbs Act's scope extends to the limit of Congress' Commerce Clause authority.\" <i>United States v. Capozzi</i> (<i>Capozzi I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200671\"><a href=\"/opinion/200671/united-states-v-capozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 335 (1st Cir.2003). Because of this, and because the Hobbs Act by its terms criminalizes robberies that affect interstate commerce \"in any way or degree,\" the government need only show that the robbery created \"a realistic probability of a <i>de minimis</i> effect on interstate commerce.\"<sup>[15]</sup><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577004\"><a href=\"/opinion/577004/united-states-v-herbert-alan-butt-aka-alan-butt-united-states-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This required showing is \"not onerous.\" <i>Capozzi II,</i> 486 F.3d at 726 (quoting <i>United States v. DiGregorio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369750\"><a href=\"/opinion/369750/united-states-v-joseph-digregorio-hermis-yanis-jr-ruben-badillo-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1191 (1st Cir.1979)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>A reasonable jury could have concluded that John Jr. robbed Sapochetti and that the probable effect of that robbery was an impact on interstate commerce, albeit largely illicit commerce. The robbing of a drug dealer typically has the required nexus with interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., id.; </i><i>United States v.

A robbery can affect interstate commerce when it depletes the assets of a business, even if the business is that of drug dealing. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Capozzi II,</i> 486 F.3d at 726; <i>Williams,</i> 342 F.3d at 354-55; <i>Bailey,</i> 227 F.3d at 798. It was sufficient for the government to demonstrate that the robbery of cocaine dealers generally affects interstate commerce and that John Jr. intended to rob Sapochetti of money he believed was derived from or intended to finance cocaine sales. <i>See </i><i>Bailey,</i> 227 F.3d at 798.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>DiCenso and Regan both testified that Sapochetti was a known cocaine dealer. The interstate aspect was nailed down by a DEA agent who, testifying as an expert witness, explained that the coca plant from which cocaine is derived is native to South America and is not (to his knowledge) capable of being grown in Massachusetts. From this the jury could conclude that Sapochetti was engaged in a business that affected interstate commerce. Further, the government presented plentiful evidence that the crew's modus operandi was to rob rival drug dealers of their drugs and drug proceeds, both to decrease competition and to increase the crew's supplies for their own sales. Both DiCenso and Regan testified that the crew obtained around $18,000 from Sapochetti. The jury could have reasonably inferred that John Jr. intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> to and did deplete Sapochetti's business assets, thereby affecting interstate commerce to some degree.</p>\n<p>John Jr. makes a related argument that the jury's \"inconsistent\" verdict demonstrated that it did not find an effect on interstate commerce but was confused about the elements of § 924(c) because the judge's instructions on this charge were convoluted. This argument fails. Although the jury did acquit John Jr. on the substantive offense of a Hobbs Act robbery of Sapochetti, \"inconsistent verdicts are not sufficient grounds for reversing a criminal conviction as long as the appellate court is satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction.\" <i>United States v.

At least one other circuit has addressed the specific situation presented by this case and affirmed a § 924(c) conviction where the jury acquitted on the predicate Hobbs Act robbery. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765018\"><a href=\"/opinion/765018/united-states-v-quintus-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 458 (6th Cir.1999). Because there was sufficient evidence to establish the jurisdictional element of a Hobbs Act robbery, John Jr.'s conviction for using or carrying a firearm during the commission of that offense must be affirmed. <i>See generally</i> 3 Wright, King &amp; Klein, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal</i> § 514, at 27-28 (3d ed.2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>Further, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected any role for individualized assessments of inconsistent verdicts when a defendant argues the inconsistency was caused by a trial error, such as the argument here that the jury instructions were unclear. This is because such inquiries \"would be based either on pure speculation, or would require inquiries into the jury's deliberations that courts generally will not undertake.\" <i>Powell,</i> 469 U.S. at 66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111286\"><a href=\"/opinion/111286/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>. Indeed, much of defendant's argument on this point takes the form of speculation about what the jury might or might not have believed about the law or concluded about the facts of the case.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>John Jr.'s conviction under § 924(c) is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Sentencing</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, John Jr. appeals his sentence on one basis. The jury found that the government had not proved John Jr.'s involvement in racketeering act 13, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. However, John Jr. had pled guilty to the same offense conduct in 1997 and was sentenced to 249 days of imprisonment. John Jr. argues that the time he served for that crime  in which calculation he also includes the twenty-one months he served for violating the terms of his supervised release following his 249-day sentence should have been taken into account as a sort of mitigating factor in his sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> in this case. As he put it in his sentencing memorandum to the district court, \"[a]t a minimum, an innocent man who serves time should be remunerated for the time he served. [The district court] should sentence below the guideline sentencing range by the same amount of time that the defendant served for the crime that he did not commit, 29 months....\" The district court, however, concluded that it \"cannot give credit for time served on a sentence that someone else imposed in a case in which Mr. DeCologero admitted guilt\" and sentenced John Jr. to 210 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, but we first consider whether the court below committed a \"significant procedural error, such as ... treating the Guidelines as mandatory.\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 597, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007). To the extent that John Jr. argues that the trial court did not believe it could grant him a variance based on this particular factor, that argument is preserved. On appeal, John Jr. focuses on the trial judge's use of the word \"cannot\" in her decision not to take the prior conviction into account.</p>\n<p>When considering a sentencing appeal, however, we do not look at comments in isolation but consider the sentencing record as a whole. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc) (\"[A] court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\"). It is clear that the trial court did not consider the Guidelines to be mandatory. The court sentenced John Jr. below the Guidelines range, which it calculated to be between 324 and 405 months. It based this lower sentence on a number of the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, especially § 3553(a)(1), and on other factors specific to John Jr.'s case: that the conviction came ten years after the commission of the crimes, that Paul A. and other \"elders\" (presumably including his father) had \"subjected\" John Jr. \"to cruel control ... most of his life,\" that John Jr. had \"made strides\" in changing his life, and that the formal Guidelines calculation double-counted some of the underlying offenses, resulting in an \"artificially high\" Guidelines range. We do not doubt that the trial court recognized its discretion to take John Jr.'s prior conviction and imprisonment into account; the court simply did not agree with defendant that his previous incarceration for a crime to which he pled guilty should lead to a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p>To the extent that John Jr. argues that the district court committed a Guidelines error by not taking into account a possible downward departure under U.S.S.G. §§ 5G1.3 and 5K2.23, he did not present that argument to the trial court. We thus review the sentence on this ground for plain error only. <i>United States v. Goodhue,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202742\"><a href=\"/opinion/202742/united-states-v-goodhue/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Wallace,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202348\"><a href=\"/opinion/202348/united-states-v-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 35 &amp; n. 11 (1st Cir.2006). We pass over the questions of which Guidelines apply (the trial court applied the 1995 Guidelines, in effect at the time of the offense conduct) and whether, if the 1995 Guidelines do apply, the later amendments relevant here were retroactive. Even taking these questions in defendant's favor, John Jr.'s argument does not survive the plain terms of § 5G1.3.</p>\n<p>Under the current Guidelines, § 5G1.3(b) provides for an adjustment of the sentence to account for an undischarged term of imprisonment that \"resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction ... and that was <i>the basis for an increase in the offense level for the</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> <i>instant offense.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Application note 4, which cross-references and uses the same language as § 5K2.23, approves the use of a downward departure when the prior term of imprisonment has been fully discharged, as long as the other requirements of § 5G1.3(b) are met. Neither section is applicable here, then, as the offense underlying racketeering act 13 was not taken into account in the Guidelines calculation; much less was it a \"basis for an increase in the offense level\" in this case.<sup>[18]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v.

Paul A. renews his double jeopardy claim in this post-conviction appeal based on the evidence actually presented at trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Laguna-Estela,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201411\"><a href=\"/opinion/201411/united-states-v-laguna-estela/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir. 2005). Our review is de novo. <i>United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196443\"><a href=\"/opinion/196443/united-states-v-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 714 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>In our prior consideration of this issue, we noted that \"double jeopardy only bars successive RICO charges involving both the same enterprise <i>and</i> the same pattern of racketeering activity.\" <i>DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d at 18. The court recognized that it was perhaps a \"hard question\" whether the enterprises in the <i>Carrozza</i> case and this case were the same, but concluded that the patterns of racketeering activity were not. <i>Id.</i> Having assessed the evidence post-trial, we reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>In comparing the charged patterns of racketeering, we consider the totality of the circumstances, including the similarities of \"the time, the place, the people, and the nature and scope of the activities involved in each indictment.\" <i>Id.</i> Paul A. first argues that the time periods covered by the two trials overlap. We recognized in our earlier opinion the overlap in the time periods covered by the two indictments but found it insubstantial. <i>Id.</i> at 19. We noted then that the <i>Carrozza</i> indictment focused on 1989 to 1994 but that the <i>Carrozza</i> trial included evidence of events occurring as late as 1998. <i>Id.</i> The <i>DeCologero</i> indictment focused on the years 1995 to 1997, but the prosecution introduced evidence reaching back to 1994. For example, there was conflicting testimony about whether the Soccorso robbery occurred in late 1994 or late 1995, and the prosecution sought to establish that Finethy incurred his drug debt in 1994 as background for the alleged 1996 extortion. These exceptions were minor, however, and Paul A. points to no other instances of proffers of pre-1995 evidence. We again conclude that the overlap between the time periods is insubstantial. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Ciancaglini,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512590\"><a href=\"/opinion/512590/united-states-v-joseph-ciancaglini-aka-chickie/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></a></span>, 929 (3d Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> 1988) (finding distinct patterns of racketeering activity despite overlap of twenty-five months).</p>\n<p>Paul A. concedes that he is the only common defendant between the two indictments, but he argues that does not end the analysis of common participants. We need not address his premise, for in any event, the only common character Paul A. points to is Vincent Marino, a <i>Carrozza</i> defendant, who Paul A. argues is a missing link in the Silva murder. That connection is tenuous, and it does not even suggest that the two indictments charged the same pattern of racketeering activity. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Russotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424771\"><a href=\"/opinion/424771/united-states-v-samuel-j-russotti-rene-piccarreto-richard-j-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 33 (2d Cir.1983) (finding different patterns of racketeering activity even though two individuals were named in both indictments).</p>\n<p>Finally, Paul A. points to references in the <i>Carrozza</i> case to robberies of drug dealers in arguing that the two cases dealt with the same types of crime. First, the references in <i>Carrozza</i> are not new information, derived from the actual prosecution of this case, and thus would not affect the conclusion we reached in the interlocutory appeal. Second, the overlap of some types of crimes between two indictments does not necessarily mean the indictments charge the same pattern of racketeering activity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ruggiero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"447925\"><a href=\"/opinion/447925/united-states-v-benjamin-ruggiero-and-john-cerasani/\"><span class=\"volume\">754</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 933-34 (11th Cir.1985) (finding different patterns of racketeering activity even though both indictments charged crimes under the same gambling, drug, and robbery statutes). Third, the alleged overlap was minimal.</p>\n<p>We thus conclude again that, whether or not the same enterprise was involved, the indictments did charge and the government did try two different patterns of racketeering activity. Taken as a whole and based on the trial records, the <i>Carrozza</i> case \"focused on the systematic murder of rival mafia members ... to seize control of the Patriarca family,\" while this case focused on \"a more conventional collection of robberies and drug trafficking offenses, the single murder being merely a means of protecting the conspiracy from the police.\" <i>DeCologero,</i> 364 F.3d at 18-19. There has been no violation of Paul A.'s double jeopardy rights by his standing trial in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Ability To Present Defense</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. raises several arguments pertaining to his ability to present his defense theory in full. He claims that the district court curtailed the testimony of witnesses in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, that the court failed to compel the production of a witness in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, and that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence in contravention of its <i>Brady</i> duties and in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. These arguments all fall short.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Trial Management and Evidentiary Rulings</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A.'s primary defense was that Regan was aligned with the Salemme faction of the Patriarca Family and thus would not have been working with Paul A. if Paul A. was, as the government had previously alleged, aligned with the Carrozza faction. Paul A. complains that the trial judge curtailed his ability to present this defense by restricting his cross-examination of Regan and other witnesses and by cutting short his own testimony. He argues that these rulings violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to present his defense.</p>\n<p>\"Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the [Fifth] Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful opportunity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Crane v.

But the court did allow Regan to be questioned about the structure of the Patriarca family, his association with Frank Salemme Jr., and related issues despite continued objections by the prosecution. The limits which were placed on questioning were based on the judge's well-founded concerns about relevance and were within her discretion. The prohibited questions pertained primarily to events that occurred before 1995 and thus before the crimes alleged in the indictment. There was a risk of jury confusion from this line of questioning in an already complex and confusing case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199008\"><a href=\"/opinion/199008/united-states-v-gonzales-vasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2000) (\"The district court `retains wide latitude to impose reasonable limits' on cross-examination in order to avoid confusion of the issues or extended discussion of marginally relevant material.\" (quoting <i>United States v.

Regardless of what theory a defendant might wish to present, that does not entitle him to provide non-responsive (and provocative) answers, even to his own attorney's questions. In addition, much of the information pertinent to Paul A.'s defense came in through the cross-examination of Regan. Finally, Paul A. complains of the court's rulings on the inadmissibility of most testimony pertaining to the gym conversations, but we have already found those rulings not to be in error.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>Paul A. was able to present his defense, and the court did not abuse its discretion in restricting the admission of a fraction of his evidence. <i>Cf. </i><i>O'Brien v.

Gigi Portalla, was involved in the North burglary and in Silva's murder, a showing presumably meant to exonerate Paul A. He argues that the district court's refusal to expedite Marino's transport from a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania or to provide a continuance until Marino's presence could be secured deprived him of compulsory process under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Paul A. filed his motion for Marino's transport to testify on February 28, two days before the prosecution rested. The district court allowed the motion, but refused to order the U.S. Marshals to expedite their transport process or to provide extra funds to do so. Paul A. moved for a continuance, which the court also denied.</p>\n<p>If the court had denied Paul A.'s motion to transport Marino, our review would be for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

As the court <i>granted</i> the motion but simply refused to expedite the request, we see no reason why a more stringent standard of review should be used. Trial judges are best situated to weigh the competing demands of trial management  \"factors such as timeliness, materiality, relevancy, competency, practicality, and utility\"  and thus we accord the trial court's determinations in these areas \"considerable respect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1118.</p>\n<p>As the trial court noted, Paul A. submitted his request quite belatedly. There was no reason for that delay. Other circuits faced with similar circumstances have found no abuse of discretion. Where a defendant waited until seven business days before the trial started to request the production of an incarcerated witness, the Eighth Circuit concluded that, \"[i]n view of the modest benefit that [the] testimony might have offered, ... the district court correctly ruled that the countervailing public interests in the efficient administration of justice were sufficient reason to deny the motion for a continuance of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Sparkman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1193515\"><a href=\"/opinion/1193515/united-states-v-sparkman/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 683 (8th Cir.2007). The Eighth Circuit also found no abuse of discretion where the trial court denied a further continuance when the marshals could not locate witnesses subpoenaed at government expense (under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> Procedure 17(b)), given that the defendant had waited until the day before trial to request the subpoena. <i>United States v. DeCoteau,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390362\"><a href=\"/opinion/390362/united-states-v-leslie-ronald-decoteau/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span>, 1192-93 (8th Cir. 1981). As the Second Circuit succinctly stated, where the defendant had waited until two business days before the beginning of trial to request a continuance so that an incarcerated prisoner could be produced, \"any detriment suffered by [the defendant] resulted from his own dilatory conduct and not from the court's ruling.\" <i>United States v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"452071\"><a href=\"/opinion/452071/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-jerry-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">762</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 235 (2d Cir.1985). In all these cases, the defendants' efforts to secure the testimony of incarcerated witnesses were considered tardy even though they were made prior to the commencement of trial; Paul A. waited until the twenty-ninth day of trial to make his request. The comparison is not in his favor. Further, the proffered testimony of Marino was tangential and potentially cumulative. Any benefit of the testimony would have been slight.</p>\n<p>The Compulsory Process Clause is more a sword than a shield because \"[t]he decision whether to employ it in a particular case rests solely with the defendant.

Again, we review <i>Brady</i> determinations for abuse of discretion. <i>Caro-Muñiz,</i> 406 F.3d at 29. Paul A. repeatedly requested materials pertaining to investigations of Vincent Marino, specifically evidence linking Marino to Silva's death, but the prosecution opposed and the court denied the motions.</p>\n<p>The prosecution represented that it had disclosed all potentially exculpatory material.<sup>[22]</sup> Paul A. points to no specific materials or information he believes are in the prosecution's possession that would exculpate him. Without such a specific request, it is the prosecution \"that decides which information must be disclosed.

There was no abuse of discretion in crediting the prosecution's adamant assertion that it had no further material and exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Conflict of Interest</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. requests a new trial based on his trial attorney's alleged conflicts of interest and the trial court's unwillingness to hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter. We review this question de novo. <i>Reyes-Vejerano v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199779\"><a href=\"/opinion/199779/reyes-vejerano-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 97 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Paul A. alleges that his counsel, John Salsberg, suffered from two conflicts of interests: that his law partner previously represented Jon Minotti, a potential defense witness, and that his associate had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> previously worked for an attorney who had represented Vincent Marino in the <i>Carrozza</i> case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ramirez-Benitez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200005\"><a href=\"/opinion/200005/united-states-v-ramirez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2002) (\"Representation of co-indictees by members of the same law firm may create a conflict of interest similar to that when a single attorney represents two or more co-defendants.\"). Paul A. argues there was some evidence that Minotti had additional information about Silva's murder, owned some of the guns found in Silva's apartment, and had told an acquaintance that he had participated in the Stevens robbery. Salsberg's partner withdrew his representation of Minotti when Salsberg was appointed to represent Paul A. Salsberg's motion for a writ of habeas corpus to procure Minotti's testimony was denied because the court concluded that his testimony would be inadmissible. As for Marino, Paul A. does not describe what, if any, work Salsberg's associate might have done on Marino's case at his prior firm. The court did approve Salsberg's motion requesting Marino's transport from prison to testify but did not order the marshals to expedite the process; as a result, Marino never testified.</p>\n<p>Prior to jury impanelment, Paul A. filed a pro se motion requesting new counsel, but that motion and the in-court discussion it generated focused on whether Salsberg was prepared for trial. Towards the very end of the trial, Paul A. filed a series of pro se motions requesting new counsel; those motions focused on Salsberg's alleged conflicts of interest. The court summarily denied these later pro se motions.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Paul A. is mistaken as to the law: reversal is <i>not</i> automatic when a trial judge fails to conduct a proper inquiry into a potential conflict of interest. <i>See </i><i>Mickens v.

Here the defendant must demonstrate that his counsel's performance was affected by the conflict, but need not also establish that the difference in performance prejudiced him in the same sense as in an ineffective assistance claim. <i>Id.</i><sup>[24]</sup> Showing an adverse effect, however, still requires more than mere speculation, <i>id.</i> at 53; the defendant \"must show that [the attorney] might plausibly have pursued an alternative defense strategy, and that the alternative strategy was in conflict with, or may not have been pursued because of, [the attorney's] other loyalties or interests,\" <i>Ramirez-Benitez,</i> 292 F.3d at 30; <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

This Paul A. fails to do.</p>\n<p>Paul A. makes no viable argument as to what Salsberg might have done differently. He accuses Salsberg of not obtaining Minotti's testimony, but Salsberg did attempt to procure Minotti's testimony; that the court denied the request for evidentiary reasons is unrelated to the question of Salsberg's allegedly divided loyalties. As for Marino, Paul A. accuses Salsberg of not actively interviewing Marino or requesting his appearance in a timely manner. This, however, is not an accusation that Salsberg failed to pursue an alternative defense strategy, but that he did not pursue Paul A.'s desired strategy to Paul A.'s satisfaction. <i>Cf. </i><i>Lachman,</i> 521 F.3d at 21-22 (finding no conflict of interest where counsel did present defendant's desired defense theory).<sup>[25]</sup> Nor does Paul A. clarify how any inaction on Salsberg's part was in fact the manifestation of divided loyalties.<sup>[26]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>Burgos-Chaparro,</i> 309 F.3d at 53 (defendant must offer some showing that attorney's alleged shortcomings were in fact due to divided loyalties).</p>\n<p>There is thus no showing of an actual conflict of interest. This claim fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Pre-Indictment Delay</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Paul A. complains that the government could have brought the robbery- and drug-related charges in this case at the same time as the charges prosecuted in the <i>Carrozza</i> trial. He asserts that the failure to press these charges earlier was a tactical decision by the government and that he was prejudiced by having to mount a separate defense at the later <i>DeCologero</i> trial. We review the district court's refusal to dismiss the charges due to pre-indictment delay for abuse of discretion. <i>Muñoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 58. The court correctly determined there was no constitutional violation here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> Pre-indictment delay does not implicate the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial provision, but the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \"has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive [pre-indictment] delay.\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span> (1971)). The Due Process Clause has only a limited role in this context because the statutes of limitations provide the primary protection against undue pre-indictment delays. <i>Id.; </i><i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 25. To rise to the level of a due process violation despite the applicable statute of limitations not having run, the delay (1) must have \"caused substantial prejudice to [defendant's] rights to a fair trial\" and (2) \"was an intentional device\" used by the prosecution \"to gain tactical advantage over the accused.\" <i>Marion,</i> 404 U.S. at 324, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108420\"><a href=\"/opinion/108420/united-states-v-marion/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>; <i>see also </i><i>Soto-Beníquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 25. \"Substantial prejudice\" means more than inconvenience; it requires a showing of actual prejudice, and even the unavailability of witnesses or evidence might not be sufficient to meet this burden. <i>See </i><i>Muñoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 59.</p>\n<p>Paul A. argues that the separate trials prevented him from developing his defense  that Regan worked for Salemme and was framing Paul A. in the context of the war between the Carrozza and Salemme factions  in the second case. The exclusion of some evidence in the present trial did not cause Paul A. substantial prejudice, as he was still allowed to present his defense theory to the jury, even if not to the full extent he desired.</p>\n<p>There is also no evidence suggesting a prosecutorial purpose of obtaining tactical advantage as there is no evidence that the prosecution knew in 1997 what Paul A.'s defense would be in the present case.</p>\n<p>There is, on the other hand, a reasonable explanation for the prosecution's delay. As <i>Lovasco</i> makes clear, prosecutors retain discretion to delay charges until investigations are complete and all other considerations have been weighed. <i>Lovasco,</i> 431 U.S. at 790-91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109682\"><a href=\"/opinion/109682/united-states-v-lovasco/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2044</span></a></span>. Paul A. attempts to distinguish <i>Lovasco</i> by arguing that the delay here was not due to an ongoing investigation. First, ongoing investigations are not the only constitutionally acceptable explanations for pre-indictment delays. <i>See id.</i> at 792-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109682\"><a href=\"/opinion/109682/united-states-v-lovasco/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2044</span></a></span>. Second, Paul A. concedes that the investigation into Silva's murder was not completed at the time of the <i>Carrozza</i> trial. Contrary to Paul A.'s characterization, that crime was closely related to the other crimes charged in the present indictment: Silva's murder was an effort to avoid prosecution for and was thus part of the conspiracy to commit the robberies, drug dealing, and other crimes that Paul A. argues should have been prosecuted sooner. There was no unconstitutional pre-indictment delay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Denial of Continuances</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn to the final issue on appeal. After the court appointed Paul A. a new lawyer on September 23, 2004, it pushed the trial back from that week until January 9, 2006  a delay of fifteen months. Defense counsel requested a further six-month continuance in November 2005, which the court denied. On January 6, 2006, Paul A.'s attorney sought a one- or two-week continuance, which the court again denied. Paul A. argues on appeal that the court's refusal to grant these continuances violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p>We review for abuse of discretion a district court's denial of a motion for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> continuance. <i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 21-22. \"[B]road discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances; only an unreasoning and arbitrary `insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay' violates the right to assistance of counsel.\" <i>Morris v.

Instead, he argues in general terms that his counsel did not have enough time to prepare. This was a complex case with extensive discovery. However, counsel was given twice as long as Paul A.'s formal counsel had estimated would be necessary (even accounting for the new counsel's participation in another lengthy trial during those fifteen months). As the district court pointed out, conscientious lawyers will always feel that they could do more to prepare.

by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  There was conflicting testimony about the exact date of this criminal episode, but it appears to have occurred at some point in 1995.</p>\n<p>[3]  This is Regan's version of the order of events. Soccorso and Ramus testified that Paul A. was picked up after Ramus was forced into the car.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (\"Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined ... or imprisoned....\").</p>\n<p>[5]  DiCenso testified that all three men were inside North's apartment. Regan, however, testified that only he and DiCenso went inside the apartment. Paul J.'s father, John P. DeCologero, Sr., also testified that his son had told him that he had remained outside the apartment.</p>\n<p>[6]  DiCenso testified that other guns obtained in the North robbery included an AK-47 (assault rifle), an AR-15 (semi-automatic rifle), and a Desert Eagle (semi-automatic pistol), as well as some handguns. Regan put the number of weapons removed from the apartment, other than those in the safes, at six to eight rifles in addition to a box of hand grenades.</p>\n<p>[7]  On the government's motion, a seventh co-defendant, Daniel Tsoukalas, was severed from the case and tried separately.\n</p>\n<p>Shortly after Silva's murder, DiCenso and his friends overdosed on the heroin originally intended to kill Silva. Two of the friends died; DiCenso survived but suffered serious and permanent injuries. Once the government was able to prove DiCenso was still competent enough to stand trial, DiCenso agreed to plead guilty and testified at this trial through the use of special equipment.</p>\n<p>Regan also agreed to testify for the government as part of a plea agreement. Meuse hanged himself in 1997.</p>\n<p>[8]  The government asserts that John Jr. waived these arguments because his attempt to incorporate the arguments of his co-defendants under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(i) was insufficient. We do not reach this or other waiver questions as we do not find an abuse of discretion on the merits.</p>\n<p>[9]  Defendants also accuse the trial court of refusing to consider their motions for mistrial, and they cite to one instance where the judge denied a mistrial motion on the spot. This argument is off the mark: an instantaneous ruling does not mean that a judge has refused to exercise her discretion. A trial judge immersed in a case is quite capable of ruling on in-court motions quickly, even immediately.</p>\n<p>[10]  Paul A. also objects to the district court's hearsay rulings pertaining to these two conversations, and we incorporate his arguments here.</p>\n<p>[11]  It is also not immediately clear how the exclusion of this testimony, which was meant to further Paul A.'s defense, caused any harm to the other three defendants.</p>\n<p>[12]  For this reason, the gym conversations excluded on hearsay grounds could also not be used to attack the credibility of Regan or DiCenso: the conversations only bear on the witnesses' motive to lie if the content of those conversations is true.</p>\n<p>[13]  The court also did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was not material whether DiCenso's sister had told State Trooper Robert Irwin that she knew DiCenso was dating Silva, so it was not improper for the court to curtail the cross-examination of Irwin on this point. Defendants note additional instances of defense witnesses not being allowed to testify to conversations but do not explain why those conversations were relevant, how the court abused its discretion, or why they were prejudiced as a result. <i>See </i><i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>[14]  18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) provides that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person  (1) who has been convicted in any court of [] a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"</p>\n<p>[15]  This standard is unaffected by <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span> (1995), and <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span> (2000). <i>Capozzi I,</i> 347 F.3d at 336 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p>[16]  Thus, contrary to John Jr.'s assertion, under the depletion-of-the-assets theory the government did not have to provide specific proof that the stolen money was connected to Sapochetti's interstate commerce activity.</p>\n<p>[17]  We also see no error in the court's instructions. The court explained the Hobbs Act, including its jurisdictional element, clearly and at length; contrasted it to the state law crime of armed robbery; and explained that a Hobbs Act robbery constituted a violent federal crime under § 924(c). While the instructions were complicated, so was the case, and the jury had to assist it the redacted indictment and a chart of elements for each crime charged.</p>\n<p>[18]  The language in the 1995 Guidelines differs slightly but not in a material way. The older version of § 5G1.3(b) covered an \"undischarged term of imprisonment [that] resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense.\" Again, the alleged offense conduct covered by racketeering act 13 was not taken into account in the trial court's Guidelines determination.\n</p>\n<p>The parties also dispute whether that offense conduct, to which John Jr. pled guilty in 1997, was relevant conduct to the instant offense. We do not need to resolve that question.</p>\n<p>[19]  As relevant here, the Sixth Amendment protects the accused's right, in a criminal trial, \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him\" and \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI.</p>\n<p>[20]  Paul A. also complains of restrictions on his ability to present evidence that Regan was somehow involved in Silva's murder, but he does not specify any objectionable rulings. Regardless, the evidence in question is highly tangential and circumstantial; there would have been no abuse of discretion in its exclusion.</p>\n<p>[21]  Paul A. also alleges that the trial court curtailed his opening and closing arguments, but our review of the record revealed no basis for these allegations.</p>\n<p>[22]  This included alerting the defense in 2001 and 2002 that a witness (DiCenso) linked Marino to a gun deal gone bad and that a confidential informant had linked Marino to the guns being stored by Silva.</p>\n<p>[23]  Contrary to Paul A.'s assertions, nothing in <i>Mickens</i> suggests that the Court intended its holding to apply to only those cases in which the defendant did not raise a conflict of interest concern during the trial, nor does the automatic reversal rule of <i>Holloway v. Arkansas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109825\"><a href=\"/opinion/109825/holloway-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109825\"><a href=\"/opinion/109825/holloway-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109825\"><a href=\"/opinion/109825/holloway-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span> (1978)  which the <i>Mickens</i> Court cabined very narrowly  apply here where counsel did not himself object at trial. <i>See </i><i>Mickens,</i> 535 U.S. at 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span> (<i>Holloway'</i>s automatic reversal rule applies \"<i>only</i> where defense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless the trial court has determined that there is no conflict\" (emphasis added)). While Salsberg did raise other concerns before the trial court about his ability to represent Paul A., he never informed the court that he himself believed that he was unable to represent Paul A. due to a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>[24]  The Supreme Court in <i>Mickens</i> expressly did not reach the question of whether this \"actual conflict\" standard, requiring some showing of an actual adverse effect but not of prejudice, should apply to cases of successive representation, such as this one. <i>Mickens,</i> 535 U.S. at 176, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>. Like the <i>Mickens</i> Court, we reserve this question for another day and grant Paul A. the benefit of the assumption that the actual conflict standard is available to him; from the record before us, we doubt Paul A. could otherwise muster a showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p>[25]  Such allegations might instead go to the effectiveness of Salsberg's representation, but that tack would likely fail for lack of prejudice  required to establish an ineffectiveness of counsel claim  resulting from these alleged shortcomings.</p>\n<p>[26]  Paul A.'s argument that the failure of Tony Bucci to testify for the defense had anything to do with Salsberg's alleged conflicts of interest is simply not borne out by the record. The debate over Bucci's testimony revolved primarily around Bucci's Fifth Amendment rights; there is no indication that Salsberg tried to prevent Bucci from testifying due to the role of Minotti as a government witness in Bucci's concurrent criminal case.</p>\n<p>[27]  Paul A. also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a continuance on the first day of trial so he could seek advice on his lawyer's potential conflict of interest, <i>see supra.</i> This motion was untimely, especially as the question of his representation had been thoroughly canvassed in pre-trial motion practice. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 22. It was also, in the district court's view, a purely dilatory tactic.</p>\n<p>[28]  This RA charged a robbery of North prior to the October 1996 burglary of North's apartment.</p>\n\n</div>",
