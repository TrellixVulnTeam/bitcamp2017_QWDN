Victor Vega-Encarnación appeals\n\nfrom a district court order granting defendants' motion to dismiss\n\nhis civil rights complaint against eight federal officials.\n\n           According to Vega's complaint, on February 2, 2001,\n\nProbation Officers Babilonia and Encarnación-Canales telephoned\n\nVega and ordered him to report to the Probation Office in Hato Rey,\n\nPuerto Rico.   At the time, Vega was serving a five-year term of\n\nsupervised release.   When Vega arrived, he was arrested by Deputy\n\nMarshals Pérez and Zayas for violating unspecified terms of his\n\nsupervised release.   Pérez and Zayas seized from Vega a number of\n\npersonal items, including the keys to a Nissan Pathfinder, which\n\nVega had left parked across the street from a 7-11 Store on Chardon\n\nAvenue near the Probation Office.\n\n           Vega says in his complaint that he was allowed to call\n\nhis brother to arrange for the retrieval of his personal items and\n\nhis car.   According to Vega, he called his brother shortly after 3\n\np.m. in the presence of Encarnación, Babilonia, Pérez, and Zayas.\n\nHe told his brother where the car was parked and instructed him to\n\ncome to the Probation Office, recover the keys from Encarnación and\n\nBabilonia, and drive it back to Vega's house.   The defendants deny\n\nthat Vega successfully contacted his brother or anyone else to\n\narrange for the retrieval of the car.\n\n           Vega says in his complaint that his brother arrived at\n\nthe Probation Office at approximately 4:50 p.m. accompanied by a\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fparalegal who worked for Vega's attorney.   According to Vega, his\n\nbrother saw that the car was not where Vega had reported it to be,\n\nand he went into the Probation Office and asked to speak with the\n\nprobation officers, but was told they were unavailable.   Vega says\n\nthat a phone call by the paralegal to the Probation Office also\n\nproved futile. Defendants apparently deny that Vega's brother came\n\nto the Probation Office that day.\n\n           In all events, after arresting Vega, the marshals took\n\nVega to be booked and processed.       Then, Deputy U.S. Marshals\n\nEscobar and Pérez used the key seized from Vega to drive Vega's car\n\nto a secure lot.   There they conducted an inventory search of the\n\nvehicle.   Vega asserts that during the course of this search,\n\nEscobar and Pérez broke open Vega's locked briefcase and discovered\n\nwithin it $7,000 in loose cash and 32 pill-like tablets.       The\n\nmarshals reported their findings to AUSA Vázquez, who in turn\n\nrelayed the information to DEA agents González and Santiago.\n\nGonzález and Santiago then had a trained narcotics dog sniff the\n\ntablets, and the dog \"alerted positive.\"\n\n           Defendants admit that they seized the car and that they\n\nconducted an inventory search of it.    They claim that the search\n\nwas conducted in accordance with written U.S. Marshals Service\n\nguidelines.   Defendants say that they found the money and the\n\ntablets in the car; they do not say whether they broke open Vega's\n\nbriefcase during the search.\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f            DEA Agents González and Santiago then went before a\n\nmagistrate judge, seeking a search warrant for Vega's car.                    Vega\n\nalleges that González and Santiago deliberately omitted from their\n\nwarrant application the fact that the car had already been subject\n\nto an inventory search, which had turned up incriminating evidence.\n\nDefendants admit applying for the search warrant, but do not say\n\nwhether    the   inventory   search      results    were     omitted   from    the\n\napplication. The magistrate judge issued the warrant, and González\n\nand Santiago seized the cash and the tablets, which turned out to\n\nbe the illegal drug known as Ecstasy.\n\n            On February 27, 2002, Vega (now in jail) filed a pro se\n\ncivil action against Probation Officers Babilonia and Encarnación,\n\nDeputy U.S. Marshals Pérez and Zayas, and DEA agents González and\n\nSantiago in the federal district court in Puerto Rico.                         The\n\ncomplaint sought compensatory and punitive damages for violations\n\nof Vega's Fourth Amendment rights. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named\n\nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).                      Vega\n\nlater amended his complaint to add as defendants AUSA Vázquez and\n\nDeputy    U.S.   Marshal   Escobar.         The   defendants    answered,      and\n\nthereafter moved to dismiss Vega's amended complaint for, inter\n\nalia, failure to state a claim and lack of personal jurisdiction\n\nover AUSA Vázquez due to insufficient service of process.\n\n            On   October   28,   2002,    the     district   court,    believing\n\ndefendants' motion to be unopposed, granted it and entered judgment\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\ffor the defendants.     Vega's motion to extend the filing deadline\n\nfor his response to defendants' motion arrived the same day as the\n\nentry of judgment, but the district court ruled that it was moot.\n\nAfter filing two post-judgment motions, which were both denied,\n\nVega filed this appeal.\n\n            In reviewing the district court's brief, one-page order,\n\nwe are uncertain of the basis for dismissal. In substance, it says\n\nonly that \"[a]bsent opposition, and it appearing that dismissal of\n\nthe complaint is warranted due to plaintiff's failure to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief can be granted, ... Defendants' Motion to\n\nDismiss ... is hereby GRANTED.\"\n\n            Possibly dismissal was granted because Vega failed to\n\nfile timely opposition.      In the district court in Puerto Rico,\n\nfailure to respond to a motion \"renders a party susceptible to\n\ninvoluntary    dismissal,    pursuant   to   [Federal   Rule   of   Civil\n\nProcedure] 41(b), for failure to prosecute.\" Negron-Gaztambide v.\n\nHernandez-Torres, 35 F.3d 25, 26 n.4 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing Local\n\nRule 313.3 (D.P.R.)).     In this case, our own review of the record\n\nsuggests that, even under the prisoner mail-box rule, Morales-\n\nRivera v. United States, 184 F.3d 109, 110-11 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nVega's motion to enlarge the time for his response was late by\n\napproximately one week.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a); Local Rule 311.5\n\n(D.P.R.).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f           Nevertheless, Vega's tardiness does not automatically\n\nresult in dismissal,     Nepsk, Inc. v. Town of Houlton, 283 F.3d 1,\n\n7 (1st Cir. 2002), and the district court does not mention failure\n\nto prosecute or Local Rules 311.5 and 313.3.          Given that Vega was\n\na prisoner proceeding pro se at the time the district court entered\n\nits decision,   we    are   doubtful   that     dismissal    was   imposed   as\n\npunishment for a missed deadline, cf. Bachier-Ortiz v. Colon-\n\nMendoza, 331 F.3d 193, 195 (1st Cir. 2003) (generally reserving the\n\nsanction of dismissal for lack of prosecution to situations where\n\nplaintiff's   misconduct     is     \"serious,    repeated,     contumacious,\n\nextreme, or otherwise inexcusable\").\n\n           Another possible reading of the district court's order is\n\nthat,   \"[a]bsent    opposition,\"    the   district   court     accepted     the\n\ndescription of events in defendants' motion to dismiss as accurate.\n\nIf the defendants' version of events is accepted, then their\n\ndecision to impound the car almost certainly falls within the\n\ncommunity caretaking exception to the warrant requirement, with the\n\nresult that Vega's complaint probably does fail to state a claim\n\nupon which relief can be granted.          See Colorado v. Bertine, 479\n\nU.S. 367, 369, 371, 375-76 (1987); United States v. Ramos-Morales,\n\n981 F.2d 625, 626-27 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           The problem is that when deciding a motion to dismiss on\n\nthe merits, a district court is obliged to accept the factual\n\nallegations contained in the complaint as true.             Martin v. Applied\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fCellular Tech., 284 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2002). If the merits are\n\nat issue, the mere fact that a motion to dismiss is unopposed does\n\nnot relieve the district court of the obligation to examine the\n\ncomplaint itself to see whether it is formally sufficient to state\n\na claim.   See Pinto v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, 895 F.2d 18, 19\n\n& n.1 (1st Cir. 1990); see also McCall v. Pataki, 232 F.3d 321,\n\n322-23 (2d Cir. 2000). Thus, the defendants' version of events, as\n\nyet untested, is not itself a basis for finding that Vega \"fail[ed]\n\nto state a claim . . . .\"\n\n           There may be some other basis for concluding that the\n\ncomplaint failed to state a claim. For example, under Bertine, law\n\nenforcement officials are not required to give arrestees the\n\nopportunity to make arrangements for their vehicles when deciding\n\nwhether impoundment is appropriate.    479 U.S. at 373-74.   But law\n\nenforcement officials are required to have a non-investigatory\n\nreason for seizing an arrestee's car in the first place.     Id. at\n\n375-76. Case law supports the view that where a driver is arrested\n\nand there is no one immediately on hand to take possession, the\n\nofficials have a legitimate non-investigatory reason for impounding\n\nthe car.   Cf. Ramos-Morales, 981 F.2d at 626-27 (to protect it from\n\nvandalism).\n\n           Whether this reasoning works where, as here, Vega was\n\nallowed to call his brother to pick up the car, is an issue that\n\nmight be debated.   Of course, on the defendants' version of events\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fno such successful call was made; but we have to suppose for\n\npresent purposes that Vega's version is true.               And, as the legal\n\nquestion is somewhat unusual and certainly has not been explicitly\n\ndecided by the district court or briefed in this court, it hardly\n\nmakes sense for us to address it in the first instance.                   Indeed,\n\nthe district court's dismissal for failure to state a claim may\n\nrest upon some other basis.\n\n             Under the circumstances, we think that the appropriate\n\nsolution is to vacate the district court's order and to remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.       The district court is free to reinstate its\n\norder, so long as it provides a basis for concluding that no claim\n\nhas been stated, and that order will in turn be subject to review\n\non   appeal    if   Vega     chooses    to   file    one.    Or,    on    further\n\nconsideration, the district court is free to deny the motion to\n\ndismiss and conduct further appropriate proceedings.\n\n             A couple of other points deserve mention.             First, Vega's\n\nBivens claim had two other aspects: one that the inventory search\n\nof   the   briefcase   was   unlawful    even   if   the    car    was   properly\n\nimpounded and the other that the warrant was defective because it\n\nwas procured without adequate disclosure.            The first of these two\n\nvariations     is   uncertain--the       marshals     apparently         rely   on\n\nguidelines, cf. Florida v. Wells, 495 U.S. 1, 4-5 (1990), whose\n\ncontents are not part of the record; and the second is quite\n\ndoubtful since the other evidence in the application was arguably\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fsufficient.   See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 156 (1978).             But\n\nthese are matters that should be sorted out on remand and not made\n\nthe subject of piece-meal review.\n\n           In addition, on appeal, the defendants say that the\n\nstatute of limitations on Vega's claim had run and, although not\n\nasserted   below   as   a   ground   for   the   dismissal,   the   issue    is\n\njurisdictional.     It is not: the statute of limitations as to a\n\nBivens action against individual officers is simply an affirmative\n\ndefense and does not affect a court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nSee Roberts v. College of the Desert, 870 F.2d 1411, 1414 (9th Cir.\n\n1989); Paetz v. United States, 795 F.2d 1533, 1536 (11th Cir.\n\n1986).   The limitations defense--although adequately preserved by\n\nthe answer to the complaint--is a matter complicated by prior\n\nattempts to file the complaint and should be addressed in the first\n\ninstance in the district court.\n\n           We remand as well the dismissal as to defendant Vázquez\n\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction due to insufficient service of\n\nprocess.   So far as we can tell from the record, the defendants'\n\nanswer filed prior to the motion to dismiss did not plead lack of\n\npersonal jurisdiction or insufficiency of service of process.                If\n\nthis is the case, the defense is waived.         Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1);\n\nGlater v. Eli Lilly & Co., 712 F.2d 735, 738 (1st Cir. 1983).               If\n\nthere is more to say about this matter, Vázquez is free to renew\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fhis motion on remand; but as presently advised, we are not prepared\n\nseparately to affirm on this issue.\n\n          The judgment of dismissal is vacated and the matter is\n\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

In the district court in Puerto Rico, failure to respond to a motion \"renders a party susceptible to involuntary dismissal, pursuant to [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 41(b), for failure to prosecute.\" <i>Negron-Gaztambide v. Hernandez-Torres,</i> 35 F.3d 25, 26 n. 4 (1st Cir.1994) (citing Local Rule 313.3 (D.P.R.)). In this case, our own review of the record suggests that, even under the prisoner mail-box rule, <i>Morales-Rivera v. United States,</i> 184 F.3d 109, 110-11 (1st Cir.1999), Vega's motion to enlarge the time for his response was late by approximately one week. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a); Local Rule 311.5 (D.P.R.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Vega's tardiness does not <i>automatically</i> result in dismissal, <i>NEPSK, Inc. v. Town of Houlton,</i> 283 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2002), and the district court does not mention failure to prosecute or Local Rules 311.5 and 313.3. Given that Vega was a prisoner proceeding pro se at the time the district court entered its decision, we are doubtful that dismissal was imposed as punishment for a missed deadline, <i>cf. Bachier-Ortiz v. Colon-Mendoza,</i> 331 F.3d 193, 195 (1st Cir.2003) (generally reserving the sanction of dismissal for lack of prosecution to situations where plaintiff's misconduct is \"serious, repeated, contumacious, extreme, or otherwise inexcusable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another possible reading of the district court's order is that, \"[a]bsent opposition,\" the district court accepted the description of events in defendants' motion to dismiss as accurate. If the defendants' version of events is accepted, then their decision to impound the car almost certainly falls within the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement, with the result that Vega's complaint probably does fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <i>See Colorado v. Bertine,</i> 479 U.S. 367, 369, 371, 375-76, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987); <i>United States v.

Applied Cellular Tech.,</i> 284 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2002). If the merits are at issue, the mere fact that a motion to dismiss is unopposed does not relieve the district court of the obligation to examine the complaint itself to see whether it is formally sufficient to state a claim. <i>See Pinto v. Universidad De Puerto Rico,</i> 895 F.2d 18, 19 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also McCall v. Pataki,</i> 232 F.3d 321, 322-23 (2d Cir.2000). Thus, the defendants' version of events, as yet untested, is not itself a basis for finding that Vega \"fail[ed] to state a claim....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may be some other basis for concluding that the complaint failed to state a claim. For example, under <i>Bertine,</i> law enforcement officials are not required to give arrestees the opportunity to make arrangements for their vehicles when deciding whether impoundment is appropriate. 479 U.S. at 373-74, 107 S.Ct. 738. But law enforcement officials <i>are</i> required to have a non-investigatory reason for seizing an arrestee's car in the first place. <i>Id.</i> at 375-76, 107 S.Ct. 738. Case law supports the view that where a driver is arrested and there is no one <i>immediately</i> on hand to take possession, the officials have a legitimate non-investigatory reason for impounding the car. <i>Cf. Ramos-Morales,</i> 981 F.2d at 626-27 (to protect it from vandalism).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this reasoning works where, as here, Vega was allowed to call his brother to pick up the car, is an issue that might be debated. Of course, on the defendants' version of events no such successful call was made; but we have to suppose for present purposes that Vega's version is true. And, as the legal question is somewhat unusual and certainly has not been explicitly decided by the district court or briefed in this court, it hardly makes sense for us to address it in the first instance. Indeed, the district court's dismissal for failure to state a claim may rest upon some other basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances, we think that the appropriate solution is to vacate the district court's order and to remand for further proceedings. The district court is free to reinstate its order, so long as it provides a basis for concluding that no claim has been stated, and that order will in turn be subject to review on appeal if Vega chooses to file one. Or, on further consideration, the district court is free to deny the motion to dismiss and conduct further appropriate proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A couple of other points deserve mention. First, Vega's <i>Bivens</i> claim had two other aspects: one that the inventory search of the briefcase was unlawful even if the car was properly impounded and the other that the warrant was defective because it was procured without adequate disclosure. The first of these two variations is uncertain &#8212; the marshals apparently rely on guidelines, <i>cf. Florida v. Wells,</i> 495 U.S. 1, 4-5, 110 S.Ct. 1632, 109 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990), whose contents are not part of the record; and the second is quite doubtful since the other evidence in the application was arguably sufficient. <i>See Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). But these are matters that should be sorted out on remand and not made the subject of piece-meal review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, on appeal, the defendants say that the statute of limitations on Vega's claim had run and, although not asserted below as a ground for the dismissal, the issue is jurisdictional. It is not: the statute of limitations as to a <i>Bivens</i> action against individual officers is simply an affirmative defense and does not affect a court's subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Roberts v. College of the Desert,</i> 870 F.2d 1411, 1414 (9th Cir.1988); <i>Paetz v. United States,</i> 795 F.2d 1533, 1536 (11th Cir.1986). The limitations defense &#8212; although adequately preserved by the answer to the complaint &#8212; is a matter complicated by prior attempts to file the complaint and should be addressed in the first instance in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remand as well the dismissal as to defendant V&#225;zquez for lack of personal jurisdiction due to insufficient service of process. So far as we can tell from the record, the defendants' answer filed prior to the motion to dismiss did not plead lack of personal jurisdiction or insufficiency of service of process. If this is the case, the defense is waived. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(1); <i>Glater v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.,</i> 712 F.2d 735, 738 (1st Cir.1983). If there is more to say about this matter, V&#225;zquez is free to renew his motion on remand; but as presently advised, we are not prepared separately to affirm on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of dismissal is <i>vacated</i> and the matter is <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",

At the time, Vega was serving a five-year term of supervised release. When Vega arrived, he was arrested by Deputy Marshals P&#233;rez and Zayas for violating unspecified terms of his supervised release. P&#233;rez and Zayas seized from Vega a number of personal items, including the keys to a Nissan Pathfinder, which Vega had left parked across the street from a 7-11 Store on Chardon Avenue near the Probation Office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vega says in his complaint that he was allowed to call his brother to arrange for the retrieval of his personal items and his car. According to Vega, he called his brother shortly after 3 p.m. in the presence of Encarnaci&#243;n, Babilonia, P&#233;rez, and Zayas. He told his brother where the car was parked and instructed him to come to the Probation Office, recover the keys from Encarnaci&#243;n and Babilonia, and drive it back to Vega's house. The defendants deny that Vega successfully contacted his brother or anyone else to arrange for the retrieval of the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vega says in his complaint that his brother arrived at the Probation Office at approximately 4:50 p.m. accompanied by a paralegal who worked for Vega's attorney. According to Vega, his brother saw that the car was not where Vega had reported it to be, and he went into the Probation Office and asked to speak with the probation officers, but was told they were unavailable. Vega says that a phone call by the paralegal to the Probation Office also proved futile. Defendants apparently deny that Vega's brother came to the Probation Office that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, after arresting Vega, the marshals took Vega to be booked and processed. Then, Deputy U.S. Marshals Escobar and P&#233;rez used the key seized from Vega to drive Vega's car to a secure lot. There they conducted an inventory search of the vehicle. Vega asserts that during the course of this search, Escobar and P&#233;rez broke open Vega's locked briefcase and discovered within it $7,000 in loose cash and 32 pill-like tablets. The marshals reported their findings to AUSA V&#225;zquez, who in turn relayed the information to DEA agents Gonz&#225;lez and Santiago. Gonz&#225;lez and Santiago then had a trained narcotics dog sniff the tablets, and the dog \"alerted positive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants admit that they seized the car and that they conducted an inventory search of it. They claim that the search was conducted in accordance with written U.S. Marshals Service guidelines. Defendants say that they found the money and the tablets in the car; they do not say whether they broke open Vega's briefcase during the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEA Agents Gonz&#225;lez and Santiago then went before a magistrate judge, seeking a search warrant for Vega's car. Vega alleges that Gonz&#225;lez and Santiago deliberately omitted from their warrant application the fact that the car had already been subject to an inventory search, which had turned up incriminating evidence. Defendants admit applying for the search warrant, but do not say whether the inventory search results were omitted from the application. The magistrate judge issued the warrant, and Gonz&#225;lez and Santiago seized the cash and the tablets, which turned out to be the illegal drug known as Ecstasy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 2002, Vega (now in jail) filed a pro se civil action against Probation Officers Babilonia and Encarnaci&#243;n, Deputy U.S. Marshals P&#233;rez and Zayas, and DEA agents Gonz&#225;lez and Santiago in the federal district court in Puerto Rico. The complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages for violations of Vega's Fourth Amendment rights. <i>See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed.

The defendants answered, and thereafter moved to dismiss Vega's amended complaint for, <i>inter alia,</i> failure to state a claim and lack of personal jurisdiction over AUSA V&#225;zquez due to insufficient service of process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 28, 2002, the district court, believing defendants' motion to be unopposed, granted it and entered judgment for the defendants. Vega's motion to extend the filing deadline for his response to defendants' motion arrived the same day as the entry of judgment, but the district court ruled that it was moot.

Wells,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112412\"><a href=\"/opinion/112412/florida-v-wells/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112412\"><a href=\"/opinion/112412/florida-v-wells/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1632</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112412\"><a href=\"/opinion/112412/florida-v-wells/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1990), whose contents are not part of the record; and the second is quite doubtful since the other evidence in the application was arguably sufficient. <i>See Franks v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 156, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2674</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span> (1978). But these are matters that should be sorted out on remand and not made the subject of piece-meal review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, on appeal, the defendants say that the statute of limitations on Vega's claim had run and, although not asserted below as a ground for the dismissal, the issue is jurisdictional. It is not: the statute of limitations as to a <i>Bivens</i> action against individual officers is simply an affirmative defense and does not affect a court's subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Roberts v. College of the Desert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520377\"><a href=\"/opinion/520377/coleen-r-roberts-v-college-of-the-desert-ca-patterson-and-fern-stout/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1411</span></a></span>, 1414 (9th Cir.1988); <i>Paetz v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473673\"><a href=\"/opinion/473673/41-fair-emplpraccas-1682-41-empl-prac-dec-p-36590-robert-paetz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1533</span></a></span>, 1536 (11th Cir.1986). The limitations defense &#8212; although adequately preserved by the answer to the complaint &#8212; is a matter complicated by prior attempts to file the complaint and should be addressed in the first instance in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remand as well the dismissal as to defendant V&#225;zquez for lack of personal jurisdiction due to insufficient service of process. So far as we can tell from the record, the defendants' answer filed prior to the motion to dismiss did not plead lack of personal jurisdiction or insufficiency of service of process. If this is the case, the defense is waived. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(1); <i>Glater v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421811\"><a href=\"/opinion/421811/cathy-ann-glater-v-eli-lilly-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, 738 (1st Cir.1983). If there is more to say about this matter, V&#225;zquez is free to renew his motion on remand; but as presently advised, we are not prepared separately to affirm on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of dismissal is <i>vacated</i> and the matter is <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
