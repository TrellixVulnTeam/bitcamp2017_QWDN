George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Martin F. Murphy, with whom Foley Hoag LLP was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Randall E. Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 11, 2006\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge. A jury convicted Kurt Roberson of\n\nselling more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and of using or carrying a firearm\n\nduring and in relation to that transaction, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A). The district court sentenced Roberson to 300 months'\n\nimprisonment.      Roberson's appeal challenges his convictions and\n\nsentence on several grounds.         We affirm.\n                                         I.\n\n            The    Federal      Bureau    of   Investigation     (FBI)         began\n\ninvestigating      Roberson     in   early     2003.   As      part       of    that\n\ninvestigation, FBI agents engaged the services of a cooperating\n\nwitness, Eric Mena, who had known Roberson for eight years and had\n\nformerly been a drug dealing associate of Roberson's.                Mena agreed\n\nto make a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from Roberson as\npart of a plea bargain resolving drug charges against him.\n\n            On March 10 of that year, FBI agent Edward Kappler\n\noutfitted   Mena    with   an    electronic    transmitter     and    a    digital\n\nrecorder to enable the FBI to monitor Mena's conversations with\nRoberson.    Mena then went to the home of Raymond Muse, a mutual\n\nassociate of Roberson and Mena, and informed him that he wanted to\n\nbuy some crack from Roberson.        Muse brought Mena to where Roberson\n\nwas currently staying.          After Roberson entered Mena's car, Mena\n\ntold him that he needed two ounces of crack.            Roberson agreed to\n\nprovide the drugs the next evening and told Mena that he should\n\ncall to initiate the pickup.\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f           While Mena was saving Roberson's phone number on his\n\nmobile phone, Roberson spontaneously stated, \"Yo, you got any\n\nburners?   I can trade you a burner.\"         Mena testified at trial that\n\n\"burner\" meant handgun, and that he understood Roberson's statement\n\nto be an offer to sell him a gun.         Roberson described the gun as \"a\n\nbrand new, 40 cal.\" that was \"like a Glock, top is chrome.                   The\n\nrest is plastic.\"        Mena was noncommittal as to that offer but\n\nconfirmed that he would meet with Roberson the next day.\n\n           The following evening, Mena, who was again outfitted with\na   transmitter    and   an     audio    recorder,    tried    several    times,\n\nunsuccessfully, to reach Roberson on his mobile phone.                   The FBI\n\ndirected Mena to drive to Muse's house again.              Rather than using\n\nhis own car, however, Mena drove an undercover car that the FBI had\n\nequipped   with    a   hidden    video    camera.      After   Muse   and   Mena\nsuccessfully contacted Roberson, Muse directed Mena to an apartment\n\ncomplex in a nearby town.        Mena drove the undercover car with Muse\n\nas his passenger.\n\n           After they arrived at the apartment complex, Muse located\n\nRoberson and brought him to Mena's car.             Roberson sat in the front\n\npassenger seat next to Mena, while Muse sat in the back.                 Roberson\n\ntold Mena, \"I got your sixty grams,\" and then told him it would\n\ncost $2,000.      As Mena was counting out his money, Roberson looked\n\nout the back window and stated, \"I got the rap on me so I'm shook\n\nanyway.\" Mena testified at trial that this meant that Roberson was\n\nparanoid because he had a handgun on him.               Roberson then handed\n\nMena a sandwich bag containing crack.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            As Mena inspected the crack, Roberson pulled a handgun\n\nout of his waistband, pointed it in Mena's direction, and stated,\n\n\"That's what I'm talking about man.\"     Mena told Roberson not to\n\npoint the gun at him and asked to see it.   Roberson handed the gun\n\nto Mena, who looked at it and smelled it to see if it had been\n\nfired.     Mena found the design of the gun to be consistent with a\n\n\"Glock\" in that the top was chrome and the bottom was plastic.\n\nMena asked Roberson why he wanted to get rid of the handgun and\n\nRoberson replied that the serial numbers had been scratched off.\nWhen Mena asked whether the gun had been fired yet, Roberson\n\nreplied, \"Nah, I don't waste shells, man.   I shoot niggas though.\"\n\nMena handed the gun back to Roberson, and they completed the drug\n\ntransaction.\n\n            Mena then asked Roberson if he would be interested in\nbuying Mena's car.     Mena initiated this conversation outside the\n\ncar so that FBI agents would have an opportunity to observe\n\nRoberson directly.     As a result, agent Timothy Quinn, who was\n\nconducting physical and audio surveillance nearby, was able to\n\ndrive within 12 feet of Mena and Roberson as they looked over the\n\nvehicle.    Roberson then went back into the apartment complex.\n\n            Later that month, a federal grand jury returned a two\n\ncount indictment charging Roberson of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute and distribution of more than 50 grams of cocaine base,1\n\n\n\n     1\n      The term \"cocaine base,\" includes, inter alia, \"crack\ncocaine.\" United States v. Anderson, --- F.3d ---, No. 05-1872,\n2006 WL 1766704, at *20 (1st Cir. June 29, 2006).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fin violation of the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"), see 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (the \"drug charge\"), and\n\nof using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug\n\ntrafficking   offense,   see   18    U.S.C.   §    924(c)(1)(A)    (the   \"gun\n\ncharge\").     The   government      subsequently    filed   an    information\n\npursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851 providing notice of its intent to seek\n\nincreased punishment -- the doubling of the drug charge's mandatory\n\nminimum sentence from 10 to 20 years -- by reason of a prior\n\nconviction. After a five-day trial, including testimony from Mena,\nKappler and Quinn, a jury convicted Roberson on both counts.\n\n            Roberson moved for a judgment of acquittal both during\n\ntrial and after the verdict.        See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a), (c).        He\n\nargued that there was insufficient evidence establishing that he\n\nhad possessed crack or had sold more than 50 grams of crack.               He\nalso argued that the government had not presented sufficient\n\nevidence to prove that he had carried or used a \"firearm,\" as that\n\nterm is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3), or that he had carried or\n\nused a firearm \"during and in relation to\" the drug transaction.\n\nFinally, he argued that, because the government had not offered any\n\nevidence establishing his prior conviction, the district court\n\ncould not impose an increased penalty for the drug conviction. The\n\ncourt denied Roberson's motions in all respects.\n\n            At sentencing, the district court found that the 20-year\n\nmandatory minimum applied to the drug charge, see 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(A)(iii), and a 5-year consecutive mandatory minimum applied\n\nto the gun charge, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). After determining\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthat the Sentencing Guidelines advised a sentencing range of 35\n\nyears to life, and considering the sentencing factors set forth in\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the court imposed a sentence of 25 years in\n\nprison, the statutory minimum sentence.\n\n              Roberson now appeals the district court's order denying\n\nhis motion for judgment of acquittal on the gun charge, arguing\n\nthat the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove\n\neither that he carried          an actual \"firearm\" or that he carried a\n\nfirearm      \"in   relation    to\"   a    drug   trafficking    offense.     He\nalternatively requests a new trial on the gun charge on the ground\n\nthat the court erroneously instructed the jury concerning the \"in\n\nrelation to\" requirement, and a new trial on both charges on the\n\nbasis of improperly admitted testimony.              Finally, Roberson argues\n\nthat   the    applicable      mandatory    minimum   sentence   for   the   drug\nconviction is ten years, not 20 years.\n\n                                         II.\n\n              A.      The gun charge\n\n              Roberson challenges the consecutive five-year mandatory\nminimum sentence he received for using or carrying a firearm\n\n\"during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense\" on several\n\ngrounds.      18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).           We begin with Roberson's\n\ncontention that the district court incorrectly instructed on the\n\n\"in relation to\" requirement, and compounded the error by simply\n\nrestating the same erroneous instruction when the jury sought\n\nclarification.\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f           At trial, both Roberson and the government submitted\n\nproposed   jury   instructions      addressing    the    gun   charge.       The\n\ngovernment proposed the First Circuit pattern jury instruction,\n\nwhich provides, in relevant part:\n\n           To \"carry\" a firearm during and in relation to\n           a crime means to move or transport the firearm\n           on one's person or in a vehicle or container\n           during and in relation to the crime. It need\n           not be immediately accessible.     To \"use\" a\n           firearm during and in relation to a crime\n           means to employ the firearm actively, such as\n           to brandish, display, barter, strike with,\n           fire or attempt to fire it, or even to refer\n           to it in a way calculated to affect the\n           underlying crime.     The firearm must have\n           played a role in the crime or must have been\n           intended by the defendant to play a role in\n           the crime. That need not have been its sole\n           purpose, however.\n\nSee First Circuit Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions § 4.07 (1998).\n\nThe   pattern   instruction   purposefully       declines      to   define   \"in\nrelation to\" separately from the terms \"carry\" and \"use.\"              See id.\n\n§ 4.07 cmt. 3 (\"It seems best not to define 'use or carry'\n\nseparately   from   'during   and    in    relation     to.'\").2     Roberson,\n\nhowever, drawing on language from Smith v. United States, 508 U.S.\n\n223 (1993), proposed that a paragraph be added to directly address\n\nthis requirement.   The court agreed to instruct the jury on the \"in\n\nrelation to\" element, but declined to adopt Roberson's proposal\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      Although Roberson does not challenge the pattern instruction\nitself, we pause to note that the pattern instructions are not\nmandatory nor has this court approved the use of any particular\ninstruction. See United States v. Tse, 375 F.3d 148, 157-58 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwholesale.      Instead, it crafted its own instruction based on\n\nlanguage from Smith:\n\n           The words \"during and in relation to\" are to\n           be given their plain and customary meaning.\n           The phrase \"in relation to\" is expansive. At\n           a minimum it means that the firearm must have\n           had some purpose or effect with respect to the\n           drug trafficking crime.      If a firearm is\n           present simply as a result of coincidence or\n           accident it cannot be said that it was used or\n           carried in relation to the drug traffic[king]\n           offense. The firearm must have facilitated or\n           have had the potential to facilitate the drug\n           offense.\n           During a pre-charge conference, Roberson objected to the\n\nstatement \"the phrase 'in relation to' is expansive.\"           He argued\n\nthat the word \"expansive\" erroneously implied that the phrase \"in\n\nrelation to\" was intended to expand, rather than limit, the phrase\n\n\"used or carried.\"      The district court denied the objection and\ndelivered the pattern jury instruction along with the \"in relation\n\nto\" insert that it had crafted.      After the charge, Roberson failed\n\nto renew his objection, and the jury retired to deliberate.\n\n           During the first full day of deliberations, the jury\n\nsubmitted a note asking: \"Does carrying a firearm during but\n\nindependent of a drug transaction constitute the use of a firearm\n\nin   relation   to   drug   trafficking?\"   Contending   that   the   word\n\n\"independent\" means the opposite of \"in relation to,\" Roberson\n\nrequested the court to directly answer the jury's question in the\n\nnegative. The court, however, agreed with the government that such\n\nan instruction would risk providing the jury with a decisive\n\nconclusion.     The court therefore elected to simply re-read the gun\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fcharge instruction in the hope that hearing the instruction again\n\nwould help the jury resolve the question internally.              Before the\n\ncourt   summoned   the    jury,   Roberson   again     objected    that   the\n\ninstruction was erroneous insofar as it stated that \"in relation\n\nto\" is \"expansive.\"      After the re-reading of the instruction, the\n\njury returned its verdicts later that day without additional\n\ninquiry.\n\n           To preserve an objection to a jury instruction under Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 30(d), a litigant must lodge a specific objection and\nstate the grounds for the objection after the court has charged the\n\njury and before the jury begins deliberations.          See United States\n\nv. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 13 & n.7 (1st Cir. 2004).                   Objections\n\nregistered during pre-charge hearings are insufficient to preserve\n\nthe issue.     See id.   We review such unpreserved jury instruction\nclaims for plain error only.      See id.\n\n           Roberson seeks a more favorable standard of review by\n\narguing that his second objection to the \"expansive\" instruction\n\npreserved the issue because it was made after the court's original\n\ncharge to the jury on the gun charge and before the jury retired to\n\ndeliberate following the court's re-reading of the gun charge\n\ninstruction.       Roberson   contends    that   the    second     objection\n\neffectively served Rule 30(d)'s purpose \"to bring to the attention\n\nof the trial court errors or omissions in its charge so that they\n\nmay be corrected before the case goes to the jury.\"          United States\n\nv. Sturm, 870 F.2d 769, 775-76 (1st Cir. 1989).          But the case had\n\nalready gone to the jury. Roberson's renewed objection, registered\n\n                                    -9-\n\fafter the jury had begun its deliberations, came too late to\n\nsatisfy Rule 30(d).          See United States v. Santana-Rosa, 132 F.3d\n\n860, 863 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[A] party waives any objection it\n\nmight have to a jury instruction by failing to enter that objection\n\ninto the record immediately after the judge has instructed the jury\n\nand before the jury begins deliberations.\") (Emphasis added).3                   We\n\ntherefore review the instruction for plain error, under which\n\nRoberson \"must demonstrate: (1) that an error occurred (2) which\n\nwas    clear    or    obvious     and   which   not    only   (3)   affected    the\ndefendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nMoran, 393 F.3d at 13 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n               Roberson     cannot   meet   this     stringent   standard.      The\n\ndistrict court took the language \"[t]he phrase 'in relation to' is\nexpansive\" directly from the majority opinion in Smith.                   See 508\n\nU.S. at 237.         Roberson makes no argument that Smith is no longer\n\ngood   law     or    has   been   undermined    by    subsequent    Supreme   Court\n\nprecedent. Indeed, federal appellate courts continue to cite Smith\n\nfor the proposition that \"in relation to\" is \"expansive.\"                      See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Brown, 400 F.3d 1242, 1250 (10th Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Williams, 344 F.3d 365, 371 (3d Cir. 2003); McNeal\n\nv. United States, 249 F.3d 747, 750 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       Even were we to accept the premise that the re-reading of an\ninstruction could present a fresh opportunity for a litigant to\nobject to the instruction, we note that Roberson again failed to\nlodge the objection after the court re-read the charge to the jury.\n\n                                         -10-\n\f              Moreover,   Roberson's    argument     that    the   jury   likely\n\nmisunderstood \"expansive\" to mean that the phrase \"in relation to\"\n\nwas intended to enlarge upon the circumstances in which a defendant\n\nmay be prosecuted for using or carrying a firearm, is belied when\n\nthe instruction is viewed as a whole.                 See United States v.\n\nDeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995).            Although one definition\n\nof \"expansive\" is \"capable of expanding or tending to expand,\" The\n\nAm. Heritage Dictionary 624 (4th ed. 2000), another is \"broad in\n\nsize or extent; comprehensive.\" Id.             Only the latter definition\nmakes sense in the context of the instruction as a whole.                       The\n\nsentences immediately following the \"expansive\" instruction state:\n\n              At a minimum [\"in relation to\"] means that the\n              firearm must have had some purpose or effect\n              with respect to the drug trafficking crime.\n              If a firearm is present simply as a result of\n              coincidence or accident it cannot be said that\n              it was used or carried in relation to the drug\n              traffic[king] offense. The firearm must have\n              facilitated or have had the potential to\n              facilitate the drug offense.\n\nGiven   the    limiting   language    of    those   sentences,     it   would   be\n\nillogical to read the sentence containing the word \"expansive\" in\n\nthe way Roberson suggests.           When read in its entirety, the \"in\n\nrelation to\" instruction adequately and accurately conveys the\n\nmeaning of the phrase as described in Smith.\n\n              Roberson    counters   that    the    jury's   mid-deliberation\n\nquestion illustrates that there was confusion with the instruction.\n\nHe argues that the district court therefore erred by not directly\n\nanswering the jury's question as he suggested: that \"if it is their\n\nconclusion that the gun was either used or carried independent of\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthe drug trafficking offense, that would mean that it was not\n\neither used or carried in relation to the drug trafficking crime.\"\n\n            We disagree.      As a general rule, whether to provide a\n\nsupplementary instruction to the jury \"is a matter within the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court.\"         Elliot v. S.D. Warren Co., 134\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1998).       Here, the court anticipated that the\n\njury might wrestle with the issue of whether the gun was used or\n\ncarried \"in relation to\" the drug transaction.              At Roberson's\n\nbehest, the court carefully crafted an instruction, consistent with\nSmith, to aid the jury's evaluation of the \"in relation to\"\n\nrequirement.     Under the circumstances, it was well within the\n\ncourt's discretion to eschew \"elaborat[ing] on these initial,\n\nentirely correct instructions\" and instead, elect simply \"to refer\n\nthe jury to the original formulation.\"          Id.\n            This is especially so given the phrasing of the jury\n\nquestion, which suggested that the jury was putting it to the court\n\nto make the dispositive decision.           District courts must exercise\n\ncaution in such circumstances.        See e.g., Arizona v. Johnson, 351\n\nF.3d 988, 994 (9th Cir. 2003) (recognizing in a similar situation\n\nthat   a   district   court   must   exercise   caution,   when   a   \"simple\n\naffirmative or negative response might favor one party's position,\n\nplace undue weight on certain evidence, or indicate that the trial\n\njudge believes certain facts to be true when such matters should\n\nproperly be determined by the jury\") (quotation and emphasis\n\nomitted); United States v. Lakich, 23 F.3d 1203, 1209 (7th Cir.\n\n1994) (noting that a district court \"would have risked intruding on\n\n                                     -12-\n\fthe jury's fact finding\" had it given \"a simple affirmative answer\"\n\nto the jury's question of whether a finding of entrapment on one\n\ncount \"reflects\" on another).         We therefore cannot fault the court\n\nfor choosing the more cautious alternative of re-reading the\n\noriginal instruction and letting that instruction stand alone.4\n\n             Roberson also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting     the   gun    charge.     \"In   determining   the   evidentiary\n\nsufficiency of a guilty verdict, we review the totality of the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the government, and then\nask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” United\n\nStates v. Bailey, 405 F.3d 102, 111 (1st Cir. 2005) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n             Roberson      first   challenges   the   government's   evidence\nestablishing that he used or carried a \"firearm\" during the drug\n\ntransaction.5     See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st\n\n\n     4\n       We reject Roberson's suggestion that United States v.\nBollenbach, 326 U.S. 607 (1946), required the district court to\nrespond to the jury's question with an explicit answer.         In\nBollenbach, the Supreme Court found that the trial court had erred\nby responding to a jury question with an erroneous supplemental\ninstruction. Id. at 612-13. That is precisely the pitfall the\ndistrict court endeavored to avoid in this case. See United States\nv. Prigmore, 243 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[W]e have recognized\nthat, in some instances, attempts to clarify inherently nebulous\nconcepts can do more harm than good.\").\n     5\n         Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3), a \"firearm\" is defined as:\n\n             (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which\n             will or is designed or may readily be\n             converted to expel a projectile by the action\n             of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of\n             any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or\n             firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive\n\n                                      -13-\n\fCir. 1995) (noting that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) \"requires proof beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that the person perpetrating the predicate\n\noffense used a real gun\").         He contends that Mena's testimony by\n\nitself is insufficient to prove that the object Roberson handed to\n\nMena was a real gun because Mena is not an expert on guns and his\n\nlay opinion is not creditworthy, given that it is based on his\n\nobservation of the alleged gun at night in a dark car.\n\n              Although § 924(c) requires proof that the gun is real,\n\nthe government's proof need not \"reach a level of scientific\ncertainty.\"     Id. at 975-76.     Descriptive lay opinion testimony can\n\nbe sufficient.     United States v. Kirvan, 997 F.2d 963, 966-67 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).      Here, Mena's testimony was sufficient to ground the\n\njury's finding.       Although Mena was not a firearms expert, he\n\ntestified that he was familiar with handguns, having held them on\nseveral occasions.       Mena testified that he had the opportunity to\n\nhold and closely inspect Roberson's handgun.          Mena took advantage\n\nof that opportunity, smelling it to see if it had been fired, and\n\nnoticing that the serial numbers had been scratched off. At trial,\n\nMena provided details about the gun (that it looked new and had\n\nchrome on the top with a black plastic bottom), noted that its\n\ndesign   (a    plastic   bottom)    was   commonly   referred   to   by   his\n\nassociates in the drug trade as a \"Glock,\" and stated that it \"felt\n\nlike a handgun.\"     Although Mena observed the gun at night inside a\n\ncar with the interior lights off, such factors go only to the\n\n\n\n              device. Such term does not include an antique\n              firearm.\n\n                                     -14-\n\fweight of Mena's testimony, and would not prevent a rational jury\n\nfrom crediting Mena's opinion. Cf. Taylor, 54 F.3d at 976 (finding\n\nsufficient lay witness testimony by a bank teller and a customer\n\nservice representative who \"observed the object gripped by [the\n\ndefendant] at close range\"); Kirvan, 997 F.2d at 966-67 (finding\n\nsufficient lay witness testimony of two individuals who described\n\nseeing the defendant holding what appeared to be a gun, and who\n\nstated that it sounded \"heavy\" when it fell to the ground).\n\n            Roberson also contends that a rational jury could not\nhave found that Roberson used or carried the gun \"in relation to\"\n\na drug trafficking offense because the evidence established, at\n\nmost, that he carried the gun for the independent purpose of\n\noffering it to Mena after completion of the drug transaction.             He\n\nasserts that his offer to sell the gun to Mena was an entirely\nseparate and unrelated transaction.\n\n            As the jury was instructed, the \"in relation to\" language\n\nof § 924(c)(1) requires, at a minimum, that the firearm have some\n\npurpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime.\n\nSmith, 508 U.S. at 238.     Mere possession of a gun during the course\n\nof   criminal   conduct   does   not   support   a   conviction   under   the\n\nstatute.    United States v. Plummer, 964 F.2d 1251, 1254 (1st Cir.\n\n1992); see also United States v. Grace, 367 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).     Nonetheless, the phrase has been construed broadly, and\n\nencompasses a variety of situations where the firearm facilitates\n\nor has the potential to facilitate the drug trafficking offense.\n\nSee, e.g., Smith, 508 U.S. at 229 (finding that an attempt to\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fbarter   a   firearm     for   drugs   satisfied    the   \"in    relation      to\"\n\nrequirement); United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1151\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (holding that gun kept available \"if a contingency\n\narose or to make [an] escape\" was carried \"in relation to\" the\n\npredicate drug offense).       Moreover, facilitation of the underlying\n\ndrug   offense    need   not   be   the    defendant's    sole    purpose      for\n\npossessing the weapon. See United States v. Vazquez Guadelupe, 407\n\nF.3d 492, 500 n.4 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that a sufficient nexus\n\nexisted between defendant's possession of a gun and the drug crime\nnotwithstanding a legitimate explanation for defendant's possession\n\nof the gun -- viz., his employment as a police officer).\n\n             Here, at least two permissible grounds existed for the\n\njury's determination that Roberson used or carried the firearm \"in\n\nrelation to\" the drug transaction.            The jury could have reasoned\nthat   Roberson   brandished     the    gun   to   embolden     himself   or   to\n\nintimidate Mena.       See United States v. Eaton, 890 F.2d 511, 512\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).       At their first meeting, Roberson informed Mena\n\nthat he had a handgun to trade.           A rational jury could infer that\n\nRoberson intended that statement to put Mena on notice that he\n\nwould be armed on the day of the drug transaction.                Sure enough,\n\nduring the transaction, before Mena finished paying for the crack,\n\nRoberson pulled the handgun from his waistband, pointed it in\n\nMena's direction, and proclaimed, \"that's what I'm talking about.\"\n\nFurther demonstrating his deadly potential, Roberson informed Mena\n\nthat, while he does not \"waste shells,\" he does \"shoot niggas.\"\n\nAlthough the evidence that Roberson subsequently handed the gun to\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fMena may weaken the theory that Roberson was using the gun to\n\nintimidate Mena, the above evidence was sufficient to ground the\n\njury's verdict.    See Plummer, 964 F.2d at 1255 (noting that while\n\nthe facts may permit multiple inferences, \"the factfinder is\n\nentitled    to   choose   among   reasonable   interpretations   of   the\n\nevidence\").\n\n            Even if the jury believed that the gun was carried only\n\nfor the purpose of attempting to sell it to Mena, it still could\n\nhave reasonably concluded that the gun was carried \"in relation to\"\nthe drug transaction.       At the first meeting, when Mena asked\n\nRoberson for crack, Roberson mentioned that he had a gun he wanted\n\nto trade.   The next day, as Mena was counting his money, Roberson\n\nhanded the gun to Mena for his inspection and stated that he was\n\nnervous about carrying the gun because the serial numbers were\nscratched off.      Indeed, it appeared to Mena that Roberson was\n\nanxious to get rid of the gun.     From this testimony, the jury could\n\nhave reasonably concluded that the opportunity to trade the gun was\n\nan incentive for Roberson to agree to Mena's request for crack.\n\nCf. United States v. Lipford, 203 F.3d 259, 267 (4th Cir. 2000)\n\n(holding that in order to convince a seller to take the risks\n\ninherent in the sale of drugs, \"a drug purchaser can often 'sweeten\n\nthe pot,' offering to purchase not only drugs, but other illegal\n\ngoods as well\").      On these facts, a jury could have reasonably\n\nconcluded that, at least in Roberson's mind, the gun deal and the\n\ndrug deal were intertwined.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f             B.        Improper testimony\n\n             During    its   case-in-chief,      the    government        asked   Mena\n\nwhether he knew \"which is more addictive, crack or cocaine powder?\"\n\nThe district court overruled Roberson's subsequent objection, and\n\nMena answered, \"I believe crack is more addictive.\"                       When asked\n\nwhich drug is \"stronger,\" Mena again answered, \"crack.\"                    Mena then\n\ntestified that when he had been a drug dealer, he had sold powder\n\ncocaine, but that Roberson had been a crack dealer.                       During its\n\nclosing argument, the government stated, \"Eric Mena told you that\nhe was a cocaine dealer and that Kurt Roberson was a crack dealer.\n\nEric Mena also told you that as between cocaine and crack, crack is\n\nmore potent and addictive.\"\n\n             On appeal, Roberson contends that the government failed\n\nto lay a sufficient foundation to ground Mena's opinion because it\ndid   not   establish      that   Mena   was    an   expert    on   the    addictive\n\nproperties of cocaine, see Fed. R. Evid. 702, or offer evidence\n\nabout     Mena's     lay   perceptions     as   to    the    different     addictive\n\nqualities or relative potency of crack versus powder cocaine, see\n\nFed. R. Evid. 701.         Roberson contends that the improperly admitted\n\nevidence was both misleading (in that it is the difference in the\n\ntypical     method    of   administration,      not    any    difference     in    the\n\ninherent properties of the two forms of cocaine, that causes an\n\nincreased risk of addiction with crack)6 and highly prejudicial (in\n\nthat the improper testimony and closing argument was aimed at\n\n\n\n      6\n      See United States Sentencing Commission Report to Congress:\nCocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy, 19 (May 2002).\n\n                                         -18-\n\fbolstering Mena's character, while degrading Roberson's).                        Because\n\nMena's testimony was critical to the government's case, Roberson\n\nargues,    a    new   trial      is    necessary.         The   government     concedes,\n\ncorrectly, that it did not lay an adequate foundation to ground\n\nMena's testimony.          Nevertheless, the government argues that the\n\nerror    was    harmless    in    light      of    the    overwhelming      evidence    of\n\nRoberson's guilt.\n\n               We agree with the government that the error was harmless\n\nbecause it is \"highly probable that the error did not influence the\nverdict.\"      United States v. Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79, 95 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quotation marks omitted) (describing the harmless error standard\n\nfor non-constitutional evidentiary errors).                       Roberson attempts to\n\nrebut the government's \"overwhelming evidence\" argument by pointing\n\nto various weaknesses in the government's case.                            For instance,\nRoberson       asserts,    the    testimony        of    agents    Kappler    and     Quinn\n\nidentifying Roberson was fallible.                      But even assuming that this\n\ntestimony was not overwhelming by itself, it is notable that all of\n\nthe government's evidence, including the testimony of Kappler and\n\nQuinn, and the recorded audio and video evidence, corroborates\n\nMena's account of what happened.                   Given the wealth of evidence\n\nsupporting       Mena's    testimony,        it    is    highly    unlikely    that    his\n\nveracity, at least with respect to the events of March 10 and 11,\n\n2003, was seriously questioned by the jury.                        Moreover, we doubt\n\nthat the jury would view the relative addictiveness of crack versus\n\npowder    cocaine     to    be        an   important      factor     for    drawing    its\n\nconclusions about the character of the two men.                      Mena admitted on\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fthe stand that he was a dealer of, among other drugs, powder\n\ncocaine.    It is highly improbable that any diminutive boost Mena's\n\ncredibility may have received from being cast as a dealer of a less\n\naddictive    form    of   cocaine   would    have   influenced   the   jury's\n\nverdicts.\n            C.       Sentence\n\n            At   sentencing,    the    district     court   heard   argument\n\nconcerning whether the mandatory minimum sentence on the drug\n\ncharge should be doubled from ten years to 20 years in light of\nRoberson's    1996    Massachusetts    conviction     for   distribution   of\n\nmarijuana in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 32D.              See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) (providing a 20-year mandatory minimum for\n\nany person convicted under § 841(a) that has \"a prior conviction\n\nfor a felony drug offense\").            Roberson argued that the prior\nMassachusetts conviction was not a \"felony drug offense\" under §\n\n841(b)(1)(A) because Massachusetts law categorized the offense as\n\na misdemeanor.       The district court rejected Roberson's argument,\n\nfinding that the CSA clearly defines a \"felony drug offense\" as any\n\nprior conviction for an offense punishable by more than one year of\n\nimprisonment.       See 21 U.S.C. § 802(44).        Because Roberson's 1996\n\nMassachusetts conviction was punishable by up to two years in\n\nprison, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 32C,            the court found that\n\nit qualified as a \"felony drug offense\" notwithstanding the state's\n\nclassification of the offense as a misdemeanor.\n\n            On appeal, Roberson contends that the district court\n\nerred by applying the 20-year mandatory minimum to the drug charge.\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fRoberson's arguments hinge on the premise that two defined terms\n\nare triggered by § 841(b)(1)(A).                 Citing to several canons of\n\nstatutory construction and to the legislative history of the CSA,\n\nhe argues that the definition of \"felony drug offense\" contained in\n\n§ 802(44) is modified by the definition of \"felony\" contained in §\n\n802(13).       See 21 U.S.C. § 802(13) (\"The term 'felony' means any\n\nFederal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State\n\nlaw   as   a       felony.\").       Roberson    contends   that   both    of   these\n\ndefinitions must be satisfied to trigger § 841(b)(1)(A)'s 20-year\nmandatory      minimum.         Under   Roberson's   interpretation,       a   prior\n\nconviction is a \"felony drug offense\" under § 841(b)(1)(A) only if\n\nthe prior drug offense is both (1) punishable by more than one year\n\nin jail, see id. § 802(44), and (2) classified as a felony by the\n\nrelevant federal or state authority, see id. § 802(13).\n               A    recent   D.C.    Circuit    decision   supports      Roberson's\n\nposition.          See United States v. West, 393 F.3d 1302 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2005).7    Like Roberson, the defendant in West had been convicted\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and (b)(1)(A)(iii) for distributing more\n\nthan 50 grams of cocaine base.             The district court increased the\n\nmandatory minimum from ten to 20 years based on a prior drug\n\nconviction in Maryland that was classified by that state as a\n\nmisdemeanor, but which was punishable by up to four years in\n\nprison.     On appeal, the D.C. Circuit vacated the defendant's 20-\n\nyear sentence, holding that the definition of \"felony drug offense\"\n\n\n\n      7\n      To our knowledge, the D.C. Circuit is the only federal\nappellate court to have addressed this issue to date.\n\n                                         -21-\n\fprovided    by   §    802(44)    must   be     read   in     conjunction      with   the\n\ndefinition of \"felony\" provided by § 802(13).                      The D.C. Circuit\n\nfound the defendant's position -- that Congress intended \"felony\n\ndrug offense\" to incorporate the definitions contained in both §\n\n802(13)    and   802(44)    --    was    \"at    least      as    plausible\"    as    the\n\ngovernment's -- that § 802(44) alone controls.                          Id. at 1315.\n\nInvoking the rule of lenity, the court held that the enhancement\n\nprovision of § 841(b)(1)(A) is limited \"to those instances in which\n\nthe prior drug offense is both punishable by more than one year and\nclassified as a felony by controlling authority.\"                       Id.   Roberson\n\nargues that, even if we do not adopt his construction of the\n\nstatute, we should follow the D.C. Circuit and apply the rule of\n\nlenity to resolve the issue in his favor.\n\n             Roberson's challenge to the applicability of the 20-year\nmandatory    minimum      sentence      presents      pure      legal   questions    of\n\nstatutory construction.          As such, our review is de novo.              Doyle v.\n\nHuntress, Inc., 419 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 2005).                    \"As in any case of\n\nstatutory construction, our analysis begins with the language of\n\nthe statute.\"        Zimmerman v. Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp., 409\n\nF.3d 473, 475 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Hughes Aircraft Co. v.\n\nJacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999)).              We accord the statutory text\n\n\"its ordinary meaning by reference to the 'specific context in\n\nwhich that language is used, and the broader context of the statute\n\nas a whole.'\"         Mullane v. Chambers, 333 F.3d 322, 330 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (quoting Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341\n\n(1997)).    If the statutory language provides a clear answer, the\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\finquiry ends.       See Hughes, 525 U.S. at 438; Sepulveda v. United\n\nStates, 330 F.3d 55, 64 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The wording of the provisions at issue, read in the\n\ncontext of the statute as a whole, lead us to conclude that, for\n\nthe purposes of the CSA, the term \"felony drug offense\" is a term\n\nof art separate and distinct from the term \"felony.\"            In our view,\n\nthe definition of \"felony drug offense\" contained in § 802(44)\n\nunambiguously controls for the purposes of determining whether the\n\npenalty enhancement in § 841(b)(1)(A) is triggered.             We therefore\nreject Roberson's arguments and decline to invoke the rule of\n\nlenity. See United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 83 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (en banc) (holding that the rule of lenity \"only applies if\n\n'there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty about the statute'\")\n\n(quoting Muscurello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 138-39 (1998)).\nWe begin our analysis by delineating the CSA's structure.\n\n            In 1970, to consolidate the assorted drug laws then on\n\nthe books and to enhance federal drug enforcement powers, Congress\n\nenacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act\n\n(the \"1970 Act\").        See Pub. Law No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236; see\n\ngenerally Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005).                     The Act is\n\nsubdivided into three titles.         The CSA, established in Title II,\n\naddresses the control of drugs and the enforcement of drug laws,\n\nsee   21   U.S.C.   §§   801-904,   while   Title    III,   aptly    named   the\n\nControlled    Substances    Import    and   Export    Act   (\"Import    Act\"),\n\nconcerns their import and export to and from the United States, see\n\nid. §§ 951-971.\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f            Part D of the CSA lays out the substantive offenses and\n\nthe attendant penalties.          As is relevant here, Part D makes it\n\nunlawful \"for any person knowingly or intentionally -- (1) to\n\nmanufacture, distribute, or dispense or possess with intent to\n\nmanufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance.\"                       Id.\n\n§   841(a)(1).     Pursuant   to    the    \"penalties\"      provision       of   that\n\nsection,   \"any    person   who    violates\"      §    841(a)     through   conduct\n\ninvolving, inter alia, \"50 grams or more of a mixture\" containing\n\ncocaine base, \"shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which\nmay not be less than 10 years.\"           Id. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).          Further\n\non, the same subsection provides that \"[i]f any person commits such\n\na violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has\n\nbecome    final,   such   person    shall    be       sentenced    to   a   term    of\n\nimprisonment which may not be less than 20 years.\"                  Id. (Emphasis\nadded).\n\n            Section 802 provides definitions for the terms used in\n\nthe CSA and the Import Act.        The two relevant definitions provide\n\nas follows:\n\n            The term \"felony\" means any Federal or State\n            offense classified by applicable Federal or\n            State law as a felony. . . .\n\n            The term \"felony drug offense\" means an\n            offense that is punishable by imprisonment for\n            more than one year under any law of the United\n            States or of a State or foreign country that\n            prohibits or restricts conduct relating to\n            narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant\n            stimulant substances.\n\nId. § 802(13), (44).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\f            The most logical interpretation of § 841(b)(1)(A), we\n\nbelieve, is that the phrase \"felony drug offense\" is a term of art\n\ninvoked intentionally by Congress to incorporate by reference the\n\nspecific definition contained in § 802(44).           Cf. United States v.\n\nCordoza-Estrada, 385 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that the\n\nstatutory definition of the term \"aggravated felony\" in 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(43)(F) \"is a term of art that includes within its ambit\n\ncertain misdemeanors under state law that carry a sentence of at\n\nleast one year”); see also Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 942\n(2000) (\"When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must\n\nfollow that definition, even if it varies from that term's ordinary\n\nmeaning.\"). Because the term \"felony drug offense\" is specifically\n\ndefined in § 802(44), and § 841(b)(1)(A) makes use of that precise\n\nterm, the logical, commonsense way to interpret \"felony drug\noffense\" in § 841(b)(1)(A) is by reference to the definition in §\n\n802(44).    See O'Connell v. Shalala, 79 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)    (\"[C]ourts    are   bound   to   afford    statutes    a    practical,\n\ncommonsense reading.\").\n\n            Roberson argues that § 802(44)'s definition must be read\n\nas incorporating the definition of \"felony\" in § 802(13) because\n\nthe term \"felony drug offense\" contains within it the defined term\n\n\"felony.\"    Because the definition of a defined term is ordinarily\n\ntriggered by every reference to that term within a statute, see 1A\n\n&   2A   Norman   J.   Singer,   Sutherland:       Statutes    and   Statutory\n\nConstruction, §§ 20:8, 47:7 (6th ed. 2000), Roberson argues, the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fdefinition of \"felony\" is embedded in both § 802(44)'s definition\n\nof and § 841(b)(1)(A)'s reference to \"felony drug offense.\"\n\n                 But the term being defined is not ordinarily read as\n\nbeing itself a part of the definition of the term.                If Congress had\n\nintended         the   definition   in   §   802(44)   to    cross-reference   the\n\ndefinition in § 802(13), it could have indicated such a cross-\n\nreference in the text of the definition.                    For example, Congress\n\ncould have written § 802(44) to state that \"the term 'felony drug\n\noffense' means a felony . . . .\"8               Indeed, such internal cross-\nreferencing, defining one term by reference in the text of the\n\ndefinition to another defined term, is not unusual in the United\n\nStates Code.           See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (defining a \"pattern\n\nof racketeering activity\" as requiring, inter alia, \"at least two\n\nacts of racketeering activity,\" thereby expressly cross-referencing\nthe separately defined \"racketeering activity\" in § 1961(1)); 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(c)(4) (defining a \"financial transaction\" as, inter\n\nalia,       \"a    transaction,\"     thereby     expressly      incorporating   the\n\ndefinition of \"transaction\" in § 1956(c)(3));9 see Zimmerman, 409\n\nF.3d at 475-76 (looking to Congress's method of drafting statutes\n\nin other parts of the Code as an aid in interpreting statutory\n\ntext).\n\n\n     8\n      Such a formulation would have been harmonious with the pre-\n1994 version of § 841(b)(1)(A) which defined a “felony drug\noffense” as “an offense that is a felony . . . .” See infra note\n10.\n        9\n      Roberson does not cite any examples where Congress has cross-\nreferenced to a defined term by placing that defined term within\nanother defined term (as opposed to placing it within the text of\nthe definition).\n\n                                         -26-\n\f          Had Congress intended to require both definitions for the\n\npurposes of § 841(b)(1)(A), but also wished to preserve a distinct\n\ndefinition of \"felony drug offense\" for the purposes of other\n\nprovisions, it could have accomplished its purposes within the text\n\nof § 841(b)(1)(A).      For example, Congress could have written §\n\n841(b)(1)(A) to trigger a 20-year mandatory minimum whenever any\n\nperson commits a violation of § 841(a) \"after a prior conviction\n\nfor a felony drug offense that is classified by applicable Federal\n\nor State law as a felony has become final.”\n          Congress did not use any of these conventions.   Thus, we\n\nare left with a statutory provision that specifically references a\n\ndefined term, “felony drug offense.”      Where, as here, Congress\n\ndefines what a particular term \"means,\" that definition controls to\n\nthe exclusion of any meaning that is not explicitly stated in the\ndefinition, see Sutherland § 47:7 (citing Colautti v. Franklin, 439\n\nU.S. 379, 392 & n.10 (1978)), and regardless of the ordinary\n\nmeaning of the words,    see id. at § 20:8 (citing Packard Motor Car\n\nCo. v. N.L.R.B., 330 U.S. 485 (1947)); Cordoza-Estrada, 385 F.3d at\n\n58.\n\n          The district court's construction, that § 802(44) alone\n\nprovides the definition of \"felony drug offense,\" is further\n\nsupported by an analysis of the statute as a whole.    See Shalala,\n\n79 F.3d at 176 (\"[A] court engaged in the task of statutory\n\ninterpretation must examine the statute as a whole, giving due\n\nweight to design, structure, and purpose as well as to aggregate\n\nlanguage.\").   Reviewing the substantive provisions in the CSA\n\n\n                                -27-\n\freveals that the term \"felony drug offense\" is utilized only in §\n\n841(b)(1).     The term also appears in a parallel provision of the\n\nImport Act.    See 21 U.S.C. § 960(b).        In both statutes, the term is\n\nused solely to specify the type of prior conviction that will\n\ntrigger a mandatory sentence enhancement.             In some instances, the\n\nsentencing floor is enhanced.          See id. §§ 841(b)(1)(A) and (B);\n\n960(b)(1) and (2) (all doubling the minimum sentence when the\n\ndefendant's violation of the subject section was committed \"after\n\na prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final\").\nIn   others,   the    sentencing    ceiling   is   enhanced.     See    id.   §§\n\n841(b)(1)(C) and (D); 960(b)(3) (all increasing the potential\n\nmaximum sentence when the defendant's violation of the subject\n\nsection was committed \"after a prior conviction for a felony drug\n\noffense has become final\").        In all events, a prior conviction for\na \"felony drug offense\" will result in a significant upward re-\n\ncalibration of the statutorily mandated sentencing range.\n\n           In contrast, the term \"felony\" (without the accompanying\n\nwords \"drug offense\") is utilized extensively throughout the CSA\n\nfor a variety of purposes.           See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. §§ 824(a)(2)\n\n(providing circumstances under which a registration to manufacture\n\nor   distribute      controlled    substances   may    be   revoked);   841(e)\n\n(providing circumstances in which an injunction is available under\n\n§ 841); 843(b) (forbidding the use of a communication facility to\n\naccomplish the commission of a felony); 843(d)(1-2) (setting a\n\nmaximum sentence for violations of § 843 for persons with a prior\n\nfelony drug conviction); 848(c)(1) (defining a \"continuing criminal\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fenterprise\" as involving a felony violation); 853(d) (creating a\n\nrebuttable presumption in favor of forfeiture against any person\n\nconvicted of a felony); 862a(a) (denying eligibility for certain\n\nassistance and benefits programs for any person convicted of an\n\noffense      classified        as   a    felony);         878(a)(3)     (granting        drug\n\nenforcement officers the power to make warrantless arrests where\n\nthere is probable cause to believe a felony has been committed).\n\n             Congress's decision to use the precise term \"felony drug\n\noffense\" in § 841(b)(1), instead of the more broadly used term\n\"felony,\"     evidences        an    intent     to     distinguish      these     sentence\n\nenhancement provisions from the other provisions that refer to the\n\ngeneric \"felony.\"         See Citizen's Awareness Network, Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 391 F.3d 338, 346 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"The principle is clear\n\nthat Congress's use of differential language in various sections of\nthe   same    statute     is    presumed       to    be    intentional      and   deserves\n\ninterpretative      weight.\");           Sutherland,        §   46:05      (\"[W]here      the\n\nlegislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded\n\nit in another, it should not be implied where excluded.\").                           Given\n\nthe structure of the CSA, and the targeted use of the term \"felony\n\ndrug offense,\" the logical inference is that Congress intended the\n\nstatutory     enhancements          in   §    841(b)(1)(A)       to   be    triggered      by\n\nreference to § 802(44) alone.                  As the government has suggested,\n\nCongress     may   have    wished        to    avoid      the   possibility       that    the\n\nsubstantial consequences of the mandatory sentence enhancements in\n\n\n\n\n                                              -29-\n\f§   841(b)(1)(A)   would    turn   on   the     happenstance    of   a   state's\n\nclassification of a prior offense.10\n\n           Roberson's      invocations     of    the   canons   of   statutory\n\nconstruction do not persuade us that the statute is ambiguous.\n\nRoberson argues that, because the definitions in § 802(13) and\n\n802(44) are part of the same definitional section and address the\n\n\n\n      10\n      Prior to 1988, § 841(b)(1)(A) provided that a prior\nconviction for, inter alia, \"a felony under any . . . law of a\nState\" would trigger enhanced penalties. Pub. Law No. 99-570, §\n1002, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-4 (1986) (emphasis added). The term\n\"felony drug offense\" was added to § 841(b)(1)(A) in 1988 and the\ndefinition was placed directly in the substantive subsection, but\nthe applicability of the penalty enhancement still depended on the\nclassification of the prior offense as a felony. See Pub. Law No.\n100-690, § 6452(a)(2), 102 Stat. 4181, 4371 (1988) (\"[T]he term\n'felony drug offense' means an offense that is . . . a felony under\nany law of a State . . . .\").       In 1994, Congress amended the\nsubstantive enhancement provisions of both the CSA and the Import\nAct so that they all uniformly used the term \"felony drug offense.\"\nSee Pub. Law No. 103-322, § 90105, 108 Stat. 1796, 1987-88 (1994).\nIt also replaced the classification-based definition of \"felony\ndrug offense\" with the new sentence-based definition of the term\nthat presently resides in § 802(44). See id.\n     Roberson contends that the 1994 amendment was intended merely\nto make uniform the parallel provisions in the CSA and the Import\nAct. But such a structural intent does not preclude an additional\nsubstantive intent:     to replace the old classification-based\ndefinition of \"felony drug offense\" with a new definition which\nconsiders only the potential length of the sentence.            See\nZimmerman, 409 F.3d at 476 (noting that a court \"may assume that .\n. . Congress was aware\" of the previously existing statutory\nprovisions, and thus that its choice of \"a different formulation\"\nwas intentional). Such an intent makes sense in the context of the\nevolving nature of the CSA. Initially, the district courts were\ngiven broad leeway in fashioning sentences, but Congress reversed\ncourse in 1984 by enacting mandatory penalties to avoid sentencing\ndisparities. See Todd E. Gonyer, Federal Sentencing in a Post-\nChapman World: What is a \"Mixture or Substance\" Anyhow?, 46 U. Kan.\nL. Rev. 983, 984-88 (1998). Subsequent amendments in the 1980's\nincreased the consequences of those mandatory penalties. See id.\nThus, it would not be surprising to learn that Congress intended\nthe 1994 amendments to ensure that the mandatory recidivist penalty\nprovisions would be applied uniformly not only across statutory\nlines, but also across state lines.\n\n                                    -30-\n\fsame subject matter -- the classification of offenses -- they are\n\ncoequal and should be read in pari materia (i.e., they should be\n\nconstrued together).    See United States v. Kelley, 712 F.2d 884,\n\n889 (1st Cir. 1983).    Moreover, continues Roberson, if we do not\n\nread the definition of \"felony\" in conjunction with the definition\n\nof \"felony drug offense,\" then the definition of \"felony\" will\n\nbecome superfluous.    See United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d\n\n741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"All words and provisions of statutes\n\nare intended to have meaning and are to be given effect, and no\nconstruction should be adopted which would render statutory words\n\nor phrases meaningless, redundant or superfluous.\").\n\n          The above-cited canons, as well as the canon, cited by\n\nthe government, that a specific provision governs as against a\n\ngeneral provision, see Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504\nU.S. 374, 384-85 (1992), are corollaries of the cardinal rule that\n\ncourts must strive to harmonize all the provisions of a statute to\n\ngive them all force and effect, see Sutherland, § 46:06.   Absent a\n\nconflict between the two provisions, resort to the canons (which\n\nare, after all, only tools of construction) is unnecessary.   Here,\n\nwe find no tension between the definition of \"felony\" and the\n\ndefinition of \"felony drug offense.\"      Viewing the statute as a\n\nwhole, the two separate definitions are harmonized by recognizing\n\nthat they are used for different purposes.     The structure of the\n\nstatute, and the differential use of the two terms, lead us to\n\ninfer that the terms were intended to carry independent meanings\n\nfor independent purposes. Applying the doctrine of in pari materia\n\n\n                                -31-\n\fto merge two definitional clauses would thus defeat their very\n\npurposes.      Cf.     Kelley,    712    F.2d    at    889   (holding     that    two\n\nsubstantive provisions aimed at regulating the same area of conduct\n\n-- disqualifying judges with a personal bias against a party --\n\nshould be construed in pari materia).\n\n            Because “felony drug offense” is a defined term of art\n\nand we have found nothing in sections 802(44) or 841(b)(1)(A)\n\nindicating a Congressional intent to incorporate the definition of\n\n\"felony\" in the term \"felony drug offense,\" we find no statutory\n\nambiguity.       The    20-year     mandatory         minimum    contained   in    §\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(iii) is triggered when the defendant has a prior\n\nconviction for an “offense that is punishable by imprisonment for\n\nmore    than   one   year   under       any    law    of   the   United   States.”\n\nAccordingly, we find that the district did not err in applying the\n20-year mandatory minimum sentence to the drug charge.11\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      Roberson also argues that we should vacate his sentence\nbecause the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by\nimposing the 20-year mandatory minimum sentence based on a prior\nconviction that the government did not prove to the jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt.    Although this circuit has previously read\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), to\nforeclose such an argument, see United States v. Ivery, 427 F.3d\n69, 75 (1st Cir. 2005), Roberson urges us to re-examine the issue\nin light of a trio of recent Supreme Court decisions, Shepard v.\nUnited States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005); United States v. Booker, 543\nU.S. 220 (2005); and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).\nRoberson contends that these three cases combine to undermine the\ncontinuing validity of Almendarez-Torres and our circuit precedent.\nWe recently rejected this argument sitting as an en banc court.\nSee United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 520 (1st Cir.\n2006) (en banc) (\"[W]e are bound to follow [Almendarez-Torres]\nuntil it is expressly overruled.\").\n\n                                        -32-\n\f                                  III.\n\n          For   the   foregoing    reasons,   we   affirm   Roberson's\n\nconvictions and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\f",

Muse brought Mena to where Roberson was currently staying. After Roberson entered Mena's car, Mena told him that he needed two ounces of crack. Roberson agreed to provide the drugs the next evening and told Mena that he should call to initiate the pickup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Mena was saving Roberson's phone number on his mobile phone, Roberson spontaneously stated, \"Yo, you got any burners? I can trade you a burner.\" Mena testified at trial that \"burner\" meant handgun, and that he understood Roberson's statement to be an offer to sell him a gun. Roberson described the gun as \"a brand new, 40 cal.\" that was \"like a Glock, top is chrome. The rest is plastic.\" Mena was noncommittal as to that offer but confirmed that he would meet with Roberson the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following evening, Mena, who was again outfitted with a transmitter and an audio recorder, tried several times, unsuccessfully, to reach Roberson on his mobile phone. The FBI directed Mena to drive to Muse's house again. Rather than using his own car, however, Mena drove an undercover car that the FBI had equipped with a hidden video camera. After Muse and Mena successfully contacted Roberson, Muse directed Mena to an apartment complex in a nearby town. Mena drove the undercover car with Muse as his passenger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After they arrived at the apartment complex, Muse located Roberson and brought him to Mena's car. Roberson sat in the front passenger seat next to Mena, while Muse sat in the back. Roberson told Mena, \"I got your sixty grams,\" and then told him it would cost $2,000. As Mena was counting out his money, Roberson looked out the back window and stated, \"I got the rap on me so I'm shook anyway.\" Mena testified at trial that this meant that Roberson was paranoid because he had a handgun on him. Roberson then handed Mena a sandwich bag containing crack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Mena inspected the crack, Roberson pulled a handgun out of his waistband, pointed it in Mena's direction, and stated, \"That's what I'm talking about man.\" Mena told Roberson not to point the gun at him and asked to see it. Roberson handed the gun to Mena, who looked at it and smelled it to see if it had been fired. Mena found the design of the gun to be consistent with a \"Glock\" in that the top was chrome and the bottom was plastic. Mena asked Roberson why he wanted to get rid of the handgun and Roberson replied that the serial numbers had been scratched off. When Mena asked whether the gun had been fired yet, Roberson replied, \"Nah, I don't waste shells, man. I shoot niggas though.\" Mena handed the gun back to Roberson, and they completed the drug transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mena then asked Roberson if he would be interested in buying Mena's car. Mena initiated this conversation outside the car so that FBI agents would have an opportunity to observe Roberson directly. As a result, agent Timothy Quinn, who was conducting physical and audio surveillance nearby, was able to drive within 12 feet of Mena and Roberson as they looked over the vehicle. Roberson then went back into the apartment complex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, a federal grand jury returned a two count indictment charging Roberson of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of more than 50 grams of cocaine base,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"), <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (the \"drug charge\"), and of using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking offense, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (the \"gun charge\"). The government subsequently filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851 providing notice of its intent to seek increased punishment&#8212;the doubling of the drug charge's mandatory minimum sentence from 10 to 20 years&#8212;by reason of a prior conviction. After a five-day trial, including testimony from Mena, Kappler and Quinn, a jury convicted Roberson on both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson moved for a judgment of acquittal both during trial and after the verdict. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a), (c). He argued that there was insufficient evidence establishing that he had possessed crack or had sold more than 50 grams of crack. He also argued that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that he had carried or used a \"firearm,\" as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(3), or that he had carried or used a firearm \"during and in relation to\" the drug transaction. Finally, he argued that, because the government had not offered any evidence establishing his prior conviction, the district court could not impose an increased penalty for the drug conviction. The court denied Roberson's motions in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that the 20-year mandatory minimum applied to the drug charge, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(A)(iii), and a 5-year consecutive mandatory minimum applied to the gun charge, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A). After determining that the Sentencing Guidelines advised a sentencing range of 35 years to life, and considering the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), the court imposed a sentence of 25 years in prison, the statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson now appeals the district court's order denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the gun charge, arguing that the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove either that he carried an actual \"firearm\" or that he carried a firearm \"in relation to\" a drug trafficking offense. He alternatively requests a new trial on the gun charge on the ground that the court erroneously instructed the jury concerning the \"in relation to\" requirement, and a new trial on both charges on the basis of improperly admitted testimony. Finally, Roberson argues that the applicable mandatory minimum sentence for the drug conviction is ten years, not 20 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A. The gun charge</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson challenges the consecutive five-year mandatory minimum sentence he received for using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense\" on several grounds. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A). We begin with Roberson's contention that the district court incorrectly instructed on the \"in relation to\" requirement, and compounded the error by simply restating the same erroneous instruction when the jury sought clarification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, both Roberson and the government submitted proposed jury instructions addressing the gun charge. The government proposed the First Circuit pattern jury instruction, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To \"carry\" a firearm during and in relation to a crime means to move or transport the firearm on one's person or in a vehicle or container during and in relation to the crime. It need not be immediately accessible. To \"use\" a firearm during and in relation to a crime means to employ the firearm actively, such as to brandish, display, barter, strike with, fire or attempt to fire it, or even to refer to it in a way calculated to affect the underlying crime. The firearm must have played a role in the crime or must have been intended by the defendant to play a role in the crime. That need not have been its sole purpose, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See</i> First Circuit Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions &#167; 4.07 (1998). The pattern instruction purposefully declines to define \"in relation to\" separately from the terms \"carry\" and \"use.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167; 4.07 cmt. 3 (\"It seems best not to define `use or carry' separately from `during and in relation to.'\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Roberson, however, drawing on language from <i>Smith v. United States,</i> 508 U.S. 223, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993), proposed that a paragraph be added to directly address this requirement. The court agreed to instruct the jury on the \"in relation to\" element, but declined to adopt Roberson's proposal wholesale. Instead, it crafted its own instruction based on language from <i>Smith:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The words \"during and in relation to\" are to be given their plain and customary meaning. The phrase \"in relation to\" is expansive. At a minimum it means that the firearm must have had some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime. If a firearm is present simply as a result of coincidence or accident it cannot be said that it was used or carried in relation to the drug traffic[king] offense. The firearm must have facilitated or have had the potential to facilitate the drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a pre-charge conference, Roberson objected to the statement \"the phrase `in relation to' is expansive.\" He argued that the word \"expansive\" erroneously implied that the phrase \"in relation to\" was intended to expand, rather than limit, the phrase \"used or carried.\" The district court denied the objection and delivered the pattern jury instruction along with the \"in relation to\" insert that it had crafted. After the charge, Roberson failed to renew his objection, and the jury retired to deliberate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the first full day of deliberations, the jury submitted a note asking: \"Does carrying a firearm during but independent of a drug transaction constitute the use of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking?\" Contending that the word \"independent\" means the opposite of \"in relation to,\" Roberson requested the court to directly answer the jury's question in the negative. The court, however, agreed with the government that such an instruction would risk providing the jury with a decisive conclusion. The court therefore elected to simply re-read the gun charge instruction in the hope that hearing the instruction again would help the jury resolve the question internally. Before the court summoned the jury, Roberson again objected that the instruction was erroneous insofar as it stated that \"in relation to\" is \"expansive.\" After the re-reading of the instruction, the jury returned its verdicts later that day without additional inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To preserve an objection to a jury instruction under Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), a litigant must lodge a specific objection and state the grounds for the objection <i>after</i> the court has charged the jury and before the jury begins deliberations. <i>See United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 13 &amp; n. 7 (1st Cir.2004). Objections registered during pre-charge hearings are insufficient to preserve the issue. <i>See id.</i> We review such unpreserved jury instruction claims for plain error only. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson seeks a more favorable standard of review by arguing that his second objection to the \"expansive\" instruction preserved the issue because it was made <i>after</i> the court's original charge to the jury on the gun charge and <i>before</i> the jury retired to deliberate following the court's re-reading of the gun charge instruction. Roberson contends that the second objection effectively served Rule 30(d)'s purpose \"to bring to the attention of the trial court errors or omissions in its charge so that they may be corrected before the case goes to the jury.\" <i>United States v. Sturm,</i> 870 F.2d 769, 775-76 (1st Cir.1989). But the <i>case</i> had already gone to the jury. Roberson's renewed objection, registered after the jury had begun its deliberations, came too late to satisfy Rule 30(d). <i>See United States v. Santana-Rosa,</i> 132 F.3d 860, 863 n. 1 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[A] party waives any objection it might have to a jury instruction by failing to enter that objection into the record immediately after the judge has instructed the jury and before the jury <i>begins</i> deliberations.\") (Emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We therefore review the instruction for plain error, under which Roberson \"must demonstrate: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Moran,</i> 393 F.3d at 13 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson cannot meet this stringent standard. The district court took the language \"[t]he phrase `in relation to' is expansive\" directly from the majority opinion in <i>Smith. See</i> 508 U.S. at 237, 113 S.Ct. 2050. Roberson makes no argument that <i>Smith</i> is no longer good law or has been undermined by subsequent Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, federal appellate courts continue to cite <i>Smith</i> for the proposition that \"in relation to\" is \"expansive.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. Brown,</i> 400 F.3d 1242, 1250 (10th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 344 F.3d 365, 371 (3d Cir.2003); <i>McNeal v. United States,</i> 249 F.3d 747, 750 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Roberson's argument that the jury likely misunderstood \"expansive\" to mean that the phrase \"in relation to\" was intended to enlarge upon the circumstances in which a defendant may be prosecuted for using or carrying a firearm, is belied when the instruction is viewed as a whole. <i>See United States v. DeStefano,</i> 59 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995). Although one definition of \"expansive\" is \"capable of expanding or tending to expand,\" The Am. Heritage Dictionary 624 (4th ed.2000), another is \"broad in size or extent; comprehensive.\" <i>Id.</i> Only the latter definition makes sense in the context of the instruction as a whole. The sentences immediately following the \"expansive\" instruction state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a minimum [\"in relation to\"] means that the firearm must have had some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime. If a firearm is present simply as a result of coincidence or accident it cannot be said that it was used or carried in relation to the drug traffic[king] offense. The firearm must have facilitated or have had the potential to facilitate the drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the limiting language of those sentences, it would be illogical to read the sentence containing the word \"expansive\" in the way Roberson suggests. When read in its entirety, the \"in relation to\" instruction adequately and accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase as described in <i>Smith.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson counters that the jury's mid-deliberation question illustrates that there was confusion with the instruction. He argues that the district court therefore erred by not directly answering the jury's question as he suggested: that \"if it is their conclusion that the gun was either used or carried independent of the drug trafficking offense, that would mean that it was not either used or carried in relation to the drug trafficking crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. As a general rule, whether to provide a supplementary instruction to the jury \"is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.\" <i>Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co.,</i> 134 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1998). Here, the court anticipated that the jury might wrestle with the issue of whether the gun was used or carried \"in relation to\" the drug transaction. At Roberson's behest, the court carefully crafted an instruction, consistent with <i>Smith,</i> to aid the jury's evaluation of the \"in relation to\" requirement. Under the circumstances, it was well within the court's discretion to eschew \"elaborat[ing] on these initial, entirely correct instructions\" and instead, elect simply \"to refer the jury to the original formulation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is especially so given the phrasing of the jury question, which suggested that the jury was putting it to the court to make the dispositive decision. District courts must exercise caution in such circumstances. <i>See e.g., Arizona v. Johnson,</i> 351 F.3d 988, 994 (9th Cir.2003) (recognizing in a similar situation that a district court must exercise caution, when a \"simple affirmative or negative response might favor one party's position, place undue weight on certain evidence, or indicate that the trial judge believes certain facts to be true when such matters should properly be determined by the jury\") (quotation and emphasis omitted); <i>United States v. Lakich,</i> 23 F.3d 1203, 1209 (7th Cir.1994) (noting that a district court \"would have risked intruding on the jury's fact finding\" had it given \"a simple affirmative answer\" to the jury's question of whether a finding of entrapment on one count \"reflects\" on another). We therefore cannot fault the court for choosing the more cautious alternative of re-reading the original instruction and letting that instruction stand alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the gun charge. \"In determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a guilty verdict, we review the totality of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and then ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 405 F.3d 102, 111 (1st Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson first challenges the government's evidence establishing that he used or carried a \"firearm\" during the drug transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) \"requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the person perpetrating the predicate offense used a real gun\"). He contends that Mena's testimony by itself is insufficient to prove that the object Roberson handed to Mena was a real gun because Mena is not an expert on guns and his lay opinion is not creditworthy, given that it is based on his observation of the alleged gun at night in a dark car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although &#167; 924(c) requires proof that the gun is real, the government's proof need not \"reach a level of scientific certainty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 975-76. Descriptive lay opinion testimony can be sufficient. <i>United States v. Kirvan,</i> 997 F.2d 963, 966-67 (1st Cir.1993). Here, Mena's testimony was sufficient to ground the jury's finding. Although Mena was not a firearms expert, he testified that he was familiar with handguns, having held them on several occasions. Mena testified that he had the opportunity to hold and closely inspect Roberson's handgun. Mena took advantage of that opportunity, smelling it to see if it had been fired, and noticing that the serial numbers had been scratched off. At trial, Mena provided details about the gun (that it looked new and had chrome on the top with a black plastic bottom), noted that its design (a plastic bottom) was commonly referred to by his associates in the drug trade as a \"Glock,\" and stated that it \"felt like a handgun.\" Although Mena observed the gun at night inside a car with the interior lights off, such factors go only to the weight of Mena's testimony, and would not prevent a rational jury from crediting Mena's opinion. <i>Cf. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 976 (finding sufficient lay witness testimony by a bank teller and a customer service representative who \"observed the object gripped by [the defendant] at close range\"); <i>Kirvan,</i> 997 F.2d at 966-67 (finding sufficient lay witness testimony of two individuals who described seeing the defendant holding what appeared to be a gun, and who stated that it sounded \"heavy\" when it fell to the ground).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson also contends that a rational jury could not have found that Roberson used or carried the gun \"in relation to\" a drug trafficking offense because the evidence established, at most, that he carried the gun for the independent purpose of offering it to Mena after completion of the drug transaction. He asserts that his offer to sell the gun to Mena was an entirely separate and unrelated transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the jury was instructed, the \"in relation to\" language of &#167; 924(c)(1) requires, at a minimum, that the firearm have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime. <i>Smith,</i> 508 U.S. at 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050. Mere possession of a gun during the course of criminal conduct does not support a conviction under the statute. <i>United States v. Plummer,</i> 964 F.2d 1251, 1254 (1st Cir.1992); <i>see also United States v. Grace,</i> 367 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.2004). Nonetheless, the phrase has been construed broadly, and encompasses a variety of situations where the firearm facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the drug trafficking offense. <i>See, e.g., Smith,</i> 508 U.S. at 229, 113 S.Ct. 2050 (finding that an attempt to barter a firearm for drugs satisfied the \"in relation to\" requirement); <i>United States v. Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d 1142, 1151 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that gun kept available \"if a contingency arose or to make [an] escape\" was carried \"in relation to\" the predicate drug offense). Moreover, facilitation of the underlying drug offense need not be the defendant's sole purpose for possessing the weapon. <i>See United States v. Vazquez-Guadalupe,</i> 407 F.3d 492, 500 n. 4 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that a sufficient nexus existed between defendant's possession of a gun and the drug crime notwithstanding a legitimate explanation for defendant's possession of the gun&#8212;<i>viz.,</i> his employment as a police officer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, at least two permissible grounds existed for the jury's determination that Roberson used or carried the firearm \"in relation to\" the drug transaction. The jury could have reasoned that Roberson brandished the gun to embolden himself or to intimidate Mena. <i>See United States v. Eaton,</i> 890 F.2d 511, 512 (1st Cir.1989). At their first meeting, Roberson informed Mena that he had a handgun to trade. A rational jury could infer that Roberson intended that statement to put Mena on notice that he would be armed on the day of the drug transaction. Sure enough, during the transaction, before Mena finished paying for the crack, Roberson pulled the handgun from his waistband, pointed it in Mena's direction, and proclaimed, \"that's what I'm talking about.\" Further demonstrating his deadly potential, Roberson informed Mena that, while he does not \"waste shells,\" he does \"shoot niggas.\" Although the evidence that Roberson subsequently handed the gun to Mena may weaken the theory that Roberson was using the gun to intimidate Mena, the above evidence was sufficient to ground the jury's verdict. <i>See Plummer,</i> 964 F.2d at 1255 (noting that while the facts may permit multiple inferences, \"the factfinder is entitled to choose among reasonable interpretations of the evidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the jury believed that the gun was carried only for the purpose of attempting to sell it to Mena, it still could have reasonably concluded that the gun was carried \"in relation to\" the drug transaction. At the first meeting, when Mena asked Roberson for crack, Roberson mentioned that he had a gun he wanted to trade. The next day, as Mena was counting his money, Roberson handed the gun to Mena for his inspection and stated that he was nervous about carrying the gun because the serial numbers were scratched off. Indeed, it appeared to Mena that Roberson was anxious to get rid of the gun. From this testimony, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the opportunity to trade the gun was an incentive for Roberson to agree to Mena's request for crack. <i>Cf. United States v. Lipford,</i> 203 F.3d 259, 267 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that in order to convince a seller to take the risks inherent in the sale of drugs, \"a drug purchaser can often `sweeten the pot,' offering to purchase not only drugs, but other illegal goods as well\"). On these facts, a jury could have reasonably concluded that, at least in Roberson's mind, the gun deal and the drug deal were intertwined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Improper testimony</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During its case-in-chief, the government asked Mena whether he knew \"which is more addictive, crack or cocaine powder?\" The district court overruled Roberson's subsequent objection, and Mena answered, \"I believe crack is more addictive.\" When asked which drug is \"stronger,\" Mena again answered, \"crack.\" Mena then testified that when he had been a drug dealer, he had sold powder cocaine, but that Roberson had been a crack dealer. During its closing argument, the government stated, \"Eric Mena told you that he was a cocaine dealer and that Kurt Roberson was a crack dealer. Eric Mena also told you that as between cocaine and crack, crack is more potent and addictive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Roberson contends that the government failed to lay a sufficient foundation to ground Mena's opinion because it did not establish that Mena was an expert on the addictive properties of cocaine, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702, or offer evidence about Mena's lay perceptions as to the different addictive qualities or relative potency of crack versus powder cocaine, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Evid. 701. Roberson contends that the improperly admitted evidence was both misleading (in that it is the difference in the typical method of administration, not any difference in the inherent properties of the two forms of cocaine, that causes an increased risk of addiction with crack)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and highly prejudicial (in that the improper testimony and closing argument was aimed at bolstering Mena's character, while degrading Roberson's). Because Mena's testimony was critical to the government's case, Roberson argues, a new trial is necessary. The government concedes, correctly, that it did not lay an adequate foundation to ground Mena's testimony. Nevertheless, the government argues that the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Roberson's guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that the error was harmless because it is \"highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d 79, 95 (1st Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted) (describing the harmless error standard for non-constitutional evidentiary errors). Roberson attempts to rebut the government's \"overwhelming evidence\" argument by pointing to various weaknesses in the government's case. For instance, Roberson asserts, the testimony of agents Kappler and Quinn identifying Roberson was fallible. But even assuming that this testimony was not overwhelming by itself, it is notable that all of the government's evidence, including the testimony of Kappler and Quinn, and the recorded audio and video evidence, corroborates Mena's account of what happened. Given the wealth of evidence supporting Mena's testimony, it is highly unlikely that his veracity, at least with respect to the events of March 10 and 11, 2003, was seriously questioned by the jury. Moreover, we doubt that the jury would view the relative addictiveness of crack versus powder cocaine to be an important factor for drawing its conclusions about the character of the two men. Mena admitted on the stand that he was a dealer of, among other drugs, powder cocaine. It is highly improbable that any diminutive boost Mena's credibility may have received from being cast as a dealer of a less addictive form of cocaine would have influenced the jury's verdicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C.

Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 32D. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) (providing a 20-year mandatory minimum for any person convicted under &#167; 841(a) that has \"a prior conviction for a felony drug offense\"). Roberson argued that the prior Massachusetts conviction was not a \"felony drug offense\" under &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) because Massachusetts law categorized the offense as a misdemeanor. The district court rejected Roberson's argument, finding that the CSA clearly defines a \"felony drug offense\" as any prior conviction for an offense <i>punishable</i> by more than one year of imprisonment. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(44). Because Roberson's 1996 Massachusetts conviction was punishable by up to two years in prison, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 32C, the court found that it qualified as a \"felony drug offense\" notwithstanding the state's classification of the offense as a misdemeanor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Roberson contends that the district court erred by applying the 20-year mandatory minimum to the drug charge. Roberson's arguments hinge on the premise that <i>two</i> defined terms are triggered by &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). Citing to several canons of statutory construction and to the legislative history of the CSA, he argues that the definition of \"felony drug offense\" contained in &#167; 802(44) is modified by the definition of \"felony\" contained in &#167; 802(13). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(13) (\"The term `felony' means any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\"). Roberson contends that both of these definitions must be satisfied to trigger &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)'s 20-year mandatory minimum. Under Roberson's interpretation, a prior conviction is a \"<i>felony</i> drug offense\" under &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) only if the prior drug offense is <i>both</i> (1) punishable by more than one year in jail, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 802(44), <i>and</i> (2) classified as a felony by the relevant federal or state authority, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 802(13).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recent D.C.

West,</i> 393 F.3d 1302 (D.C.Cir.2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Like Roberson, the defendant in <i>West</i> had been convicted under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a) and (b)(1)(A)(iii) for distributing more than 50 grams of cocaine base. The district court increased the mandatory minimum from ten to 20 years based on a prior drug conviction in Maryland that was classified by that state as a misdemeanor, but which was punishable by up to four years in prison. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit vacated the defendant's 20-year sentence, holding that the definition of \"felony drug offense\" provided by &#167; 802(44) must be read in conjunction with the definition of \"felony\" provided by &#167; 802(13). The D.C. Circuit found the defendant's position&#8212;that Congress intended \"felony drug offense\" to incorporate the definitions contained in both &#167; 802(13) and 802(44)&#8212;was \"at least as plausible\" as the government's&#8212;that &#167; 802(44) alone controls. <i>Id.</i> at 1315. Invoking the rule of lenity, the court held that the enhancement provision of &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) is limited \"to those instances in which the prior drug offense is <i>both</i> punishable by more than one year and classified as a felony by controlling authority.\" <i>Id.</i> Roberson argues that, even if we do not adopt his construction of the statute, we should follow the D.C.

As such, our review is de novo. <i>Doyle v.

We therefore reject Roberson's arguments and decline to invoke the rule of lenity. <i>See United States v.

Law No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236; <i>see generally Gonzales v. Raich,</i> 545 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). The Act is subdivided into three titles. The CSA, established in Title II, addresses the control of drugs and the enforcement of drug laws, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 801-904, while Title III, aptly named the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (\"Import Act\"), concerns their import and export to and from the United States, <i>see id.</i> &#167;&#167; 951-971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part D of the CSA lays out the substantive offenses and the attendant penalties. As is relevant here, Part D makes it unlawful \"for any person knowingly or intentionally&#8212;(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(a)(1). Pursuant to the \"penalties\" provision of that section, \"any person who violates\" &#167; 841(a) through conduct involving, inter alia, \"50 grams or more of a mixture\" containing cocaine base, \"shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). Further on, the same subsection provides that \"[i]f any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a <i>felony drug offense</i> has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years.\" <i>Id.</i> (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 802 provides definitions for the terms used in the CSA and the Import Act. The two relevant definitions provide as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"felony\" means any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"felony drug offense\" means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant stimulant substances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 802(13), (44).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most logical interpretation of &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), we believe, is that the phrase \"felony drug offense\" is a term of art invoked intentionally by Congress to incorporate by reference the specific definition contained in &#167; 802(44). <i>Cf. United States v. Cordoza-Estrada,</i> 385 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.2004) (holding that the statutory definition of the term \"aggravated felony\" in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(F) \"is a term of art that includes within its ambit certain misdemeanors under state law that carry a sentence of at least one year\"); <i>see also Stenberg v.

Because the term \"felony drug offense\" is specifically defined in &#167; 802(44), and &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) makes use of that precise term, the logical, commonsense way to interpret \"felony drug offense\" in &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) is by reference to the definition in &#167; 802(44). <i>See O'Connell v. Shalala,</i> 79 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[C]ourts are bound to afford statutes a practical, commonsense reading.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson argues that &#167; 802(44)'s definition must be read as incorporating the definition of \"felony\" in &#167; 802(13) because the term \"felony drug offense\" contains within it the defined term \"felony.\" Because the definition of a defined term is ordinarily triggered by every reference to that term within a statute, <i>see</i> 1A &amp; 2A Norman J. Singer, <i>Sutherland: Statutes and Statutory Construction,</i> &#167;&#167; 20:8, 47:7 (6th ed.2000), Roberson argues, the definition of \"felony\" is embedded in both &#167; 802(44)'s definition of and &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)'s reference to \"felony drug offense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the term being defined is not ordinarily read as being itself a part of the definition of the term. If Congress had intended the definition in &#167; 802(44) to cross-reference the definition in &#167; 802(13), it could have indicated such a cross-reference in the text of the <i>definition.</i> For example, Congress could have written &#167; 802(44) to state that \"the term `felony drug offense' means a felony . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, such internal cross-referencing, defining one term by reference in the text of the definition to another defined term, is not unusual in the United States Code. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(5) (defining a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" as requiring, inter alia, \"at least two acts of racketeering activity,\" thereby expressly cross-referencing the separately defined \"racketeering activity\" in &#167; 1961(1)); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(4) (defining a \"financial transaction\" as, inter alia, \"a transaction,\" thereby expressly incorporating the definition of \"transaction\" in &#167; 1956(c)(3));<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>see Zimmerman,</i> 409 F.3d at 475-76 (looking to Congress's method of drafting statutes in other parts of the Code as an aid in interpreting statutory text).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Congress intended to require both definitions for the purposes of &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), but also wished to preserve a distinct definition of \"felony drug offense\" for the purposes of other provisions, it could have accomplished its purposes within the text of &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). For example, Congress could have written &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) to trigger a 20-year mandatory minimum whenever any person commits a violation of &#167; 841(a) \"after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense that is classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony has become final.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress did not use any of these conventions. Thus, we are left with a statutory provision that specifically references a defined term, \"felony drug offense.\" Where, as here, Congress defines what a particular term \"means,\" that definition controls to the exclusion of any meaning that is not explicitly stated in the definition, <i>see Sutherland</i> &#167; 47:7 (citing <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S. 379, 392 &amp; n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979)), and regardless of the ordinary meaning of the words, <i>see id.</i> at &#167; 20:8 (citing <i>Packard Motor Car Co. v.

Reviewing the substantive provisions in the CSA reveals that the term \"felony drug offense\" is utilized only in &#167; 841(b)(1). The term also appears in a parallel provision of the Import Act. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b). In both statutes, the term is used solely to specify the type of prior conviction that will trigger a mandatory sentence enhancement. In some instances, the sentencing floor is enhanced. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(A) and (B); 960(b)(1) and (2) (all doubling the <i>minimum</i> sentence when the defendant's violation of the subject section was committed \"after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final\"). In others, the sentencing ceiling is enhanced. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(C) and (D); 960(b)(3) (all increasing the potential <i>maximum</i> sentence when the defendant's violation of the subject section was committed \"after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final\").

United States,</i> 391 F.3d 338, 346 (1st Cir.2004) (\"The principle is clear that Congress's use of differential language in various sections of the same statute is presumed to be intentional and deserves interpretative weight.\"); <i>Sutherland,</i> &#167; 46:05 (\"[W]here the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.\"). Given the structure of the CSA, and the targeted use of the term \"felony drug offense,\" the logical inference is that Congress intended the statutory enhancements in &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) to be triggered by reference to &#167; 802(44) alone. As the government has suggested, Congress may have wished to avoid the possibility that the substantial consequences of the mandatory sentence enhancements in &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) would turn on the happenstance of a state's classification of a prior offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson's invocations of the canons of statutory construction do not persuade us that the statute is ambiguous. Roberson argues that, because the definitions in &#167; 802(13) and 802(44) are part of the same definitional section and address the same subject matter&#8212;the classification of offenses&#8212;they are coequal and should be read <i>in pari materia</i> (i.e., they should be construed together). <i>See United States v. Kelley,</i> 712 F.2d 884, 889 (1st Cir.1983). Moreover, continues Roberson, if we do not read the definition of \"felony\" in conjunction with the definition of \"felony drug offense,\" then the definition of \"felony\" will become superfluous. <i>See United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc.,</i> 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir.1985) (\"All words and provisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be given effect, and no construction should be adopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless, redundant or superfluous.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above-cited canons, as well as the canon, cited by the government, that a specific provision governs as against a general provision, <i>see Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 504 U.S. 374, 384-85, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), are corollaries of the cardinal rule that courts must strive to harmonize all the provisions of a statute to give them all force and effect, <i>see Sutherland,</i> &#167; 46:06. Absent a conflict between the two provisions, resort to the canons (which are, after all, only tools of construction) is unnecessary. Here, we find no tension between the definition of \"felony\" and the definition of \"felony drug offense.\" Viewing the statute as a whole, the two separate definitions are harmonized by recognizing that they are used for different purposes. The structure of the statute, and the differential use of the two terms, lead us to infer that the terms were <i>intended</i> to carry independent meanings for independent purposes. Applying the doctrine of <i>in pari materia</i> to merge two definitional clauses would thus defeat their very purposes. <i>Cf.

Pub. Law No. 99-570, &#167; 1002, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-4 (1986) (emphasis added). The term \"felony drug offense\" was added to &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) in 1988 and the definition was placed directly in the substantive subsection, but the applicability of the penalty enhancement still depended on the classification of the prior offense as a felony. <i>See</i> Pub. Law No. 100-690, &#167; 6452(a)(2), 102 Stat. 4181, 4371 (1988) (\"[T]he term `felony drug offense' means an offense that is . . . a felony under any law of a State . . . .\"). In 1994, Congress amended the substantive enhancement provisions of both the CSA and the Import Act so that they all uniformly used the term \"felony drug offense.\" <i>See</i> Pub. Law No. 103-322, &#167; 90105, 108 Stat. 1796, 1987-88 (1994). It also replaced the classification-based definition of \"felony drug offense\" with the new sentence-based definition of the term that presently resides in &#167; 802(44). <i>See id.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Roberson contends that the 1994 amendment was intended merely to make uniform the parallel provisions in the CSA and the Import Act. But such a structural intent does not preclude an additional substantive intent: to replace the old classification-based definition of \"felony drug offense\" with a new definition which considers only the potential length of the sentence. <i>See Zimmerman,</i> 409 F.3d at 476 (noting that a court \"may assume that ... Congress was aware\" of the previously existing statutory provisions, and thus that its choice of \"a different formulation\" was intentional). Such an intent makes sense in the context of the evolving nature of the CSA. Initially, the district courts were given broad leeway in fashioning sentences, but Congress reversed course in 1984 by enacting mandatory penalties to avoid sentencing disparities. <i>See</i> Todd E. Gonyer, <i>Federal Sentencing in a Post-Chapman World: What is a \"Mixture or Substance\" Anyhow?,</i> 46 U. Kan. L.Rev. 983, 984-88 (1998). Subsequent amendments in the 1980's increased the consequences of those mandatory penalties. <i>See id.</i> Thus, it would not be surprising to learn that Congress intended the 1994 amendments to ensure that the mandatory recidivist penalty provisions would be applied uniformly not only across statutory lines, but also across state lines.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Roberson also argues that we should vacate his sentence because the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing the 20-year mandatory minimum sentence based on a prior conviction that the government did not prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Although this circuit has previously read<i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), to foreclose such an argument, <i>see United States v. Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir.2005), Roberson urges us to re-examine the issue in light of a trio of recent Supreme Court decisions, <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); and <i>Blakely v.

The district court sentenced Roberson to 300 months' imprisonment. Roberson's appeal challenges his convictions and sentence on several grounds. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began investigating Roberson in early 2003. As part of that investigation, FBI agents engaged the services of a cooperating witness, Eric Mena, who had known Roberson for eight years and had formerly been a drug dealing associate of Roberson's. Mena agreed to make a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from Roberson as part of a plea bargain resolving drug charges against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 10 of that year, FBI agent Edward Kappler outfitted Mena with an electronic transmitter and a digital recorder to enable the FBI to monitor Mena's conversations with Roberson. Mena then went to the home of Raymond Muse, a mutual associate of Roberson and Mena, and informed him that he wanted to buy some crack from Roberson. Muse brought Mena to where Roberson was currently staying. After Roberson entered Mena's car, Mena told him that he needed two ounces of crack. Roberson agreed to provide the drugs the next evening and told Mena that he should call to initiate the pickup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Mena was saving Roberson's phone number on his mobile phone, Roberson spontaneously stated, \"Yo, you got any burners? I can trade you a burner.\" Mena testified at trial that \"burner\" meant handgun, and that he understood Roberson's statement to be an offer to sell him a gun. Roberson described the gun as \"a brand new, 40 cal.\" that was \"like a Glock, top is chrome. The rest is plastic.\" Mena was noncommittal as to that offer but confirmed that he would meet with Roberson the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following evening, Mena, who was again outfitted with a transmitter and an audio recorder, tried several times, unsuccessfully, to reach Roberson on his mobile phone. The FBI directed Mena to drive to Muse's house again. Rather than using his own car, however, Mena drove an undercover car that the FBI had equipped with a hidden video camera. After Muse and Mena successfully contacted Roberson, Muse directed Mena to an apartment complex in a nearby town. Mena drove the undercover car with Muse as his passenger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After they arrived at the apartment complex, Muse located Roberson and brought him to Mena's car. Roberson sat in the front passenger seat next to Mena, while Muse sat in the back. Roberson told Mena, \"I got your sixty grams,\" and then told him it would cost $2,000. As Mena was counting out his money, Roberson looked out the back window and stated, \"I got the rap on me so I'm shook anyway.\" Mena testified at trial that this meant that Roberson was paranoid because he had a handgun on him. Roberson then handed Mena a sandwich bag containing crack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Mena inspected the crack, Roberson pulled a handgun out of his waistband, pointed it in Mena's direction, and stated, \"That's what I'm talking about man.\" Mena told Roberson not to point the gun at him and asked to see it. Roberson handed the gun to Mena, who looked at it and smelled it to see if it had been fired. Mena found the design of the gun to be consistent with a \"Glock\" in that the top was chrome and the bottom was plastic. Mena asked Roberson why he wanted to get rid of the handgun and Roberson replied that the serial numbers had been scratched off. When Mena asked whether the gun had been fired yet, Roberson replied, \"Nah, I don't waste shells, man. I shoot niggas though.\" Mena handed the gun back to Roberson, and they completed the drug transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mena then asked Roberson if he would be interested in buying Mena's car. Mena initiated this conversation outside the car so that FBI agents would have an opportunity to observe Roberson directly. As a result, agent Timothy Quinn, who was conducting physical and audio surveillance nearby, was able to drive within 12 feet of Mena and Roberson as they looked over the vehicle. Roberson then went back into the apartment complex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, a federal grand jury returned a two count indictment charging Roberson of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of more than 50 grams of cocaine base,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"), <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (the \"drug charge\"), and of using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking offense, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (the \"gun charge\"). The government subsequently filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851 providing notice of its intent to seek increased punishment&#8212;the doubling of the drug charge's mandatory minimum sentence from 10 to 20 years&#8212;by reason of a prior conviction. After a five-day trial, including testimony from Mena, Kappler and Quinn, a jury convicted Roberson on both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson moved for a judgment of acquittal both during trial and after the verdict. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a), (c). He argued that there was insufficient evidence establishing that he had possessed crack or had sold more than 50 grams of crack. He also argued that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that he had carried or used a \"firearm,\" as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(3), or that he had carried or used a firearm \"during and in relation to\" the drug transaction. Finally, he argued that, because the government had not offered any evidence establishing his prior conviction, the district court could not impose an increased penalty for the drug conviction. The court denied Roberson's motions in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that the 20-year mandatory minimum applied to the drug charge, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(A)(iii), and a 5-year consecutive mandatory minimum applied to the gun charge, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A). After determining that the Sentencing Guidelines advised a sentencing range of 35 years to life, and considering the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), the court imposed a sentence of 25 years in prison, the statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson now appeals the district court's order denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the gun charge, arguing that the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove either that he carried an actual \"firearm\" or that he carried a firearm \"in relation to\" a drug trafficking offense. He alternatively requests a new trial on the gun charge on the ground that the court erroneously instructed the jury concerning the \"in relation to\" requirement, and a new trial on both charges on the basis of improperly admitted testimony. Finally, Roberson argues that the applicable mandatory minimum sentence for the drug conviction is ten years, not 20 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A. The gun charge</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson challenges the consecutive five-year mandatory minimum sentence he received for using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense\" on several grounds. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A). We begin with Roberson's contention that the district court incorrectly instructed on the \"in relation to\" requirement, and compounded the error by simply restating the same erroneous instruction when the jury sought clarification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, both Roberson and the government submitted proposed jury instructions addressing the gun charge. The government proposed the First Circuit pattern jury instruction, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To \"carry\" a firearm during and in relation to a crime means to move or transport the firearm on one's person or in a vehicle or container during and in relation to the crime. It need not be immediately accessible. To \"use\" a firearm during and in relation to a crime means to employ the firearm actively, such as to brandish, display, barter, strike with, fire or attempt to fire it, or even to refer to it in a way calculated to affect the underlying crime. The firearm must have played a role in the crime or must have been intended by the defendant to play a role in the crime. That need not have been its sole purpose, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See</i> First Circuit Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions &#167; 4.07 (1998). The pattern instruction purposefully declines to define \"in relation to\" separately from the terms \"carry\" and \"use.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167; 4.07 cmt. 3 (\"It seems best not to define `use or carry' separately from `during and in relation to.'\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Roberson, however, drawing on language from <i>Smith v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span> (1993), proposed that a paragraph be added to directly address this requirement. The court agreed to instruct the jury on the \"in relation to\" element, but declined to adopt Roberson's proposal wholesale. Instead, it crafted its own instruction based on language from <i>Smith:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The words \"during and in relation to\" are to be given their plain and customary meaning. The phrase \"in relation to\" is expansive. At a minimum it means that the firearm must have had some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime. If a firearm is present simply as a result of coincidence or accident it cannot be said that it was used or carried in relation to the drug traffic[king] offense. The firearm must have facilitated or have had the potential to facilitate the drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a pre-charge conference, Roberson objected to the statement \"the phrase `in relation to' is expansive.\" He argued that the word \"expansive\" erroneously implied that the phrase \"in relation to\" was intended to expand, rather than limit, the phrase \"used or carried.\" The district court denied the objection and delivered the pattern jury instruction along with the \"in relation to\" insert that it had crafted. After the charge, Roberson failed to renew his objection, and the jury retired to deliberate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the first full day of deliberations, the jury submitted a note asking: \"Does carrying a firearm during but independent of a drug transaction constitute the use of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking?\" Contending that the word \"independent\" means the opposite of \"in relation to,\" Roberson requested the court to directly answer the jury's question in the negative. The court, however, agreed with the government that such an instruction would risk providing the jury with a decisive conclusion. The court therefore elected to simply re-read the gun charge instruction in the hope that hearing the instruction again would help the jury resolve the question internally. Before the court summoned the jury, Roberson again objected that the instruction was erroneous insofar as it stated that \"in relation to\" is \"expansive.\" After the re-reading of the instruction, the jury returned its verdicts later that day without additional inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To preserve an objection to a jury instruction under Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), a litigant must lodge a specific objection and state the grounds for the objection <i>after</i> the court has charged the jury and before the jury begins deliberations. <i>See United States v.

Roberson contends that the second objection effectively served Rule 30(d)'s purpose \"to bring to the attention of the trial court errors or omissions in its charge so that they may be corrected before the case goes to the jury.\" <i>United States v.

But the <i>case</i> had already gone to the jury. Roberson's renewed objection, registered after the jury had begun its deliberations, came too late to satisfy Rule 30(d). <i>See United States v.

Indeed, federal appellate courts continue to cite <i>Smith</i> for the proposition that \"in relation to\" is \"expansive.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v.

DeStefano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196179\"><a href=\"/opinion/196179/united-states-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1995). Although one definition of \"expansive\" is \"capable of expanding or tending to expand,\" The Am. Heritage Dictionary 624 (4th ed.2000), another is \"broad in size or extent; comprehensive.\" <i>Id.</i> Only the latter definition makes sense in the context of the instruction as a whole. The sentences immediately following the \"expansive\" instruction state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a minimum [\"in relation to\"] means that the firearm must have had some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime. If a firearm is present simply as a result of coincidence or accident it cannot be said that it was used or carried in relation to the drug traffic[king] offense. The firearm must have facilitated or have had the potential to facilitate the drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the limiting language of those sentences, it would be illogical to read the sentence containing the word \"expansive\" in the way Roberson suggests. When read in its entirety, the \"in relation to\" instruction adequately and accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase as described in <i>Smith.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson counters that the jury's mid-deliberation question illustrates that there was confusion with the instruction. He argues that the district court therefore erred by not directly answering the jury's question as he suggested: that \"if it is their conclusion that the gun was either used or carried independent of the drug trafficking offense, that would mean that it was not either used or carried in relation to the drug trafficking crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.

Here, the court anticipated that the jury might wrestle with the issue of whether the gun was used or carried \"in relation to\" the drug transaction. At Roberson's behest, the court carefully crafted an instruction, consistent with <i>Smith,</i> to aid the jury's evaluation of the \"in relation to\" requirement. Under the circumstances, it was well within the court's discretion to eschew \"elaborat[ing] on these initial, entirely correct instructions\" and instead, elect simply \"to refer the jury to the original formulation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is especially so given the phrasing of the jury question, which suggested that the jury was putting it to the court to make the dispositive decision.

Here, Mena's testimony was sufficient to ground the jury's finding. Although Mena was not a firearms expert, he testified that he was familiar with handguns, having held them on several occasions. Mena testified that he had the opportunity to hold and closely inspect Roberson's handgun. Mena took advantage of that opportunity, smelling it to see if it had been fired, and noticing that the serial numbers had been scratched off. At trial, Mena provided details about the gun (that it looked new and had chrome on the top with a black plastic bottom), noted that its design (a plastic bottom) was commonly referred to by his associates in the drug trade as a \"Glock,\" and stated that it \"felt like a handgun.\" Although Mena observed the gun at night inside a car with the interior lights off, such factors go only to the weight of Mena's testimony, and would not prevent a rational jury from crediting Mena's opinion. <i>Cf. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 976 (finding sufficient lay witness testimony by a bank teller and a customer service representative who \"observed the object gripped by [the defendant] at close range\"); <i>Kirvan,</i> 997 F.2d at 966-67 (finding sufficient lay witness testimony of two individuals who described seeing the defendant holding what appeared to be a gun, and who stated that it sounded \"heavy\" when it fell to the ground).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson also contends that a rational jury could not have found that Roberson used or carried the gun \"in relation to\" a drug trafficking offense because the evidence established, at most, that he carried the gun for the independent purpose of offering it to Mena after completion of the drug transaction.

Nonetheless, the phrase has been construed broadly, and encompasses a variety of situations where the firearm facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the drug trafficking offense. <i>See, e.g., Smith,</i> 508 U.S. at 229, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, facilitation of the underlying drug offense need not be the defendant's sole purpose for possessing the weapon. <i>See United States v.

The jury could have reasoned that Roberson brandished the gun to embolden himself or to intimidate Mena. <i>See United States v. Eaton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532749\"><a href=\"/opinion/532749/united-states-v-thomas-otis-eaton/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 512 (1st Cir.1989). At their first meeting, Roberson informed Mena that he had a handgun to trade. A rational jury could infer that Roberson intended that statement to put Mena on notice that he would be armed on the day of the drug transaction. Sure enough, during the transaction, before Mena finished paying for the crack, Roberson pulled the handgun from his waistband, pointed it in Mena's direction, and proclaimed, \"that's what I'm talking about.\" Further demonstrating his deadly potential, Roberson informed Mena that, while he does not \"waste shells,\" he does \"shoot niggas.\" Although the evidence that Roberson subsequently handed the gun to Mena may weaken the theory that Roberson was using the gun to intimidate Mena, the above evidence was sufficient to ground the jury's verdict. <i>See Plummer,</i> 964 F.2d at 1255 (noting that while the facts may permit multiple inferences, \"the factfinder is entitled to choose among reasonable interpretations of the evidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the jury believed that the gun was carried only for the purpose of attempting to sell it to Mena, it still could have reasonably concluded that the gun was carried \"in relation to\" the drug transaction. At the first meeting, when Mena asked Roberson for crack, Roberson mentioned that he had a gun he wanted to trade. The next day, as Mena was counting his money, Roberson handed the gun to Mena for his inspection and stated that he was nervous about carrying the gun because the serial numbers were scratched off. Indeed, it appeared to Mena that Roberson was anxious to get rid of the gun. From this testimony, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the opportunity to trade the gun was an incentive for Roberson to agree to Mena's request for crack. <i>Cf. United States v. Lipford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767595\"><a href=\"/opinion/767595/united-states-v-victor-jermaine-lipford-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 267 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that in order to convince a seller to take the risks inherent in the sale of drugs, \"a drug purchaser can often `sweeten the pot,' offering to purchase not only drugs, but other illegal goods as well\"). On these facts, a jury could have reasonably concluded that, at least in Roberson's mind, the gun deal and the drug deal were intertwined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Improper testimony</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During its case-in-chief, the government asked Mena whether he knew \"which is more addictive, crack or cocaine powder?\" The district court overruled Roberson's subsequent objection, and Mena answered, \"I believe crack is more addictive.\" When asked which drug is \"stronger,\" Mena again answered, \"crack.\" Mena then testified that when he had been a drug dealer, he had sold powder cocaine, but that Roberson had been a crack dealer. During its closing argument, the government stated, \"Eric Mena told you that he was a cocaine dealer and that Kurt Roberson was a crack dealer. Eric Mena also told you that as between cocaine and crack, crack is more potent and addictive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Roberson contends that the government failed to lay a sufficient foundation to ground Mena's opinion because it did not establish that Mena was an expert on the addictive properties of cocaine, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702, or offer evidence about Mena's lay perceptions as to the different addictive qualities or relative potency of crack versus powder cocaine, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Evid. 701. Roberson contends that the improperly admitted evidence was both misleading (in that it is the difference in the typical method of administration, not any difference in the inherent properties of the two forms of cocaine, that causes an increased risk of addiction with crack)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and highly prejudicial (in that the improper testimony and closing argument was aimed at bolstering Mena's character, while degrading Roberson's). Because Mena's testimony was critical to the government's case, Roberson argues, a new trial is necessary. The government concedes, correctly, that it did not lay an adequate foundation to ground Mena's testimony. Nevertheless, the government argues that the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Roberson's guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that the error was harmless because it is \"highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201500\"><a href=\"/opinion/201500/united-states-v-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted) (describing the harmless error standard for non-constitutional evidentiary errors). Roberson attempts to rebut the government's \"overwhelming evidence\" argument by pointing to various weaknesses in the government's case. For instance, Roberson asserts, the testimony of agents Kappler and Quinn identifying Roberson was fallible. But even assuming that this testimony was not overwhelming by itself, it is notable that all of the government's evidence, including the testimony of Kappler and Quinn, and the recorded audio and video evidence, corroborates Mena's account of what happened. Given the wealth of evidence supporting Mena's testimony, it is highly unlikely that his veracity, at least with respect to the events of March 10 and 11, 2003, was seriously questioned by the jury. Moreover, we doubt that the jury would view the relative addictiveness of crack versus powder cocaine to be an important factor for drawing its conclusions about the character of the two men. Mena admitted on the stand that he was a dealer of, among other drugs, powder cocaine. It is highly improbable that any diminutive boost Mena's credibility may have received from being cast as a dealer of a less addictive form of cocaine would have influenced the jury's verdicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C. Sentence</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court heard argument concerning whether the mandatory minimum sentence on the drug charge should be doubled from ten years to 20 years in light of Roberson's 1996 Massachusetts conviction for distribution of marijuana in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 32D. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) (providing a 20-year mandatory minimum for any person convicted under &#167; 841(a) that has \"a prior conviction for a felony drug offense\"). Roberson argued that the prior Massachusetts conviction was not a \"felony drug offense\" under &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) because Massachusetts law categorized the offense as a misdemeanor. The district court rejected Roberson's argument, finding that the CSA clearly defines a \"felony drug offense\" as any prior conviction for an offense <i>punishable</i> by more than one year of imprisonment. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(44). Because Roberson's 1996 Massachusetts conviction was punishable by up to two years in prison, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 32C, the court found that it qualified as a \"felony drug offense\" notwithstanding the state's classification of the offense as a misdemeanor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Roberson contends that the district court erred by applying the 20-year mandatory minimum to the drug charge. Roberson's arguments hinge on the premise that <i>two</i> defined terms are triggered by &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). Citing to several canons of statutory construction and to the legislative history of the CSA, he argues that the definition of \"felony drug offense\" contained in &#167; 802(44) is modified by the definition of \"felony\" contained in &#167; 802(13). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(13) (\"The term `felony' means any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\"). Roberson contends that both of these definitions must be satisfied to trigger &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)'s 20-year mandatory minimum. Under Roberson's interpretation, a prior conviction is a \"<i>felony</i> drug offense\" under &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) only if the prior drug offense is <i>both</i> (1) punishable by more than one year in jail, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 802(44), <i>and</i> (2) classified as a felony by the relevant federal or state authority, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 802(13).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recent D.C.

The district court increased the mandatory minimum from ten to 20 years based on a prior drug conviction in Maryland that was classified by that state as a misdemeanor, but which was punishable by up to four years in prison. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit vacated the defendant's 20-year sentence, holding that the definition of \"felony drug offense\" provided by &#167; 802(44) must be read in conjunction with the definition of \"felony\" provided by &#167; 802(13). The D.C. Circuit found the defendant's position&#8212;that Congress intended \"felony drug offense\" to incorporate the definitions contained in both &#167; 802(13) and 802(44)&#8212;was \"at least as plausible\" as the government's&#8212;that &#167; 802(44) alone controls. <i>Id.</i> at 1315. Invoking the rule of lenity, the court held that the enhancement provision of &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) is limited \"to those instances in which the prior drug offense is <i>both</i> punishable by more than one year and classified as a felony by controlling authority.\" <i>Id.</i> Roberson argues that, even if we do not adopt his construction of the statute, we should follow the D.C.

The CSA, established in Title II, addresses the control of drugs and the enforcement of drug laws, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 801-904, while Title III, aptly named the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (\"Import Act\"), concerns their import and export to and from the United States, <i>see id.</i> &#167;&#167; 951-971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part D of the CSA lays out the substantive offenses and the attendant penalties.

Pursuant to the \"penalties\" provision of that section, \"any person who violates\" &#167; 841(a) through conduct involving, inter alia, \"50 grams or more of a mixture\" containing cocaine base, \"shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).

Because the term \"felony drug offense\" is specifically defined in &#167; 802(44), and &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) makes use of that precise term, the logical, commonsense way to interpret \"felony drug offense\" in &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) is by reference to the definition in &#167; 802(44). <i>See O'Connell v.

Singer, <i>Sutherland: Statutes and Statutory Construction,</i> &#167;&#167; 20:8, 47:7 (6th ed.2000), Roberson argues, the definition of \"felony\" is embedded in both &#167; 802(44)'s definition of and &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)'s reference to \"felony drug offense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the term being defined is not ordinarily read as being itself a part of the definition of the term. If Congress had intended the definition in &#167; 802(44) to cross-reference the definition in &#167; 802(13), it could have indicated such a cross-reference in the text of the <i>definition.</i> For example, Congress could have written &#167; 802(44) to state that \"the term `felony drug offense' means a felony . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, such internal cross-referencing, defining one term by reference in the text of the definition to another defined term, is not unusual in the United States Code. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(5) (defining a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" as requiring, inter alia, \"at least two acts of racketeering activity,\" thereby expressly cross-referencing the separately defined \"racketeering activity\" in &#167; 1961(1)); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(4) (defining a \"financial transaction\" as, inter alia, \"a transaction,\" thereby expressly incorporating the definition of \"transaction\" in &#167; 1956(c)(3));<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>see Zimmerman,</i> 409 F.3d at 475-76 (looking to Congress's method of drafting statutes in other parts of the Code as an aid in interpreting statutory text).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Congress intended to require both definitions for the purposes of &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), but also wished to preserve a distinct definition of \"felony drug offense\" for the purposes of other provisions, it could have accomplished its purposes within the text of &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). For example, Congress could have written &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) to trigger a 20-year mandatory minimum whenever any person commits a violation of &#167; 841(a) \"after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense that is classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony has become final.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress did not use any of these conventions.

Reviewing the substantive provisions in the CSA reveals that the term \"felony drug offense\" is utilized only in &#167; 841(b)(1). The term also appears in a parallel provision of the Import Act. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b).

Given the structure of the CSA, and the targeted use of the term \"felony drug offense,\" the logical inference is that Congress intended the statutory enhancements in &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) to be triggered by reference to &#167; 802(44) alone. As the government has suggested, Congress may have wished to avoid the possibility that the substantial consequences of the mandatory sentence enhancements in &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) would turn on the happenstance of a state's classification of a prior offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberson's invocations of the canons of statutory construction do not persuade us that the statute is ambiguous.

Absent a conflict between the two provisions, resort to the canons (which are, after all, only tools of construction) is unnecessary.

The structure of the statute, and the differential use of the two terms, lead us to infer that the terms were <i>intended</i> to carry independent meanings for independent purposes. Applying the doctrine of <i>in pari materia</i> to merge two definitional clauses would thus defeat their very purposes. <i>Cf.

Pub. Law No. 99-570, &#167; 1002, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-4 (1986) (emphasis added). The term \"felony drug offense\" was added to &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) in 1988 and the definition was placed directly in the substantive subsection, but the applicability of the penalty enhancement still depended on the classification of the prior offense as a felony. <i>See</i> Pub. Law No. 100-690, &#167; 6452(a)(2), 102 Stat. 4181, 4371 (1988) (\"[T]he term `felony drug offense' means an offense that is . . . a felony under any law of a State . . . .\"). In 1994, Congress amended the substantive enhancement provisions of both the CSA and the Import Act so that they all uniformly used the term \"felony drug offense.\" <i>See</i> Pub. Law No. 103-322, &#167; 90105, 108 Stat. 1796, 1987-88 (1994). It also replaced the classification-based definition of \"felony drug offense\" with the new sentence-based definition of the term that presently resides in &#167; 802(44). <i>See id.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Roberson contends that the 1994 amendment was intended merely to make uniform the parallel provisions in the CSA and the Import Act. But such a structural intent does not preclude an additional substantive intent: to replace the old classification-based definition of \"felony drug offense\" with a new definition which considers only the potential length of the sentence. <i>See Zimmerman,</i> 409 F.3d at 476 (noting that a court \"may assume that ... Congress was aware\" of the previously existing statutory provisions, and thus that its choice of \"a different formulation\" was intentional). Such an intent makes sense in the context of the evolving nature of the CSA. Initially, the district courts were given broad leeway in fashioning sentences, but Congress reversed course in 1984 by enacting mandatory penalties to avoid sentencing disparities. <i>See</i> Todd E. Gonyer, <i>Federal Sentencing in a Post-Chapman World: What is a \"Mixture or Substance\" Anyhow?,</i> 46 U. Kan. L.Rev. 983, 984-88 (1998). Subsequent amendments in the 1980's increased the consequences of those mandatory penalties. <i>See id.</i> Thus, it would not be surprising to learn that Congress intended the 1994 amendments to ensure that the mandatory recidivist penalty provisions would be applied uniformly not only across statutory lines, but also across state lines.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Roberson also argues that we should vacate his sentence because the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing the 20-year mandatory minimum sentence based on a prior conviction that the government did not prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
