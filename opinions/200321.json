George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert L. Sheketoff for petitioner.\n     Cathryn A. Neaves, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nBureau, with whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief\nfor respondent.\n\n\n\n                        February 5, 2003\n\f            BOUDIN,   Chief   Judge.      In   this    case,   which   raises\n\nquestions    concerning    habeas   corpus,      the   relevant   dates   are\n\nimportant. On April 13, 1992, petitioner Stephen David pled guilty\n\nin a Massachusetts state court to second-degree murder and was\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment.         The crime was described in the\n\nplea colloquy: briefly stated, David and others, camping at a tent\n\ncity in Quincy, Massachusetts, killed one of their number (Abraham\n\nChamplain) by beating and otherwise mistreating him over the course\n\nof several days and leaving him to die of his injuries and exposure\n\nto cold.    The members of the group, including David, had consumed\n\nalcohol.\n\n            No direct appeal was taken from the conviction. Instead,\n\nmore than three years after his plea and sentencing, David filed in\n\nthe trial court two successive motions to withdraw his guilty plea\n\nand obtain a new trial, which under state law is a permissible form\n\nof   collateral   attack   after    a   guilty    plea.     Constantine    v.\n\nCommonwealth, 435 Mass. 1011, 1012, 760 N.E.2d 733, 735 (2002).\n\nBoth motions were rejected by the trial court and the intermediate\n\nappellate court and, in both cases, the Supreme Judicial Court\n\ndenied review.    The first motion was filed on or about July 17,\n\n1995, and SJC review was denied on December 29, 1997; the second\n\nwas filed on May 5, 1998, and SJC review was denied on June 29,\n\n2000.   David did not seek certiorari on either ruling from the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f          On    March   29,    2001,   David    filed   the    present    habeas\n\nproceeding in the federal district court.           In his petition, David\n\nasserts that, for second degree murder, Massachusetts law required\n\nthat he know that his actions had a \"plain and strong likelihood\"\n\nof causing Champlain's death.           Commonwealth v. Sneed, 413 Mass.\n\n387, 388 n.1, 597 N.E.2d 1346, 1347 n.1 (1992).               And, he asserts,\n\nthe trial judge committed constitutional error by misadvising David\n\nat the plea colloquy that an intent to cause injury was sufficient.\n\nSee Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. 637, 643-46 (1976).                    He also\n\nasserts that, due to his intoxication, a jury could not have found\n\nthat he had the intent required under state law.\n\n          In fact, at the plea colloquy, the trial judge used both\n\nphrases, saying that an intent to injure was enough and that there\n\nhad to be knowledge of \"a plain and strong likelihood\" of death.\n\nBut whether the instruction was confusing (the state courts said\n\nno) and, if so, whether it constituted a constitutional violation\n\nare issues not before us.      This is so because in opposing the writ,\n\nthe Commonwealth pled that regardless of its merits, David's\n\npetition came    too    late   under    the    deadlines   fixed   for    habeas\n\npetitions by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n\n1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. § 2241 et seq. (2000).\n\n          AEDPA, which became effective on April 24, 1996, fixes a\n\none-year limitations period for federal habeas petitions by state\n\nprisoners.     28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).          Statutory exceptions exist\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fwhere the state impeded relief, new constitutional rights were\n\ncreated by the Supreme Court, or newly discovered facts underpin\n\nthe claim, id. § 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D), but David does not claim to\n\nfall within any of these exceptions.          Absent an exception, AEDPA's\n\none-year limit runs from the time that the state court judgment of\n\nconviction became final by the conclusion of direct review or the\n\nexpiration of the time for seeking it.                Id. § 2244(d)(1)(A).\n\nHowever, defendants like David, convicted prior to AEDPA, can file\n\ntheir   petitions    within     one    year   of   AEDPA's   effective     date.\n\nGaskins v. Duval, 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           A   magistrate     judge    recommended    dismissal     of   David's\n\npetition on the ground that it was barred by AEDPA's time limit.\n\nAEDPA excludes from the one-year period \"[t]he time during which a\n\nproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other\n\ncollateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim\n\nis pending . . . .\"     28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).        The magistrate judge\n\nexcluded from the calculation the days in which the two state new\n\ntrial motions were pending (measuring from the dates of their\n\nfilings   to   the   ultimate    SJC    dispositions).       Even   with    this\n\nexclusion, David's petition was filed 399 days after AEDPA's\n\nenactment and, therefore, more than the 365 days allowed.                    The\n\ndistrict court adopted the recommendation.\n\n           David then sought a certificate of appealability (\"COA\"),\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), which the district court denied.               This court\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthen granted the COA and asked the parties to brief several issues:\n\nDavid's claim that 180 days should be added to the excluded period\n\nfor the time in which he could have sought certiorari in the United\n\nStates Supreme Court;1 his alternative request that the time period\n\nbe \"equitably tolled\" because of his attorney's error in filing\n\nlate; and his claim that the Constitution's Suspension Clause\n\noverrides the AEDPA limit when the petitioner asserts that he is\n\nactually innocent of the underlying offense.           We now address these\n\nissues in the same order.\n\n          David's first argument--that 180 days should be added to\n\nthe excluded period--is easily answered.         Congress excluded from\n\nthe one-year   period   the   time    during   which    \"a   properly   filed\n\napplication for State post-conviction or other collateral               review\n\n. . . is pending . . . .\"            Id. § 2244(d)(2).       The reason is\n\nobvious. During the period when the state courts are reviewing the\n\nclaims, a federal petition would likely be dismissed or held as\n\npremature and would at best simply be held until state remedies\n\nwere exhausted.   28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A).\n\n          Nothing in the language or policy of this exclusion\n\nwarrants adding to the excluded period an additional period during\n\nwhich the petitioner could have, but did not, seek certiorari in\n\n\n     1\n      A petitioner in a criminal case has 90 days to petition the\nUnited States Supreme Court after receiving a final judgment from\nthe highest court of his state. S. Ct. R. 13(1). Because David\nreceived two adverse judgments from the SJC, he has asked that the\nlimitations period be tolled 180 days.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthe Supreme Court from the denial of collateral remedies. Once the\n\nSJC denied review as to the first new trial motion, nothing was\n\npending in either state or federal court nor was any further action\n\never taken in any court with respect to that motion.   The same is\n\ntrue for the second motion.   Thus, to say that David's collateral\n\nattack proceedings were pending in any court during the 90-day\n\nperiods after the SJC denials is at odds with ordinary usage.2\n\n          If anything more were needed, it is supplied by the\n\ncontrasting language of a companion AEDPA provision.        In the\n\nordinary post-AEDPA case, the one-year period (exceptions aside)\n\nruns from the later of two dates: \"the date . . . the judgment\n\nbecame final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration\n\nof the time for seeking such review.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A)\n\n(emphasis supplied). Thus, if David had been convicted after trial\n\nand fought his conviction through the SJC, he would automatically\n\nhave gotten the benefit of the additional 90 days for seeking\n\ncertiorari--that is, those days would have been excluded from the\n\none-year period by virtue of the underscored language.     No such\n\nlanguage appears in the collateral attack provision applicable\n\nhere.\n\n\n     2\n      The state further argues that the reference to \"State post-\nconviction or other collateral review\" necessarily excludes the\nfederal certiorari process, so that the result would be the same\neven if David had filed for certiorari. Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S.\n167 (2001), on which the state heavily relies, is arguably\ndistinguishable and there are language and policy arguments on the\nother side, but the issue need not be resolved in this case.\n\n                               -6-\n\f            David says that he had no direct review remedy under\n\nstate law because of his guilty plea so that, to create equality of\n\nopportunity, the underscored language should be read into the\n\ncollateral attack provision or the collateral attack should be\n\nequated in this case with direct review.                This argument has the\n\nmatter     backwards.      Congress      did   not   aim    at   equality:     it\n\nspecifically provided a more generous exclusion of time where\n\ndirect review was involved and, consistent with the spirit of\n\nAEDPA, took a stricter view as to state post-conviction remedies.\n\n            David next argues that the running of the limitations\n\nperiod should be equitably tolled because the failure to file the\n\npetition within the required period was due to error by David's\n\ncounsel.    The factual premise is an affidavit from counsel stating\n\nthat he could have filed the petition earlier but did not think\n\nthis was required. \"Equitable tolling\" is an umbrella term for the\n\nnotion that a statute of limitations--unless its time limit is\n\n\"jurisdictional\"--may          be   extended   for   equitable     reasons     not\n\nacknowledged in the statute creating the limitations period.                 See,\n\ne.g., Delaney v. Matesanz, 264 F.3d 7, 13-14 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Section     2244    does   not   describe    its   time   limits   as\n\njurisdictional, either in its own terms or otherwise, nor does the\n\nCommonwealth invoke that label.          See Miller v. N.J. State Dept. of\n\nCorrections, 145 F.3d 616, 617-18 (3d Cir. 1998).                Still, section\n\n2244(d) comprises six paragraphs defining its one-year limitations\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fperiod in detail and adopting very specific exceptions.                     Congress\n\nlikely did not conceive that the courts would add new exceptions\n\nand it is even more doubtful that it would have approved of such an\n\neffort.       Taliani v. Chrans,         189 F.3d 597, 598 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\nAEDPA reflects Congress' view that the courts were being too\n\ngenerous with habeas relief and that the whole system needed to be\n\ntightened up.         See H.R. Rep. No. 104-518, at 111 (1996).\n\n                  Nevertheless, many circuits have held or assumed that\n\nequitable tolling is available,3 and we will proceed here on that\n\narguendo assumption.               The \"exclusion\" inference against such a\n\nreading of section 2244 is matched, as such rubrics often are, by\n\na counter inference: that Congress acts against the background of\n\nexisting decisional doctrine unless it negates the doctrine. Young\n\nv. United States. 122 S. Ct. 1036, 1040 (2002).                          This court,\n\nalthough      it     has    never    decided    whether    equitable     tolling   is\n\npermitted under section 2244, Lattimore v. Dubois, 311 F.3d 46, 55\n\n(1st       Cir.    2002),    has    elsewhere    been     willing   to   read   AEDPA\n\ncreatively.          See Evicci v. Commissioner of Corrections, 226 F.3d\n\n26, 28 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                  If equitable tolling is available to extend section\n\n2244(d)'s limitations period, it can only do so for the most\n\nexceptional reasons.           One of AEDPA's main purposes was to compel\n\n\n       3\n      See e.g., Dunlap v. United States, 250 F.3d 1001, 1004-06\n(6th Cir.), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 649 (2001); Taliani, 189 F.3d\nat 598; Miller, 145 F.3d at 617-18 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\n                                          -8-\n\fhabeas petitions to be filed promptly after conviction and direct\n\nreview, to limit their number, and to permit delayed or second\n\npetitions    only     in   fairly   narrow   and   explicitly   defined\n\ncircumstances.      28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A)-(D); H.R. Rep. No. 104-\n\n518, supra at 111.     To bypass these restrictions for reasons other\n\nthan those given in the statute could be defended, if at all, only\n\nfor the most exigent reasons.\n\n            Here, the magistrate judge thought, and the district\n\ncourt, agreed, that a mistake by counsel in reading the statute or\n\ncomputing the time limit is, at most, a routine error.      Indeed, it\n\nwould not even constitute \"excusable neglect\" under Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(5).    See Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., 212 F.3d 624, 630-31 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). Even apart from AEDPA, the Supreme Court has said that \"the\n\nprinciples of equitable tolling . . . do not extend to what is at\n\nbest a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.\"       Irwin v. Dep't\n\nof Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990).4      If carelessness were\n\nan escape hatch from statutes of limitations, they would hardly\n\never bar claims.\n\n            David's final argument is that the limitations period, if\n\notherwise applicable to him and unmitigated here by equitable\n\ntolling, violates the Constitution.       Article I, section 9, clause\n\n\n     4\n      Unsurprisingly, cases involving capital punishment are\nsometimes treated differently. E.g., Rouse v. Lee, No. 01-12, slip\nop. at 12-17 (4th Cir. Jan. 7, 2003) (excusing one day delay due to\nattorney error in habeas case where petitioner faced death penalty\nand would not have any other avenue of post-conviction review).\n\n                                    -9-\n\f2,   provides    that     the   \"writ   of     habeas   corpus    shall      not   be\n\nsuspended,\" save in cases of rebellion or invasion.                 David argues\n\nthat any statutory limitations period that prevents him from\n\npresenting a claim predicated on \"actual innocence\" amounts to an\n\nunconstitutional suspension of the writ.                  Compare Delaney v.\n\nMatesanz, 264 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 2001) (upholding the one year\n\nlimit only \"as a general matter\").\n\n           Assuming arguendo that the Suspension Clause extends\n\nbeyond the narrow historical office of the writ, cf. McCleskey v.\n\nZant, 499 U.S. 467, 478 (1991), it could only be violated by\n\nenactments that make the writ \"inadequate or ineffective to test\n\nthe legality of (the applicant's) detention.\"                 Swain v. Pressley,\n\n430 U.S. 372, 381 (1977).          Here, the argument made by David was\n\navailable to him from April 1992 onward and, excluding the time for\n\nexhausting remedies, he had ample time after AEDPA in which to\n\nbring    his    claim    within   the    statutory      deadline.       In    these\n\ncircumstances,          the     limitation       is     not      even     arguably\n\nunconstitutional.        Molo v. Johnson, 207 F.3d 773, 775 (5th Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           It would be another matter if David's constitutional\n\nclaim regarding the misstatement of the elements of the murder came\n\nto light only after the limitations period had expired.                            But\n\nCongress has provided that in such a case a petitioner may bring\n\nhis claim a year from the \"date on which the factual predicate of\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthe claim . . . could have been discovered through the exercise of\n\ndue diligence.\"          28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(D).            Here, any error at the\n\nplea       colloquy      was    immediately       apparent,    so   this    alternative\n\nstarting date has no relevance for David.\n\n               Nothing is changed here by David's claim of actual\n\ninnocence,      a     claim     itself     derived    from    his   mistaken-colloquy\n\nargument.           In   general,     defendants       who    may   be     innocent   are\n\nconstrained by the same explicit statutory or rule-based deadlines\n\nas those against whom the evidence is overwhelming: pre-trial\n\nmotions must be filed on time, timely appeals must be lodged, and\n\nhabeas claims must conform to AEDPA.                 In particular, the statutory\n\none-year limit on filing initial habeas petitions is not mitigated\n\nby   any     statutory         exception    for    actual     innocence     even   though\n\nCongress clearly knew how to provide such an escape hatch.5\n\n               There is a strong public interest in the prompt assertion\n\nof habeas claims.          Normally, the grant of habeas relief leaves the\n\nstate free to retry the petitioner, but this becomes increasingly\n\nhard to do as memories fade, evidence disperses and witnesses\n\ndisappear.          A defendant who could not have filed his petition\n\nearlier is at least a sympathetic figure; one who has a known\n\n\n       5\n      In AEDPA Congress adopted a form of actual innocence test as\none component of its threshold requirements for allowing a second\nor successive habeas petition; but it also provided that this\nsecond petition is allowed only where the factual predicate for the\nclaim of constitutional error could not have been discovered\npreviously through the exercise of due diligence.      28 U.S.C. §\n2244(b)(2)(B).\n\n                                            -11-\n\fclaim, defers presenting it, and then asks to be excused for the\n\ndelay is unlikely to get cut much slack.       A couple of cases have\n\nconjectured     that actual innocence might override the one-year\n\nlimit, e.g., Wyzkowski v. Dept. of Corrections, 226 F.3d 1213,\n\n1218-19 (11th Cir. 2000); but to us these dicta are in tension with\n\nthe statute and are not persuasive.\n\n          The    actual   innocence   rubric--a   phrase   courts   use\n\ndifferently in different contexts, see Calderon v. Thompson, 523\n\nU.S. 538, 559-66 (1998)--has been firmly disallowed by the Supreme\n\nCourt as an independent ground of habeas relief, save (possibly) in\n\nextraordinary circumstances in a capital case. Herrera v. Collins,\n\n506 U.S. 390, 417 (1993).      By contrast, the Court has used an\n\nactual innocence test as a safety valve where an issue was not\n\ntimely presented in the original trial, Schlup v.

On April 13, 1992, petitioner Stephen David pled guilty in a Massachusetts state court to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The crime was described in the plea colloquy: briefly stated, David and others, camping at a tent city in Quincy, Massachusetts, killed one of their number (Abraham Champlain) by beating and otherwise mistreating him over the course of several days and leaving him to die of his injuries and exposure to cold. The members of the group, including David, had consumed alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No direct appeal was taken from the conviction. Instead, more than three years after his plea and sentencing, David filed in the trial court two successive motions to withdraw his guilty plea and obtain a new trial, which under state law is a permissible form of collateral attack after a guilty plea. <i>Constantine v. Commonwealth,</i> 435 Mass. 1011, 1012, 760 N.E.2d 733, 735 (2002). Both motions were rejected by the trial court and the intermediate appellate court and, in both cases, the Supreme Judicial Court denied review. The first motion was filed on or about July 17, 1995, and SJC review was denied on December 29, 1997; the second was filed on May 5, 1998, and SJC review was denied on June 29, 2000. David did not seek certiorari on either ruling from the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 29, 2001, David filed the present habeas proceeding in the federal district court. In his petition, David asserts that, for second degree murder, Massachusetts law required that he know that his actions had a \"plain and strong likelihood\" of causing Champlain's death. <i>Commonwealth v. Sneed,</i> 413 Mass. 387, 388 n. 1, 597 N.E.2d 1346, 1347 n. 1 (1992). And, he asserts, the trial judge committed constitutional error by misadvising David at the plea colloquy that an intent to cause injury was sufficient. <i>See Henderson v. Morgan,</i> 426 U.S. 637, 643-46, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976). He also asserts that, due to his intoxication, a jury could not have found that he had the intent required under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, at the plea colloquy, the trial judge used both phrases, saying that an intent to injure was enough and that there had to be knowledge of \"a plain and strong likelihood\" of death. But whether the instruction was confusing (the state courts said no) and, if so, whether it constituted a constitutional violation are issues not before us. This is so because in opposing the writ, the Commonwealth pled that regardless of its merits, David's petition came too late under the deadlines fixed for habeas petitions by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241 <i>et seq.</i> (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AEDPA, which became effective on April 24, 1996, fixes a one-year limitations period for federal habeas petitions by state prisoners. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1). Statutory exceptions exist where the state impeded relief, new constitutional rights were created by the Supreme Court, or newly discovered facts underpin the claim, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D), but David does not claim to fall within any of these exceptions. Absent an exception, AEDPA's one-year limit runs from the time that the state court judgment of conviction became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking it. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A). However, defendants like David, convicted prior to AEDPA, can file their petitions within one year of AEDPA's effective date. <i>Gaskins v. Duval,</i> 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A magistrate judge recommended dismissal of David's petition on the ground that it was barred by AEDPA's time limit. AEDPA excludes from the one-year period \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2). The magistrate judge excluded from the calculation the days in which the two state new trial motions were pending (measuring from the dates of their filings to the ultimate SJC dispositions). Even with this exclusion, David's petition was filed 399 days after AEDPA's enactment and, therefore, more than the 365 days allowed. The district court adopted the recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David then sought a certificate of appealability (\"COA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c), which the district court denied. This court then granted the COA and asked the parties to brief several issues: David's claim that 180 days should be added to the excluded period for the time in which he could have sought certiorari in the United States Supreme Court;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> his alternative request that the time period be \"equitably tolled\" because of his attorney's error in filing late; and his claim that the Constitution's Suspension Clause overrides the AEDPA limit when the petitioner asserts that he is actually innocent of the underlying offense. We now address these issues in the same order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David's first argument &#8212; that 180 days should be added to the excluded period &#8212; is easily answered. Congress excluded from the one-year period the time during which \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review... is pending....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2244(d)(2). The reason is obvious. During the period when the state courts are reviewing the claims, a federal petition would likely be dismissed or held as premature and would at best simply be held until state remedies were exhausted. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the language or policy of this exclusion warrants adding to the excluded period an additional period during which the petitioner could have, <i>but did not,</i> seek certiorari in the Supreme Court from the denial of collateral remedies. Once the SJC denied review as to the first new trial motion, nothing was pending in either state or federal court nor was any further action ever taken in any court with respect to that motion. The same is true for the second motion. Thus, to say that David's collateral attack proceedings were pending in any court during the 90-day periods after the SJC denials is at odds with ordinary usage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If anything more were needed, it is supplied by the contrasting language of a companion AEDPA provision. In the ordinary post-AEDPA case, the one-year period (exceptions aside) runs from the later of two dates: \"the date ... the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review <i>or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A) (emphasis supplied). Thus, if David had been convicted after trial and fought his conviction through the SJC, he would automatically have gotten the benefit of the additional 90 days for seeking certiorari &#8212; that is, those days would have been excluded from the one-year period by virtue of the underscored language. No such language appears in the collateral attack provision applicable here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David says that he had no direct review remedy under state law because of his guilty plea so that, to create equality of opportunity, the underscored language should be read into the collateral attack provision or the collateral attack should be equated in this case with direct review. This argument has the matter backwards. Congress did not aim at equality: it specifically provided a more generous exclusion of time where direct review was involved and, consistent with the spirit of AEDPA, took a stricter view as to state post-conviction remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David next argues that the running of the limitations period should be equitably tolled because the failure to file the petition within the required period was due to error by David's counsel. The factual premise is an affidavit from counsel stating that he could have filed the petition earlier but did not think this was required. \"Equitable tolling\" is an umbrella term for the notion that a statute of limitations &#8212; unless its time limit is \"jurisdictional\" &#8212; may be extended for equitable reasons not acknowledged in the statute creating the limitations period. <i>See, e.g., Delaney v. Matesanz,</i> 264 F.3d 7, 13-14 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2244 does not describe its time limits as jurisdictional, either in its own terms or otherwise, nor does the Commonwealth invoke that label. <i>See Miller v. N.J. State Dept. of Corrections,</i> 145 F.3d 616, 617-18 (3d Cir.1998). Still, section 2244(d) comprises six paragraphs defining its one-year limitations period in detail and adopting very specific exceptions. Congress likely did not conceive that the courts would add new exceptions and it is even more doubtful that it would have approved of such an effort. <i>Taliani v. Chrans,</i> 189 F.3d 597, 598 (7th Cir.1999). AEDPA reflects Congress' view that the courts were being too generous with habeas relief and that the whole system needed to be tightened up. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-518, at 111 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, many circuits have held or assumed that equitable tolling is available,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and we will proceed here on that <i>arguendo</i> assumption. The \"exclusion\" inference against such a reading of section 2244 is matched, as such rubrics often are, by a counter inference: that Congress acts against the background of existing decisional doctrine unless it negates the doctrine. <i>Young v. United States,</i> 535 U.S. 43, 122 S.Ct. 1036, 1040, 152 L.Ed.2d 79 (2002). This court, although it has never decided whether equitable tolling is permitted under section 2244, <i>Lattimore v. Dubois,</i> 311 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir.2002), has elsewhere been willing to read AEDPA flexibly. <i>See Evicci v. Commissioner of Corrections,</i> 226 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If equitable tolling is available to extend section 2244(d)'s limitations period, it can only do so for the most exceptional reasons. One of AEDPA's main purposes was to compel habeas petitions to be filed promptly after conviction and direct review, to limit their number, and to permit delayed or second petitions only in fairly narrow and explicitly defined circumstances. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A)-(D); H.R.Rep. No. 104-518, <i>supra</i> at 111. To bypass these restrictions for reasons other than those given in the statute could be defended, if at all, only for the most exigent reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the magistrate judge thought, and the district court, agreed, that a mistake by counsel in reading the statute or computing the time limit is, at most, a routine error. Indeed, it would not even constitute \"excusable neglect\" under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). <i>See Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg.,</i> 212 F.3d 624, 630-31 (1st Cir. 2000). Even apart from AEDPA, the Supreme Court has said that \"the principles of equitable tolling ... do not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.\" <i>Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> If carelessness were an escape hatch from statutes of limitations, they would hardly ever bar claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David's final argument is that the limitations period, if otherwise applicable to him and unmitigated here by equitable tolling, violates the Constitution. Article I, section 9, clause 2, provides that the \"writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,\" save in cases of rebellion or invasion. David argues that any statutory limitations period that prevents him from presenting a claim predicated on \"actual innocence\" amounts to an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. <i>Compare Delaney v. Matesanz,</i> 264 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.2001) (upholding the one year limit only \"as a general matter\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the Suspension Clause extends beyond the narrow historical office of the writ, <i>cf. McCleskey v. Zant,</i> 499 U.S. 467, 478, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991), it could only be violated by enactments that make the writ \"inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of (the applicant's) detention.\" <i>Swain v. Pressley,</i> 430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977). Here, the argument made by David was available to him from April 1992 onward and, excluding the time for exhausting remedies, he had ample time after AEDPA in which to bring his claim within the statutory deadline. In these circumstances, the limitation is not even arguably unconstitutional. <i>Molo v. Johnson,</i> 207 F.3d 773, 775 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be another matter if David's constitutional claim regarding the misstatement of the elements of the murder came to light only after the limitations period had expired. But Congress has provided that in such a case a petitioner may bring his claim a year from the \"date on which the factual predicate of the claim... could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(D). Here, any error at the plea colloquy was immediately apparent, so this alternative starting date has no relevance for David.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing is changed here by David's claim of actual innocence, a claim itself derived from his mistaken-colloquy argument. In general, defendants who may be innocent are constrained by the same explicit statutory or rule-based deadlines as those against whom the evidence is overwhelming: pre-trial motions must be filed on time, timely appeals must be lodged, and habeas claims must conform to AEDPA. In particular, the statutory one-year limit on filing initial habeas petitions is not mitigated by any statutory exception for actual innocence even though Congress clearly knew how to provide such an escape hatch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a strong public interest in the prompt assertion of habeas claims. Normally, the grant of habeas relief leaves the state free to retry the petitioner, but this becomes increasingly hard to do as memories fade, evidence disperses and witnesses disappear. A defendant who could not have filed his petition earlier is at least a sympathetic figure; one who has a known claim, defers presenting it, and then asks to be excused for the delay is unlikely to get cut much slack. A couple of cases have conjectured that actual innocence might override the one-year limit, <i>e.g., Wyzykowski v. Dept. of Corrections,</i> 226 F.3d 1213, 1218-19 (11th Cir.2000); but to us these dicta are in tension with the statute and are not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The actual innocence rubric &#8212; a phrase courts use differently in different contexts, <i>see Calderon v. Thompson,</i> 523 U.S. 538, 559-66, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998) &#8212; has been firmly disallowed by the Supreme Court as an independent ground of habeas relief, save (possibly) in extraordinary circumstances in a capital case. <i>Herrera v. Collins,</i> 506 U.S. 390, 417, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). By contrast, the Court has used an actual innocence test as a safety valve where an issue was not timely presented in the original trial, <i>Schlup v. Delo,</i> 513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995), but we are not here concerned with a claim forfeited under the cause and prejudice standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, David has not made out a predicate showing of \"actual innocence,\" if the phrase is taken to mean that no jury would likely convict David based on the currently known evidence. This is so even if the jury was here instructed exactly as David says Massachusetts law requires. In the end, the defense would depend largely on whether the jury believed David's own self-serving testimony about his own mental state &#8212; a conclusion which, given his active participation in Champlain's mistreatment over several days, a jury might easily resist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A petitioner in a criminal case has 90 days to petition the United States Supreme Court after receiving a final judgment from the highest court of his state.

In his petition, David asserts that, for second degree murder, Massachusetts law required that he know that his actions had a \"plain and strong likelihood\" of causing Champlain's death. <i>Commonwealth v. Sneed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2067073\"><a href=\"/opinion/2067073/commonwealth-v-sneed/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span>, 388 n. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2067073\"><a href=\"/opinion/2067073/commonwealth-v-sneed/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></a></span>, 1347 n. 1 (1992). And, he asserts, the trial judge committed constitutional error by misadvising David at the plea colloquy that an intent to cause injury was sufficient. <i>See Henderson v. Morgan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109492\"><a href=\"/opinion/109492/henderson-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 643-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109492\"><a href=\"/opinion/109492/henderson-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span> (1976). He also asserts that, due to his intoxication, a jury could not have found that he had the intent required under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, at the plea colloquy, the trial judge used both phrases, saying that an intent to injure was enough and that there had to be knowledge of \"a plain and strong likelihood\" of death. But whether the instruction was confusing (the state courts said no) and, if so, whether it constituted a constitutional violation are issues not before us. This is so because in opposing the writ, the Commonwealth pled that regardless of its merits, David's petition came too late under the deadlines fixed for habeas petitions by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241 <i>et seq.</i> (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AEDPA, which became effective on April 24, 1996, fixes a one-year limitations period for federal habeas petitions by state prisoners. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1). Statutory exceptions exist where the state impeded relief, new constitutional rights were created by the Supreme Court, or newly discovered facts underpin the claim, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D), but David does not claim to fall within any of these exceptions. Absent an exception, AEDPA's one-year limit runs from the time that the state court judgment of conviction became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking it. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A). However, defendants like David, convicted prior to AEDPA, can file their petitions within one year of AEDPA's effective date. <i>Gaskins v. Duval,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198545\"><a href=\"/opinion/198545/gaskins-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A magistrate judge recommended dismissal of David's petition on the ground that it was barred by AEDPA's time limit. AEDPA excludes from the one-year period \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2). The magistrate judge excluded from the calculation the days in which the two state new trial motions were pending (measuring from the dates of their filings to the ultimate SJC dispositions). Even with this exclusion, David's petition was filed 399 days after AEDPA's enactment and, therefore, more than the 365 days allowed. The district court adopted the recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David then sought a certificate of appealability (\"COA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c), which the district court denied. This court then granted the COA and asked the parties to brief several issues: David's claim that 180 days should be added to the excluded period for the time in which he could have sought certiorari in the United States Supreme Court;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> his alternative request that the time period be \"equitably tolled\" because of his attorney's error in filing late; and his claim that the Constitution's Suspension Clause overrides the AEDPA limit when the petitioner asserts that he is actually innocent of the underlying offense. We now address these issues in the same order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David's first argument &#8212; that 180 days should be added to the excluded period &#8212; is easily answered. Congress excluded from the one-year period the time during which \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review... is pending....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2244(d)(2). The reason is obvious. During the period when the state courts are reviewing the claims, a federal petition would likely be dismissed or held as premature and would at best simply be held until state remedies were exhausted. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the language or policy of this exclusion warrants adding to the excluded period an additional period during which the petitioner could have, <i>but did not,</i> seek certiorari in the Supreme Court from the denial of collateral remedies. Once the SJC denied review as to the first new trial motion, nothing was pending in either state or federal court nor was any further action ever taken in any court with respect to that motion. The same is true for the second motion. Thus, to say that David's collateral attack proceedings were pending in any court during the 90-day periods after the SJC denials is at odds with ordinary usage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If anything more were needed, it is supplied by the contrasting language of a companion AEDPA provision. In the ordinary post-AEDPA case, the one-year period (exceptions aside) runs from the later of two dates: \"the date ... the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review <i>or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A) (emphasis supplied). Thus, if David had been convicted after trial and fought his conviction through the SJC, he would automatically have gotten the benefit of the additional 90 days for seeking certiorari &#8212; that is, those days would have been excluded from the one-year period by virtue of the underscored language. No such language appears in the collateral attack provision applicable here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David says that he had no direct review remedy under state law because of his guilty plea so that, to create equality of opportunity, the underscored language should be read into the collateral attack provision or the collateral attack should be equated in this case with direct review. This argument has the matter backwards. Congress did not aim at equality: it specifically provided a more generous exclusion of time where direct review was involved and, consistent with the spirit of AEDPA, took a stricter view as to state post-conviction remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David next argues that the running of the limitations period should be equitably tolled because the failure to file the petition within the required period was due to error by David's counsel. The factual premise is an affidavit from counsel stating that he could have filed the petition earlier but did not think this was required. \"Equitable tolling\" is an umbrella term for the notion that a statute of limitations &#8212; unless its time limit is \"jurisdictional\" &#8212; may be extended for equitable reasons not acknowledged in the statute creating the limitations period. <i>See, e.g., Delaney v. Matesanz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774790\"><a href=\"/opinion/774790/charles-c-delaney-iii-v-james-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 13-14 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2244 does not describe its time limits as jurisdictional, either in its own terms or otherwise, nor does the Commonwealth invoke that label. <i>See Miller v. N.J. State Dept. of Corrections,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754744\"><a href=\"/opinion/754744/frank-t-miller-v-new-jersey-state-department-of-corrections-donald-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span>, 617-18 (3d Cir.1998). Still, section 2244(d) comprises six paragraphs defining its one-year limitations period in detail and adopting very specific exceptions. Congress likely did not conceive that the courts would add new exceptions and it is even more doubtful that it would have approved of such an effort. <i>Taliani v. Chrans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765902\"><a href=\"/opinion/765902/steven-taliani-v-james-chrans-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 598 (7th Cir.1999). AEDPA reflects Congress' view that the courts were being too generous with habeas relief and that the whole system needed to be tightened up. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-518, at 111 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, many circuits have held or assumed that equitable tolling is available,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and we will proceed here on that <i>arguendo</i> assumption. The \"exclusion\" inference against such a reading of section 2244 is matched, as such rubrics often are, by a counter inference: that Congress acts against the background of existing decisional doctrine unless it negates the doctrine. <i>Young v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118486\"><a href=\"/opinion/118486/young-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118486\"><a href=\"/opinion/118486/young-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

One of AEDPA's main purposes was to compel habeas petitions to be filed promptly after conviction and direct review, to limit their number, and to permit delayed or second petitions only in fairly narrow and explicitly defined circumstances. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A)-(D); H.R.Rep. No. 104-518, <i>supra</i> at 111. To bypass these restrictions for reasons other than those given in the statute could be defended, if at all, only for the most exigent reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the magistrate judge thought, and the district court, agreed, that a mistake by counsel in reading the statute or computing the time limit is, at most, a routine error. Indeed, it would not even constitute \"excusable neglect\" under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). <i>See Mirpuri v.

Even apart from AEDPA, the Supreme Court has said that \"the principles of equitable tolling ... do not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.\" <i>Irwin v.

Article I, section 9, clause 2, provides that the \"writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,\" save in cases of rebellion or invasion. David argues that any statutory limitations period that prevents him from presenting a claim predicated on \"actual innocence\" amounts to an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. <i>Compare Delaney v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span> (1977). Here, the argument made by David was available to him from April 1992 onward and, excluding the time for exhausting remedies, he had ample time after AEDPA in which to bring his claim within the statutory deadline. In these circumstances, the limitation is not even arguably unconstitutional. <i>Molo v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"20382\"><a href=\"/opinion/20382/molo-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span>, 775 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be another matter if David's constitutional claim regarding the misstatement of the elements of the murder came to light only after the limitations period had expired. But Congress has provided that in such a case a petitioner may bring his claim a year from the \"date on which the factual predicate of the claim... could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(D). Here, any error at the plea colloquy was immediately apparent, so this alternative starting date has no relevance for David.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing is changed here by David's claim of actual innocence, a claim itself derived from his mistaken-colloquy argument. In general, defendants who may be innocent are constrained by the same explicit statutory or rule-based deadlines as those against whom the evidence is overwhelming: pre-trial motions must be filed on time, timely appeals must be lodged, and habeas claims must conform to AEDPA. In particular, the statutory one-year limit on filing initial habeas petitions is not mitigated by any statutory exception for actual innocence even though Congress clearly knew how to provide such an escape hatch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a strong public interest in the prompt assertion of habeas claims. Normally, the grant of habeas relief leaves the state free to retry the petitioner, but this becomes increasingly hard to do as memories fade, evidence disperses and witnesses disappear. A defendant who could not have filed his petition earlier is at least a sympathetic figure; one who has a known claim, defers presenting it, and then asks to be excused for the delay is unlikely to get cut much slack. A couple of cases have conjectured that actual innocence might override the one-year limit, <i>e.g., Wyzykowski v.
