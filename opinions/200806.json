Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Willie J. Davis with whom Davis, Robinson & White, LLP was on\nbrief for petitioner.\n     Dean A. Mazzone, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwith whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n                          January 9, 2004\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge.        Carlos Luna appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus.   Luna, a former Boston police officer, was convicted of\n\nperjury and filing false reports.        The background events are\n\ncomplicated, see Commonwealth v. Lewin, 542 N.E.2d 275, 276-83\n\n(Mass. 1989), but an abbreviated version suffices for the issues\n\nraised on this appeal.\n\n          In February 1988 Luna applied for a search warrant for a\n\nDorchester apartment, claiming in an affidavit attached to the\n\napplication that a confidential informant had told him that a short\n\nHispanic male had been distributing cocaine from the premises.\n\nLuna also claimed that he had purchased cocaine at the apartment\n\nfrom a Hispanic male on February 15 and 16, 1988.    In the ensuing\n\nraid, a police officer named Sherman Griffiths was shot by someone\n\ninside the apartment. Albert Lewin, a tall black man, was arrested\n\nand charged with Griffiths' murder.\n\n          Luna's search warrant affidavit was materially false.\n\nThe drug purchases on February 15 and 16, 1988, had been made\n\nrespectively by two other confidential informants--not by Luna and\n\nnot in his presence.     Further, the informant who had initially\n\ntipped off the police to the drug activity at the apartment had not\n\nreported to Luna, as Luna had claimed in the affidavit, but had\n\ninstead reported to another officer who then passed the information\n\nalong to Luna.   Finally, Luna had also said in the search warrant\n\n\n                                -2-\n\faffidavit that he had witnessed unusual foot traffic going to the\n\napartment and had witnessed other transactions there, but these\n\nstatements were untrue.\n\n            Nevertheless,   at   a    probable    cause   hearing   following\n\nLewin's arrest, Luna testified in accordance with the lies in the\n\nsearch   warrant   affidavit.        He   also   submitted   police   reports\n\ndescribing the February 15 and 16 drug purchases he had allegedly\n\nmade.    When a state court ordered Luna to reveal his supposed\n\noriginal informant, Luna made up a name and physical description;\n\nand when ordered to produce the informant, Luna and others engaged\n\nin a spurious search, in the course of which Luna filed further\n\nfalse reports.\n\n            In due course the indictment against Lewin was dismissed\n\nfor failure to produce the informant, a potentially exculpatory\n\nwitness.    At the hearing prior to the dismissal, Luna had told\n\nadditional lies consistent with his search warrant affidavit and\n\nhis subsequent false identification of the informant.                   Then,\n\nthrough an anonymous tip, the prosecutor learned the name of the\n\ninformant who had in fact made the February 15 drug purchase and\n\nasked for reinstatement of the indictment.           The state court asked\n\nthe prosecutor to try to obtain affidavits from Luna and other\n\nofficers.\n\n            During early March 1989, Luna met a number of times with\n\nMark Sullivan, retained as Luna's private counsel at his union's\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fexpense.    On March 12, 1989, Luna executed an affidavit admitting\n\ninter alia that he had lied in the search warrant affidavit, that\n\nthe information contained in the search warrant affidavit did not\n\nreflect    his    personal     knowledge,      but    rather    \"the   collective\n\nknowledge    of       the   police   squad     members[,]      and   that   he     had\n\nsubstituted himself as the drug purchaser [in the search warrant\n\naffidavit]       in    order   to    protect    the   informants.\"          Luna    v.\n\nMassachusetts, 224 F. Supp. 2d 302, 306 (D. Mass. 2002).                     At the\n\ndirection of Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\"), Lewin's\n\nindictment was eventually reinstated, Commonwealth v. Lewin, 542\n\nN.E.2d at 276-83, but Lewin was acquitted at trial.\n\n            Meanwhile, Luna was indicted in state court on charges of\n\nperjury and filing false reports and was convicted in June 1991 on\n\nmultiple counts of each offense.              He was sentenced to five years'\n\nprobation, conditioned on his resigning from the police force.                       A\n\nmotion for a new trial was denied, and the SJC affirmed Luna's\n\nconviction.       Commonwealth v. Luna, 641 N.E.2d 1050 (Mass. 1994).\n\nThen, in 1996 Luna brought the present habeas action which failed\n\nin the district court, Luna v. Massachusetts, 224 F. Supp. at 302,\n\nand he now appeals raising two different claims.1\n\n\n     1\n      Although Luna's probation has expired, the habeas action was\nfiled before this occurred.    See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241(c), 2254(b)\n(2000) (only people \"in custody\" may file a federal habeas\npetition); Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998) (statutory\nrequirement is satisfied so long as the petitioner is in custody at\nthe time the petition is filed); Jackson v. Coalter, 337 F.3d 74,\n78-79 (1st Cir. 2003) (probation counts as \"custody\" for purposes\n\n                                        -4-\n\f           The   first    claim    is    that   Luna's    second   affidavit,\n\nadmitting to the falsity of his original affidavit, was a coerced\n\nconfession improperly admitted at his trial for perjury and false\n\nreporting. Luna suggests that he was ordered to file the affidavit\n\nby the judge in the Lewin case; and, with greater vigor, Luna\n\nasserts that his own counsel put psychological pressure on him to\n\nfile the affidavit, saying (for example) that otherwise the dead\n\nofficer's family would blame him for thwarting the prosecution of\n\nLewin.\n\n           Whether       the    confession      was      inadmissible   under\n\nMassachusetts law was the subject of dispute at trial and on review\n\nin the SJC.      Massachusetts law is friendly to such claims in a\n\nnumber of respects: it puts the burden on the Commonwealth to prove\n\nvoluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt, allows the defendant two\n\nbites at the apple by giving the issue separately to the trial\n\njudge and the jury, and treats as coercion pressure exerted by\n\nprivate parties as well as by official action.               Commonwealth v.\n\nAllen,   480   N.E.2d    630,   636-37    (Mass.   1985);    Commonwealth   v.\n\nTavares, 430 N.E.2d 1198, 1204-05 (Mass. 1982), cert. denied sub\n\n\n\n\nof federal habeas).    Mootness is avoided because a presumption\nexists that a habeas petitioner continues to suffer the ill effects\nof a wrongful conviction even after his sentence is served. See\nSpencer, 523 U.S. at 7-14. Habeas denials can be appealed only by\npermission, 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c) (2000); Fed. R. App. P. 22(b)(1),\nbut the district court granted a certificate of appealability on\nthe two grounds now before us.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fnom, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982).         Compare, e.g., Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S.\n\n477, 489 (1972).\n\n              In the state case against Luna, the trial judge refused\n\nto suppress the second affidavit, the jury may or may not have\n\nconsidered it after making its own judgment about undue pressure,\n\nand the SJC ruled that there was no legal error.               Commonwealth v.\n\nLuna, 641 N.E.2d at 1052 n.1.          In the district court (and on this\n\nappeal), there has been much discussion about the deferential\n\nstandards of review applied in federal habeas to, respectively,\n\nstate court findings of fact and legal rulings, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(d)-(e) (2000), but in this case the degree of deference makes\n\nno difference to the result.\n\n              The state court judge said he wanted an affidavit from\n\nLuna but made clear that he understood that Luna could invoke his\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination; thus, the judge did not\n\nrequire Luna to file the affidavit.             Whether Luna's own counsel\n\nproperly advised him about the privilege, or told Luna that others\n\nwould    be   unhappy   if    he   thwarted    the   Lewin     prosecution,    is\n\nirrelevant:     under   federal     law,     only   coercion    resulting    from\n\nofficial      action--court    orders,     police    pressure,    state     law--\n\ninvalidates a confession. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 164-\n\n66 (1986); United States v. Byram, 145 F.3d 405, 407 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f               Luna's private attorney was not acting as a governmental\n\nofficial, nor (so far as the evidence shows) at the behest of\n\nofficials, when he counseled Luna. Apparently Sullivan had earlier\n\nworked in the prosecutor's office and his wife still worked there;\n\nbut neither circumstance made Sullivan a state actor at the time he\n\nadvised Luna.2      Massachusetts was free to exclude the affidavit on\n\ngrounds of private coercion, but, whether or not it properly\n\napplied its own law, admitting the affidavit did not violate the\n\nfederal constitution. The fact that Sullivan was not a state actor\n\nalso disposes of Luna's contention that he did not voluntarily\n\nwaive his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination--a\n\nwaiver of a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights is only involuntary\n\nif it resulted from official coercion.      Connelly, 479 U.S. at 170.\n\n               Luna says that the admission of the confession was\n\ncontrary to Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967).          It was\n\nnot.       In Garrity, the statements were given under compulsion of a\n\nstate law penalizing by dismissal a police officer who refused to\n\nanswer questions about his official duties.       Id. at 494.   The case\n\nlaw has tended to construe Garrity narrowly,3 but it is wholly\n\n\n       2\n      Sullivan's wife apparently attended two of Luna's meetings\nwith Sullivan; in addition, it was she who typed up the affidavit\nin which Luna admitted that he had lied. However, Luna does not\nassert that Sullivan's wife put any pressure on him whatsoever to\nfile the affidavit.\n       3\n      See Dwan v. City of Boston, 329 F.3d 275, 279-80 (1st Cir.\n2003); United States v. Stein, 233 F.3d 6, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2000),\ncert. denied, 532 U.S. 943 (2001); Wiley v. Mayor of Balt., 48 F.3d\n\n                                    -7-\n\firrelevant      here:    the     state    law    penalty    in   Garrity   was    the\n\nquintessence of state action.            In this case the whole point is that\n\nthere was no official compulsion.\n\n           Luna's second claim of error on this appeal relates to\n\nhis own testimony at his trial.                  At trial Luna's affidavit was\n\nadmitted by the judge as voluntary but subject to the caveat\n\n(required under state law) that the jury should disregard the\n\naffidavit if the jury itself found the statement involuntary\n\n(again, under the defendant-friendly state law standard).                       During\n\nits deliberations, the jury asked whether if it did find the\n\nconfession      involuntary,      it     could   still     consider    Luna's    trial\n\ntestimony about the affidavit--some of which had been inculpatory.\n\n             Over Luna's objection, the trial judge told the jury that\n\nit could still consider his trial testimony.                     On appeal in this\n\ncourt,   Luna    says     that    this    was    constitutional       error,    citing\n\nHarrison v. United States, 392 U.S. 219 (1968). There, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that where a confession obtained in violation of federal\n\nstandards was introduced at trial and the defendant testified only\n\nto   respond     to     that   evidence,        the   defendant's     incriminatory\n\ntestimony was the fruit of the illegal confession and could not be\n\nused to salvage the conviction.             Id. at 220-223.\n\n           The premise of Harrison was that the original confession\n\n(actually several confessions, 392 U.S. at 220) had been wrongfully\n\n\n773, 776-77 (4th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 824 (1995).\n\n                                          -8-\n\fobtained under federal law. Id. at 222-23. Here, Luna's affidavit\n\nwas not obtained in violation of federal law for reasons explained\n\nearlier.   Whether or not the jury disregarded the Luna affidavit\n\nunder Massachusetts law does not matter.   To secure relief through\n\nfederal habeas proceedings, there must be a violation of federal\n\nlaw, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a) (2000), and here there was none.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

Luna, a former Boston police officer, was convicted of perjury and filing false reports. The background events are complicated, <i>see Commonwealth v. Lewin,</i> 405 Mass. 566, 542 N.E.2d 275, 276-83 (1989), but an abbreviated version suffices for the issues raised on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1988 Luna applied for a search warrant for a Dorchester apartment, claiming in an affidavit attached to the application that a confidential informant had told him that a short Hispanic male had been distributing cocaine from the premises. Luna also claimed that he had purchased cocaine at the apartment from a Hispanic male on February 15 and 16, 1988. In the ensuing raid, a police officer named Sherman Griffiths was shot by someone inside the apartment. Albert Lewin, a tall black man, was arrested and charged with Griffiths' murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luna's search warrant affidavit was materially false. The drug purchases on February 15 and 16, 1988, had been made respectively by two <i>other</i> confidential informants &#8212; not by Luna and not in his presence. Further, the informant who had initially tipped off the police to the drug activity at the apartment had not reported to Luna, as Luna had claimed in the affidavit, but had instead reported to another officer who then passed the information along to Luna. Finally, Luna had also said in the search warrant affidavit that he had witnessed unusual foot traffic going to the apartment and had witnessed other transactions there, but these statements were untrue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, at a probable cause hearing following Lewin's arrest, Luna testified in accordance with the lies in the search warrant affidavit. He also submitted police reports describing the February 15 and 16 drug purchases he had allegedly made. When a state court ordered Luna to reveal his supposed original informant, Luna made up a name and physical description; and when ordered to produce the informant, Luna and others engaged in a spurious search, in the course of which Luna filed further false reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course the indictment against Lewin was dismissed for failure to produce the informant, a potentially exculpatory witness. At the hearing prior to the dismissal, Luna had told additional lies consistent with his search warrant affidavit and his subsequent false identification of the informant. Then, through an anonymous tip, the prosecutor learned the name of the informant who had in fact made the February 15 drug purchase and asked for reinstatement of the indictment. The state court asked the prosecutor to try to obtain affidavits from Luna and other officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During early March 1989, Luna met a number of times with Mark Sullivan, retained as Luna's private counsel at his union's expense. On March 12, 1989, Luna executed an affidavit admitting <i>inter alia</i> that he had lied in the search warrant affidavit, that the information contained in the search warrant affidavit did not reflect his personal knowledge, but rather \"the collective knowledge of the police squad members[,] and that he had substituted himself as the drug purchaser [in the search warrant affidavit] in order to protect the informants.\" <i>Luna v. Massachusetts,</i> 224 F.Supp.2d 302, 306 (D.Mass. 2002). At the direction of Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\"), Lewin's indictment was eventually reinstated, <i>Commonwealth v.

Luna,</i> 418 Mass. 749, 641 N.E.2d 1050 (1994). Then, in 1996 Luna brought the present habeas action which failed in the district court, <i>Luna v. Massachusetts,</i> 224 F.Supp.2d at 302, and he now appeals raising two different claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first claim is that Luna's second affidavit, admitting to the falsity of his original affidavit, was a coerced confession improperly admitted at his trial for perjury and false reporting.

Luna, a former Boston police officer, was convicted of perjury and filing false reports. The background events are complicated, <i>see Commonwealth v. Lewin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2055259\"><a href=\"/opinion/2055259/commonwealth-v-lewin/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2055259\"><a href=\"/opinion/2055259/commonwealth-v-lewin/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 276-83 (1989), but an abbreviated version suffices for the issues raised on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1988 Luna applied for a search warrant for a Dorchester apartment, claiming in an affidavit attached to the application that a confidential informant had told him that a short Hispanic male had been distributing cocaine from the premises. Luna also claimed that he had purchased cocaine at the apartment from a Hispanic male on February 15 and 16, 1988. In the ensuing raid, a police officer named Sherman Griffiths was shot by someone inside the apartment. Albert Lewin, a tall black man, was arrested and charged with Griffiths' murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luna's search warrant affidavit was materially false. The drug purchases on February 15 and 16, 1988, had been made respectively by two <i>other</i> confidential informants &#8212; not by Luna and not in his presence. Further, the informant who had initially tipped off the police to the drug activity at the apartment had not reported to Luna, as Luna had claimed in the affidavit, but had instead reported to another officer who then passed the information along to Luna. Finally, Luna had also said in the search warrant affidavit that he had witnessed unusual foot traffic going to the apartment and had witnessed other transactions there, but these statements were untrue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, at a probable cause hearing following Lewin's arrest, Luna testified in accordance with the lies in the search warrant affidavit. He also submitted police reports describing the February 15 and 16 drug purchases he had allegedly made. When a state court ordered Luna to reveal his supposed original informant, Luna made up a name and physical description; and when ordered to produce the informant, Luna and others engaged in a spurious search, in the course of which Luna filed further false reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course the indictment against Lewin was dismissed for failure to produce the informant, a potentially exculpatory witness. At the hearing prior to the dismissal, Luna had told additional lies consistent with his search warrant affidavit and his subsequent false identification of the informant. Then, through an anonymous tip, the prosecutor learned the name of the informant who had in fact made the February 15 drug purchase and asked for reinstatement of the indictment. The state court asked the prosecutor to try to obtain affidavits from Luna and other officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During early March 1989, Luna met a number of times with Mark Sullivan, retained as Luna's private counsel at his union's expense. On March 12, 1989, Luna executed an affidavit admitting <i>inter alia</i> that he had lied in the search warrant affidavit, that the information contained in the search warrant affidavit did not reflect his personal knowledge, but rather \"the collective knowledge of the police squad members[,] and that he had substituted himself as the drug purchaser [in the search warrant affidavit] in order to protect the informants.\" <i>Luna v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2490200\"><a href=\"/opinion/2490200/luna-v-com-of-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 306 (D.Mass. 2002). At the direction of Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\"), Lewin's indictment was eventually reinstated, <i>Commonwealth v. Lewin,</i> 542 N.E.2d at 276-83, but Lewin was acquitted at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Luna was indicted in state court on charges of perjury and filing false reports and was convicted in June 1991 on multiple counts of each offense. He was sentenced to five years' probation, conditioned on his resigning from the police force. A motion for a new trial was denied, and the SJC affirmed Luna's conviction. <i>Commonwealth v. Luna,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2121856\"><a href=\"/opinion/2121856/commonwealth-v-luna/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2121856\"><a href=\"/opinion/2121856/commonwealth-v-luna/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span> (1994). Then, in 1996 Luna brought the present habeas action which failed in the district court, <i>Luna v. Massachusetts,</i> 224 F.Supp.2d at 302, and he now appeals raising two different claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first claim is that Luna's second affidavit, admitting to the falsity of his original affidavit, was a coerced confession improperly admitted at his trial for perjury and false reporting. Luna suggests that he was ordered to file the affidavit by the judge in the Lewin case; and, with greater vigor, Luna asserts that his own counsel put psychological pressure on him to file the affidavit, saying (for example) that otherwise the dead officer's family would blame him for thwarting the prosecution of Lewin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the confession was inadmissible under Massachusetts law was the subject of dispute at trial and on review in the SJC. Massachusetts law is friendly to such claims in a number of respects: it puts the burden on the Commonwealth to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt, allows the defendant two bites at the apple by giving the issue separately to the trial judge and the jury, and treats as coercion pressure exerted by private parties as well as by official action. <i>Commonwealth v.

Luna,</i> 641 N.E.2d at 1052 n. 1. In the district court (and on this appeal), there has been much discussion about the deferential standards of review applied in federal habeas to, respectively, state court findings of fact and legal rulings, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)-(e) (2000), but in this case the degree of deference makes no difference to the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state court judge said he wanted an affidavit from Luna but made clear that he understood that Luna could invoke his privilege against self-incrimination; thus, the judge did not require Luna to file the affidavit.
