Smith for appellant.\n     Kevin O'Regan, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J.

Ivan   Teleguez     of    Lancaster,\n\nPennsylvania, participated in an interstate business, the selling\n\nof firearms.      He sold firearms to Carlos Ortiz, a cooperating\n\nwitness for the FBI in Springfield, Massachusetts.              All told, over\n\na fifteen-month period ending in October 2002, Teleguez and his co-\n\ndefendants sold to Ortiz twenty-five firearms, thirteen of which\n\nhad obliterated serial numbers.\n\n            Teleguez was charged with federal conspiracies both to\n\ndeal   firearms      without    a   license,     see   18    U.S.C.    §§    371,\n\n922(a)(1)(A), and to possess firearms with obliterated serial\n\nnumbers, see id. §§ 371, 922(k), as well as three separate counts\n\nof possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers, see id.\n\n§ 922(k).      His co-defendants, Aleksei Safanov, Roman Zhirnov,\n\nAndrey Buynovskiy, and Michael Quickel, all pled guilty, and\n\nQuickel testified against Teleguez.            A jury convicted Teleguez on\n\nall counts.     The district court sentenced Teleguez to fifty-one\n\nmonths' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised\n\nrelease, and a special monetary assessment of $500.\n\n            Teleguez    attacks     his   conviction,       arguing   that   the\n\ndistrict court erred (1) in denying his request for an entrapment\n\ninstruction and in precluding him from arguing entrapment at\n\nclosing, (2) in denying his motion to dismiss the possession counts\n\non interstate commerce grounds, (3) in denying his motions to\n\nsuppress his post-arrest statement, and (4) in denying a motion for\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fjudgment of acquittal as a matter of law as to the possession\n\ncounts.    We affirm.        We adhere to our prior rule that 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(k) is a constitutional exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause\n\npowers, see United States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st\n\nCir. 1995), and hold that this result is not overruled by Jones v.\n\nUnited States, 529 U.S. 848 (2000), or United States v. Morrison,\n\n529 U.S. 598 (2000).\n\n                                      I.     FACTS\n\nA.           Ortiz's Firearms Purchases\n\n             Ortiz   was     paid    by     the    FBI     to    assist    in   criminal\n\ninvestigations.        In    this     case,       Ortiz    received       approximately\n\n$80,000.\n\n             In the early summer of 2001, FBI Special Agent Robert\n\nLewis asked Ortiz to \"keep an eye out and an ear out for criminal\n\nactivity amongst Russian individuals in the Springfield area.\"\n\nOrtiz's    inquiries    of    some     members       of    the    Russian       community\n\nultimately led to the criminal firearms transactions charges in\n\nthis case.    At various times, Ortiz represented that he had his own\n\ncustomers for guns.\n\n             The first firearms transaction occurred in July 2001.\n\nOrtiz went to a local gun store, where he was approached by\n\nBuynovskiy.      Buynovskiy         asked    Ortiz    if    he    was     interested   in\n\npurchasing some rifles. Ortiz was interested; he consulted the FBI\n\nand then gave Buynovskiy a $200 deposit.                  On July 2, Buynovskiy and\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fZhirnov met with Ortiz in a parking lot, where Ortiz purchased two\n\nrifles and ammunition for $1,800.                    The source of at least one of\n\nthese weapons was Teleguez.                    More than a year earlier, in the\n\nspring of 2000, Teleguez had purchased one of these rifles from an\n\nacquaintance in Pennsylvania.\n\n              The FBI investigation was interrupted by the events of\n\nSeptember 11, 2001, but then resumed in the spring of 2002.                              On\n\nApril 6, 2002, Ortiz purchased two firearms from Buynovskiy and\n\nSafanov.      He purchased an additional firearm from Safanov on May\n\n20, 2002.\n\n              On    June    24,    2002,       Ortiz   and     Safanov,     at    Safanov's\n\nsuggestion,        drove    together          to   Pennsylvania    to   buy      guns   from\n\nTeleguez.          The     two     went       to   Teleguez's     house     in     Ephrata,\n\nPennsylvania, where Ortiz purchased four firearms.                               The serial\n\nnumber   on    one    of     the       four   firearms   had     been   obliterated      by\n\ngrinding.      The two returned to Massachusetts with the firearms.\n\n              On July 16, 2002, Ortiz went to Safanov's apartment in\n\nSpringfield and purchased another five firearms. Serial numbers on\n\nthree of these firearms had been removed.\n\n              On    August       25,    2002,      Teleguez,    who   had    traveled    to\n\nMassachusetts, met Ortiz in a Springfield parking lot and sold\n\nOrtiz another eight firearms, six of which had their serial numbers\n\nobliterated.         Teleguez asked Ortiz to send him money for the\n\nfirearms by mail.          The defendant gave Ortiz an envelope with his\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fname and Pennsylvania address written on it.           On August 27, 2002,\n\nOrtiz   instead    sent   Teleguez    a    wire   transfer   for   $1,500   as\n\nadditional payment for the firearms purchased two days earlier.\n\n           On August 30, 2002, Teleguez again met with Ortiz in\n\nSpringfield.      This time, defendant sold Ortiz two semi-automatic\n\npistols with obliterated serial numbers.              Ortiz paid Teleguez\n\n$1,200.\n\n           On October 3, 2002, at Teleguez's direction, Ortiz met\n\nwith Zhirnov in Springfield.         Zhirnov sold Ortiz a firearm whose\n\nserial number had been removed.       The next day, Ortiz wired $850 to\n\nTeleguez in payment for the firearm.\n\nB.         Quickel's Firearms Purchases for Teleguez\n\n           Quickel testified that in July and August 2002, he\n\npurchased firearms for Teleguez, at defendant's request.             Quickel\n\nused his own identification at legitimate firearms stores in\n\nPennsylvania.      Teleguez had told him that Teleguez could not\n\npurchase the firearms in his own name.            Typically, Teleguez went\n\nwith Quickel to the firearms stores, told Quickel which firearms to\n\nbuy, and gave Quickel money to purchase the firearms.                Quickel\n\nwould carry the firearms out of the store himself, and then hand\n\nthem over to Teleguez.      The defendant paid Quickel $100 for each\n\nrifle and $200 for each pistol purchased.\n\n           The government introduced into evidence six transaction\n\nrecords detailing Quickel's firearms purchases in Pennsylvania on\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fbehalf of Teleguez.    The records showed that Quickel purchased\n\nfifteen firearms from July 8 through August 28, 2002.     All of the\n\nfirearms had serial numbers at the time of purchase.\n\n          ATF Special Agent Patrick Burns testified about the guns\n\nQuickel purchased for Teleguez which were ultimately sold to Ortiz.\n\nBurns testified that Ortiz purchased nine firearms that were\n\nsimilar to firearms Quickel purchased for Teleguez.      All nine of\n\nthe firearms had obliterated serial numbers when they were sold to\n\nOrtiz.   As to four of the firearms, the similarity to Quickel's\n\npurchases was limited to the manufacturer and type of firearm.    As\n\nto the remaining five firearms, the government was able to raise\n\npartial serial numbers which matched the serial numbers associated\n\nwith the firearms purchased by Quickel.\n\n                           II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.        Denial of Request for Entrapment Instruction           and\n          Preclusion from Arguing Entrapment at Closing\n\n          Teleguez's primary argument is that he was entitled to an\n\nentrapment instruction because the evidence shows that Ortiz was an\n\ninsistent buyer who was doggedly persistent, and this amounted to\n\nimproper inducement of Teleguez.       Teleguez also argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred in precluding him from arguing entrapment to\n\nthe jury at closing.   Teleguez preserved his objections at trial;\n\nwe review the denial of the entrapment instruction de novo, United\n\nStates v. Sánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 76 (1st Cir. 2005), and\n\nreview the limitations placed on defendant's closing argument for\n\n                                 -6-\n\fabuse of discretion, United States v. Wood, 982 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n          The     entrapment   defense   is   not    a   doctrine   of\n\nconstitutional dimension or one expressly created by statute.\n\nUnited States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 432-33 (1973); see also\n\nUnited States v.   Luisi, 482 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2007).     Rather,\n\nit is a judicially created doctrine which recognizes that \"Congress\n\ncould not have intended that its statutes were to be enforced by\n\ntempting innocent persons into violations.\"         Sherman v. United\n\nStates, 356 U.S. 369, 372 (1958).\n\n          The question is whether a reasonable jury could view the\n\nevidence as establishing that defendant was entrapped.     See United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir. 1988).        If so,\n\nTeleguez was entitled to an entrapment instruction; if not, there\n\nwas no error in the district court's denial of defendant's request.\n\n          The entrapment defense consists of two prongs.        Luisi,\n\n482 F.3d at 52.     The first prong requires a showing of improper\n\ngovernment inducement.    United States v. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). The second prong requires that the defendant have\n\nhad a lack of predisposition to commit the offense.      Id.   Because\n\nentrapment is a judicially created doctrine, courts have been\n\ncareful not to contravene congressional intent to punish those who\n\ncommit the offense; that, in turn, requires that the doctrine take\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\finto   account     the    practical      problems     faced       by    federal    law\n\nenforcement.     See Luisi, 482 F.3d at 52-53.\n\n            Our case law stating that a defendant has a low entry-\n\nlevel burden for obtaining an entrapment instruction, Gamache, 156\n\nF.3d   at   9,   should    not    be   misunderstood        (as    defendant      here\n\nmisunderstands).     In assessing whether the entry-level burden for\n\nan   instruction    has    been   met,    we   look    at    the       evidence   most\n\ncharitably to the defendant and determine whether it is sufficient\n\nfor a reasonable jury to conclude that there was entrapment.                      See\n\nRodriguez, 858 F.2d at 813.\n\n            In this case, no reasonable jury could conclude that\n\nthere was any improper government inducement. Defendant's argument\n\nis based on an erroneous understanding of (1) what it takes to show\n\nimproper inducement, (2) the personal nature of the entrapment\n\ndefense, and (3) the scope of the record to be considered.\n\n            Acceptance of Teleguez's arguments would so water down\n\nthe concept of improper inducement as to delete the requirement of\n\nimpropriety from the equation. Admittedly, sometimes a judgment on\n\nwhat is sufficient to make a plausible claim of improper inducement\n\ncan be a close call.        Nonetheless, merely giving a defendant an\n\nopportunity to commit a crime when the government puts forth an\n\nenthusiastic and persistent buyer of illicit goods cannot be\n\nimproper inducement.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f             Decisions     which    discuss          the     improper      inducement\n\nrequirement often use the phrase that there must be \"opportunity\n\nplus,\" and then turn to the nature of the \"plus.\"                          See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Capelton, 350 F.3d 231, 243 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nUnited States v. Vega, 102 F.3d 1301, 1305 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nPlucking phrases from the case law, Teleguez argues that the \"plus\"\n\nfactor     is   necessarily      satisfied      by     evidence       of   government\n\nmanipulation or by forceful solicitation and dogged insistence. He\n\ncites United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955 (1st Cir. 1994), for\n\nsupport.        Gendron,   however,      is    clear       that   sting    operations\n\nordinarily do not involve improper inducement. See id. at 961; see\n\nalso Gamache, 156 F.3d at 9 (\"A 'sting' operation is not improper\n\ninducement if it merely provides an opportunity to commit a crime\n\n. . . .\").      Indeed, sting operations by their nature often involve\n\ngovernment manipulation, solicitation, and, at times, deceit. See,\n\ne.g., Sánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d at 71-72, 76-77.\n\n             Teleguez's    argument      that    the       evidence    supported   an\n\nentrapment instruction rests on evidence to the following effect.\n\nTeleguez argues that it was the government agent1 Ortiz who first\n\napproached      Teleguez   and     the    co-defendants           about    purchasing\n\nfirearms.       Teleguez also maintains that Ortiz was not simply a\n\nbuyer; he pretended to befriend several of the defendants.                      Ortiz\n\n\n     1\n          For entrapment purposes, an individual hired by the\ngovernment as a cooperating witness qualifies as a \"government\nagent.\" Luisi, 482 F.3d at 53.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fpressed hard to get a number of weapons from co-defendants, and to\n\nget them quickly.     Further, defendant says Ortiz made up stories\n\nabout why he needed the weapons and why he needed them so quickly.\n\nThese facts, however, whether standing alone or collectively, are\n\ninsufficient to show improper inducement.\n\n            Most of the evidence on which Teleguez relies to show\n\nundue pressure was directed toward co-defendants, and was not\n\ndesigned to induce the co-defendants to put pressure on Teleguez.\n\nEntrapment is a personal defense; it is not additive to cover co-\n\ndefendants not targeted by the government agent.     See Luisi, 482\n\nF.3d at 54-55; United States v. Bradley, 820 F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).     The justification for the entrapment doctrine simply does\n\nnot extend to pressure placed on co-defendants intended to affect\n\nonly those co-defendants' actions.2\n\n\n       2\n            This is not a case like Luisi where there was evidence\nthat\n\n            (1) a government agent specifically targeted\n            the defendant in order to induce him to commit\n            illegal conduct; (2) the agent acted through\n            the middleman after other government attempts\n            at inducing the defendant had failed; (3) the\n            government agent requested, encouraged, or\n            instructed the middleman to employ a specified\n            inducement, which could be found improper,\n            against the targeted defendant; (4) the\n            agent's actions led the middleman to do what\n            the government sought, even if the government\n            did not use improper means to influence the\n            middleman; and (5) as a result of the\n            middleman's inducement, the targeted defendant\n            in fact engaged in the illegal conduct.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            In the larger context of this case, the basis for an\n\nentrapment instruction is even weaker.           Before Ortiz and Teleguez\n\nmet for the first time on June 24, 2002 at Teleguez's home, Ortiz\n\nhad already bought two rifles from co-defendants Buynovskiy and\n\nZhernov, one of which had been previously owned by defendant.\n\n            In total, Ortiz completed eight firearms transactions\n\nwith Teleguez and his co-defendants.             Over the course of these\n\ntransactions, Ortiz and Teleguez had three face-to-face meetings.\n\nAs the district court noted, when Ortiz visited defendant's house\n\nin Pennsylvania, Teleguez stated almost immediately that he was\n\nready to do business.      Within approximately one hour, Teleguez had\n\nsold Ortiz four firearms.       Two months later, on August 25, 2002,\n\nthe defendant traveled to Massachusetts and personally sold Ortiz\n\neight firearms.       Five days later, he sold Ortiz another two\n\nfirearms, also in Massachusetts.              There is no showing of any\n\nresistance on Teleguez's part to selling weapons, much less any\n\nresistance which was overcome by improper government pressure.\n\nDefendant was an eager vendor of deadly weapons.\n\n            Having considered the broader record, we agree that\n\nTeleguez did not make the requisite entry-level showing for an\n\nentrapment instruction. Cf. United States v. Joost, 92 F.3d 7, 12-\n\n14   (1st   Cir.   1996)   (holding    that    defendant   was   entitled   to\n\nentrapment instruction where jury could have found, inter alia,\n\n\nLuisi, 482 F.3d at 55.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthat defendant resisted agents' requests, defendant employed a\n\ngeneral     strategy   of   deflecting   agents'   requests,   agents\n\ndeliberately created a financial dependency, and agents threatened\n\ndefendant's continued income).    The district court properly denied\n\ndefendant's request for an instruction on entrapment.\n\n            As to the district court's decision to preclude Teleguez\n\nfrom arguing entrapment at closing, we find no abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Wood, 982 F.2d at 4.      The trial court \"has broad discretion\n\nover the scope of summations.\"    United States v. Grabiec, 96 F.3d\n\n549, 552 (1st Cir. 1996).      After the close of evidence, having\n\nalready correctly determined that Teleguez was not entitled to an\n\nentrapment instruction, the district court informed defense counsel\n\nthat he would be precluded from arguing entrapment in his closing\n\nargument.     Defense counsel initially believed that the district\n\ncourt had prohibited him from arguing neutral facts that had been\n\ndeveloped in relation to the desired entrapment defense. The court\n\nclarified, however, that it was only prohibiting defense counsel\n\nfrom arguing a theory of entrapment; there was no limitation on\n\narguing facts.    The district court's decision was well within its\n\ndiscretion.\n\nB.          Denial of Motion To Dismiss, on Interstate Commerce\n            Grounds, Charges of Possession of a Firearm with an\n            Obliterated Serial Number\n\n            The district court denied Teleguez's pre-trial motion to\n\ndismiss the charges brought against him under 18 U.S.C. § 922(k).\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fTeleguez argues that dismissal of the charges under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   922(k)    was    required    both     because   §   922(k)   involves    an\n\nimpermissible exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause powers, and\n\nbecause the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under\n\nthe statute.        Our review of legal questions is de novo, and we\n\nreview the entire record on Teleguez's sufficiency claim.                   See\n\nUnited States v. García-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d 124, 129 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); United States v. Rodriguez, 457 F.3d 109, 113 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n             Section 922(k) prohibits possession of firearms with\n\nobliterated    or    altered    serial    numbers.3     The   statutory     text\n\nrequires proof that the firearm \"has, at any time, been shipped or\n\ntransported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"4\n\n\n     3\n             18 U.S.C. § 922(k) provides:\n\n             It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly\n             to transport, ship, or receive, in interstate\n             or foreign commerce, any firearm which has had\n             the importer's or manufacturer's serial number\n             removed, obliterated, or altered or to possess\n             or receive any firearm which has had the\n             importer's or manufacturer's serial number\n             removed, obliterated, or altered and has, at\n             any time, been shipped or transported in\n             interstate or foreign commerce.\n     4\n          Teleguez cites a case from the Ninth Circuit, United\nStates v. Stewart, 348 F.3d 1132 (9th Cir. 2003), vacated, 545 U.S.\n1112 (2005), to support his argument that § 922(k) falls outside\nCongress's Commerce Clause powers and/or cannot constitutionally be\napplied to him. Stewart, however, considered 18 U.S.C. § 922(o),\nwhich -- unlike § 922(k) -- does not contain an express interstate\ncommerce element. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(o); Stewart, 348 F.3d at\n1134. Further, on remand from the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit\n\n                                        -13-\n\f           We have already held that § 922(k) is a constitutional\n\nexercise of Congress's Commerce Clause powers.         See Diaz-Martinez,\n\n71 F.3d at 953.      Teleguez argues, however, that in light of the\n\nSupreme Court's more recent decisions in Jones, 529 U.S. 848, and\n\nMorrison, 529 U.S. 598, we should revisit Diaz-Martinez and hold\n\nthat evidence that a firearm was manufactured in one state and\n\npossessed by defendant in another state is insufficient to justify\n\na conviction under § 922(k).           Teleguez mixes the question of\n\nCongress's   power   to   regulate    with   the   different   question   of\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.\n\n           Our opinion in Diaz-Martinez, which was decided after\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995),5 remains good law.\n\nOther circuits, post-Lopez, have upheld § 922(k) against similar\n\nattacks.   See United States v. Baer, 235 F.3d 561, 563 (10th Cir.\n\n2000); United States v. Mack, 164 F.3d 467, 473 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\nIndeed, our sister circuits have held that virtually identical\n\n\n\nreconsidered § 922(o) in light of Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1\n(2005), and held that the statute could be constitutionally applied\nto Stewart's possession of homemade machine guns. United States v.\nStewart, 451 F.3d 1071, 1078 (9th Cir. 2006). Teleguez has failed\nto note that the Ninth Circuit has, in fact, upheld § 922(k) on\ninterstate commerce grounds. United States v. Mack, 164 F.3d 467,\n473 (9th Cir. 1999).\n     5\n          In Lopez, the Supreme Court held that the Gun-Free School\nZones Act of 1990, 18 U.S.C. § 922(q)(1)(A), which contained no\ninterstate commerce element, was beyond Congress's Commerce Clause\npowers because gun possession in a local school zone did not\nqualify as economic activity that substantially affected interstate\ncommerce. 514 U.S. at 561-62, 567-68.\n\n                                     -14-\n\finterstate commerce elements in other federal criminal statutes\n\nsurvive challenges under Jones and Morrison.                 See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Thompson, 359 F.3d 470, 480 (7th Cir.) (upholding 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1)), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 844 (2004); United\n\nStates v. Rousseau, 257 F.3d 925, 932-33 (9th Cir.) (reaffirming\n\nconstitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8) and § 922(g)(1)), cert.\n\ndenied, 534 U.S. 1013 (2001); United States v. Dorris, 236 F.3d\n\n582, 584-86 (10th Cir. 2000) (upholding 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)),\n\ncert. denied, 532 U.S. 986 (2001); United States v. Napier, 233\n\nF.3d 394, 400-02 (6th Cir. 2000) (upholding 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8)).\n\n                The reasoning for upholding § 922(k) in the aftermath of\n\nJones and Morrison is the same as that provided in the cases cited\n\nabove.    Congress has not exceeded the scope of its Commerce Clause\n\npowers in enacting § 922(k) because the statute prohibits the\n\npossession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers only if such\n\nfirearms have been \"shipped or transported in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce.\"           So restricted by its own text, § 922(k) does not\n\npresent     a    constitutional     problem      --   Congress   may   permissibly\n\nregulate the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce,\n\nas   well       as    activities   that    substantially     affect     interstate\n\ncommerce. See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558-59; United States v. Morales-\n\nDe Jesús, 372 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                From the constitutional analysis, it follows that the\n\nevidence was sufficient.           The prosecution offered expert testimony\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fthat twenty-two of the twenty-five firearms at issue necessarily\n\nhad crossed state or foreign lines because they were originally\n\nmanufactured in other states or countries. The interstate commerce\n\nargument is especially misplaced here, where Teleguez traveled from\n\nhis home in Pennsylvania, across a number of state lines, to sell\n\nfirearms to Ortiz in Massachusetts.\n\nC.        Denial of Motions To Suppress Post-Arrest Statement\n\n          After defendant had signed a voluntary and knowing waiver\n\nof his Miranda rights, ATF agent Bernie Tuerler asked Teleguez how\n\nmany illegal guns he had and how many illegal guns he had sold.\n\nDefendant did not respond. Teleguez was then asked who removed the\n\nserial numbers and reblued6 the guns which he sold.       Teleguez\n\nanswered, \"Well, Alex is the one who reblued the guns and removed\n\nthe serial numbers.\"   Only then did defendant say, \"I think I'm\n\ngoing to get a lawyer.\"7\n\n          The district court denied defendant's pre-trial motion to\n\nsuppress the statement that Alex was the one who reblued the guns\n\nand removed the serial numbers.8      The court similarly denied\n\n\n\n     6\n          \"Rebluing\" is the process of refinishing the surface of\na firearm after the chemical finish of the firearm has been worn\noff.\n     7\n          The trial judge instructed the jury not to draw any\ninference from Teleguez's invocation of his right to counsel.\n     8\n          Teleguez asserts that the challenged statement was the\ngovernment's only evidence that he had knowledge that the serial\nnumbers on firearms had been altered or removed. This is not so.\n\n                               -16-\n\fdefendant's pre-admission and post-admission suppression motions at\n\ntrial.     The court noted that the agent's questions were put to\n\nTeleguez    in   \"fairly   quick    succession\"     and   concluded    that\n\ndefendant's mere hesitation or non-response to previous questions\n\ndid not justify suppression.       Our appellate review of the denials\n\nof defendant's motions is bifurcated.      We review findings of fact\n\nfor clear error; we review conclusions of law de novo.                United\n\nStates v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Teleguez argues that there was a Miranda violation and\n\nrelies on the facts that (1) just before he made the challenged\n\nstatement he had not answered Tuerler's questions about how many\n\nillegal guns he had and how many illegal guns he had sold, and (2)\n\njust after the statement he said, \"I think I'm going to get a\n\nlawyer.\"    See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966).\n\nTeleguez argues that his silence in response to questions about the\n\nnumber of illegal guns was \"tantamount\" to the invocation of his\n\nright to remain silent, and that his subsequent invocation of his\n\nright to an attorney confirms that his earlier state of mind in not\n\nanswering questions was to exercise his Miranda rights, his prior\n\nwritten waiver notwithstanding.\n\n            Miranda addresses two different rights: the right to\n\nremain silent and the right to counsel.           See id. at 444; Bui v.\n\nDiPaolo, 170 F.3d 232, 239 (1st Cir. 1999).          The record is clear\n\nthat Teleguez did not request counsel until after he made the\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fstatement, so his right to counsel is not at issue.             That leaves\n\nthe question of whether he had invoked his right to remain silent.\n\nHe had not.\n\n            A defendant's choice, after signing a Miranda waiver, to\n\nselectively answer questions, is not in itself an unequivocal\n\nassertion of his right to remain silent.               There is no other\n\nevidence to support the argument that Teleguez asserted his right\n\nto remain silent.       See Bui, 170 F.3d at 239; cf. Davis v. United\n\nStates, 512 U.S. 452, 461-62 (1994) (\"If the suspect's statement is\n\nnot an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers\n\nhave no obligation to stop questioning him.\").\n\n            The   district   court    correctly   held   that    Teleguez's\n\nstatement was admissible.\n\nD.          Denial of Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n\n            At the close of the evidence, the district court denied\n\nTeleguez's motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the three\n\ncounts of possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers.\n\nThe court rejected the argument that defendant did not know at the\n\ntime of possession that serial numbers had been removed from many\n\nof the guns he sold to Ortiz.         We review the matter de novo, see\n\nUnited States v. O'Shea, 426 F.3d 475, 479 (1st Cir. 2005), and\n\naffirm.\n\n            The statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(k), requires the defendant\n\nto   have   knowingly   possessed    firearms   with   obliterated   serial\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fnumbers.    See United States v. Hooker, 997 F.2d 67, 74 (5th Cir.\n\n1993).   Defendant argues that his statement that \"Alex is the one\n\nwho reblued the guns and removed the serial numbers\" is not a\n\nstatement that Teleguez had this knowledge at the time he possessed\n\nthe firearms.      That is true, but it is hardly dispositive.\n\n            The government's case did not rest merely on Teleguez's\n\nstatement, so we do not face the abstract question of whether\n\ninferences from defendant's statement would suffice to meet the\n\ngovernment's    burden   of   proof.   On   August   25,   2002,   Teleguez\n\npersonally sold six firearms with obliterated serial numbers to\n\nOrtiz in Massachusetts.        The same was true of the two firearms\n\ndefendant sold to Ortiz on August 30, 2002.      Further, on October 3,\n\n2002, Teleguez arranged for Zhernov to deliver to Ortiz another\n\nfirearm with an obliterated serial number, for which Teleguez\n\nreceived $850.     It is easy to infer that Teleguez was familiar with\n\nthe guns he was selling and knew quite well that the serial numbers\n\nhad been obliterated.         This conclusion that Teleguez had the\n\nrequisite knowledge is further supported by Quickel's testimony\n\nthat he had purchased firearms with intact serial numbers for\n\nTeleguez,    and    by   Agent   Burns's    testimony      explaining   the\n\nsimilarities between Quickel's purchases for Teleguez and numerous\n\nfirearms with obliterated serial numbers that defendant sold to\n\nOrtiz.   The evidence was sufficient.\n\n            The conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f",

Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, LYNCH and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Ivan Teleguz of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, participated in an interstate business, the selling of firearms. He sold firearms to Carlos Ortiz, a cooperating witness for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> the FBI in Springfield, Massachusetts. All told, over a fifteen-month period ending in October 2002, Teleguz and his co-defendants sold to Ortiz twenty-five firearms, thirteen of which had obliterated serial numbers.</p>\n<p>Teleguz was charged with federal conspiracies both to deal firearms without a license, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 922(a)(1)(A), and to possess firearms with obliterated serial numbers, <i>see id.</i> §§ 371, 922(k), as well as three separate counts of possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers, <i>see id.</i> § 922(k). His co-defendants, Aleksei Safanov, Roman Zhirnov, Andrey Buynovskiy, and Michael Quickel, all pled guilty, and Quickel testified against Teleguz. A jury convicted Teleguz on all counts. The district court sentenced Teleguz to fifty-one months' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and a special monetary assessment of $500.</p>\n<p>Teleguz attacks his conviction, arguing that the district court erred (1) in denying his request for an entrapment instruction and in precluding him from arguing entrapment at closing, (2) in denying his motion to dismiss the possession counts on interstate commerce grounds, (3) in denying his motions to suppress his post-arrest statement, and (4) in denying a motion for judgment of acquittal as a matter of law as to the possession counts. We affirm. We adhere to our prior rule that 18 U.S.C. § 922(k) is a constitutional exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause powers, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Diaz-Martinez,</i> 71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st Cir.1995), and hold that this result is not overruled by <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), or <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. FACTS</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Ortiz's Firearms Purchases</i></p>\n<p>Ortiz was paid by the FBI to assist in criminal investigations. In this case, Ortiz received approximately $80,000.</p>\n<p>In the early summer of 2001, FBI Special Agent Robert Lewis asked Ortiz to \"keep an eye out and an ear out for criminal activity amongst Russian individuals in the Springfield area.\" Ortiz's inquiries of some members of the Russian community ultimately led to the criminal firearms transactions charges in this case. At various times, Ortiz represented that he had his own customers for guns.</p>\n<p>The first firearms transaction occurred in July 2001. Ortiz went to a local gun store, where he was approached by Buynovskiy. Buynovskiy asked Ortiz if he was interested in purchasing some rifles. Ortiz was interested; he consulted the FBI and then gave Buynovskiy a $200 deposit. On July 2, Buynovskiy and Zhirnov met with Ortiz in a parking lot, where Ortiz purchased two rifles and ammunition for $1,800. The source of at least one of these weapons was Teleguz. More than a year earlier, in the spring of 2000, Teleguz had purchased one of these rifles from an acquaintance in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>The FBI investigation was interrupted by the events of September 11, 2001, but then resumed in the spring of 2002. On April 6, 2002, Ortiz purchased two firearms from Buynovskiy and Safanov. He purchased an additional firearm from Safanov on May 20, 2002.</p>\n<p>On June 24, 2002, Ortiz and Safanov, at Safanov's suggestion, drove together to Pennsylvania to buy guns from Teleguz. The two went to Teleguz's house in Ephrata, Pennsylvania, where Ortiz purchased four firearms. The serial number on one of the four firearms had been obliterated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> by grinding. The two returned to Massachusetts with the firearms.</p>\n<p>On July 16, 2002, Ortiz went to Safanov's apartment in Springfield and purchased another five firearms. Serial numbers on three of these firearms had been removed.</p>\n<p>On August 25, 2002, Teleguz, who had traveled to Massachusetts, met Ortiz in a Springfield parking lot and sold Ortiz another eight firearms, six of which had their serial numbers obliterated. Teleguz asked Ortiz to send him money for the firearms by mail. The defendant gave Ortiz an envelope with his name and Pennsylvania address written on it. On August 27, 2002, Ortiz instead sent Teleguz a wire transfer for $1,500 as additional payment for the firearms purchased two days earlier.</p>\n<p>On August 30, 2002, Teleguz again met with Ortiz in Springfield. This time, defendant sold Ortiz two semi-automatic pistols with obliterated serial numbers. Ortiz paid Teleguz $1,200.</p>\n<p>On October 3, 2002, at Teleguz's direction, Ortiz met with Zhirnov in Springfield. Zhirnov sold Ortiz a firearm whose serial number had been removed. The next day, Ortiz wired $850 to Teleguz in payment for the firearm.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Quickel's Firearms Purchases for Teleguz</i></p>\n<p>Quickel testified that in July and August 2002, he purchased firearms for Teleguz, at defendant's request. Quickel used his own identification at legitimate firearms stores in Pennsylvania. Teleguz had told him that Teleguz could not purchase the firearms in his own name. Typically, Teleguz went with Quickel to the firearms stores, told Quickel which firearms to buy, and gave Quickel money to purchase the firearms. Quickel would carry the firearms out of the store himself, and then hand them over to Teleguz. The defendant paid Quickel $100 for each rifle and $200 for each pistol purchased.</p>\n<p>The government introduced into evidence six transaction records detailing Quickel's firearms purchases in Pennsylvania on behalf of Teleguz. The records showed that Quickel purchased fifteen firearms from July 8 through August 28, 2002. All of the firearms had serial numbers at the time of purchase.</p>\n<p>ATF Special Agent Patrick Burns testified about the guns Quickel purchased for Teleguz which were ultimately sold to Ortiz. Burns testified that Ortiz purchased nine firearms that were similar to firearms Quickel purchased for Teleguz. All nine of the firearms had obliterated serial numbers when they were sold to Ortiz. As to four of the firearms, the similarity to Quickel's purchases was limited to the manufacturer and type of firearm. As to the remaining five firearms, the government was able to raise partial serial numbers which matched the serial numbers associated with the firearms purchased by Quickel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Denial of Request for Entrapment Instruction and Preclusion from Arguing Entrapment at Closing</i></p>\n<p>Teleguz's primary argument is that he was entitled to an entrapment instruction because the evidence shows that Ortiz was an insistent buyer who was doggedly persistent, and this amounted to improper inducement of Teleguz. Teleguz also argues that the district court erred in precluding him from arguing entrapment to the jury at closing. Teleguz preserved his objections at trial; we review the denial of the entrapment instruction de novo, <i>United States v. Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 76 (1st Cir.2005), and review the limitations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> placed on defendant's closing argument for abuse of discretion, <i>United States v. Wood,</i> 982 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>The entrapment defense is not a doctrine of constitutional dimension or one expressly created by statute. <i>United States v. Russell,</i> 411 U.S. 423, 432-33, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir.2007). Rather, it is a judicially created doctrine which recognizes that \"Congress could not have intended that its statutes were to be enforced by tempting innocent persons into violations.\" <i>Sherman v. United States,</i> 356 U.S. 369, 372, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958).</p>\n<p>The question is whether a reasonable jury could view the evidence as establishing that defendant was entrapped. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir.1988). If so, Teleguz was entitled to an entrapment instruction; if not, there was no error in the district court's denial of defendant's request.</p>\n<p>The entrapment defense consists of two prongs. <i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 52. The first prong requires a showing of improper government inducement. <i>United States v. Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1998). The second prong requires that the defendant have had a lack of predisposition to commit the offense. <i>Id.</i> Because entrapment is a judicially created doctrine, courts have been careful not to contravene congressional intent to punish those who commit the offense; that, in turn, requires that the doctrine take into account the practical problems faced by federal law enforcement. <i>See </i><i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 52-53.</p>\n<p>Our case law stating that a defendant has a low entry-level burden for obtaining an entrapment instruction, <i>Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9, should not be misunderstood (as defendant here misunderstands). In assessing whether the entry-level burden for an instruction has been met, we look at the evidence most charitably to the defendant and determine whether it is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that there was entrapment. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 813.</p>\n<p>In this case, no reasonable jury could conclude that there was any improper government inducement. Defendant's argument is based on an erroneous understanding of (1) what it takes to show improper inducement, (2) the personal nature of the entrapment defense, and (3) the scope of the record to be considered.</p>\n<p>Acceptance of Teleguz's arguments would so water down the concept of <i>improper</i> inducement as to delete the requirement of impropriety from the equation. Admittedly, sometimes a judgment on what is sufficient to make a plausible claim of <i>improper</i> inducement can be a close call. Nonetheless, merely giving a defendant an opportunity to commit a crime when the government puts forth an enthusiastic and persistent buyer of illicit goods cannot be improper inducement.</p>\n<p>Decisions which discuss the improper inducement requirement often use the phrase that there must be \"opportunity plus,\" and then turn to the nature of the \"plus.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d 231, 243 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Vega,</i> 102 F.3d 1301, 1305 (1st Cir.1996). Plucking phrases from the case law, Teleguz argues that the \"plus\" factor is necessarily satisfied by evidence of government manipulation or by forceful solicitation and dogged insistence. He cites <i>United States v. Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d 955 (1st Cir.1994), for support. <i>Gendron,</i> however, is clear that sting operations ordinarily do not involve improper inducement. <i>See id.</i> at 961; <i>see also </i><i>Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9 (\"A `sting' operation is not improper inducement if it merely provides an opportunity to commit a crime. . . .\"). Indeed, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> sting operations by their nature often involve government manipulation, solicitation, and, at times, deceit. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d at 71-72, 76-77.</p>\n<p>Teleguz's argument that the evidence supported an entrapment instruction rests on evidence to the following effect. Teleguz argues that it was the government agent<sup>[1]</sup> Ortiz who first approached Teleguz and the co-defendants about purchasing firearms. Teleguz also maintains that Ortiz was not simply a buyer; he pretended to befriend several of the defendants. Ortiz pressed hard to get a number of weapons from co-defendants, and to get them quickly. Further, defendant says Ortiz made up stories about why he needed the weapons and why he needed them so quickly. These facts, however, whether standing alone or collectively, are insufficient to show improper inducement.</p>\n<p>Most of the evidence on which Teleguz relies to show undue pressure was directed toward co-defendants, and was not designed to induce the co-defendants to put pressure on Teleguz. Entrapment is a personal defense; it is not additive to cover co-defendants not targeted by the government agent. <i>See </i><i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 54-55; <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir.1987). The justification for the entrapment doctrine simply does not extend to pressure placed on co-defendants intended to affect only those co-defendants' actions.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In the larger context of this case, the basis for an entrapment instruction is even weaker. Before Ortiz and Teleguz met for the first time on June 24, 2002 at Teleguz's home, Ortiz had already bought two rifles from co-defendants Buynovskiy and Zhernov, one of which had been previously owned by defendant.</p>\n<p>In total, Ortiz completed eight firearms transactions with Teleguz and his co-defendants. Over the course of these transactions, Ortiz and Teleguz had three face-to-face meetings. As the district court noted, when Ortiz visited defendant's house in Pennsylvania, Teleguz stated almost immediately that he was ready to do business. Within approximately one hour, Teleguz had sold Ortiz four firearms. Two months later, on August 25, 2002, the defendant traveled to Massachusetts and personally sold Ortiz eight firearms. Five days later, he sold Ortiz another two firearms, also in Massachusetts. There is no showing of any resistance on Teleguz's part to selling weapons, much less any resistance which was overcome by improper government pressure. Defendant was an eager vendor of deadly weapons.</p>\n<p>Having considered the broader record, we agree that Teleguz did not make the requisite entry-level showing for an entrapment instruction. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Joost,</i> 92 F.3d 7, 12-14 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that defendant was entitled to entrapment instruction where jury could have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> found, inter alia, that defendant resisted agents' requests, defendant employed a general strategy of deflecting agents' requests, agents deliberately created a financial dependency, and agents threatened defendant's continued income). The district court properly denied defendant's request for an instruction on entrapment.</p>\n<p>As to the district court's decision to preclude Teleguz from arguing entrapment at closing, we find no abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Wood,</i> 982 F.2d at 4. The trial court \"has broad discretion over the scope of summations.\" <i>United States v. Grabiec,</i> 96 F.3d 549, 552 (1st Cir.1996). After the close of evidence, having already correctly determined that Teleguz was not entitled to an entrapment instruction, the district court informed defense counsel that he would be precluded from arguing entrapment in his closing argument. Defense counsel initially believed that the district court had prohibited him from arguing neutral facts that had been developed in relation to the desired entrapment defense. The court clarified, however, that it was only prohibiting defense counsel from arguing a theory of entrapment; there was no limitation on arguing facts. The district court's decision was well within its discretion.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Denial of Motion To Dismiss, on Interstate Commerce Grounds, Charges of Possession of a Firearm with an Obliterated Serial Number</i></p>\n<p>The district court denied Teleguz's pretrial motion to dismiss the charges brought against him under 18 U.S.C. § 922(k). Teleguz argues that dismissal of the charges under 18 U.S.C. § 922(k) was required both because § 922(k) involves an impermissible exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause powers, and because the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under the statute. Our review of legal questions is de novo, and we review the entire record on Teleguz's sufficiency claim. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d 124, 129 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 457 F.3d 109, 113 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Section 922(k) prohibits possession of firearms with obliterated or altered serial numbers.<sup>[3]</sup> The statutory text requires proof that the firearm \"has, at any time, been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>We have already held that § 922(k) is a constitutional exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause powers. <i>See </i><i>Diaz-Martinez,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> 71 F.3d at 953. Teleguz argues, however, that in light of the Supreme Court's more recent decisions in <i>Jones,</i> 529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902, and <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658, we should revisit <i>Diaz-Martinez</i> and hold that evidence that a firearm was manufactured in one state and possessed by defendant in another state is insufficient to justify a conviction under § 922(k). Teleguz mixes the question of Congress's power to regulate with the different question of sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>Diaz-Martinez,</i> which was decided after <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995),<sup>[5]</sup> remains good law. Other circuits, post-<i>Lopez,</i> have upheld § 922(k) against similar attacks. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Baer,</i> 235 F.3d 561, 563 (10th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Mack,</i> 164 F.3d 467, 473 (9th Cir.1999). Indeed, our sister circuits have held that virtually identical interstate commerce elements in other federal criminal statutes survive challenges under <i>Jones</i> and <i>Morrison. See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Thompson,</i> 359 F.3d 470, 480 (7th Cir.) (upholding 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)), <i>cert. denied,</i> 543 U.S. 844, 125 S.Ct. 285, 160 L.Ed.2d 71 (2004); <i>United States v. Rousseau,</i> 257 F.3d 925, 932-33 (9th Cir.) (reaffirming constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8) and § 922(g)(1)), <i>cert. denied,</i> 534 U.S. 1013, 122 S.Ct. 503, 151 L.Ed.2d 413 (2001); <i>United States v. Dorris,</i> 236 F.3d 582, 584-86 (10th Cir.2000) (upholding 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)), <i>cert. denied,</i> 532 U.S. 986, 121 S.Ct. 1635, 149 L.Ed.2d 495 (2001); <i>United States v. Napier,</i> 233 F.3d 394, 400-02 (6th Cir.2000) (upholding 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8)).</p>\n<p>The reasoning for upholding § 922(k) in the aftermath of <i>Jones</i> and <i>Morrison</i> is the same as that provided in the cases cited above. Congress has not exceeded the scope of its Commerce Clause powers in enacting § 922(k) because the statute prohibits the possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers only if such firearms have been \"shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\" So restricted by its own text, § 922(k) does not present a constitutional problem  Congress may permissibly regulate the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, as well as activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624; <i>United States v. Morales-De Jesus,</i> 372 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>From the constitutional analysis, it follows that the evidence was sufficient. The prosecution offered expert testimony that twenty-two of the twenty-five firearms at issue necessarily had crossed state or foreign lines because they were originally manufactured in other states or countries. The interstate commerce argument is especially misplaced here, where Teleguz traveled from his home in Pennsylvania, across a number of state lines, to sell firearms to Ortiz in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Denial of Motions To Suppress Post-Arrest Statement</i></p>\n<p>After defendant had signed a voluntary and knowing waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, ATF agent Bernie Tuerler asked Teleguz how many illegal guns he had and how many illegal guns he had sold. Defendant did not respond. Teleguz was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> then asked who removed the serial numbers and reblued<sup>[6]</sup> the guns which he sold. Teleguz answered, \"Well, Alex is the one who reblued the guns and removed the serial numbers.\" Only then did defendant say, \"I think I'm going to get a lawyer.\"<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court denied defendant's pre-trial motion to suppress the statement that Alex was the one who reblued the guns and removed the serial numbers.<sup>[8]</sup> The court similarly denied defendant's preadmission and post-admission suppression motions at trial. The court noted that the agent's questions were put to Teleguz in \"fairly quick succession\" and concluded that defendant's mere hesitation or non-response to previous questions did not justify suppression. Our appellate review of the denials of defendant's motions is bifurcated. We review findings of fact for clear error; we review conclusions of law de novo. <i>United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Teleguz argues that there was a <i>Miranda</i> violation and relies on the facts that (1) just before he made the challenged statement he had not answered Tuerler's questions about how many illegal guns he had and how many illegal guns he had sold, and (2) just after the statement he said, \"I think I'm going to get a lawyer.\" <i>See </i><i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 444-45, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Teleguz argues that his silence in response to questions about the number of illegal guns was \"tantamount\" to the invocation of his right to remain silent, and that his subsequent invocation of his right to an attorney confirms that his earlier state of mind in not answering questions was to exercise his <i>Miranda</i> rights, his prior written waiver notwithstanding.</p>\n<p><i>Miranda</i> addresses two different rights: the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. <i>See id.</i> at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602; <i>Bui v. DiPaolo,</i> 170 F.3d 232, 239 (1st Cir. 1999). The record is clear that Teleguz did not request counsel until after he made the statement, so his right to counsel is not at issue. That leaves the question of whether he had invoked his right to remain silent. He had not.</p>\n<p>A defendant's choice, after signing a <i>Miranda</i> waiver, to selectively answer questions, is not in itself an unequivocal assertion of his right to remain silent. There is no other evidence to support the argument that Teleguz asserted his right to remain silent. <i>See </i><i>Bui,</i> 170 F.3d at 239; <i>cf. </i><i>Davis v. United States,</i> 512 U.S. 452, 461-62, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (\"If the suspect's statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.\").</p>\n<p>The district court correctly held that Teleguz's statement was admissible.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Denial of Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</i></p>\n<p>At the close of the evidence, the district court denied Teleguz's motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the three counts of possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers. The court rejected the argument that defendant did not know <i>at the time of possession</i> that serial numbers had been removed from many of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> the guns he sold to Ortiz. We review the matter de novo, <i>see </i><i>United States v. O'Shea,</i> 426 F.3d 475, 479 (1st Cir.2005), and affirm.</p>\n<p>The statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(k), requires the defendant to have knowingly possessed firearms with obliterated serial numbers. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hooker,</i> 997 F.2d 67, 74 (5th Cir.1993). Defendant argues that his statement that \"Alex is the one who reblued the guns and removed the serial numbers\" is not a statement that Teleguz had this knowledge <i>at the time he possessed the firearms.</i> That is true, but it is hardly dispositive.</p>\n<p>The government's case did not rest merely on Teleguz's statement, so we do not face the abstract question of whether inferences from defendant's statement would suffice to meet the government's burden of proof. On August 25, 2002, Teleguz personally sold six firearms with obliterated serial numbers to Ortiz in Massachusetts. The same was true of the two firearms defendant sold to Ortiz on August 30, 2002. Further, on October 3, 2002, Teleguz arranged for Zhernov to deliver to Ortiz another firearm with an obliterated serial number, for which Teleguz received $850. It is easy to infer that Teleguz was familiar with the guns he was selling and knew quite well that the serial numbers had been obliterated. This conclusion that Teleguz had the requisite knowledge is further supported by Quickel's testimony that he had purchased firearms with intact serial numbers for Teleguz, and by Agent Burns's testimony explaining the similarities between Quickel's purchases for Teleguz and numerous firearms with obliterated serial numbers that defendant sold to Ortiz. The evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p>The conviction is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For entrapment purposes, an individual hired by the government as a cooperating witness qualifies as a \"government agent.\" <i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p>[2]  This is not a case like <i>Luisi</i> where there was evidence that\n</p>\n<p>(1) a government agent specifically targeted the defendant in order to induce him to commit illegal conduct; (2) the agent acted through the middleman after other government attempts at inducing the defendant had failed; (3) the government agent requested, encouraged, or instructed the middleman to employ a specified inducement, which could be found improper, against the targeted defendant; (4) the agent's actions led the middleman to do what the government sought, even if the government did not use improper means to influence the middleman; and (5) as a result of the middleman's inducement, the targeted defendant in fact engaged in the illegal conduct.</p>\n<p><i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 55.</p>\n<p>[3]  18 U.S.C. § 922(k) provides:\n</p>\n<p>It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to transport, ship, or receive, in interstate or foreign commerce, any firearm which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, or altered or to possess or receive any firearm which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, or altered and has, at any time, been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n<p>[4]  Teleguz cites a case from the Ninth Circuit, <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> 348 F.3d 1132 (9th Cir.2003), <i>vacated,</i> 545 U.S. 1112, 125 S.Ct. 2899, 162 L.Ed.2d 291 (2005), to support his argument that § 922(k) falls outside Congress's Commerce Clause powers and/or cannot constitutionally be applied to him. <i>Stewart,</i> however, considered 18 U.S.C. § 922(o), which  unlike § 922(k)  does not contain an express interstate commerce element. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 922(o); <i>Stewart,</i> 348 F.3d at 1134. Further, on remand from the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit reconsidered § 922(o) in light of <i>Gonzales v. Raich,</i> 545 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005), and held that the statute <i>could</i> be constitutionally applied to Stewart's possession of homemade machine guns. <i>United States v. Stewart,</i> 451 F.3d 1071, 1078 (9th Cir.2006). Teleguz has failed to note that the Ninth Circuit has, in fact, upheld § 922(k) on interstate commerce grounds. <i>United States v. Mack,</i> 164 F.3d 467, 473 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>[5]  In <i>Lopez,</i> the Supreme Court held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U.S.C. § 922(q)(1)(A), which contained no interstate commerce element, was beyond Congress's Commerce Clause powers because gun possession in a local school zone did not qualify as economic activity that substantially affected interstate commerce. 514 U.S. at 561-62, 567-68, 115 S.Ct. 1624.</p>\n<p>[6]  \"Rebluing\" is the process of refinishing the surface of a firearm after the chemical finish of the firearm has been worn off.</p>\n<p>[7]  The trial judge instructed the jury not to draw any inference from Teleguz's invocation of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p>[8]  Teleguz asserts that the challenged statement was the government's only evidence that he had knowledge that the serial numbers on firearms had been altered or removed. This is not so.</p>\n\n</div>",

FACTS</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Ortiz's Firearms Purchases</i></p>\n<p>Ortiz was paid by the FBI to assist in criminal investigations. In this case, Ortiz received approximately $80,000.</p>\n<p>In the early summer of 2001, FBI Special Agent Robert Lewis asked Ortiz to \"keep an eye out and an ear out for criminal activity amongst Russian individuals in the Springfield area.\" Ortiz's inquiries of some members of the Russian community ultimately led to the criminal firearms transactions charges in this case. At various times, Ortiz represented that he had his own customers for guns.</p>\n<p>The first firearms transaction occurred in July 2001. Ortiz went to a local gun store, where he was approached by Buynovskiy. Buynovskiy asked Ortiz if he was interested in purchasing some rifles. Ortiz was interested; he consulted the FBI and then gave Buynovskiy a $200 deposit. On July 2, Buynovskiy and Zhirnov met with Ortiz in a parking lot, where Ortiz purchased two rifles and ammunition for $1,800. The source of at least one of these weapons was Teleguz. More than a year earlier, in the spring of 2000, Teleguz had purchased one of these rifles from an acquaintance in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>The FBI investigation was interrupted by the events of September 11, 2001, but then resumed in the spring of 2002. On April 6, 2002, Ortiz purchased two firearms from Buynovskiy and Safanov. He purchased an additional firearm from Safanov on May 20, 2002.</p>\n<p>On June 24, 2002, Ortiz and Safanov, at Safanov's suggestion, drove together to Pennsylvania to buy guns from Teleguz. The two went to Teleguz's house in Ephrata, Pennsylvania, where Ortiz purchased four firearms. The serial number on one of the four firearms had been obliterated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> by grinding. The two returned to Massachusetts with the firearms.</p>\n<p>On July 16, 2002, Ortiz went to Safanov's apartment in Springfield and purchased another five firearms. Serial numbers on three of these firearms had been removed.</p>\n<p>On August 25, 2002, Teleguz, who had traveled to Massachusetts, met Ortiz in a Springfield parking lot and sold Ortiz another eight firearms, six of which had their serial numbers obliterated. Teleguz asked Ortiz to send him money for the firearms by mail. The defendant gave Ortiz an envelope with his name and Pennsylvania address written on it. On August 27, 2002, Ortiz instead sent Teleguz a wire transfer for $1,500 as additional payment for the firearms purchased two days earlier.</p>\n<p>On August 30, 2002, Teleguz again met with Ortiz in Springfield. This time, defendant sold Ortiz two semi-automatic pistols with obliterated serial numbers. Ortiz paid Teleguz $1,200.</p>\n<p>On October 3, 2002, at Teleguz's direction, Ortiz met with Zhirnov in Springfield. Zhirnov sold Ortiz a firearm whose serial number had been removed. The next day, Ortiz wired $850 to Teleguz in payment for the firearm.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Quickel's Firearms Purchases for Teleguz</i></p>\n<p>Quickel testified that in July and August 2002, he purchased firearms for Teleguz, at defendant's request. Quickel used his own identification at legitimate firearms stores in Pennsylvania. Teleguz had told him that Teleguz could not purchase the firearms in his own name. Typically, Teleguz went with Quickel to the firearms stores, told Quickel which firearms to buy, and gave Quickel money to purchase the firearms. Quickel would carry the firearms out of the store himself, and then hand them over to Teleguz. The defendant paid Quickel $100 for each rifle and $200 for each pistol purchased.</p>\n<p>The government introduced into evidence six transaction records detailing Quickel's firearms purchases in Pennsylvania on behalf of Teleguz. The records showed that Quickel purchased fifteen firearms from July 8 through August 28, 2002. All of the firearms had serial numbers at the time of purchase.</p>\n<p>ATF Special Agent Patrick Burns testified about the guns Quickel purchased for Teleguz which were ultimately sold to Ortiz. Burns testified that Ortiz purchased nine firearms that were similar to firearms Quickel purchased for Teleguz. All nine of the firearms had obliterated serial numbers when they were sold to Ortiz. As to four of the firearms, the similarity to Quickel's purchases was limited to the manufacturer and type of firearm. As to the remaining five firearms, the government was able to raise partial serial numbers which matched the serial numbers associated with the firearms purchased by Quickel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Denial of Request for Entrapment Instruction and Preclusion from Arguing Entrapment at Closing</i></p>\n<p>Teleguz's primary argument is that he was entitled to an entrapment instruction because the evidence shows that Ortiz was an insistent buyer who was doggedly persistent, and this amounted to improper inducement of Teleguz.

Rather, it is a judicially created doctrine which recognizes that \"Congress could not have intended that its statutes were to be enforced by tempting innocent persons into violations.\" <i>Sherman v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span> (1958).</p>\n<p>The question is whether a reasonable jury could view the evidence as establishing that defendant was entrapped. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512578\"><a href=\"/opinion/512578/united-states-v-felix-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span>, 812 (1st Cir.1988). If so, Teleguz was entitled to an entrapment instruction; if not, there was no error in the district court's denial of defendant's request.</p>\n<p>The entrapment defense consists of two prongs. <i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 52. The first prong requires a showing of improper government inducement. <i>United States v. Gamache,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198087\"><a href=\"/opinion/198087/united-states-v-gamache/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1998). The second prong requires that the defendant have had a lack of predisposition to commit the offense. <i>Id.</i> Because entrapment is a judicially created doctrine, courts have been careful not to contravene congressional intent to punish those who commit the offense; that, in turn, requires that the doctrine take into account the practical problems faced by federal law enforcement. <i>See </i><i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 52-53.</p>\n<p>Our case law stating that a defendant has a low entry-level burden for obtaining an entrapment instruction, <i>Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9, should not be misunderstood (as defendant here misunderstands). In assessing whether the entry-level burden for an instruction has been met, we look at the evidence most charitably to the defendant and determine whether it is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that there was entrapment. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 813.</p>\n<p>In this case, no reasonable jury could conclude that there was any improper government inducement. Defendant's argument is based on an erroneous understanding of (1) what it takes to show improper inducement, (2) the personal nature of the entrapment defense, and (3) the scope of the record to be considered.</p>\n<p>Acceptance of Teleguz's arguments would so water down the concept of <i>improper</i> inducement as to delete the requirement of impropriety from the equation. Admittedly, sometimes a judgment on what is sufficient to make a plausible claim of <i>improper</i> inducement can be a close call. Nonetheless, merely giving a defendant an opportunity to commit a crime when the government puts forth an enthusiastic and persistent buyer of illicit goods cannot be improper inducement.</p>\n<p>Decisions which discuss the improper inducement requirement often use the phrase that there must be \"opportunity plus,\" and then turn to the nature of the \"plus.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Capelton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200745\"><a href=\"/opinion/200745/united-states-v-capelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 243 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Vega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197125\"><a href=\"/opinion/197125/united-states-v-vega/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></a></span>, 1305 (1st Cir.1996). Plucking phrases from the case law, Teleguz argues that the \"plus\" factor is necessarily satisfied by evidence of government manipulation or by forceful solicitation and dogged insistence. He cites <i>United States v. Gendron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195225\"><a href=\"/opinion/195225/united-states-v-gendron/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994), for support. <i>Gendron,</i> however, is clear that sting operations ordinarily do not involve improper inducement. <i>See id.</i> at 961; <i>see also </i><i>Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9 (\"A `sting' operation is not improper inducement if it merely provides an opportunity to commit a crime. . . .\"). Indeed, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> sting operations by their nature often involve government manipulation, solicitation, and, at times, deceit. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d at 71-72, 76-77.</p>\n<p>Teleguz's argument that the evidence supported an entrapment instruction rests on evidence to the following effect. Teleguz argues that it was the government agent<sup>[1]</sup> Ortiz who first approached Teleguz and the co-defendants about purchasing firearms. Teleguz also maintains that Ortiz was not simply a buyer; he pretended to befriend several of the defendants. Ortiz pressed hard to get a number of weapons from co-defendants, and to get them quickly. Further, defendant says Ortiz made up stories about why he needed the weapons and why he needed them so quickly. These facts, however, whether standing alone or collectively, are insufficient to show improper inducement.</p>\n<p>Most of the evidence on which Teleguz relies to show undue pressure was directed toward co-defendants, and was not designed to induce the co-defendants to put pressure on Teleguz. Entrapment is a personal defense; it is not additive to cover co-defendants not targeted by the government agent. <i>See </i><i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 54-55; <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489321\"><a href=\"/opinion/489321/united-states-v-john-c-bradley-united-states-of-america-v-howard-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1987). The justification for the entrapment doctrine simply does not extend to pressure placed on co-defendants intended to affect only those co-defendants' actions.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In the larger context of this case, the basis for an entrapment instruction is even weaker. Before Ortiz and Teleguz met for the first time on June 24, 2002 at Teleguz's home, Ortiz had already bought two rifles from co-defendants Buynovskiy and Zhernov, one of which had been previously owned by defendant.</p>\n<p>In total, Ortiz completed eight firearms transactions with Teleguz and his co-defendants. Over the course of these transactions, Ortiz and Teleguz had three face-to-face meetings. As the district court noted, when Ortiz visited defendant's house in Pennsylvania, Teleguz stated almost immediately that he was ready to do business. Within approximately one hour, Teleguz had sold Ortiz four firearms. Two months later, on August 25, 2002, the defendant traveled to Massachusetts and personally sold Ortiz eight firearms. Five days later, he sold Ortiz another two firearms, also in Massachusetts. There is no showing of any resistance on Teleguz's part to selling weapons, much less any resistance which was overcome by improper government pressure. Defendant was an eager vendor of deadly weapons.</p>\n<p>Having considered the broader record, we agree that Teleguz did not make the requisite entry-level showing for an entrapment instruction. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Joost,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196915\"><a href=\"/opinion/196915/united-states-v-joost/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 12-14 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that defendant was entitled to entrapment instruction where jury could have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> found, inter alia, that defendant resisted agents' requests, defendant employed a general strategy of deflecting agents' requests, agents deliberately created a financial dependency, and agents threatened defendant's continued income). The district court properly denied defendant's request for an instruction on entrapment.</p>\n<p>As to the district court's decision to preclude Teleguz from arguing entrapment at closing, we find no abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Wood,</i> 982 F.2d at 4. The trial court \"has broad discretion over the scope of summations.\" <i>United States v. Grabiec,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196995\"><a href=\"/opinion/196995/united-states-v-grabiec/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 552 (1st Cir.1996). After the close of evidence, having already correctly determined that Teleguz was not entitled to an entrapment instruction, the district court informed defense counsel that he would be precluded from arguing entrapment in his closing argument. Defense counsel initially believed that the district court had prohibited him from arguing neutral facts that had been developed in relation to the desired entrapment defense. The court clarified, however, that it was only prohibiting defense counsel from arguing a theory of entrapment; there was no limitation on arguing facts. The district court's decision was well within its discretion.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Denial of Motion To Dismiss, on Interstate Commerce Grounds, Charges of Possession of a Firearm with an Obliterated Serial Number</i></p>\n<p>The district court denied Teleguz's pretrial motion to dismiss the charges brought against him under 18 U.S.C. § 922(k). Teleguz argues that dismissal of the charges under 18 U.S.C. § 922(k) was required both because § 922(k) involves an impermissible exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause powers, and because the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under the statute. Our review of legal questions is de novo, and we review the entire record on Teleguz's sufficiency claim. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202688\"><a href=\"/opinion/202688/united-states-v-garcia-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 129 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v.

Teleguz mixes the question of Congress's power to regulate with the different question of sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>Diaz-Martinez,</i> which was decided after <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Other circuits, post-<i>Lopez,</i> have upheld § 922(k) against similar attacks. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Congress has not exceeded the scope of its Commerce Clause powers in enacting § 922(k) because the statute prohibits the possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers only if such firearms have been \"shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\" So restricted by its own text, § 922(k) does not present a constitutional problem  Congress may permissibly regulate the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, as well as activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 558-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The prosecution offered expert testimony that twenty-two of the twenty-five firearms at issue necessarily had crossed state or foreign lines because they were originally manufactured in other states or countries. The interstate commerce argument is especially misplaced here, where Teleguz traveled from his home in Pennsylvania, across a number of state lines, to sell firearms to Ortiz in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Denial of Motions To Suppress Post-Arrest Statement</i></p>\n<p>After defendant had signed a voluntary and knowing waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, ATF agent Bernie Tuerler asked Teleguz how many illegal guns he had and how many illegal guns he had sold. Defendant did not respond. Teleguz was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> then asked who removed the serial numbers and reblued<sup>[6]</sup> the guns which he sold. Teleguz answered, \"Well, Alex is the one who reblued the guns and removed the serial numbers.\" Only then did defendant say, \"I think I'm going to get a lawyer.\"<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court denied defendant's pre-trial motion to suppress the statement that Alex was the one who reblued the guns and removed the serial numbers.<sup>[8]</sup> The court similarly denied defendant's preadmission and post-admission suppression motions at trial. The court noted that the agent's questions were put to Teleguz in \"fairly quick succession\" and concluded that defendant's mere hesitation or non-response to previous questions did not justify suppression. Our appellate review of the denials of defendant's motions is bifurcated. We review findings of fact for clear error; we review conclusions of law de novo. <i>United States v. Coplin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202424\"><a href=\"/opinion/202424/united-states-v-coplin/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 100 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Teleguz argues that there was a <i>Miranda</i> violation and relies on the facts that (1) just before he made the challenged statement he had not answered Tuerler's questions about how many illegal guns he had and how many illegal guns he had sold, and (2) just after the statement he said, \"I think I'm going to get a lawyer.\" <i>See </i><i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 444-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966). Teleguz argues that his silence in response to questions about the number of illegal guns was \"tantamount\" to the invocation of his right to remain silent, and that his subsequent invocation of his right to an attorney confirms that his earlier state of mind in not answering questions was to exercise his <i>Miranda</i> rights, his prior written waiver notwithstanding.</p>\n<p><i>Miranda</i> addresses two different rights: the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. <i>See id.</i> at 444, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The record is clear that Teleguz did not request counsel until after he made the statement, so his right to counsel is not at issue. That leaves the question of whether he had invoked his right to remain silent. He had not.</p>\n<p>A defendant's choice, after signing a <i>Miranda</i> waiver, to selectively answer questions, is not in itself an unequivocal assertion of his right to remain silent. There is no other evidence to support the argument that Teleguz asserted his right to remain silent. <i>See </i><i>Bui,</i> 170 F.3d at 239; <i>cf. </i><i>Davis v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span> (1994) (\"If the suspect's statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.\").</p>\n<p>The district court correctly held that Teleguz's statement was admissible.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Denial of Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</i></p>\n<p>At the close of the evidence, the district court denied Teleguz's motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the three counts of possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers. The court rejected the argument that defendant did not know <i>at the time of possession</i> that serial numbers had been removed from many of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> the guns he sold to Ortiz. We review the matter de novo, <i>see </i><i>United States v. O'Shea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201866\"><a href=\"/opinion/201866/united-states-v-oshea/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 479 (1st Cir.2005), and affirm.</p>\n<p>The statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(k), requires the defendant to have knowingly possessed firearms with obliterated serial numbers. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hooker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610596\"><a href=\"/opinion/610596/united-states-v-donald-hooker-and-donald-ray-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 74 (5th Cir.1993). Defendant argues that his statement that \"Alex is the one who reblued the guns and removed the serial numbers\" is not a statement that Teleguz had this knowledge <i>at the time he possessed the firearms.</i> That is true, but it is hardly dispositive.</p>\n<p>The government's case did not rest merely on Teleguz's statement, so we do not face the abstract question of whether inferences from defendant's statement would suffice to meet the government's burden of proof. On August 25, 2002, Teleguz personally sold six firearms with obliterated serial numbers to Ortiz in Massachusetts. The same was true of the two firearms defendant sold to Ortiz on August 30, 2002. Further, on October 3, 2002, Teleguz arranged for Zhernov to deliver to Ortiz another firearm with an obliterated serial number, for which Teleguz received $850. It is easy to infer that Teleguz was familiar with the guns he was selling and knew quite well that the serial numbers had been obliterated. This conclusion that Teleguz had the requisite knowledge is further supported by Quickel's testimony that he had purchased firearms with intact serial numbers for Teleguz, and by Agent Burns's testimony explaining the similarities between Quickel's purchases for Teleguz and numerous firearms with obliterated serial numbers that defendant sold to Ortiz. The evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p>The conviction is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For entrapment purposes, an individual hired by the government as a cooperating witness qualifies as a \"government agent.\" <i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p>[2]  This is not a case like <i>Luisi</i> where there was evidence that\n</p>\n<p>(1) a government agent specifically targeted the defendant in order to induce him to commit illegal conduct; (2) the agent acted through the middleman after other government attempts at inducing the defendant had failed; (3) the government agent requested, encouraged, or instructed the middleman to employ a specified inducement, which could be found improper, against the targeted defendant; (4) the agent's actions led the middleman to do what the government sought, even if the government did not use improper means to influence the middleman; and (5) as a result of the middleman's inducement, the targeted defendant in fact engaged in the illegal conduct.</p>\n<p><i>Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d at 55.</p>\n<p>[3]  18 U.S.C. § 922(k) provides:\n</p>\n<p>It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to transport, ship, or receive, in interstate or foreign commerce, any firearm which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, or altered or to possess or receive any firearm which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, or altered and has, at any time, been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n<p>[4]  Teleguz cites a case from the Ninth Circuit, <i>United States v.

Further, on remand from the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit reconsidered § 922(o) in light of <i>Gonzales v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (2005), and held that the statute <i>could</i> be constitutionally applied to Stewart's possession of homemade machine guns. <i>United States v.

Teleguz has failed to note that the Ninth Circuit has, in fact, upheld § 922(k) on interstate commerce grounds. <i>United States v.
