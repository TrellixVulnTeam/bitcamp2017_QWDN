R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 03-1710\n\n                   MEDICAL BOOKS IN PRINT, INC.,\n                       Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                      v.\n\n                            HARCOURT, INC.,\n                         Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n         [Hon. Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     José R. García Pérez, with whom Bufete Bennazar, C.S.P. was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Raúl M. Arias, with whom Arturo J. García-Solá and McConnell\nValdés were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                              March 18, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam.    In this diversity case the plaintiff, a\n\nmerchandiser of books and a quondam distributor of medical texts\n\npublished by the defendant, charges the defendant with violating,\n\ninter alia, the Puerto Rico Dealer's Act, 10 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 278-\n\n278e, the Puerto Rico Sales Representatives Act (SRA), 10 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. §§ 279-279h, and various provisions of the Puerto Rico Civil\n\nCode.   After a lengthy period of pretrial discovery, the district\n\ncourt wrote a thoughtful rescript and granted the defendant's\n\nmotion for summary judgment.     Medical Books in Print, Inc. v.\n\nHarcourt, Inc., Civ. No. 99-2208, slip op. (D.P.R. March 21, 2003)\n\n(unpublished).   The plaintiff now appeals.\n\n          We have stated before, and today reaffirm, that when a\n\nnisi prius court accurately takes the measure of a case, applies\n\nthe appropriate legal rules, and formulates a convincing rationale,\n\n\"an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no\n\nother end than to hear its own words resonate.\"    Lawton v. State\n\nMut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996).        We\n\nfrequently have followed this admonition in suitable instances,\n\nsee, e.g., Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 383 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas, Local 901, 74 F.3d 344,\n\n345 (1st Cir. 1996); Holders Capital Corp. v. Cal. Union Ins. Co.\n\n(In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 1993), and this case fits neatly within its boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fConsequently, we affirm the judgment below for substantially the\n\nreasons set forth in the lower court's well-crafted opinion.\n\n          We add only that the issue here is not, as the plaintiff\n\nassumes, whether the plaintiff has suffered harm as a result of the\n\nseverance of its non-exclusive distributorship agreement with the\n\ndefendant.   Rather, the issue centers on which party bears the\n\nlegal responsibility for the end of that relationship.      As the\n\ndistrict court perspicaciously observed, the plaintiff failed to\n\ngive timely notice, as per the contract, of an intent to renew the\n\ndistribution agreement.   That led, in turn, to the expiration of\n\nthe agreement.   In these circumstances, the Dealer's Act does not\n\nafford the plaintiff a remedy.   See Vulcan Tools of P.R. v. Makita\n\nU.S.A., Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 569 (1st Cir. 1994); Nike Int'l Ltd. v.\n\nAthletic Sales, Inc., 689 F. Supp. 1235, 1238, 1247-48 (D.P.R.\n\n1988).   And because the distribution agreement, by its explicit\n\nterms, was non-exclusive, the SRA is also unavailable.1     See 10\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. § 279(a) (defining \"[s]ales representative\" as \"[a]n\n\nindependent entrepreneur who establishes a sales representation\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The plaintiff contends that the payment of a 10% override\ncommission on all direct sales by the defendant in Puerto Rico\nrendered the distribution agreement exclusive. We do not agree.\nThe essence of a non-exclusive agreement is that the manufacturer\n(or, as here, the publisher) retains the right to sell its wares to\nothers, including other distributers, as it sees fit. See Vulcan\nTools, 23 F.3d at 567. The defendant at all times retained that\nright.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fcontract of an exclusive nature, with a principal or grantor\")\n\n(emphasis supplied).\n\n            We need go no further.           Having scoured the briefs,\n\nentertained oral argument, and carefully canvassed the record, we,\n\nlike the district court, find no significantly probative evidence\n\nsufficient to create a genuine dispute as to any material fact.\n\nThe defendant   was,   as   the   district    court   ruled,   entitled   to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
