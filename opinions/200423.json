D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Peter E. Rodway, with whom Rodway & Horodyski was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            April 9, 2003\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.        A jury convicted Defendant-\n\nAppellant Brian Goodine1 of conspiracy and possession with intent\n\nto distribute cocaine base (\"crack\"), in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1)   &   846   (2003).     By    special   verdict   form,   the   jury\n\nindicated that the amount for each count was at least five, but\n\nless than fifty grams of cocaine base.               The judge, however,\n\ndetermined that Goodine was responsible for 309.2 grams of crack,\n\nand sentenced him accordingly.\n\n            We are faced with two closely-related issues on appeal.\n\nFirst, Goodine alleges that the different penalty provisions under\n\n§ 841(b) create separate crimes requiring the government to prove\n\ndrug quantity beyond a reasonable doubt.           Goodine asserts that he\n\ncould only be sentenced pursuant to the jury's determination of\n\ndrug quantity, but was erroneously sentenced pursuant to the\n\njudge's determination.          Second, the judge imposed a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence based on drug quantity proved by preponderance of\n\nthe evidence.    Goodine raises an Apprendi challenge because that\n\nmandatory minimum sentence is higher than the sentencing guideline\n\nrange to which he was exposed before the judge's finding as to drug\n\nquantity.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Goodine was tried with co-defendant Garry Julien, and both\nappeals were heard on the same date. Julien's appeal is addressed\nin United States v. Julien, No. 02-1765, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 1780,\n(1st Cir. Feb. 3, 2003).\n\n                                       -2-\n\f             We find that drug quantity in § 841(b) is a sentencing\n\nfactor, not an element of separate crimes.          We also find that no\n\nApprendi violation occurred here because the sentencing guidelines\n\nare not \"statutory maximums\" for purposes of Apprendi, and Goodine\n\nwas not sentenced to a penalty greater than that authorized by the\n\njury's finding.      Goodine's sentence is therefore affirmed.\n\n                             I.   Introduction\n\n             Goodine does not dispute the jury verdict or the findings\n\nby the judge.        He raises two legal challenges to his sentence.\n\nGoodine preserved these appeals at sentencing; we therefore apply\n\nde novo review. United States v. Henderson, No. 01-2392, 2003 U.S.\n\nApp. LEXIS 2735, at *42 (1st Cir. Feb. 14, 2003); United States v.\n\nEirby, 262 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n               II.    Drug Quantity as Sentencing Factors\n\nA.   Issue\n\n             The second subsection of the statute for drug possession\n\nwith intent to distribute2 delineates different penalty provisions\n\nbased on drug type and other factors.3           See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).\n\nThree such provisions are relevant here.          Defendants responsible\n\n\n2\n   Because the conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C. § 846, adopts the\nsentencing scheme of 21 U.S.C. § 841, we need not address it\nseparately.\n3\n   The statute also considers drug type, whether serious bodily\ninjury resulted from the crime, and whether the defendant has a\nprior felony drug conviction. Our decision is limited to the issue\nof drug quantity, and leaves challenges to the other factors for\nanother day.\n\n                                    -3-\n\ffor an unspecified amount of crack are exposed to a maximum\n\nsentence of twenty years under § 841(b)(1)(C), or thirty years if\n\nthe defendant has a prior drug offense conviction.                      Defendants\n\nresponsible for five or more grams of crack are exposed to five to\n\nforty years in prison, or ten years to life for defendants with a\n\nprior    felony   drug   offense    conviction       under    §    841(b)(1)(B).\n\nFinally, defendants responsible for at least fifty grams of crack\n\nare sentenced under § 841(b)(1)(A), which carries a possible\n\npenalty   of   ten   years   to   life,      or   twenty   years   to    life   for\n\ndefendants who have a prior conviction for a felony drug offense.\n\n            The jury convicted Goodine of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute at least five grams (but less than fifty grams) of\n\ncrack.    Strictly following the jury's conviction, Goodine (who has\n\na prior conviction for a felony drug offense) would be subject to\n\na   ten-year   mandatory     minimum    sentence      under   §    841(b)(1)(B).\n\nHowever, the judge determined that Goodine was responsible for\n\n309.2 grams of crack and sentenced him to the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence under § 841(b)(1)(A) -- twenty years.\n\n            Goodine asserts that § 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (C) are\n\ndifferent crimes with drug quantity as the differing element, and\n\nthat because the government only proved beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat he was responsible for five grams, he could only be sentenced\n\nto a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence under § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fGoodine challenges the legal decision of the district court to\n\nsentence him under § 841(b)(1)(A) instead of § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n            The government must prove every element of a crime beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.      See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970).\n\nHowever,    mere   sentencing    factors   do   not   require   such   proof.\n\nPatterson v. N.Y., 432 U.S. 197, 207 (1977) (holding that the State\n\nneed not \"prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact, the existence\n\nor nonexistence of which it is willing to recognize as . . .\n\naffecting . . . the severity of the punishment\").                 While the\n\nlegislature is generally free to identify elements and sentencing\n\nfactors, there are constitutional limits to this power.            McMillan\n\nv. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 86 (1986). We must determine whether\n\ndrug quantity is an element of offenses under § 841 that must be\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt, or merely a sentencing factor\n\nthat may be determined by the judge by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\n\nB.   Relevant Cases\n\n            The    distinction   between    \"elements\"    and   \"sentencing\n\nfactors\" can be elusive, see Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 494, and we\n\nadmit that we have been wrong on similar questions before.                See\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Gómez, 67 F.3d 993, 996 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(holding that the federal carjacking statute identified only one\n\ncrime; later rejected by the Supreme Court in Jones v. United\n\nStates, 526 U.S. 227, 229 (1999)). This question is complicated by\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe Supreme Court's recent sentencing decisions.    Before Apprendi,\n\nwe held that drug-quantity delineations contained in § 841(b)(1)\n\nwere sentencing factors that could be determined by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence.   See United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160-\n\n61 (1st Cir. 1996).      However, we have noted that the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Apprendi \"requires some rethinking of this\n\napproach.\"    United States v. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n            There is a split among our sister circuits who have\n\nconsidered this issue post-Apprendi.      Compare United States v.\n\nWade, No. 01-5210, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 2374, at *18 (6th Cir.\n\nFeb. 11, 2003) (holding that drug quantity under § 841 need not be\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt) and United States v. Smith, 308\n\nF.3d 726, 740 (7th Cir. 2002) (same), with United States v.\n\nDoggett, 230 F.3d 160, 164-65 (5th Cir. 2000) (\"If the government\n\nseeks enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) or (B), the\n\n[drug] quantity must be stated in the indictment and submitted to\n\na jury for a finding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"),\n\nfollowed in United States v. Turner, No. 01-11589, 2003 U.S. App.\n\nLEXIS 1270, at *10-11 (5th Cir. Jan. 27, 2003) and United States v.\n\nBuckland, 289 F.3d 558, 568 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc).\n\n            This case presents us with a post-Apprendi opportunity to\n\ndetermine congressional intent regarding the drug quantity language\n\nof § 841.    Cf. United States v. Terry, 240 F.3d 65, 74 n.9 (1st\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fCir. 2001) (not reaching the issue).           We are assisted in this task\n\nby the Supreme Court's determination of congressional intent behind\n\nsimilar statutes.         Five cases shape our analysis.\n\n            First, in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79 (1986),\n\nthe Supreme Court found that a five year mandatory minimum sentence\n\nfor visible possession of a firearm during certain enumerated\n\nfelonies was a sentencing factor that could be determined at\n\nsentencing.    Id. at 84.      The felonies had maximum sentences of ten\n\nor twenty years, and the Court found that the \"statute [gave] no\n\nimpression of having been tailored to permit the visible possession\n\nfinding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive\n\noffense.\"     Id. at 88.      The Court found that the instrumentality\n\nused in commission of a crime was a factor \"that has always been\n\nconsidered    by    sentencing    courts      to   bear    on   punishment\"   and\n\ntherefore was not an element of the crime.                Id. at 89.    Although\n\nthis was the first time the Supreme Court identified \"sentencing\n\nfactors\" as distinct from \"elements\" of a crime, McMillan has\n\nsubsequently       been    reaffirmed    in   light   of    recent     sentencing\n\ndecisions.    Harris v. United States, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 2420 (2002).\n\n            In the second case, Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n\n523 U.S. 224 (1998), the Court considered 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2),\n\nwhich   predicated an increase in penalty on a prior conviction of\n\naggravated felony.          The Court held that prior conviction is a\n\nsentencing factor rather than an element establishing a separate\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\foffense.    Id. at 226-27.       In reaching this conclusion, the Court\n\nengaged    in    a    detailed   analysis     of   the   statute's     language,\n\nstructure, legislative history, caption and placement, id. at 230-\n\n35, as well as functional factors such as potential unfairness, the\n\nmagnitude   of       the   increase,   and   whether     prior   conviction   is\n\ntraditionally treated as a sentencing factor or an element of the\n\noffense, id. at 234-36.\n\n            In the third case, Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227\n\n(1999), the Court construed the federal carjacking statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119 (1994 ed. & Supp. V).            At the time, the statute set\n\nthree different maximum sentences: fifteen years for a carjacking,\n\ntwenty-five years if serious bodily injury resulted, and life\n\nimprisonment if death resulted.              Id. at 230.     The question was\n\nwhether the statute \"defined three distinct offenses or a single\n\ncrime with a choice of three maximum penalties, two of them\n\ndependent on sentencing factors exempt from the requirements of\n\ncharge and jury verdict.\"         Id. at 229.\n\n            The Supreme Court began with the language and structure\n\nof the statute, noting that the statute appeared to identify one\n\noffense with several penalty provisions.               Id. at 232.     The Court\n\ncalled this first glance an unreliable guide to congressional\n\nintentions because the statute identified steeply higher penalties\n\nconditioned on further facts \"that seem quite as important as the\n\nelements in the principal paragraph.\"              Id. at 233.       The penalty\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\frange increased by at least two-thirds (from fifteen years to\n\ntwenty-five years), and to as much as life imprisonment, based on\n\na finding that substantial bodily injury or death resulted.              Id.\n\n          The Court found the legislative history \"unimpressive\"\n\nbecause it supported either intent -- of serious bodily injury\n\nmeant as a sentencing factor or as an element of the crime.            Id. at\n\n237-39.\n\n          The Jones Court reasoned that carjacking is a type of\n\nrobbery, and \"serious bodily injury has traditionally been treated,\n\nboth by Congress and by the state legislatures, as defining an\n\nelement of the offense of aggravated robbery.\"                 Id. at 235.\n\nFinding serious bodily injury to be an element corresponded to\n\nmaintaining   the   jury's   role   as    more    than   a   mere   low-level\n\ngatekeeper: if serious bodily injury was merely a sentencing\n\nfactor, \"in some cases, a jury finding of fact necessary for a\n\nmaximum 15-year sentence would merely open the door to a judicial\n\nfinding sufficient for life imprisonment.\"           Id. at 244.\n\n          Finally, the Jones Court noted that if a statute is\n\nequally susceptible of two interpretations, one of which raises\n\n\"grave and doubtful constitutional questions\" that the other does\n\nnot, a court should interpret the statute so as to avoid the\n\nconstitutional question.     Id. at 239.         By holding serious bodily\n\ninjury to be an element of a crime requiring proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, the Court avoided a constitutional question. Id.\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          In the fourth case to resolve a similar issue, Castillo\n\nv. United States, 530 U.S. 120 (2000), the Supreme Court considered\n\na statute prohibiting the use or carrying of a firearm in relation\n\nto a crime of violence.         The Court found that the provision\n\nincreasing the penalty from a minimum of five years to a minimum of\n\nthirty years when the weapon was a machinegun required that the\n\ntype of weapon used be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.                 Id. at\n\n131. The Court noted that the first sentence of the statute, which\n\nincluded the type of firearm used, identified the elements of the\n\ncrime, while the second sentence described \"factors (such as\n\nrecidivism) that ordinarily pertain only to sentencing.\"                 Id. at\n\n125.   The    Court   further   found    that   firearm     type    is   not   a\n\ntraditional   sentencing   factor.        Id.   at   126.      \"Traditional\n\nsentencing factors often involve either characteristics of the\n\noffender, such as recidivism, or special features of the manner in\n\nwhich a basic crime was carried out (e.g., that the defendant\n\nabused a position of trust or brandished a gun).\"            Id.    The Court\n\nthen found that asking a jury to resolve what type of weapon was\n\nused would not complicate a trial or risk unfairness.              Id. at 127.\n\nThe Court noted that the legislative history could have supported\n\neither view, but that the length and severity of the provision\n\nsuggest that the language relating to different firearm types\n\nreferred to elements of separate crimes.         Id. at 130-31.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f          The final case offering guidance is Harris v. United\n\nStates, 122 S. Ct. 2406 (2002).      There, the Supreme Court held that\n\nthe statute for commission of a drug trafficking offense while\n\nusing or carrying a firearm defines a single crime, and that\n\nwhether the firearm was \"brandished\" or \"discharged\" is merely a\n\nsentencing factor to be determined by the judge.          Id. at 2414.   The\n\nCourt found that the statute's structure suggested definition of\n\none crime only, as the first paragraph listed the elements of a\n\ncomplete crime and the second paragraph described how defendants\n\nwere to be punished.      See id. at 2411-12 (interpreting 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)).       The Court then considered \"tradition and past\n\ncongressional practice\" and found that brandishing and discharging\n\na firearm had not been treated as elements in other statutes,\n\nrather, they    were    classic   sentencing   factors.      Id. at     2412.\n\nFurther, nothing in the \"text or history of the statute\" rebutted\n\nthe presumption drawn from the statute's structure -- that the\n\nstatute identifies only one offense.       Id. at 2413.\n\n          The    Harris    Court    distinguished    Jones,     where    the\n\ncarjacking statute authorized \"steeply higher penalties\" based on\n\nwhether injury or death resulted from the crime.              Id. at 2412\n\n(quoting Jones, 526 U.S. at 233).         In the statute at issue in\n\nHarris, the consequence of a judicial determination that a firearm\n\nhad been brandished or discharged was simply an increase in the\n\nmandatory minimum sentence.       Id. at 2412-13.   The Court found that\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe \"incremental changes in the minimum -- from 5 years, to 7, to\n\n10 -- are precisely what one would expect to see in provisions\n\nmeant     to     identify   matters    for     the   sentencing    judge's\n\nconsideration.\"       Id. at 2413.\n\nC.    Application\n\n               Applying these cases to the drug statute at issue here,\n\nwe begin with the language and structure of the statute.           Section\n\n841(a) lays out an offense that stands on its own, stating that \"it\n\nshall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally . . .\n\nto . . . possess with intent to              distribute or dispense[] a\n\ncounterfeit substance.\"        See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a).4           The next\n\n\n4\n     The relevant provisions of the statute read:\n\n       (a) Unlawful acts. Except as authorized by this title,\n       it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or\n       intentionally --\n         (1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess\n       with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a\n       controlled substance; or\n         (2) to create, distribute or dispense, or possess with\n       intent to distribute or dispense, a counterfeit\n       substance.\n       (b) Penalties.      . . . [A]ny person who violates\n       subsection (a) of this section shall be sentenced as\n       follows:\n       (1)(A) In the case of a violation of subsection (a) of\n       this section involving . . . (iii) 50 grams or more of a\n       mixture or substance described in clause (ii) which\n       contains cocaine base . . . such person shall be\n       sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less\n       than 10 years or more than life . . . .\n          (B) In the case of a violation of subsection (a) of\n       this section involving . . .

See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).     A\n\nstraightforward reading suggests that part (a) identifies a crime\n\nand part (b) outlines different penalties for that crime.               We have\n\nnever directly answered this question, but we have previously\n\nstated that a switch from 841(b)(1)(B) to 841(b)(1)(A) does not\n\naffect the \"substance\" of the charge, Eirby, 262 F.3d at 38, and\n\nhave    referred     to     subsection     (b)    as   designating   \"different\n\nsentencing regimes based on drug quantity\" (and other factors).\n\nUnited States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 118 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            At the time § 841 was passed, Congress referred to the\n\n\"sentencing procedures\" as giving \"maximum flexibility to judges,\"\n\nsuggesting    that        Congress   viewed      the   penalty   provisions   as\n\nsentencing factors.         H.R. Conf. Rep. 91-1444 (1970), reprinted in\n\n1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4566, 4576.              The legislative history on this\n\npoint is scarce, and others have found it unhelpful.                 See United\n\nStates v. McAllister, 272 F.3d 228, 231 (4th Cir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n       than 5 years and not more than 40 years . . . .\n         (C) In the case of a controlled substance in schedule\n       I or II, . . . such person shall be sentenced to a term\n       of imprisonment of not more than 20 years . . . .\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a)-(b).\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f            In   addition   to   the   statutory     text    and   legislative\n\nhistory, we find here other considerations which have heavily\n\ninfluenced the Supreme Court in finding that certain facts are\n\nsentencing factors rather than elements establishing an offense.\n\nFirst, drug quantity is a classic sentencing factor.                    See 18\n\nU.S.C.S. Appx. § 2D1.1(c) (2003) (determining Sentencing Guideline\n\nbase offense level based on drug type and quantity).                  Like many\n\nsentencing factors, it goes to the \"nature and circumstances of the\n\noffense.\"    See Castillo, 530 U.S. at 126 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3553\n\n(a)(1)).    Permitting the judge to make a determination as to drug\n\nquantity is not permitting the tail of sentencing to wag the dog of\n\nthe substantive offense.         See McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88.              The\n\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of\n\n§ 841(a); in this case the jury found that Goodine knowingly or\n\nintentionally possessed with intent to distribute a counterfeit\n\nsubstance (cocaine base).        This determination exposed Goodine to\n\nsentencing    under   §   841(b),   ranging   from    five    years    to   life\n\nimprisonment.      The judicial finding relating to drug quantity\n\nsimply guides the judge for sentencing purposes within this range.\n\nThis is a typical sentencing scheme.\n\n            Second, due to Apprendi limitations discussed in Part III\n\nbelow, a jury's determination will cap the maximum sentence a judge\n\ncan impose, regardless of drug quantity determination. Our holding\n\nthat drug quantity is not an element of § 841 means that a judge's\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fdetermination of drug quantity can influence the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence imposed, and such incremental changes in the minimum are\n\ntypical sentencing provisions determined by the judge. Harris, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2413.           The Jones Court's concern that a jury would merely\n\nbe     a    low-level       gatekeeper        is     unfounded         because     the     jury\n\ndetermination in fact sets the maximum punishment.\n\n               Third,      drug       quantity     goes    to     how    the     offense    is\n\nconducted, rather than the result of the crime.                              As such, it is\n\nmore       analogous      to    the    statutes      in    which       the   Supreme     Court\n\nidentified sentencing factors.                 Drug quantity is \"not necessary to\n\nthe determination of whether [defendant's] conduct was 'criminal'\n\nor 'innocent.'\" United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 281 F.3d 320, 326\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).               It therefore is more like a sentencing factor\n\nthan an element.               Finally, we note a practical result of our\n\nruling.       Were all facts contained in § 841(b) to be treated as\n\nelements,      the     statute        would   define      as    many    as   350   different\n\noffenses.          See United States v. Promise, 255 F.3d 150, 175 (4th\n\nCir.       2001)    (en     banc)      (Luttig,      J.,       concurring).         Such     an\n\ninterpretation causes difficulty we think Congress did not intend.\n\nWe therefore find that drug quantity for purposes of § 841 is a\n\nsentencing factor that may be determined by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\n\n     III.     Application of Apprendi to the Sentencing Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n                                              -15-\n\f            With a judicial finding of 309.2 grams of cocaine base,\n\nGoodine was exposed to 168-210 months imprisonment under the\n\nSentencing Guidelines.    However, because § 841(b)(1)(A) carries a\n\nmandatory   minimum   sentence   of   twenty    years   imprisonment   for\n\ndefendants who have a prior conviction for a felony drug offense\n\nand are guilty of possessing with intent to distribute fifty or\n\nmore grams of cocaine base, the judge sentenced Goodine to twenty\n\nyears in prison.    Goodine raises an Apprendi argument because this\n\nmandatory minimum sentence exceeded the high end of his Sentencing\n\nGuideline range.\n\n            The landmark case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.\n\n466, 490 (2000), held that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior\n\nconviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\n\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"             Apprendi's limitation on\n\npunishment beyond the statutory maximum applies regardless of\n\nwhether the fact is considered an \"element\" or a \"sentencing\n\nfactor.\"    Harris, 122 S. Ct. at 2410.    A sentencing court may use\n\nthe preponderance of the evidence standard to find facts that\n\nrequire the imposition of a specified minimum sentence, so long as\n\nthat sentence does not exceed the maximum sentence provided by the\n\nrelevant statute.     Id. at 2419 (plurality opinion); id. at 2421\n\n(Breyer, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f             We have held that Apprendi's holding \"applies only when\n\nthe disputed 'fact' enlarges the applicable statutory maximum and\n\nthe defendant's sentence exceeds the original maximum.\"                United\n\nStates v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nRobinson,    241   F.3d   115,   119    (1st   Cir.   2001)   (\"[T]heoretical\n\nexposure to a higher sentence, unaccompanied by the imposition of\n\na sentence that in fact exceeds the otherwise-applicable statutory\n\nmaximum, is of no consequence.\"). If the disputed fact (here, drug\n\nquantity) influences the sentence, but the resulting sentence is\n\nstill below the default statutory maximum, there is no Apprendi\n\nviolation.    Robinson, 241 F.3d at 119; United States v. Houle, 237\n\nF.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 2001).       This is so even if the judge imposes\n\na mandatory minimum sentence.          Robinson, 241 F.3d at 122.\n\n             Section   841(b)    delineates    several   different    default\n\nstatutory maximums based on drug quantity (and other factors not\n\nrelevant here, such as drug type and whether or not seriously\n\nbodily injury resulted): 20 years if no drug quantity is specified,\n\n40 years for five or more grams of cocaine base, and life for fifty\n\nor more grams of cocaine base.          21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)-(C); See\n\nalso United States v. Martínez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 121 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 311 (2002) (identifying default\n\nstatutory maximum under § 841(b)(1)(A) as life); Robinson, 241 F.3d\n\nat 119 (identifying default statutory maximum as twenty years under\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(C), where no quantity had been determined beyond a\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\freasonable doubt); United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 41 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (same); Smith, 308 F.3d at 741 (finding a default\n\nstatutory maximum of 20 years for more than fifty kilograms of\n\nmarijuana under § 841(b)(1)(C)).\n\n           In this case, the jury found Goodine guilty of conspiracy\n\nand possession with intent to distribute at least five grams of\n\ncocaine base.         The default statutory maximum was therefore 40\n\nyears.    Because he was sentenced to less than that-- 20 years --\n\nthere was no Apprendi violation.\n\n           Goodine argues that the \"prescribed statutory maximum\" in\n\nhis case is the top of the Sentencing Guideline range (210 months)\n\nand that his sentence of 240 months violates the rule in Apprendi\n\nbecause   it     is   based   on   a    drug   quantity   determined   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence only.            We disagree.\n\n           If we adopted Goodine's argument, we would essentially\n\nabolish the guidelines because the jury would be required to make\n\nfindings as to all facts that may be relevant to sentencing ranges\n\nand potential adjustments. Nothing in Apprendi or subsequent cases\n\ncalls into question the validity of the Sentencing Guidelines, and\n\n\"[w]e do not believe that the Court would have set in motion such\n\na sea change in the law of sentencing without explicitly addressing\n\nthe issue.\"    Robinson, 241 F.3d at 121.\n\n           The    guideline     calculations      are   not   restricted    by\n\nApprendi's rule.       See United States v. Knox, 301 F.3d 616, 620 (7th\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fCir. 2002); United States v. Norris, 281 F.3d 357, 361 (2d Cir.\n\n2002).    The guidelines themselves state that where a \"statutorily\n\nrequired minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the\n\napplicable    guideline      range,   the    statutorily   required   minimum\n\nsentence shall be the guideline sentence.\"                 18 U.S.C.S. Appx.\n\n§ 5G1.1 (2002).        Nothing further is needed to impose a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence in excess of the guideline range, as the guideline\n\nrange    yields   to   the    statutory     minimum   sentence.   Here,   the\n\nstatutorily required minimum sentence of twenty years became the\n\nguideline sentence.       Therefore, Goodine's sentence did not offend\n\nApprendi.\n\n                                IV.   Conclusion\n\n            Goodine's sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                             \"Concurrence follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge, concurring.      I concur in the\n\naffirmance of the sentence.   As to Goodine's argument that drug\n\nquantity under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) is an element of a crime and not\n\na sentencing factor, I think the argument is foreclosed by United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 118 (1st Cir. 2001), United\n\nStates v. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31, 35-38 (1st Cir. 2001), and United\n\nStates v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160-61 (1st Cir. 1996).   The claim\n\nthat there is a violation of the rule of Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n\n530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000), is foreclosed by Harris v. United States,\n\n536 U.S. 545 (2002).\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f",

A jury convicted Defendant-\n\nAppellant Brian Goodine1 of conspiracy and possession with intent\n\nto distribute cocaine base (\"crack\"), in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1)   &   846   (2003).     By    special   verdict   form,   the   jury\n\nindicated that the amount for each count was at least five, but\n\nless than fifty grams of cocaine base.               The judge, however,\n\ndetermined that Goodine was responsible for 309.2 grams of crack,\n\nand sentenced him accordingly.\n\n            We are faced with two closely-related issues on appeal.\n\nFirst, Goodine alleges that the different penalty provisions under\n\n§ 841(b) create separate crimes requiring the government to prove\n\ndrug quantity beyond a reasonable doubt.           Goodine asserts that he\n\ncould only be sentenced pursuant to the jury's determination of\n\ndrug quantity, but was erroneously sentenced pursuant to the\n\njudge's determination.          Second, the judge imposed a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence based on drug quantity proved by preponderance of\n\nthe evidence.    Goodine raises an Apprendi challenge because that\n\nmandatory minimum sentence is higher than the sentencing guideline\n\nrange to which he was exposed before the judge's finding as to drug\n\nquantity.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Goodine was tried with co-defendant Garry Julien, and both\nappeals were heard on the same date.

We also find that no\n\nApprendi violation occurred here because the sentencing guidelines\n\nare not \"statutory maximums\" for purposes of Apprendi, and Goodine\n\nwas not sentenced to a penalty greater than that authorized by the\n\njury's finding.

Drug Quantity as Sentencing Factors\n\nA.   Issue\n\n             The second subsection of the statute for drug possession\n\nwith intent to distribute2 delineates different penalty provisions\n\nbased on drug type and other factors.3           See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).\n\nThree such provisions are relevant here.          Defendants responsible\n\n\n2\n   Because the conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C. § 846, adopts the\nsentencing scheme of 21 U.S.C. § 841, we need not address it\nseparately.\n3\n   The statute also considers drug type, whether serious bodily\ninjury resulted from the crime, and whether the defendant has a\nprior felony drug conviction. Our decision is limited to the issue\nof drug quantity, and leaves challenges to the other factors for\nanother day.\n\n                                    -3-\n\ffor an unspecified amount of crack are exposed to a maximum\n\nsentence of twenty years under § 841(b)(1)(C), or thirty years if\n\nthe defendant has a prior drug offense conviction.                      Defendants\n\nresponsible for five or more grams of crack are exposed to five to\n\nforty years in prison, or ten years to life for defendants with a\n\nprior    felony   drug   offense    conviction       under    §    841(b)(1)(B).\n\nFinally, defendants responsible for at least fifty grams of crack\n\nare sentenced under § 841(b)(1)(A), which carries a possible\n\npenalty   of   ten   years   to   life,      or   twenty   years   to    life   for\n\ndefendants who have a prior conviction for a felony drug offense.\n\n            The jury convicted Goodine of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute at least five grams (but less than fifty grams) of\n\ncrack.    Strictly following the jury's conviction, Goodine (who has\n\na prior conviction for a felony drug offense) would be subject to\n\na   ten-year   mandatory     minimum    sentence      under   §    841(b)(1)(B).\n\nHowever, the judge determined that Goodine was responsible for\n\n309.2 grams of crack and sentenced him to the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence under § 841(b)(1)(A) -- twenty years.\n\n            Goodine asserts that § 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (C) are\n\ndifferent crimes with drug quantity as the differing element, and\n\nthat because the government only proved beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat he was responsible for five grams, he could only be sentenced\n\nto a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence under § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fGoodine challenges the legal decision of the district court to\n\nsentence him under § 841(b)(1)(A) instead of § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n            The government must prove every element of a crime beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.

Id. at 84.      The felonies had maximum sentences of ten\n\nor twenty years, and the Court found that the \"statute [gave] no\n\nimpression of having been tailored to permit the visible possession\n\nfinding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive\n\noffense.\"     Id. at 88.

Id. at 89.    Although\n\nthis was the first time the Supreme Court identified \"sentencing\n\nfactors\" as distinct from \"elements\" of a crime, McMillan has\n\nsubsequently       been    reaffirmed    in   light   of    recent     sentencing\n\ndecisions.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court\n\nengaged    in    a    detailed   analysis     of   the   statute's     language,\n\nstructure, legislative history, caption and placement, id. at 230-\n\n35, as well as functional factors such as potential unfairness, the\n\nmagnitude   of       the   increase,   and   whether     prior   conviction   is\n\ntraditionally treated as a sentencing factor or an element of the\n\noffense, id. at 234-36.\n\n            In the third case, Jones v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1999), the Court construed the federal carjacking statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119 (1994 ed. & Supp. V).            At the time, the statute set\n\nthree different maximum sentences: fifteen years for a carjacking,\n\ntwenty-five years if serious bodily injury resulted, and life\n\nimprisonment if death resulted.              Id. at 230.     The question was\n\nwhether the statute \"defined three distinct offenses or a single\n\ncrime with a choice of three maximum penalties, two of them\n\ndependent on sentencing factors exempt from the requirements of\n\ncharge and jury verdict.\"         Id. at 229.\n\n            The Supreme Court began with the language and structure\n\nof the statute, noting that the statute appeared to identify one\n\noffense with several penalty provisions.               Id. at 232.     The Court\n\ncalled this first glance an unreliable guide to congressional\n\nintentions because the statute identified steeply higher penalties\n\nconditioned on further facts \"that seem quite as important as the\n\nelements in the principal paragraph.\"              Id. at 233.       The penalty\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\frange increased by at least two-thirds (from fifteen years to\n\ntwenty-five years), and to as much as life imprisonment, based on\n\na finding that substantial bodily injury or death resulted.              Id.\n\n          The Court found the legislative history \"unimpressive\"\n\nbecause it supported either intent -- of serious bodily injury\n\nmeant as a sentencing factor or as an element of the crime.            Id. at\n\n237-39.\n\n          The Jones Court reasoned that carjacking is a type of\n\nrobbery, and \"serious bodily injury has traditionally been treated,\n\nboth by Congress and by the state legislatures, as defining an\n\nelement of the offense of aggravated robbery.\"                 Id. at 235.\n\nFinding serious bodily injury to be an element corresponded to\n\nmaintaining   the   jury's   role   as    more    than   a   mere   low-level\n\ngatekeeper: if serious bodily injury was merely a sentencing\n\nfactor, \"in some cases, a jury finding of fact necessary for a\n\nmaximum 15-year sentence would merely open the door to a judicial\n\nfinding sufficient for life imprisonment.\"           Id. at 244.\n\n          Finally, the Jones Court noted that if a statute is\n\nequally susceptible of two interpretations, one of which raises\n\n\"grave and doubtful constitutional questions\" that the other does\n\nnot, a court should interpret the statute so as to avoid the\n\nconstitutional question.     Id. at 239.         By holding serious bodily\n\ninjury to be an element of a crime requiring proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, the Court avoided a constitutional question.

The Court found that the provision\n\nincreasing the penalty from a minimum of five years to a minimum of\n\nthirty years when the weapon was a machinegun required that the\n\ntype of weapon used be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.                 Id. at\n\n131. The Court noted that the first sentence of the statute, which\n\nincluded the type of firearm used, identified the elements of the\n\ncrime, while the second sentence described \"factors (such as\n\nrecidivism) that ordinarily pertain only to sentencing.\"                 Id. at\n\n125.   The    Court   further   found    that   firearm     type    is   not   a\n\ntraditional   sentencing   factor.        Id.   at   126.      \"Traditional\n\nsentencing factors often involve either characteristics of the\n\noffender, such as recidivism, or special features of the manner in\n\nwhich a basic crime was carried out (e.g., that the defendant\n\nabused a position of trust or brandished a gun).\"            Id.    The Court\n\nthen found that asking a jury to resolve what type of weapon was\n\nused would not complicate a trial or risk unfairness.              Id. at 127.\n\nThe Court noted that the legislative history could have supported\n\neither view, but that the length and severity of the provision\n\nsuggest that the language relating to different firearm types\n\nreferred to elements of separate crimes.

There, the Supreme Court held that\n\nthe statute for commission of a drug trafficking offense while\n\nusing or carrying a firearm defines a single crime, and that\n\nwhether the firearm was \"brandished\" or \"discharged\" is merely a\n\nsentencing factor to be determined by the judge.          Id. at 2414.   The\n\nCourt found that the statute's structure suggested definition of\n\none crime only, as the first paragraph listed the elements of a\n\ncomplete crime and the second paragraph described how defendants\n\nwere to be punished.      See id. at 2411-12 (interpreting 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)).       The Court then considered \"tradition and past\n\ncongressional practice\" and found that brandishing and discharging\n\na firearm had not been treated as elements in other statutes,\n\nrather, they    were    classic   sentencing   factors.      Id. at     2412.\n\nFurther, nothing in the \"text or history of the statute\" rebutted\n\nthe presumption drawn from the statute's structure -- that the\n\nstatute identifies only one offense.       Id. at 2413.\n\n          The    Harris    Court    distinguished    Jones,     where    the\n\ncarjacking statute authorized \"steeply higher penalties\" based on\n\nwhether injury or death resulted from the crime.              Id. at 2412\n\n(quoting Jones, 526 U.S. at 233).         In the statute at issue in\n\nHarris, the consequence of a judicial determination that a firearm\n\nhad been brandished or discharged was simply an increase in the\n\nmandatory minimum sentence.       Id. at 2412-13.   The Court found that\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe \"incremental changes in the minimum -- from 5 years, to 7, to\n\n10 -- are precisely what one would expect to see in provisions\n\nmeant     to     identify   matters    for     the   sentencing    judge's\n\nconsideration.\"       Id. at 2413.\n\nC.    Application\n\n               Applying these cases to the drug statute at issue here,\n\nwe begin with the language and structure of the statute.           Section\n\n841(a) lays out an offense that stands on its own, stating that \"it\n\nshall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally . . .\n\nto . . . possess with intent to              distribute or dispense[] a\n\ncounterfeit substance.\"        See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a).4           The next\n\n\n4\n     The relevant provisions of the statute read:\n\n       (a) Unlawful acts. Except as authorized by this title,\n       it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or\n       intentionally --\n         (1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess\n       with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a\n       controlled substance; or\n         (2) to create, distribute or dispense, or possess with\n       intent to distribute or dispense, a counterfeit\n       substance.\n       (b) Penalties.      . . .

See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).     A\n\nstraightforward reading suggests that part (a) identifies a crime\n\nand part (b) outlines different penalties for that crime.               We have\n\nnever directly answered this question, but we have previously\n\nstated that a switch from 841(b)(1)(B) to 841(b)(1)(A) does not\n\naffect the \"substance\" of the charge, Eirby, 262 F.3d at 38, and\n\nhave    referred     to     subsection     (b)    as   designating   \"different\n\nsentencing regimes based on drug quantity\" (and other factors).\n\nUnited States v.

See 18\n\nU.S.C.S. Appx. § 2D1.1(c) (2003) (determining Sentencing Guideline\n\nbase offense level based on drug type and quantity).                  Like many\n\nsentencing factors, it goes to the \"nature and circumstances of the\n\noffense.\"    See Castillo, 530 U.S. at 126 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3553\n\n(a)(1)).    Permitting the judge to make a determination as to drug\n\nquantity is not permitting the tail of sentencing to wag the dog of\n\nthe substantive offense.         See McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88.              The\n\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of\n\n§ 841(a); in this case the jury found that Goodine knowingly or\n\nintentionally possessed with intent to distribute a counterfeit\n\nsubstance (cocaine base).        This determination exposed Goodine to\n\nsentencing    under   §   841(b),   ranging   from    five    years    to   life\n\nimprisonment.      The judicial finding relating to drug quantity\n\nsimply guides the judge for sentencing purposes within this range.\n\nThis is a typical sentencing scheme.\n\n            Second, due to Apprendi limitations discussed in Part III\n\nbelow, a jury's determination will cap the maximum sentence a judge\n\ncan impose, regardless of drug quantity determination. Our holding\n\nthat drug quantity is not an element of § 841 means that a judge's\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fdetermination of drug quantity can influence the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence imposed, and such incremental changes in the minimum are\n\ntypical sentencing provisions determined by the judge. Harris, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 2413.           The Jones Court's concern that a jury would merely\n\nbe     a    low-level       gatekeeper        is     unfounded         because     the     jury\n\ndetermination in fact sets the maximum punishment.\n\n               Third,      drug       quantity     goes    to     how    the     offense    is\n\nconducted, rather than the result of the crime.                              As such, it is\n\nmore       analogous      to    the    statutes      in    which       the   Supreme     Court\n\nidentified sentencing factors.                 Drug quantity is \"not necessary to\n\nthe determination of whether [defendant's] conduct was 'criminal'\n\nor 'innocent.'\" United States v. Collazo-Aponte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776643\"><a href=\"/opinion/776643/united-states-v-rafael-collazo-aponte/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).               It therefore is more like a sentencing factor\n\nthan an element.               Finally, we note a practical result of our\n\nruling.       Were all facts contained in § 841(b) to be treated as\n\nelements,      the     statute        would   define      as    many    as   350   different\n\noffenses.          See United States v. Promise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773798\"><a href=\"/opinion/773798/united-states-v-marion-promise-aka-mariodefendant-appellant/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (4th\n\nCir.       2001)    (en     banc)      (Luttig,      J.,       concurring).         Such     an\n\ninterpretation causes difficulty we think Congress did not intend.\n\nWe therefore find that drug quantity for purposes of § 841 is a\n\nsentencing factor that may be determined by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\n\n     III.     Application of Apprendi to the Sentencing Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n                                              -15-\n\f            With a judicial finding of 309.2 grams of cocaine base,\n\nGoodine was exposed to 168-210 months imprisonment under the\n\nSentencing Guidelines.    However, because § 841(b)(1)(A) carries a\n\nmandatory   minimum   sentence   of   twenty    years   imprisonment   for\n\ndefendants who have a prior conviction for a felony drug offense\n\nand are guilty of possessing with intent to distribute fifty or\n\nmore grams of cocaine base, the judge sentenced Goodine to twenty\n\nyears in prison.    Goodine raises an Apprendi argument because this\n\nmandatory minimum sentence exceeded the high end of his Sentencing\n\nGuideline range.\n\n            The landmark case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (2000), held that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior\n\nconviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\n\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"             Apprendi's limitation on\n\npunishment beyond the statutory maximum applies regardless of\n\nwhether the fact is considered an \"element\" or a \"sentencing\n\nfactor.\"    Harris, 122 S.

The default statutory maximum was therefore 40\n\nyears.    Because he was sentenced to less than that-- 20 years --\n\nthere was no Apprendi violation.\n\n           Goodine argues that the \"prescribed statutory maximum\" in\n\nhis case is the top of the Sentencing Guideline range (210 months)\n\nand that his sentence of 240 months violates the rule in Apprendi\n\nbecause   it     is   based   on   a    drug   quantity   determined   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence only.            We disagree.\n\n           If we adopted Goodine's argument, we would essentially\n\nabolish the guidelines because the jury would be required to make\n\nfindings as to all facts that may be relevant to sentencing ranges\n\nand potential adjustments. Nothing in Apprendi or subsequent cases\n\ncalls into question the validity of the Sentencing Guidelines, and\n\n\"[w]e do not believe that the Court would have set in motion such\n\na sea change in the law of sentencing without explicitly addressing\n\nthe issue.\"    Robinson, 241 F.3d at 121.\n\n           The    guideline     calculations      are   not   restricted    by\n\nApprendi's rule.       See United States v. Knox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778904\"><a href=\"/opinion/778904/united-states-v-carlos-d-knox/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (7th\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fCir. 2002); United States v.

The guidelines themselves state that where a \"statutorily\n\nrequired minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the\n\napplicable    guideline      range,   the    statutorily   required   minimum\n\nsentence shall be the guideline sentence.\"                 18 U.S.C.S. Appx.\n\n§ 5G1.1 (2002).        Nothing further is needed to impose a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence in excess of the guideline range, as the guideline\n\nrange    yields   to   the    statutory     minimum   sentence.   Here,   the\n\nstatutorily required minimum sentence of twenty years became the\n\nguideline sentence.       Therefore, Goodine's sentence did not offend\n\nApprendi.\n\n                                IV.
