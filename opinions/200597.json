On behalf of its affiliate\n\nCellco    Partnership    (\"Cellco\"),      appellant    GTE    Wireless   sought\n\nenforcement of a 1996 covenant not to sue that GTE Mobilnet\n\nServices Corporation and GTE Corporation (collectively \"GTE\")1 made\n\nwith appellee Cellexis International, Inc. (\"Cellexis\").2                    On\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted\n\nsummary    judgment     for   Cellexis,     finding    that    the    Settlement\n\nAgreement did not reach entities that became GTE affiliates after\n\nthe   execution    of     the    1996     Agreement.          After    extensive\n\nconsideration, we reverse.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n            A.   Generation of Settlement Agreement\n\n            The history of the parties' litigation is complicated by\n\nseveral    corporate    transmutations.        In     April   1996,    appellees\n\nCellexis and Freedom Wireless, Inc., sued GTE in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Arizona, claiming that GTE stole\n\nits trade secrets by using Cellexis's technology for prepaid\n\ncellular telephone service (the \"1996 litigation\").\n\n            Five weeks after filing suit, Cellexis settled with GTE\n\n(the \"Settlement Agreement\"). As part of the Settlement Agreement,\n\n\n\n1\n    GTE Wireless, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GTE\nCorporation; GTE Corporation, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof Verizon Communications, Inc.\n2\n  Cellexis International, Inc. is now known as Wireless Pathways,\nInc.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fCellexis agreed to pay part of GTE's attorneys' fees and to\n\npublicly retract prior statements accusing GTE of uncompetitive\n\nbehavior, theft, fraud, and malice.       In return, GTE agreed to drop\n\nits claims against Cellexis for malicious prosecution, trade libel,\n\nand   interference   with   contractual   relations.    The   Settlement\n\nAgreement contained a covenant by Cellexis and its principals not\n\nto sue GTE and its affiliates, partnerships, joint ventures, and\n\nsuccessors in the future over GTEâ€™s use of the same technology.\n\nWhen the     Settlement Agreement was signed, Cellexis had a patent\n\napplication pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n\n(\"Patent Office\") for the technology at issue in the suit.\n\n             In September 1997, Cellexis sold its rights under the\n\npatent application to Freedom Wireless, Inc., (\"Freedom\") for\n\n$750,000.    In February 1998, the Patent Office issued the first of\n\ntwo patents (\"'067 patent\") arising from the patent application,\n\nwhich Cellexis assigned to Freedom under the terms of the 1997 sale\n\nof rights.    Four months later, in June 1998, Freedom sent a letter\n\nto GTE claiming that GTE was infringing the '067 patent.             GTE\n\nresponded that the Settlement Agreement barred any suit against GTE\n\nor its affiliates because the patent covered the technology at\n\nissue in the 1996 litigation.\n\n             On July 27, 1998, GTE Corporation and Bell Atlantic\n\nCorporation (\"Bell Atlantic\") entered into a merger agreement.        On\n\nSeptember 21, 1999, Bell Atlantic and Vodafone Airtouch PLC agreed\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fto consolidate their operations.         As part of the agreement, GTE\n\nWireless's operations were assigned to Cellco (a Bell Atlantic\n\nsubsidiary) at the closing of the GTE/Bell Atlantic merger.             GTE\n\nMobilnet was dissolved on June 21, 2000, and all its assets were\n\ndistributed to its sole shareholder, GTE Wireless.          The GTE/Bell\n\nAtlantic merger was completed July 10, 2000, and GTE Corporation\n\nbecame a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic (now Verizon\n\nCommunications, Inc. (\"Verizon\")). GTE subsidiaries and affiliates\n\ntogether own 55% of Cellco. Verizon also has the contractual right\n\nto appoint a majority of Cellco's Board of Representatives.\n\n          B.    District Court Proceedings\n\n          On March 29, 2000, Freedom filed suit in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California\n\naccusing several companies, including Bell Atlantic and AirTouch,\n\nof infringing Freedom's patent.        The patent action was transferred\n\nto Massachusetts federal court.          In December 2000, the Patent\n\nOffice issued the second patent (\"'823 patent\") arising from the\n\npatent application assigned to Freedom.        Freedom filed an amended\n\ncomplaint in the patent action adding infringement of the '823\n\npatent and naming Cellco as a defendant.\n\n          As Cellco answered Freedom's complaint, GTE Mobilnet\n\nfiled suit against Cellexis, Freedom, and one of Freedom's officers\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Arizona,\n\ncontending     that   AirTouch   and   Bell   Atlantic   fell   under   the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdefinition of GTE Partnerships in paragraph 1.4 of the Settlement\n\nAgreement;        thus,   Freedom     could        not    bring    a   claim       of    patent\n\ninfringement       against    them.          Six     days      after   bringing         suit   in\n\nArizona,    GTE     Mobilnet    dissolved.               GTE    Mobilnet     attempted         to\n\nsubstitute Cellco as plaintiff, stating that Cellco was a successor\n\nto GTE Mobilnet and seeking to preliminarily enjoin Freedom from\n\npursuing its patent case against Cellco.                       The Arizona court denied\n\nthe motion to substitute and transferred the case to Massachusetts\n\nbecause of its relatedness to the pending patent action.\n\n             After    transfer      to       Massachusetts,        the      district      court\n\nallowed     GTE    Mobilnet's    motion        to     substitute       GTE    Wireless         as\n\nplaintiff.        In its supplemental complaint, GTE Wireless claimed\n\nthat defendants were in breach of the Settlement Agreement by\n\ncontinuing to pursue Freedom's patent suit against Cellco.                                     GTE\n\nWireless argued that the interest that GTE Wireless took in Cellco\n\nin   July   2000     made    Cellco      a    GTE    Partnership       and    an    intended\n\nbeneficiary of the Settlement Agreement and that Cellco fell within\n\nthe definition of GTE as an affiliate.                          Cellexis argued, inter\n\nalia, that the definition of GTE in the Settlement Agreement only\n\nincluded     affiliates      that     were      in    existence        at    the    time       the\n\nagreement was executed.\n\n             The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nApplying Arizona law as the parties contracted, the Massachusetts\n\ncourt denied GTE's proffer of extrinsic evidence and granted\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fCellexis's    motion     for    summary    judgment,   concluding   that   the\n\nSettlement Agreement does not reach entities that became GTE\n\naffiliates after May 15, 1996.            GTE Wireless appeals.\n\n                          II.    Standard of Review\n\n             We review summary judgment decisions de novo, viewing the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.              Ruiz-\n\nSulsona v. Univ. of P. R., __ F.3d __ (1st Cir. 2003).               Summary\n\njudgment is inappropriate if there is a genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact.     Id.\n\n          It is undisputed that Arizona law controls.             In Arizona,\n\ncontract interpretation involves matters of law, and we are not\n\nbound by the trial court's interpretation of the language.                 See\n\nAndrews v. Blake, 69 P.3d 7, 11 (Ariz. 2003).           \"A district court's\n\napplication of the parol evidence rule, an issue of state law, is\n\nreviewed under the same de novo standard applied to decisions\n\nconcerning federal law.\"         Jinro Am., Inc. v. JR Int'l Corp., 266\n\nF.3d 993, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2001) (applying Arizona law to a\n\ncontract dispute).       Where a contract is reasonably susceptible to\n\nmore than one meaning and evidence exists to support the reading\n\nadvocated by the nonmovant, an issue of fact is presented that\n\ncannot be resolved on summary judgment.           See Taylor v. State Farm\n\nMut. Auto Ins. Co., 854 P.2d 1134, 1144-45 (Ariz. 1993) (en banc).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f                             III.   Discussion\n\n          GTE wishes to enforce Paragraph 7.1 of the Covenant Not\n\nto Sue which states:\n\n          Cellexis and the Cellexis Principals hereby\n          covenant and agree that they shall not now or\n          at any time in the future bring any Claims\n          against GTE, the GTE Partnerships,3 their\n          predecessors, their successors, and each of\n          their present and former attorneys, officers,\n          agents, heirs, assigns, owners, servants,\n          directors,    employees,    and   all    other\n          representatives involving alleged Intellectual\n          Property as defined in paragraph 1.7.\n\n          Our task is to determine whether the district court\n\ncorrectly resolved on summary judgment that the language in the\n\nSettlement Agreement was \"so one-sided that no reasonable person\n\ncould decide\" that the definition of \"GTE\" in the Settlement\n\nAgreement included Cellco, a current GTE affiliate that was not an\n\naffiliate at the time the Settlement Agreement was executed.             See\n\nLohnes v. Level 3 Communs., Inc., 272 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n          We   begin   our   analysis     by   scrutinizing   the   contract\n\nlanguage for the parties' intent. The definition of \"GTE\" provided\n\nin Paragraph 1.3 of the Settlement Agreement states that \"'GTE'\n\nmeans and includes GTE Corporation, all of its subsidiaries, joint\n\n\n3\n  Paragraph 1.4 states, \"'GTE Partnerships' means and includes all\npartnerships engaged in the provision of wireless communication\nservices, including but not limited to wireless communication\ncarriers, of which GTE Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or\naffiliates are a partner or have an ownership or other financial\ninterest.\"\n\n                                    -7-\n\fventures, and affiliates and every GTE entity which is licensed to\n\nprovide wireless communications services, including but not limited\n\nto GTE Mobilnet Service Corporation.\"\n\n          GTE contends that Paragraph 1.3 does not contain a\n\ntemporal limitation.     In support of its position, GTE attempted to\n\nintroduce into evidence the deposition of GTE general counsel,\n\nRichard Stimson, who testified that he and Cellexis's attorney had\n\nagreed not to include a list of GTE entities because the entities\n\nwere always changing as GTE attempted to establish itself as a\n\nnational cellular carrier.    The district court denied admission of\n\nthe extrinsic evidence and found that other provisions of the\n\nSettlement   Agreement    contain    language   in   the   future   tense,\n\nindicating that the drafters of the contract would have used a\n\nfuture tense if they intended to include future affiliates.4           The\n\ndistrict court concluded that where the contract did not explicitly\n\nuse future language, the court will \"presume that the parties\n\nintended the Agreement to cover only those entities that existed at\n\nthe time of the Agreement's execution.\"         GTE Wireless, 2002 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS, at *14.\n\n\n\n\n4\n   The district court points to the use of the phrase \"arising out\nof\" in Paragraph 1.7 (\"'Intellectual Property' means rights,\nincluding but not limited to patents, copyrights, or trade secrets,\ninvolving or arising out of wireless communication technology\n. . . .) and the explicit use of the term \"successor\" in Paragraph\n7.1 to reach the conclusion that the drafters used the future tense\nwhen they intended to cover future events and entities.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           We find that the district court erred in its approach to\n\ninterpreting the contract. The district court believed that it was\n\nrequired to interpret the Agreement narrowly, and that this narrow\n\nconstruction could not be broadened by any extrinsic evidence, even\n\nif that evidence compelled a broader interpretation.              See id. at\n\n*16.     However, this is not Arizona law.              When the extrinsic\n\nevidence supports GTE's proffered and reasonable interpretation, a\n\ntriable issue of fact is created that cannot be resolved by a court\n\non summary judgment.\n\n           In Arizona, \"[w]hen interpreting a contract, a court must\n\ndetermine and effectuate the intent of the parties.\"               Ahwatukee\n\nCustom Estates Mgmt. Assoc., Inc. v. Bach, 973 P.2d 106, 109 (Ariz.\n\n1999).     To   ascertain   intent,    Arizona    has   adopted   the   Corbin\n\napproach to the admission of extrinsic evidence.           Taylor, 854 P.2d\n\nat 1138.   Under this approach, the trial judge is not required to\n\nmake a finding of ambiguity; the court considers all extrinsic\n\nevidence offered by a party to \"illuminate the meaning of the\n\ncontract language, or demonstrate the parties' intent.\"                 Id. at\n\n1139.    The district court erred, then, in holding that GTE's\n\nproffered interpretation needed to rest on some \"ambiguity as to\n\nthe temporal limitations in the Agreement.\"             GTE Wireless, 2002\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 16203, at *16.             At the interpretation stage, a\n\ncourt may only disregard that evidence that is wholly without\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fprobative value in determining that intent.             Taylor, 854 P.2d at\n\n1139.\n\n           In     Arizona,   \"a      court    may    consider     surrounding\n\ncircumstances, including negotiation, prior understandings, and\n\nsubsequent conduct.\" Id. After considering all proffered evidence\n\nand arriving at an interpretation of the disputed terms, the court\n\nexcludes from the fact-finder's consideration only the evidence\n\nthat contradicts or varies the meaning of the agreement.                 See id.\n\n(stating that the judge may not consider the offered evidence\n\nwhere   \"the    asserted   meaning    of    the   contract    language    is    so\n\nunreasonable or extraordinary that it is improbable that the\n\nparties actually subscribed to the interpretation asserted by the\n\nproponent of the extrinsic evidence\").            Thus, if the trial court\n\nfinds the contract language is \"reasonably susceptible\" to the\n\nproponent's interpretation, the extrinsic evidence is admissible to\n\ndetermine the parties' intended meaning. Id.; Maxwell v. Fid. Fin.\n\nServs., 907 P.2d 51, 61 (Ariz. 1995) (en banc).\n\n           After    correctly     reciting    Arizona   law    regarding       the\n\nadmission of extrinsic evidence, the district court overstated\n\nArizona law by asserting it \"requires that a release of liability\n\nbe construed narrowly against coverage of non-parties, unless\n\nexpressly named or otherwise identified.\"           GTE Wireless, 2002 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 16203, at *11 (citing Spain v. Gen. Motors Corp., 829\n\nP.2d. 1272, 1273 (Ariz. App. Div. 2 1992)).             Spain actually uses\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe language relied upon by the district court to discuss the rule\n\nother jurisdictions have applied to the rights on non-parties under\n\nrelease contracts.        829 P.2d at 1273.     The correct rule to be\n\ngleaned from Spain is that others are \"released only if that was\n\nthe intended result or the release expressly provided.\"               Id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            Independently of its error about the extrinsic evidence,\n\nthe district court erred in ruling that the language of the\n\nAgreement   alone   was    not   reasonably   susceptible   to   different\n\ninterpretations.     We think the Agreement offers ample room for\n\ndifferent interpretations, including the one offered by GTE.            We\n\nthink the most natural reading of Paragraph 1.3 is that it contains\n\nno temporal limitations, encompassing at any given time those\n\nentities of which GTE consists or is affiliated with through\n\npartnership or other agreements.       Another reading, focused on the\n\nuse of the present tense in the term \"is licensed to provide,\"\n\nsuggests that the covenant is limited to those entities as of the\n\ndate of the covenant, the time of execution, or both.\n\n            As the district court noted, GTE's extrinsic evidence\n\nsupported a reasonable belief that GTE wanted to prevent Cellexis\n\nfrom harassing it again with frivolous lawsuits over the claimed\n\nintellectual property.      That testimony apparently formed the basis\n\nfor the district court's conclusion that there was \"no doubt that\n\nGTE desired a broadly worded agreement to protect its interests to\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe greatest degree possible.\" See 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16203, at\n\n*16.      Since we cannot find where Cellexis has ever directly\n\nrebutted this testimony or offered evidence to the contrary, we do\n\nnot see how GTE's \"asserted meaning of the contract language is so\n\nunreasonable or extraordinary that it is improbable that the\n\nparties actually subscribed to the interpretation asserted by the\n\nproponent of the extrinsic evidence.\"               Taylor, 854 P.2d at 1139.\n\n            Although ostensibly grounded in Federal patent policy,\n\nthe district court also erred when it rejected GTE's interpretation\n\n(and    consequently       GTE's       extrinsic    evidence)     because        GTE's\n\nconstruction of the agreement would be against public policy as an\n\nunreasonable      expansion       of    the     protections    afforded     by     the\n\nSettlement Agreement.5        GTE Wireless, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS, at\n\n*16-17.     The    trial    court's      concern    about     potential    abuse    is\n\nmisplaced; the paramount purpose of contract interpretation under\n\nArizona law is to effectuate the parties' intent. Taylor, 854 P.2d\n\nat 1139; see also Stephen F. Ross and Daniel Tranen, The Modern\n\nParol   Evidence    Rule    and    Its    Implications      for   New     Textualist\n\n\n\n5\n   \"To afford protection under the Settlement Agreement to any\nentity that at some point qualifies as a GTE affiliate, joint\nventure, partnership, or other protected entity, would essentially\ngive the plaintiff a right to infringe Freedom's patent in\nperpetuity . . . render[ing] the Agreement tantamount to a freely\nassignable license to Freedom's intellectual property. . . . Absent\nany evidence showing that the parties agreed to this result, I am\ndisinclined to grant the plaintiff such a broad, and potentially\nlucrative, construction of the Agreement.\"     GTE Wireless, Inc.,\n2002 U.S. Dist.

The    district      court      misapplied          Arizona      law   when   it\n\nsubstituted     its       views   as    to    what      constitutes       an     improvident\n\ncontract for that of the contract drafters. As the Arizona Supreme\n\nCourt   has    stated,      \"[t]he      judge       .   .   .    must   avoid     the   often\n\nirresistible        temptation         to    automatically          interpret        contract\n\nlanguage as he or she would understand the words.                              This natural\n\ntendency is sometimes disguised in the judge's ruling that contract\n\nlanguage is 'unambiguous.'\"                 Taylor, 854 P.2d at 1139.\n\n              In Arizona, extrinsic evidence is not barred even where\n\nthe trial court believes the contract language is express. Taylor,\n\n854 P.2d at 1139 (stating that \"a court is obligated to enforce the\n\nagreement according to the parties' intent, even if the language\n\nordinarily might mean something different\").                       Even a document that\n\nmay appear plain on its face, \"may not appear nearly so plain once\n\nthe judge considers the [extrinsic] evidence.\" Id. at 1140. Thus,\n\nif   the   terms     of    the    Settlement        Agreement       can     be   reasonably\n\nconstrued in more than one manner, then the terms are \"subject to\n\na determination by the trier of fact about the intent of the\n\nparties based on extrinsic evidence.\"                           Leo Eisenberg & Co. v.\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fPayson, 785 P.2d 49, 52 (Ariz. 1989) (en banc).     As the district\n\ncourt stated, it is beyond doubt that GTE desired a broadly worded\n\nagreement.    GTE wished to be released from   substantial potential\n\nliability.    The district court erred by not considering Stimson's\n\ntestimony and admitting it for consideration by the fact-finder.\n\nThe imprecise contract language defining GTE in Paragraph 1.3 is\n\nreasonably susceptible to GTE's interpretation that the parties\n\nintended the Settlement Agreement to cover future affiliates.

Generation of Settlement Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The history of the parties' litigation is complicated by several corporate transmutations. In April 1996, appellees Cellexis and Freedom Wireless, Inc., sued GTE in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, claiming that GTE stole its trade secrets by using Cellexis's technology for prepaid cellular telephone service (the \"1996 litigation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five weeks after filing suit, Cellexis settled with GTE (the \"Settlement Agreement\"). As part of the Settlement Agreement, Cellexis agreed to pay part of GTE's attorneys' fees and to publicly retract prior statements accusing GTE of uncompetitive behavior, theft, fraud, and malice. In return, GTE agreed to drop its claims against Cellexis for malicious prosecution, trade libel, and interference with contractual relations. The Settlement Agreement contained a covenant by Cellexis and its principals not to sue GTE and its affiliates, partnerships, joint ventures, and successors in the future over GTE's use of the same technology. When the Settlement Agreement was signed, Cellexis had a patent application pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"Patent Office\") for the technology at issue in the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, Cellexis sold its rights under the patent application to Freedom Wireless, Inc., (\"Freedom\") for $750,000. In February 1998, the Patent Office issued the first of two patents (\"'067 patent\") arising from the patent application, which Cellexis assigned to Freedom under the terms of the 1997 sale of rights. Four months later, in June 1998, Freedom sent a letter to GTE claiming that GTE was infringing the '067 patent. GTE responded that the Settlement Agreement barred any suit against GTE or its affiliates because the patent covered the technology at issue in the 1996 litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 1998, GTE Corporation and Bell Atlantic Corporation (\"Bell Atlantic\") entered into a merger agreement. On September 21, 1999, Bell Atlantic and Vodafone Airtouch PLC agreed to consolidate their operations. As part of the agreement, GTE Wireless's operations were assigned to Cellco (a Bell Atlantic subsidiary) at the closing of the GTE/Bell Atlantic merger. GTE Mobilnet was dissolved on June 21, 2000, and all its assets were distributed to its sole shareholder, GTE Wireless. The GTE/Bell Atlantic merger was completed July 10, 2000, and GTE Corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic (now Verizon Communications, Inc. (\"Verizon\")). GTE subsidiaries and affiliates together own 55% of Cellco. Verizon also has the contractual right to appoint a majority of Cellco's Board of Representatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 29, 2000, Freedom filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California accusing several companies, including Bell Atlantic and AirTouch, of infringing Freedom's patent. The patent action was transferred to Massachusetts federal court. In December 2000, the Patent Office issued the second patent (\"'823 patent\") arising from the patent application assigned to Freedom. Freedom filed an amended complaint in the patent action adding infringement of the '823 patent and naming Cellco as a defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Cellco answered Freedom's complaint, GTE Mobilnet filed suit against Cellexis, Freedom, and one of Freedom's officers in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, contending that AirTouch and Bell Atlantic fell under the definition of GTE Partnerships in paragraph 1.4 of the Settlement Agreement; thus, Freedom could not bring a claim of patent infringement against them. Six days after bringing suit in Arizona, GTE Mobilnet dissolved. GTE Mobilnet attempted to substitute Cellco as plaintiff, stating that Cellco was a successor to GTE Mobilnet and seeking to preliminarily enjoin Freedom from pursuing its patent case against Cellco. The Arizona court denied the motion to substitute and transferred the case to Massachusetts because of its relatedness to the pending patent action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After transfer to Massachusetts, the district court allowed GTE Mobilnet's motion to substitute GTE Wireless as plaintiff. In its supplemental complaint, GTE Wireless claimed that defendants were in breach of the Settlement Agreement by continuing to pursue Freedom's patent suit against Cellco. GTE Wireless argued that the interest that GTE Wireless took in Cellco in July 2000 made Cellco a GTE Partnership and an intended beneficiary of the Settlement Agreement and that Cellco fell within the definition of GTE as an affiliate. Cellexis argued, inter alia, that the definition of GTE in the Settlement Agreement only included affiliates that were in existence at the time the agreement was executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Applying Arizona law as the parties contracted, the Massachusetts court denied GTE's proffer of extrinsic evidence and granted Cellexis's motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Settlement Agreement does not reach entities that became GTE affiliates after May 15, 1996. GTE Wireless appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review summary judgment decisions de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>Ruiz-Sulsona v. Univ. of P. R.,</i> 334 F.3d 157 (1st Cir.2003). Summary judgment is inappropriate if there is a genuine issue as to any material fact. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Arizona law controls. In Arizona, contract interpretation involves matters of law, and we are not bound by the trial court's interpretation of the language. <i>See Andrews v. Blake,</i> 205 Ariz. 236, 69 P.3d 7, 11 (2003). \"A district court's application of the parol evidence rule, an issue of state law, is reviewed under the same de novo standard applied to decisions concerning federal law.\" <i>Jinro Am., Inc. v. Secure Investments, Inc.,</i> 266 F.3d 993, 998-99 (9th Cir.2001) (applying Arizona law to a contract dispute). Where a contract is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning and evidence exists to support the reading advocated by the nonmovant, an issue of fact is presented that cannot be resolved on summary judgment. <i>See Taylor v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</i> 175 Ariz. 148, 854 P.2d 1134, 1144-45 (1993) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GTE wishes to enforce Paragraph 7.1 of the Covenant Not to Sue which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cellexis and the Cellexis Principals hereby covenant and agree that they shall not now or at any time in the future bring any Claims against GTE, the GTE Partnerships,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> their predecessors, their successors, and each of their present and former attorneys, officers, agents, heirs, assigns, owners, servants, directors, employees, and all other representatives involving alleged Intellectual Property as defined in paragraph 1.7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task is to determine whether the district court correctly resolved on summary judgment that the language in the Settlement Agreement was \"so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide\" that the definition of \"GTE\" in the Settlement Agreement included Cellco, a current GTE affiliate that was not an affiliate at the time the Settlement Agreement was executed. <i>See Lohnes v. Level 3 Communs., Inc.,</i> 272 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis by scrutinizing the contract language for the parties' intent. The definition of \"GTE\" provided in Paragraph 1.3 of the Settlement Agreement states that \"`GTE' means and includes GTE Corporation, all of its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and affiliates and every GTE entity which is licensed to provide wireless communications services, including but not limited to GTE Mobilnet Service Corporation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GTE contends that Paragraph 1.3 does not contain a temporal limitation. In support of its position, GTE attempted to introduce into evidence the deposition of GTE general counsel, Richard Stimson, who testified that he and Cellexis's attorney had agreed not to include a list of GTE entities because the entities were always changing as GTE attempted to establish itself as a national cellular carrier. The district court denied admission of the extrinsic evidence and found that other provisions of the Settlement Agreement contain language in the future tense, indicating that the drafters of the contract would have used a future tense if they intended to include future affiliates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court concluded that where the contract did not explicitly use future language, the court will \"presume that the parties intended the Agreement to cover only those entities that existed at the time of the Agreement's execution.\" <i>GTE Wireless,</i> 2002 WL 1998261, at*4, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS, at *14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court erred in its approach to interpreting the contract. The district court believed that it was required to interpret the Agreement narrowly, and that this narrow construction could not be broadened by any extrinsic evidence, even if that evidence compelled a broader interpretation. <i>See id.</i> at *5, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16203, at *16. However, this is not Arizona law. When the extrinsic evidence supports GTE's proffered and reasonable interpretation, a triable issue of fact is created that cannot be resolved by a court on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Arizona, \"[w]hen interpreting a contract, a court must determine and effectuate the intent of the parties.\" <i>Ahwatukee Custom Estates Mgmt. Assoc., Inc. v. Bach,</i> 193 Ariz. 401, 973 P.2d 106, 109 (1999). To ascertain intent, Arizona has adopted the Corbin approach to the admission of extrinsic evidence. <i>Taylor,</i> 854 P.2d at 1138. Under this approach, the trial judge is not required to make a finding of ambiguity; the court considers all extrinsic evidence offered by a party to \"illuminate the meaning of the contract language, or demonstrate the parties' intent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1139. The district court erred, then, in holding that GTE's proffered interpretation needed to rest on some \"ambiguity as to the temporal limitations in the Agreement.\" <i>GTE Wireless,</i> 2002 WL 1998261, at *5, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16203, at *16. At the interpretation stage, a court may only disregard that evidence that is wholly without probative value in determining that intent. <i>Taylor,</i> 854 P.2d at 1139.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Arizona, \"a court may consider surrounding circumstances, including negotiation, prior understandings, and subsequent conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> After considering all proffered evidence and arriving at an interpretation of the disputed terms, the court excludes from the fact-finder's consideration only the evidence that contradicts or varies the meaning of the agreement. <i>See id.</i> (stating that the judge may not consider the offered evidence where \"the asserted meaning of the contract language is so unreasonable or extraordinary that it is improbable that the parties actually subscribed to the interpretation asserted by the proponent of the extrinsic evidence\"). Thus, if the trial court finds the contract language is \"reasonably susceptible\" to the proponent's interpretation, the extrinsic evidence is admissible to determine the parties' intended meaning. <i>Id.; Maxwell v. Fid. Fin. Servs.,</i> 184 Ariz. 82, 907 P.2d 51, 61 (1995) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After correctly reciting Arizona law regarding the admission of extrinsic evidence, the district court overstated Arizona law by asserting it \"requires that a release of liability be construed narrowly against coverage of non-parties, unless expressly named or otherwise identified.\" <i>GTE Wireless,</i> 2002 WL 1998261, at *3, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16203, at *11 (citing <i>Spain v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 171 Ariz. 226, 829 P.2d 1272, 1273 (1992)). <i>Spain</i> actually uses the language relied upon by the district court to discuss the rule other jurisdictions have applied to the rights on non-parties under release contracts. 829 P.2d at 1273. The correct rule to be gleaned from <i>Spain</i> is that others are \"released only if that was the intended result or the release expressly provided.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Independently of its error about the extrinsic evidence, the district court erred in ruling that the language of the Agreement alone was not reasonably susceptible to different interpretations. We think the Agreement offers ample room for different interpretations, including the one offered by GTE. We think the most natural reading of Paragraph 1.3 is that it contains no temporal limitations, encompassing at any given time those entities of which GTE consists or is affiliated with through partnership or other agreements. Another reading, focused on the use of the present tense in the term \"is licensed to provide,\" suggests that the covenant is limited to those entities as of the date of the covenant, the time of execution, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, GTE's extrinsic evidence supported a reasonable belief that GTE wanted to prevent Cellexis from harassing it again with frivolous lawsuits over the claimed intellectual property. That testimony apparently formed the basis for the district court's conclusion that there was \"no doubt that GTE desired a broadly worded agreement to protect its interests to the greatest degree possible.\" <i>See</i> 2002 WL 1998261, *5, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16203, at *16. Since we cannot find where Cellexis has ever directly rebutted this testimony or offered evidence to the contrary, we do not see how GTE's \"asserted meaning of the contract language is so unreasonable or extraordinary that it is improbable that the parties actually subscribed to the interpretation asserted by the proponent of the extrinsic evidence.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 854 P.2d at 1139.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although ostensibly grounded in Federal patent policy, the district court also erred when it rejected GTE's interpretation (and consequently GTE's extrinsic evidence) because GTE's construction of the agreement would be against public policy as an unreasonable expansion of the protections afforded by the Settlement Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>GTE Wireless,</i> 2002 WL 1998261, at *5, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS, at *16-17. The trial court's concern about potential abuse is misplaced; the paramount purpose of contract interpretation under Arizona law is to effectuate the parties' intent. <i>Taylor,</i> 854 P.2d at 1139; <i>see also</i> Stephen F. Ross and Daniel Tranen, <i>The Modern Parol Evidence Rule and Its Implications for New Textualist Statutory Interpretation,</i> 87 Geo. L.J. 195, 203-04 (1998) (stating that \"because [extrinsic] evidence more accurately reflects the parties' manifest intent than the judge's `objective' review,\" Corbin's approach promotes the integrity of the contract as a means of allowing parties the freedom to effectuate their economic goals). The district court misapplied Arizona law when it substituted its views as to what constitutes an improvident contract for that of the contract drafters. As the Arizona Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]he judge ... must avoid the often irresistible temptation to automatically interpret contract language as he or she would understand the words. This natural tendency is sometimes disguised in the judge's ruling that contract language is `unambiguous.'\" <i>Taylor,</i> 854 P.2d at 1139.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Arizona, extrinsic evidence is not barred even where the trial court believes the contract language is express. <i>Taylor,</i> 854 P.2d at 1139 (stating that \"a court is obligated to enforce the agreement according to the parties' intent, even if the language ordinarily might mean something different\"). Even a document that may appear plain on its face, \"may not appear nearly so plain once the judge considers the [extrinsic] evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1140. Thus, if the terms of the Settlement Agreement can be reasonably construed in more than one manner, then the terms are \"subject to a determination by the trier of fact about the intent of the parties based on extrinsic evidence.\" <i>Leo Eisenberg &amp; Co. v. Payson,</i> 162 Ariz. 529, 785 P.2d 49, 52 (1989) (en banc). As the district court stated, it is beyond doubt that GTE desired a broadly worded agreement. GTE wished to be released from substantial potential liability. The district court erred by not considering Stimson's testimony and admitting it for consideration by the fact-finder. The imprecise contract language defining GTE in Paragraph 1.3 is reasonably susceptible to GTE's interpretation that the parties intended the Settlement Agreement to cover future affiliates.

Generation of Settlement Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The history of the parties' litigation is complicated by several corporate transmutations. In April 1996, appellees Cellexis and Freedom Wireless, Inc., sued GTE in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, claiming that GTE stole its trade secrets by using Cellexis's technology for prepaid cellular telephone service (the \"1996 litigation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five weeks after filing suit, Cellexis settled with GTE (the \"Settlement Agreement\"). As part of the Settlement Agreement, Cellexis agreed to pay part of GTE's attorneys' fees and to publicly retract prior statements accusing GTE of uncompetitive behavior, theft, fraud, and malice. In return, GTE agreed to drop its claims against Cellexis for malicious prosecution, trade libel, and interference with contractual relations. The Settlement Agreement contained a covenant by Cellexis and its principals not to sue GTE and its affiliates, partnerships, joint ventures, and successors in the future over GTE's use of the same technology. When the Settlement Agreement was signed, Cellexis had a patent application pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"Patent Office\") for the technology at issue in the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, Cellexis sold its rights under the patent application to Freedom Wireless, Inc., (\"Freedom\") for $750,000. In February 1998, the Patent Office issued the first of two patents (\"'067 patent\") arising from the patent application, which Cellexis assigned to Freedom under the terms of the 1997 sale of rights. Four months later, in June 1998, Freedom sent a letter to GTE claiming that GTE was infringing the '067 patent. GTE responded that the Settlement Agreement barred any suit against GTE or its affiliates because the patent covered the technology at issue in the 1996 litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 1998, GTE Corporation and Bell Atlantic Corporation (\"Bell Atlantic\") entered into a merger agreement. On September 21, 1999, Bell Atlantic and Vodafone Airtouch PLC agreed to consolidate their operations. As part of the agreement, GTE Wireless's operations were assigned to Cellco (a Bell Atlantic subsidiary) at the closing of the GTE/Bell Atlantic merger. GTE Mobilnet was dissolved on June 21, 2000, and all its assets were distributed to its sole shareholder, GTE Wireless. The GTE/Bell Atlantic merger was completed July 10, 2000, and GTE Corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic (now Verizon Communications, Inc. (\"Verizon\")). GTE subsidiaries and affiliates together own 55% of Cellco. Verizon also has the contractual right to appoint a majority of Cellco's Board of Representatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 29, 2000, Freedom filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California accusing several companies, including Bell Atlantic and AirTouch, of infringing Freedom's patent. The patent action was transferred to Massachusetts federal court. In December 2000, the Patent Office issued the second patent (\"'823 patent\") arising from the patent application assigned to Freedom. Freedom filed an amended complaint in the patent action adding infringement of the '823 patent and naming Cellco as a defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Cellco answered Freedom's complaint, GTE Mobilnet filed suit against Cellexis, Freedom, and one of Freedom's officers in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, contending that AirTouch and Bell Atlantic fell under the definition of GTE Partnerships in paragraph 1.4 of the Settlement Agreement; thus, Freedom could not bring a claim of patent infringement against them. Six days after bringing suit in Arizona, GTE Mobilnet dissolved. GTE Mobilnet attempted to substitute Cellco as plaintiff, stating that Cellco was a successor to GTE Mobilnet and seeking to preliminarily enjoin Freedom from pursuing its patent case against Cellco. The Arizona court denied the motion to substitute and transferred the case to Massachusetts because of its relatedness to the pending patent action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After transfer to Massachusetts, the district court allowed GTE Mobilnet's motion to substitute GTE Wireless as plaintiff. In its supplemental complaint, GTE Wireless claimed that defendants were in breach of the Settlement Agreement by continuing to pursue Freedom's patent suit against Cellco. GTE Wireless argued that the interest that GTE Wireless took in Cellco in July 2000 made Cellco a GTE Partnership and an intended beneficiary of the Settlement Agreement and that Cellco fell within the definition of GTE as an affiliate. Cellexis argued, inter alia, that the definition of GTE in the Settlement Agreement only included affiliates that were in existence at the time the agreement was executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Applying Arizona law as the parties contracted, the Massachusetts court denied GTE's proffer of extrinsic evidence and granted Cellexis's motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Settlement Agreement does not reach entities that became GTE affiliates after May 15, 1996. GTE Wireless appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.

The definition of \"GTE\" provided in Paragraph 1.3 of the Settlement Agreement states that \"`GTE' means and includes GTE Corporation, all of its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and affiliates and every GTE entity which is licensed to provide wireless communications services, including but not limited to GTE Mobilnet Service Corporation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GTE contends that Paragraph 1.3 does not contain a temporal limitation. In support of its position, GTE attempted to introduce into evidence the deposition of GTE general counsel, Richard Stimson, who testified that he and Cellexis's attorney had agreed not to include a list of GTE entities because the entities were always changing as GTE attempted to establish itself as a national cellular carrier. The district court denied admission of the extrinsic evidence and found that other provisions of the Settlement Agreement contain language in the future tense, indicating that the drafters of the contract would have used a future tense if they intended to include future affiliates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court concluded that where the contract did not explicitly use future language, the court will \"presume that the parties intended the Agreement to cover only those entities that existed at the time of the Agreement's execution.\" <i>GTE Wireless,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1998261</span></span>, at*4, 2002 U.S. Dist.

We think the Agreement offers ample room for different interpretations, including the one offered by GTE. We think the most natural reading of Paragraph 1.3 is that it contains no temporal limitations, encompassing at any given time those entities of which GTE consists or is affiliated with through partnership or other agreements. Another reading, focused on the use of the present tense in the term \"is licensed to provide,\" suggests that the covenant is limited to those entities as of the date of the covenant, the time of execution, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, GTE's extrinsic evidence supported a reasonable belief that GTE wanted to prevent Cellexis from harassing it again with frivolous lawsuits over the claimed intellectual property.

Since we cannot find where Cellexis has ever directly rebutted this testimony or offered evidence to the contrary, we do not see how GTE's \"asserted meaning of the contract language is so unreasonable or extraordinary that it is improbable that the parties actually subscribed to the interpretation asserted by the proponent of the extrinsic evidence.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 854 P.2d at 1139.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although ostensibly grounded in Federal patent policy, the district court also erred when it rejected GTE's interpretation (and consequently GTE's extrinsic evidence) because GTE's construction of the agreement would be against public policy as an unreasonable expansion of the protections afforded by the Settlement Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>GTE Wireless,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1998261</span></span>, at *5, 2002 U.S. Dist.

The trial court's concern about potential abuse is misplaced; the paramount purpose of contract interpretation under Arizona law is to effectuate the parties' intent. <i>Taylor,</i> 854 P.2d at 1139; <i>see also</i> Stephen F. Ross and Daniel Tranen, <i>The Modern Parol Evidence Rule and Its Implications for New Textualist Statutory Interpretation,</i> 87 Geo.

The district court misapplied Arizona law when it substituted its views as to what constitutes an improvident contract for that of the contract drafters. As the Arizona Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]he judge ... must avoid the often irresistible temptation to automatically interpret contract language as he or she would understand the words.

Even a document that may appear plain on its face, \"may not appear nearly so plain once the judge considers the [extrinsic] evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1140. Thus, if the terms of the Settlement Agreement can be reasonably construed in more than one manner, then the terms are \"subject to a determination by the trier of fact about the intent of the parties based on extrinsic evidence.\" <i>Leo Eisenberg &amp; Co. v. Payson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1138746\"><a href=\"/opinion/1138746/leo-eisenberg-co-inc-v-payson/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1138746\"><a href=\"/opinion/1138746/leo-eisenberg-co-inc-v-payson/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 52 (1989) (en banc). As the district court stated, it is beyond doubt that GTE desired a broadly worded agreement. GTE wished to be released from substantial potential liability. The district court erred by not considering Stimson's testimony and admitting it for consideration by the fact-finder. The imprecise contract language defining GTE in Paragraph 1.3 is reasonably susceptible to GTE's interpretation that the parties intended the Settlement Agreement to cover future affiliates. A perusal of the recitation of facts in this case supports the assertion that the composition of companies in this industry is constantly changing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the procedural history and extrinsic evidence there are conflicting reasonable interpretations of the contract language. These conflicting interpretations create a triable issue of fact that requires the fact-finder to determine whether the parties intended to include future affiliates within the definition of GTE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.
