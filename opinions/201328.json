  "plain_text": "          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-2658\n\n     BENITO GALLOZA, A/K/A BENITO GALLOZA GONZALEZ, ET AL.,\n\n                    Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                               v.\n\n                     NORMAN E. FOY ET AL.,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n      [Hon. Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Selya, Lipez and Howard,\n\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Nydia Gonzalez Ortiz, with whom Santiago & Gonzalez was on\nbrief for appellants.\n     Teresa M. Seda Ramos, with whom Sánchez Betances & Sifre,\nP.S.C. was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                       November 10, 2004\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.      In this action, the plaintiffs,\n\nwho once held identical appointed offices in the same government\n\nagency, claim that their ousters were rooted in politics and, thus,\n\nviolated their rights under the First Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution.      As a fallback, they also claim that the\n\nadverse personnel actions infringed property rights secured to them\n\nby the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe district court brushed these claims aside and granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants.          The plaintiffs now appeal.\n\nAfter careful perscrutation of the briefs and the record, we\n\nconclude that political affiliation is a permissible criterion for\n\nholding the positions at issue and that the plaintiffs lacked any\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest in those positions.\n\nConsequently, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n            The essential facts are uncontroversial.         In 1991, the\n\nPuerto    Rico    legislature   established     the   Municipal    Revenues\n\nCollection Center (familiarly known by its Spanish acronym, CRIM)\n\nto \"collect, receive and allocate . . . public funds\" generated\n\nprimarily through municipal property taxes.           P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n21,   §   5802.    Organizationally,     CRIM   maintains   nine   regional\n\noffices, each of which operates under the aegis of a regional\n\nadministrator.     From 1993 through 2000, the New Progressive Party\n\n(NPP) controlled the central government of Puerto Rico. At various\n\ntimes during the NPP's reign, CRIM's executive director appointed\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fplaintiffs-appellants Benito Galloza Gonzalez, Orlando Mas-Muñiz,\n\nand Luis Antonio Galarza-Pérez, each of whom had enjoyed a long and\n\nsuccessful      career     as   a   bureaucrat,         to    serve          as   regional\n\nadministrators.\n\n              The Popular Democratic Party (PDP) swept to victory in\n\nthe November 2000 general elections.                  Subsequent thereto, CRIM's\n\nreconstituted board of directors named defendant-appellee Norman E.\n\nFoy as CRIM's executive director and defendant-appellee Euclides\n\nMartinez as deputy executive director. The new hierarchs requested\n\nthe plaintiffs' resignations.             When the plaintiffs balked, Foy\n\ndischarged     them    from     their    regional       administrator             positions\n\n(although he reinstated them to the career positions that they\n\npreviously     had    occupied).        Foy    then    appointed        others      of   his\n\nchoosing to the newly vacated regional administrator positions.\n\nFor purposes of this opinion, we assume that politics played a\n\ndecisive role in these personnel moves (Foy and Martinez are\n\nmembers of the PDP, whereas the plaintiffs are members of the NPP).\n\n              The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\narguing   that       (i)   political     affiliation         is    an    inappropriate\n\ncriterion for employment as a regional administrator of CRIM (and,\n\nthus,   the    defendants'      actions       in   reliance       on    it    constituted\n\npolitical discrimination), and (ii) each of them had acquired a\n\nproperty interest in the regional administrator's position (and,\n\nthus, the defendants' abrupt dismissals of them for partisan\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fpolitical reasons abridged due process).               The defendants' riposte\n\nwas that (i) political affiliation is an appropriate criterion for\n\nthe effective performance of a regional administrator's duties, and\n\n(ii) the position is one of \"trust,\" statutorily committed to free\n\nselection and removal (and, thus, not one in which a job-holder can\n\nacquire a constitutionally protected property interest).                    In a\n\nthoughtful rescript, the district court accepted the defendants'\n\narguments and granted summary judgment accordingly.                  Gonzalez v.\n\nFoy, 286 F. Supp. 2d 223 (D.P.R. 2003).            This appeal followed.\n\n            We review the entry of summary judgment de novo, taking\n\nall disputed facts in the light most hospitable to the nonmovants\n\n(here,    the   plaintiffs)    and    drawing    all    reasonable    inferences\n\ntherefrom in favor of the nonmovants.            Houlton Citizens' Coalition\n\nv. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999); Garside v.\n\nOsco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990).                  In conducting\n\nthis     tamisage,   we   do   not    consider    \"conclusory       allegations,\n\nimprobable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"                Medina-Munoz\n\nv. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nSummary judgment is proper only if the record, read in this manner,\n\nreflects that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the\n\nmoving party or parties are entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n            Having erected the summary judgment framework, we move to\n\nthe    plaintiffs'   political       discrimination      claims.      The   First\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fAmendment protects associational rights.                Incorporated within this\n\nprophylaxis is the right to be free from discrimination on account\n\nof one's political opinions or beliefs.                LaRou v. Ridlon, 98 F.3d\n\n659, 661 (1st Cir. 1996).              This protection extends to matters of\n\npublic employment: as a general rule, a government employer cannot\n\ndischarge public employees merely because they are not sponsored by\n\nor affiliated with a particular political party.                  Elrod v. Burns,\n\n427 U.S. 347, 350 (1976).\n\n             Like most general rules, this rule admits of certain\n\nwell-defined exceptions.               One such exception is reserved for\n\ninstances      in   which    political        affiliation    is   an   \"appropriate\n\nrequirement for the effective performance of the public office\n\ninvolved.\"      Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 518 (1980).                      This\n\nexception helps to ensure that elected representatives will not be\n\nhamstrung in endeavoring to carry out the voters' mandate.                         See\n\nElrod, 427 U.S. at 367. Policies espoused by a new administration,\n\npresumably     desired      by   the    citizens     whose   votes     elected   that\n\nadministration, must be given a fair opportunity to flourish.\n\n            In an effort to hold the balance steady and true between\n\nan   individual     employee's     legitimate        First   Amendment     right   to\n\nfreedom   of    association      and     a    new   administration's     legitimate\n\ninterest in implementing its civic policies, the Supreme Court has\n\ndecreed that a public employer, as a prerequisite for discharging\n\nan employee for political reasons, must demonstrate that political\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\faffiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position in\n\nquestion.     Elrod, 427 U.S. at 362-63.              This means, in effect, that\n\nthe    employer      must      show   that   the    position    is   confidential    or\n\npolicymaking in nature.               Id. at 367.\n\n              That may be more easily said than done; determining\n\nwhether a position is \"confidential\" or \"policymaking\" is not a\n\nmatter of inserting variables into a known equation and crunching\n\nthe numbers. See, e.g., id. at 367 (acknowledging that \"[n]o clear\n\nline    can     be     drawn     between     policymaking      and   nonpolicymaking\n\npositions\"); Vazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon, 819 F.2d 319, 324\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (noting that \"[c]onfidentiality has many facets\" in\n\nthis context).          Nor can the question be resolved by the simple\n\nexpedient     of     examining        the    government's      classification   of   a\n\nparticular position (although that taxonomy may be entitled to some\n\nweight).      See Branti, 445 U.S. at 518; Jimenez-Fuentes v. Torres\n\nGaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 246 (1st Cir. 1986) (en banc); see also\n\nRomero Feliciano v. Torres Gaztambide, 836 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (warning that this court, in determining whether political\n\naffiliation is an appropriate job requirement, has \"resisted rigid\n\nuse of labels\").         When all is said and done, the determination as\n\nto whether a particular office is policymaking or confidential in\n\nnature,    so     as    to     make    political     affiliation     an   appropriate\n\nrequirement for holding it, is fact-specific.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\f            This case involves positions that, according to the\n\ndefendants, have sufficient policymaking implications to avoid the\n\nconstitutional       proscription         against     politically           motivated\n\ndischarges.    To test that representation, we employ a two-pronged\n\nanalysis.    The first prong, derived directly from Branti, 445 U.S.\n\nat 519, necessitates a high-level glimpse of the purpose of the\n\nemploying agency and the role that the particular position occupies\n\nwithin it.     Although conducted from the juridical equivalent of\n\n50,000 feet, this reconnaissance should determine \"whether the\n\nagency   employing      the     plaintiff      handle[s]    matters     potentially\n\nsubject to partisan political differences,\" and should permit a\n\ntentative conclusion about the extent to which the particular\n\nposition has the capacity to \"influence the resolution of such\n\nmatters.\"     Mendez-Palou v. Rohena-Betancourt, 813 F.2d 1255, 1258\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).          This first prong is satisfied (that is, a\n\nposition may be regarded, at least provisionally, as a policymaking\n\nposition)     as   long    as     the    position    potentially        \"involve[s]\n\ngovernment    decisionmaking        on   issues     where   there     is    room   for\n\npolitical disagreement on goals or their implementation.\" Jimenez-\n\nFuentes, 807 F.2d at 241-42.\n\n            As applied to putative policymakers, the second analytic\n\nprong    aspires   to     actualize      the   potential     of   the      particular\n\nposition.     This task necessitates a detailed examination into\n\nwhether the specific responsibilities of the position sufficiently\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fresemble those of a policymaker or office-holder whose functions\n\nare such that party affiliation is an appropriate criterion for\n\ntenure.     Id.    \"The nature of the responsibilities is critical.\"\n\nElrod, 427 U.S. at 367.\n\n            To     differentiate      between           policymakers       and    non-\n\npolicymakers, we assay a wide array of factors, including the\n\nrelative    compensation     level    for       the     position,    the   technical\n\nexpertise (if any) required to do the job, the extent to which the\n\nposition involves supervision and control over others, the degree\n\nto which the position confers authority to speak in the name of\n\nhigher-ups who themselves are policymakers, the influence of the\n\nposition over programs and policy initiatives, and the public\n\nperception of what the position entails.                See Jimenez-Fuentes, 807\n\nF.2d at 242.      We also factor into the mix the relationship of the\n\nposition    to     elected   officials,         party    leaders,    and    partisan\n\npolitics.    Id.    Finally,    \"consideration should . . . be given to\n\nwhether the employee acts as an adviser or formulates plans for the\n\nimplementation of broad goals.\"             Elrod, 427 U.S. at 368.\n\n            This inquiry focuses not on what functions a particular\n\noccupant of the position may in fact carry out from time to time,\n\nbut, rather, on the essential attributes of the position itself.\n\nSee O'Conner v. Steeves, 994 F.2d 905, 911 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\nJimenez-Fuentes,      807    F.2d    at    242.         Thus,   if   a   formal    job\n\ndescription exists, it is important for an inquiring court to look\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fto the specifics of that document.           See Jimenez-Fuentes, 807 F.2d\n\nat 242.    \"An employee with responsibilities that are not well\n\ndefined   or   are   of   broad   scope      more   likely   functions   in   a\n\npolicymaking position.\"      Elrod, 427 U.S. at 368.\n\n           We emphasize that the goal of this two-pronged analysis\n\nis not to shackle a new administration in the legitimate pursuit of\n\nthe policies that led to its electoral success.              In Flynn v. City\n\nof Boston, 140 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 1998), we explained that \"an\n\nemployee is not immune from political firing merely because the\n\nemployee stands apart from 'partisan' politics, or is not the\n\nultimate decisionmaker in the agency, or is guided in some of his\n\nor her functions by professional or technical standards.              Rather,\n\nit is enough that the official be involved in policy, even if only\n\nas an adviser, implementer, or spokesperson.\" Id. at 46 (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).               Those words color our\n\nexamination of the present plaintiffs' political discrimination\n\nclaims.\n\n           We turn now from the general to the specific.             Our task\n\nis to determine whether the regional administrator position within\n\nCRIM   sufficiently   relates     to   partisan     political   interests     or\n\nconcerns to warrant application of the policymaker exception.                 We\n\nconclude that it does.\n\n           It is difficult to imagine a more politically sensitive\n\nissue than the collection and apportionment of taxes.             Taxation is\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fconsidered an inevitable concomitant of American life.                  Cf. Letter\n\nfrom Benjamin Franklin to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy (Nov. 13, 1789) in\n\n10 The Works of Benjamin Franklin 409, 410 (Boston, Hilliard, Gray\n\n& Co. 1840) (positing that in the newly formed republic, \"nothing\n\ncan be said to be certain, except death and taxes\").                  The tax rate,\n\nthe assiduousness of the collection process, and the distribution\n\nof the revenues generated will significantly impact the domestic\n\nagenda of virtually every municipal, county, and state government\n\nin the United States (not to mention the federal sovereign).\n\nGovernments at every level rely upon tax revenues to fund programs\n\nand functions that serve constituent needs.                   Roads could not be\n\nmaintained,    drinking      water    made     potable,    or   social    services\n\nadministered without a tax-driven revenue stream.                In the idiom of\n\nthe First Amendment case law, then, taxation is a \"vital political\n\nissue,\" Jimenez-Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 243 — and one that is of\n\nspecial     importance    to    those      who    harbor   partisan      political\n\nambitions.\n\n            The    agency,     too,   is   politically     sensitive.       CRIM's\n\nresponsibilities       extend     beyond         collection     and    enforcement\n\nactivities.       For example, it is tasked with setting tax rates and\n\nallocating collected revenues to the various municipalities it\n\nserves.   See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, § 5802.              While the mechanical\n\nprocess of collecting taxes, by itself, may not be subject to much\n\npolitical    disagreement,      the   potential      for   partisan     divergence\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fincreases exponentially when an agency has the discretion to affect\n\nthe assessment of taxes and the distribution of the amounts that\n\nare collected.\n\n            The        role    of   the     regional     administrator      is    not\n\ninconsequential in this process.                   CRIM's regional offices are\n\nentrusted, inter alia, with the responsibility for implementing the\n\npolicies set by CRIM's board of directors and executive director.\n\nThe regional administrator is the head of each regional office. He\n\nor she speaks for the agency in that region and superintends its\n\nactivities there.           Given the political sensitivity of taxation and\n\nthe role and status of the agency and its regional administrators,\n\nwe conclude that the position is one that satisfies the first facet\n\nof the policymaker analysis.\n\n            We thus reach the second prong of the inquiry.                  At that\n\nstage, the issue to be resolved is whether the position resembles\n\nthat   of   a   policymaker,        whose    functions    are   such   that      party\n\naffiliation       is    a     concinnous    criterion    for    selection     and/or\n\nretention.      Jimenez-Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 242.                 In making this\n\ndetermination, what counts are the attributes inherent in the\n\nposition — its duties and powers — as opposed to the work actually\n\nperformed by a quondam holder of that position.                 See id.\n\n            As indicated above, a perusal of the job description for\n\nthe position is the most useful starting point for determining the\n\nposition's inherent attributes.                   See Roland-Plumey v. Cerezo-\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fSuarez, 115 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 1997); Ortiz-Pinero v. Rivera-\n\nArroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Mendez-Palou, 813\n\nF.2d at 1260 (\"Whenever possible, we will rely upon [the written\n\njob description] because it contains precisely the information we\n\nneed       concerning     the   position's      inherent        powers.\").         Job\n\ndescriptions with duties that are broad or open-ended generally\n\nallow for the latitude to exercise discretionary judgment (and,\n\nthus, tend to indicate that a position is policymaking in nature).\n\nRoland-Plumey, 115 F.3d at 62.              Conversely, job descriptions with\n\nduties      that    are   narrowly   circumscribed        or    rigidly      delimited\n\ngenerally inhibit freedom of action (and, thus, tend to indicate\n\nthat a position is not policymaking in nature).                      Id.\n\n              The    official     job       description        for     the   regional\n\nadministrator position lists twelve main areas of responsibility.1\n\nTaken in the ensemble, this compendium strongly suggests that the\n\nposition is one in which political affiliation is an appropriate\n\ncriterion      for   employment.        A   regional   administrator's          duties\n\ninvolve, among other things, the planning and supervision of all\n\nadministrative activities of the regional center; the oversight of\n\npersonnel; the establishment of work methods to implement CRIM's\n\nobjectives; the giving of advice to mid-level supervisory personnel\n\nin matters such as drawing up work plans; the channeling of complex\n\n\n\n       1\n      For ease in reference, we attach the official job description\nas an appendix to this opinion.\n\n                                        -12-\n\fcases; and representation of the agency at various types of local\n\nassemblies, meetings, and conferences.     In addition, the position\n\nvests the holder with the authority to determine what appraisals\n\nshall be made within the region, the power to resolve taxpayer\n\nproblems    (including   the   right     to     override    preliminary\n\ndeterminations of the field staff or mid-level supervisors), the\n\nresponsibility of maintaining relationships with the mayors of the\n\naffected municipalities in order to facilitate the performance of\n\nCRIM's work, and the duty of integrating CRIM's policies with the\n\ncontribution needs and priorities of each municipality.\n\n           These are not purely mechanical or ministerial functions.\n\nThey illustrate the wide sweep of discretionary powers inherent in\n\nthe position of regional administrator.       The responsibilities of a\n\nregional administrator, in CRIM's organizational structure, are not\n\nnarrowly circumscribed, but, rather, are open-ended; they afford\n\nthe position's   occupant   considerable   leeway    for   discretionary\n\npolicymaking and policy implementation.2        As the district court\n\nperspicuously noted, the performance of a regional administrator\n\ncan affect the financial well-being of the communities within the\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — we find it\ncompelling that the regional administrators are in the upper\nechelon of CRIM's employees in terms of compensation; indeed, the\nplaintiffs' pay increased anywhere from 150% to 200% after being\nelevated from their career positions to the regional administrator\npositions.\n\n                                -13-\n\fregion and can enhance or diminish CRIM's public image.                      See\n\nGonzalez, 286 F. Supp. 2d at 228-29.\n\n            The case law erases any lingering doubt. Although CRIM's\n\nregional administrator positions have not previously been the\n\nsubject of reported First Amendment litigation, this court \"ha[s]\n\nregularly upheld against First Amendment challenge the dismissal on\n\npolitical grounds of mid- to upper-level officials or employees who\n\nare significantly connected to policy-making.\"              Flynn, 140 F.3d at\n\n45.   On    this   basis,   we   uniformly        have   classified   analogous\n\npositions as involving policymaking. See, e.g., Duriex-Gauthier v.\n\nLopez-Nieves, 274 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that the\n\npersonnel   officer   in    Puerto    Rico's      Ombudsman's     Office   was   a\n\npolicymaking position, notwithstanding a number of \"technical and\n\nadministrative\" duties, because its occupant was \"responsible for\n\nthe planning and supervising of . . . personnel activities\" and the\n\nlike); Ortiz-Pinero, 84 F.3d at 11 (concluding that the office of\n\ndirector of    federal     programs    in    an   agency   that   obtained   and\n\nadministered federal funding for public works projects was a\n\npolicymaking position); Ortiz Lebron v. Santiago Nieves, 813 F.2d\n\n22, 26 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that the position of regional\n\ndirector of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources was\n\npolicymaking in nature); Jimenez-Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 244 (holding\n\nto like effect anent a regional director of Puerto Rico's Urban\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fDevelopment and Housing Corporation).         This case is cut from the\n\nsame cloth.\n\n            Where, as here, the holder of a position is deeply\n\ninvolved in policy, even if only as an implementer or agency\n\nrepresentative, no more is exigible to satisfy the Elrod-Branti\n\nanalysis.    Taking into account the position's \"relative pay, power\n\nto control others, authority to speak in the name of policymakers,\n\npublic perception, influence on programs, contact with elected\n\nofficials and responsiveness to partisan politics and political\n\nleaders,\" Jimenez-Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 242 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted), we conclude that, for First Amendment\n\npurposes, a regional administrator in the CRIM hierarchy is a\n\npolicymaker.\n\n            In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nplaintiffs    contend   that    CRIM's   independence   from    the   central\n\ngovernment and the bipartisan makeup of its board of directors\n\nnecessitate    a   finding     that   political   affiliation   is    not   an\n\nappropriate criterion for appointment as a regional administrator.\n\nWe do not agree.\n\n             The legislature created CRIM on the understanding that\n\nthe agency would be \"independent and separate from any other agency\n\nor instrumentality of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico.\"   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, § 5802.           Although this language\n\nestablishes CRIM as a separate and independent agency, nothing in\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fthe statute declares that the agency is to be a political eunuch.\n\nIn fact, the statute specifies that CRIM's board of directors shall\n\nconsist of nine members, seven of whom are to be sitting mayors and\n\ntwo of whom are to be officials of the central government.3          P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 21, § 5804.      The seven mayors are elected by vote of\n\nall the incumbent mayors, but four of them must belong to \"the\n\nparty winning the greatest number of municipalities in the general\n\nelections immediately preceding.\"         Id. § 5804(a).   These members\n\nserve four-year terms, roughly coincident with the four-year term\n\nof the governor.     Id. § 5804(c).\n\n            For present purposes, this scheme is informative in two\n\nrespects.       First, it makes party affiliation a conspicuously\n\nimportant integer in the decisional calculus and, thus, belies any\n\ndesire on the part of the legislature to insulate CRIM from\n\npolitical influences.      Second, even if one assumes, for argument's\n\nsake,    that   it   is   theoretically   possible   for   the   political\n\naffiliation of the majority on the board to differ from that of the\n\nleadership of the central government, this would simply shift the\n\nprevailing political agenda from one of the two major parties to\n\nthe other. Whether or not the governor's party dominates the board\n\nof directors, some party will dominate it; that party will have an\n\nagenda; and the regional administrators will, therefore, remain\n\n\n     3\n      These officials — the president of the Government Development\nBank and the Commonwealth's commissioner of municipal affairs — are\nthemselves patronage appointees.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fdeeply engrossed in matters of partisan political concern.                 Hence,\n\nwe reject the plaintiffs' attempt to extricate this case from the\n\nmine-run of decisions applying the Elrod-Branti doctrine.\n\n            To sum up, a multifaceted analysis of the functions of\n\nCRIM, the attributes of the regional administrator's position, the\n\nplaintiffs' job descriptions, and the relevant case law persuades\n\nus   that   the        position    is    open   to     patronage    dismissals.\n\nConsequently, the district court did not err in entering summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' political\n\ndiscrimination claims.\n\n            This leaves the plaintiffs' claims under the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments.          Those claims derive from an assertion that\n\neach plaintiff had acquired a property interest in his regional\n\nadministrator's position, so that his dismissal — which took place\n\nwithout either a hearing or a statement of cause — was in violation\n\nof due process.        These claims are groundless.\n\n            To    be    sure,     the   Constitution    affords    due    process\n\nprotections to public employees who possess property interests in\n\ncontinued public        employment.       See Cleveland     Bd.    of    Educ.   v.\n\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985).            But the Constitution does\n\nnot itself create property rights.              Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-\n\nAlicea, 959 F.2d 349, 350 (1st Cir. 1992).             Rather, the question of\n\nwhether a public employee possessed a protectable property interest\n\nin a particular job is governed by local law and the terms and\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fconditions of the employment arrangement.      See Ortiz-Pinero, 84\n\nF.3d at 17; Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 352.\n\n            Puerto Rico law establishes two categories of public\n\nemployees:    career and confidential.    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §\n\n1349.    Confidential employees, sometimes known as trust employees,\n\nare \"those who intervene or collaborate substantially in the\n\nformation of the public policy, who advise directly or render\n\ndirect services to the head of the agency.\"    Id. § 1350.   Regional\n\ndirectors of agencies are expressly included within this taxonomy.\n\nId. § 1350(4).    The plaintiffs, vis-à-vis the positions at issue\n\nhere, are therefore confidential employees.4\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.     The plaintiffs\n\nadmit that they ascended to the regional administrator positions by\n\nnon-competitive appointment to positions designated by Puerto Rico\n\nlaw as trust positions.      Appellants' Br. at 4.    Unlike career\n\nemployees, who are \"selected strictly on merit and can be removed\n\nonly for cause,\" Jimenez-Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 246, trust employees\n\nare, under Puerto Rico law, of \"free selection and removal,\" P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 3, § 1350(8).   Thus, the holder of a trust position\n\ndoes not have a constitutionally protected property interest in\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      As mentioned earlier, each of the plaintiffs is also a career\nemployee vis-à-vis the position to which he was returned after\nbeing ousted from his regional administrator's post.            The\nplaintiffs' career positions are not at issue here.\n\n                                 -18-\n\fthat position.   See Ruiz-Roche v. Lausell, 848 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).   Accordingly, the plaintiffs' due process claims founder.\n\n            We need go no further.     Concluding, as we do, that the\n\nposition of regional administrator within CRIM is one for which\n\npolitical   affiliation   is   a   valid   criterion   and   in   which   the\n\nplaintiffs had no legitimate expectation of continued employment,\n\nwe uphold the lower court's entry of summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f                              APPENDIX\n\n                ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE POSITION\n\n1.

As a fallback, they also claim that the adverse personnel actions infringed property rights secured to them by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court brushed these claims aside and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs now appeal. After careful perscrutation of the briefs and the record, we conclude that political affiliation is a permissible criterion for holding the positions at issue and that the plaintiffs lacked any constitutionally protected property interest in those positions. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts are uncontroversial. In 1991, the Puerto Rico legislature established the Municipal Revenues Collection Center (familiarly known by its Spanish acronym, CRIM) to \"collect, receive and allocate ... public funds\" generated primarily through municipal property taxes. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, &#167; 5802. Organizationally, CRIM maintains nine regional offices, each of which operates under the aegis of a regional administrator. From 1993 through 2000, the New Progressive Party (NPP) controlled the central government of Puerto Rico. At various times during the NPP's reign, CRIM's executive director appointed plaintiffs-appellants Benito Galloza Gonzalez, Orlando Mas-Mu&#241;iz, and Luis Antonio Galarza-P&#233;rez, each of whom had enjoyed a long and successful career as a bureaucrat, to serve as regional administrators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Popular Democratic Party (PDP) swept to victory in the November 2000 general elections. Subsequent thereto, CRIM's reconstituted board of directors named defendant-appellee Norman E. Foy as CRIM's executive director and defendant-appellee Euclides Martinez as deputy executive director. The new hierarchs requested the plaintiffs' resignations. When the plaintiffs balked, Foy discharged them from their regional administrator positions (although he reinstated them to the career positions that they previously had occupied). Foy then appointed others of his choosing to the newly vacated regional administrator positions. For purposes of this opinion, we assume that politics played a decisive role in these personnel moves (Foy and Martinez are members of the PDP, whereas the plaintiffs are members of the NPP).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, arguing that (i) political affiliation is an inappropriate criterion for employment as a regional administrator of CRIM (and, thus, the defendants' actions in reliance on it constituted political discrimination), and (ii) each of them had acquired a property interest in the regional administrator's position (and, thus, the defendants' abrupt dismissals of them for partisan political reasons abridged due process). The defendants' riposte was that (i) political affiliation is an appropriate criterion for the effective performance of a regional administrator's duties, and (ii) the position is one of \"trust,\" statutorily committed to free selection and removal (and, thus, not one in which a job-holder can acquire a constitutionally protected property interest). In a thoughtful rescript, the district court accepted the defendants' arguments and granted summary judgment accordingly. <i>Gonzalez v. Foy,</i> 286 F.Supp.2d 223 (D.P.R.2003). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the entry of summary judgment de novo, taking all disputed facts in the light most hospitable to the nonmovants (here, the plaintiffs) and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the nonmovants. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990). In conducting this tamisage, we do not consider \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990). Summary judgment is proper only if the record, read in this manner, reflects that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party or parties are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having erected the summary judgment framework, we move to the plaintiffs' political discrimination claims. The First Amendment protects associational rights. Incorporated within this prophylaxis is the right to be free from discrimination on account of one's political opinions or beliefs. <i>LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> 98 F.3d 659, 661 (1st Cir.1996). This protection extends to matters of public employment: as a general rule, a government employer cannot discharge public employees merely because they are not sponsored by or affiliated with a particular political party. <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 350, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like most general rules, this rule admits of certain well-defined exceptions. One such exception is reserved for instances in which political affiliation is an \"appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.\" <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980). This exception helps to ensure that elected representatives will not be hamstrung in endeavoring to carry out the voters' mandate. <i>See Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. 2673. Policies espoused by a new administration, presumably desired by the citizens whose votes elected that administration, must be given a fair opportunity to flourish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to hold the balance steady and true between an individual employee's legitimate First Amendment right to freedom of association and a new administration's legitimate interest in implementing its civic policies, the Supreme Court has decreed that a public employer, as a prerequisite for discharging an employee for political reasons, must demonstrate that political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position in question. <i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 362-63, 96 S.Ct. 2673. This means, in effect, that the employer must show that the position is confidential or policymaking in nature. <i>Id.</i> at 367, 96 S.Ct. 2673.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That may be more easily said than done; determining whether a position is \"confidential\" or \"policymaking\" is not a matter of inserting variables into a known equation and crunching the numbers. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 367, 96 S.Ct. 2673 (acknowledging that \"[n]o clear line can be drawn between policymaking and nonpolicymaking positions\"); <i>Vazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon,</i> 819 F.2d 319, 324 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that \"[c]onfidentiality has many facets\" in this context). Nor can the question be resolved by the simple expedient of examining the government's classification of a particular position (although that taxonomy may be entitled to some weight). <i>See Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287; <i>Jimenez-Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> 807 F.2d 236, 246 (1st Cir.1986) (en banc); <i>see also Romero Feliciano v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> 836 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1987) (warning that this court, in determining whether political affiliation is an appropriate job requirement, has \"resisted rigid use of labels\"). When all is said and done, the determination as to whether a particular office is policymaking or confidential in nature, so as to make political affiliation an appropriate requirement for holding it, is fact-specific.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves positions that, according to the defendants, have sufficient policymaking implications to avoid the constitutional proscription against politically motivated discharges. To test that representation, we employ a two-pronged analysis. The first prong, derived directly from <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 519, 100 S.Ct. 1287, necessitates a high-level glimpse of the purpose of the employing agency and the role that the particular position occupies within it. Although conducted from the juridical equivalent of 50,000 feet, this reconnaissance should determine \"whether the agency employing the plaintiff handle[s] matters potentially subject to partisan political differences,\" and should permit a tentative conclusion about the extent to which the particular position has the capacity to \"influence the resolution of such matters.\" <i>Mendez-Palou v. Rohena-Betancourt,</i> 813 F.2d 1255, 1258 (1st Cir.1987). This first prong is satisfied (that is, a position may be regarded, at least provisionally, as a policymaking position) as long as the position potentially \"involve[s] government decisionmaking on issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation.\" <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 241-42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As applied to putative policymakers, the second analytic prong aspires to actualize the potential of the particular position. This task necessitates a detailed examination into whether the specific responsibilities of the position sufficiently resemble those of a policymaker or office-holder whose functions are such that party affiliation is an appropriate criterion for tenure. <i>Id.</i> \"The nature of the responsibilities is critical.\" <i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. 2673.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To differentiate between policymakers and non-policymakers, we assay a wide array of factors, including the relative compensation level for the position, the technical expertise (if any) required to do the job, the extent to which the position involves supervision and control over others, the degree to which the position confers authority to speak in the name of higher-ups who themselves are policymakers, the influence of the position over programs and policy initiatives, and the public perception of what the position entails. <i>See Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242. We also factor into the mix the relationship of the position to elected officials, party leaders, and partisan politics. <i>Id.</i> Finally, \"consideration should ... be given to whether the employee acts as an adviser or formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals.\" <i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 368, 96 S.Ct. 2673.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This inquiry focuses not on what functions a particular occupant of the position may in fact carry out from time to time, but, rather, on the essential attributes of the position itself. <i>See O'Connor v. Steeves,</i> 994 F.2d 905, 911 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242. Thus, if a formal job description exists, it is important for an inquiring court to look to the specifics of that document. <i>See Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242. \"An employee with responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope more likely functions in a policymaking position.\" <i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 368, 96 S.Ct. 2673.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that the goal of this two-pronged analysis is not to shackle a new administration in the legitimate pursuit of the policies that led to its electoral success. In <i>Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> 140 F.3d 42 (1st Cir.1998), we explained that \"an employee is not immune from political firing merely because the employee stands apart from `partisan' politics, or is not the ultimate decisionmaker in the agency, or is guided in some of his or her functions by professional or technical standards. Rather, it is enough that the official be involved in policy, even if only as an adviser, implementer, or spokesperson.\" <i>Id.</i> at 46 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Those words color our examination of the present plaintiffs' political discrimination claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now from the general to the specific. Our task is to determine whether the regional administrator position within CRIM sufficiently relates to partisan political interests or concerns to warrant application of the policymaker exception. We conclude that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to imagine a more politically sensitive issue than the collection and apportionment of taxes. Taxation is considered an inevitable concomitant of American life. <i>Cf.</i> Letter from Benjamin Franklin to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy (Nov. 13, 1789) <i>in</i> 10 <i>The Works of Benjamin Franklin</i> 409, 410 (Boston, Hilliard, Gray &amp; Co. 1840) (positing that in the newly formed republic, \"nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes\"). The tax rate, the assiduousness of the collection process, and the distribution of the revenues generated will significantly impact the domestic agenda of virtually every municipal, county, and state government in the United States (not to mention the federal sovereign). Governments at every level rely upon tax revenues to fund programs and functions that serve constituent needs. Roads could not be maintained, drinking water made potable, or social services administered without a tax-driven revenue stream. In the idiom of the First Amendment case law, then, taxation is a \"vital political issue,\" <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 243 &#8212; and one that is of special importance to those who harbor partisan political ambitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency, too, is politically sensitive. CRIM's responsibilities extend beyond collection and enforcement activities. For example, it is tasked with setting tax rates and allocating collected revenues to the various municipalities it serves. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, &#167; 5802. While the mechanical process of collecting taxes, by itself, may not be subject to much political disagreement, the potential for partisan divergence increases exponentially when an agency has the discretion to affect the assessment of taxes and the distribution of the amounts that are collected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of the regional administrator is not inconsequential in this process. CRIM's regional offices are entrusted, inter alia, with the responsibility for implementing the policies set by CRIM's board of directors and executive director. The regional administrator is the head of each regional office. He or she speaks for the agency in that region and superintends its activities there. Given the political sensitivity of taxation and the role and status of the agency and its regional administrators, we conclude that the position is one that satisfies the first facet of the policymaker analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus reach the second prong of the inquiry. At that stage, the issue to be resolved is whether the position resembles that of a policymaker, whose functions are such that party affiliation is a concinnous criterion for selection and/or retention. <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242. In making this determination, what counts are the attributes inherent in the position &#8212; its duties and powers &#8212; as opposed to the work actually performed by a quondam holder of that position. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated above, a perusal of the job description for the position is the most useful starting point for determining the position's inherent attributes. <i>See Roldan-Plumey v. Cerezo-Suarez,</i> 115 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Ortiz-Pinero v. Rivera-Arroyo,</i> 84 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also Mendez-Palou,</i> 813 F.2d at 1260 (\"Whenever possible, we will rely upon [the written job description] because it contains precisely the information we need concerning the position's inherent powers.\"). Job descriptions with duties that are broad or open-ended generally allow for the latitude to exercise discretionary judgment (and, thus, tend to indicate that a position is policymaking in nature). <i>Roldan-Plumey,</i> 115 F.3d at 62. Conversely, job descriptions with duties that are narrowly circumscribed or rigidly delimited generally inhibit freedom of action (and, thus, tend to indicate that a position is not policymaking in nature). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The official job description for the regional administrator position lists twelve main areas of responsibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Taken in the ensemble, this compendium strongly suggests that the position is one in which political affiliation is an appropriate criterion for employment. A regional administrator's duties involve, among other things, the planning and supervision of all administrative activities of the regional center; the oversight of personnel; the establishment of work methods to implement CRIM's objectives; the giving of advice to mid-level supervisory personnel in matters such as drawing up work plans; the channeling of complex cases; and representation of the agency at various types of local assemblies, meetings, and conferences. In addition, the position vests the holder with the authority to determine what appraisals shall be made within the region, the power to resolve taxpayer problems (including the right to override preliminary determinations of the field staff or mid-level supervisors), the responsibility of maintaining relationships with the mayors of the affected municipalities in order to facilitate the performance of CRIM's work, and the duty of integrating CRIM's policies with the contribution needs and priorities of each municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are not purely mechanical or ministerial functions. They illustrate the wide sweep of discretionary powers inherent in the position of regional administrator. The responsibilities of a regional administrator, in CRIM's organizational structure, are not narrowly circumscribed, but, rather, are open-ended; they afford the position's occupant considerable leeway for discretionary policymaking and policy implementation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As the district court perspicuously noted, the performance of a regional administrator can affect the financial well-being of the communities within the region and can enhance or diminish CRIM's public image. <i>See Gonzalez,</i> 286 F.Supp.2d at 228-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law erases any lingering doubt. Although CRIM's regional administrator positions have not previously been the subject of reported First Amendment litigation, this court \"ha[s] regularly upheld against First Amendment challenge the dismissal on political grounds of mid- to upper-level officials or employees who are significantly connected to policy-making.\" <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 45. On this basis, we uniformly have classified analogous positions as involving policymaking. <i>See, e.g., Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves,</i> 274 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that the personnel officer in Puerto Rico's Ombudsman's Office was a policymaking position, notwithstanding a number of \"technical and administrative\" duties, because its occupant was \"responsible for the planning and supervising of ... personnel activities\" and the like); <i>Ortiz-Pinero,</i> 84 F.3d at 11 (concluding that the office of director of federal programs in an agency that obtained and administered federal funding for public works projects was a policymaking position); <i>Ortiz Lebron v. Santiago Nieves,</i> 813 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that the position of regional director of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources was policymaking in nature); <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 244 (holding to like effect anent a regional director of Puerto Rico's Urban Development and Housing Corporation). This case is cut from the same cloth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the holder of a position is deeply involved in policy, even if only as an implementer or agency representative, no more is exigible to satisfy the <i>Elrod-Branti</i> analysis. Taking into account the position's \"relative pay, power to control others, authority to speak in the name of policymakers, public perception, influence on programs, contact with elected officials and responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders,\" <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), we conclude that, for First Amendment purposes, a regional administrator in the CRIM hierarchy is a policymaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the plaintiffs contend that CRIM's independence from the central government and the bipartisan makeup of its board of directors necessitate a finding that political affiliation is not an appropriate criterion for appointment as a regional administrator. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislature created CRIM on the understanding that the agency would be \"independent and separate from any other agency or instrumentality of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, &#167; 5802. Although this language establishes CRIM as a separate and independent agency, nothing in the statute declares that the agency is to be a political eunuch. In fact, the statute specifies that CRIM's board of directors shall consist of nine members, seven of whom are to be sitting mayors and two of whom are to be officials of the central government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, &#167; 5804. The seven mayors are elected by vote of all the incumbent mayors, but four of them must belong to \"the party winning the greatest number of municipalities in the general elections immediately preceding.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5804(a). These members serve four-year terms, roughly coincident with the four-year term of the governor. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5804(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, this scheme is informative in two respects. First, it makes party affiliation a conspicuously important integer in the decisional calculus and, thus, belies any desire on the part of the legislature to insulate CRIM from political influences. Second, even if one assumes, for argument's sake, that it is theoretically possible for the political affiliation of the majority on the board to differ from that of the leadership of the central government, this would simply shift the prevailing political agenda from one of the two major parties to the other. Whether or not the governor's party dominates the board of directors, some party will dominate it; that party will have an agenda; and the regional administrators will, therefore, remain deeply engrossed in matters of partisan political concern. Hence, we reject the plaintiffs' attempt to extricate this case from the mine-run of decisions applying the <i>Elrod-Branti</i> doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, a multifaceted analysis of the functions of CRIM, the attributes of the regional administrator's position, the plaintiffs' job descriptions, and the relevant case law persuades us that the position is open to patronage dismissals. Consequently, the district court did not err in entering summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' political discrimination claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the plaintiffs' claims under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Those claims derive from an assertion that each plaintiff had acquired a property interest in his regional administrator's position, so that his dismissal &#8212; which took place without either a hearing or a statement of cause &#8212; was in violation of due process. These claims are groundless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the Constitution affords due process protections to public employees who possess property interests in continued public employment. <i>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). But the Constitution does not itself create property rights. <i>Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> 959 F.2d 349, 350 (1st Cir.1992). Rather, the question of whether a public employee possessed a protectable property interest in a particular job is governed by local law and the terms and conditions of the employment arrangement. <i>See Ortiz-Pinero,</i> 84 F.3d at 17; <i>Rivera-Muriente,</i> 959 F.2d at 352.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico law establishes two categories of public employees: career and confidential. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1349. Confidential employees, sometimes known as trust employees, are \"those who intervene or collaborate substantially in the formation of the public policy, who advise directly or render direct services to the head of the agency.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1350. Regional directors of agencies are expressly included within this taxonomy. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1350(4). The plaintiffs, vis-&#224;-vis the positions at issue here, are therefore confidential employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. The plaintiffs admit that they ascended to the regional administrator positions by non-competitive appointment to positions designated by Puerto Rico law as trust positions. Appellants' Br. at 4. Unlike career employees, who are \"selected strictly on merit and can be removed only for cause,\" <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 246, trust employees are, under Puerto Rico law, of \"free selection and removal,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1350(8). Thus, the holder of a trust position does not have a constitutionally protected property interest in that position. <i>See Ruiz-Roche v. Lausell,</i> 848 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1988). Accordingly, the plaintiffs' due process claims founder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

As a fallback, they also claim that the adverse personnel actions infringed property rights secured to them by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court brushed these claims aside and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs now appeal. After careful perscrutation of the briefs and the record, we conclude that political affiliation is a permissible criterion for holding the positions at issue and that the plaintiffs lacked any constitutionally protected property interest in those positions. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts are uncontroversial. In 1991, the Puerto Rico legislature established the Municipal Revenues Collection Center (familiarly known by its Spanish acronym, CRIM) to \"collect, receive and allocate ... public funds\" generated primarily through municipal property taxes. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, &#167; 5802. Organizationally, CRIM maintains nine regional offices, each of which operates under the aegis of a regional administrator. From 1993 through 2000, the New Progressive Party (NPP) controlled the central government of Puerto Rico. At various times during the NPP's reign, CRIM's executive director appointed plaintiffs-appellants Benito Galloza Gonzalez, Orlando Mas-Mu&#241;iz, and Luis Antonio Galarza-P&#233;rez, each of whom had enjoyed a long and successful career as a bureaucrat, to serve as regional administrators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Popular Democratic Party (PDP) swept to victory in the November 2000 general elections. Subsequent thereto, CRIM's reconstituted board of directors named defendant-appellee Norman E. Foy as CRIM's executive director and defendant-appellee Euclides Martinez as deputy executive director. The new hierarchs requested the plaintiffs' resignations. When the plaintiffs balked, Foy discharged them from their regional administrator positions (although he reinstated them to the career positions that they previously had occupied). Foy then appointed others of his choosing to the newly vacated regional administrator positions. For purposes of this opinion, we assume that politics played a decisive role in these personnel moves (Foy and Martinez are members of the PDP, whereas the plaintiffs are members of the NPP).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, arguing that (i) political affiliation is an inappropriate criterion for employment as a regional administrator of CRIM (and, thus, the defendants' actions in reliance on it constituted political discrimination), and (ii) each of them had acquired a property interest in the regional administrator's position (and, thus, the defendants' abrupt dismissals of them for partisan political reasons abridged due process). The defendants' riposte was that (i) political affiliation is an appropriate criterion for the effective performance of a regional administrator's duties, and (ii) the position is one of \"trust,\" statutorily committed to free selection and removal (and, thus, not one in which a job-holder can acquire a constitutionally protected property interest). In a thoughtful rescript, the district court accepted the defendants' arguments and granted summary judgment accordingly. <i>Gonzalez v.

This first prong is satisfied (that is, a position may be regarded, at least provisionally, as a policymaking position) as long as the position potentially \"involve[s] government decisionmaking on issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation.\" <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 241-42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As applied to putative policymakers, the second analytic prong aspires to actualize the potential of the particular position.

Taxation is considered an inevitable concomitant of American life. <i>Cf.</i> Letter from Benjamin Franklin to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy (Nov. 13, 1789) <i>in</i> 10 <i>The Works of Benjamin Franklin</i> 409, 410 (Boston, Hilliard, Gray &amp; Co. 1840) (positing that in the newly formed republic, \"nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes\"). The tax rate, the assiduousness of the collection process, and the distribution of the revenues generated will significantly impact the domestic agenda of virtually every municipal, county, and state government in the United States (not to mention the federal sovereign). Governments at every level rely upon tax revenues to fund programs and functions that serve constituent needs. Roads could not be maintained, drinking water made potable, or social services administered without a tax-driven revenue stream. In the idiom of the First Amendment case law, then, taxation is a \"vital political issue,\" <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 243 &#8212; and one that is of special importance to those who harbor partisan political ambitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency, too, is politically sensitive. CRIM's responsibilities extend beyond collection and enforcement activities. For example, it is tasked with setting tax rates and allocating collected revenues to the various municipalities it serves. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, &#167; 5802. While the mechanical process of collecting taxes, by itself, may not be subject to much political disagreement, the potential for partisan divergence increases exponentially when an agency has the discretion to affect the assessment of taxes and the distribution of the amounts that are collected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of the regional administrator is not inconsequential in this process. CRIM's regional offices are entrusted, inter alia, with the responsibility for implementing the policies set by CRIM's board of directors and executive director. The regional administrator is the head of each regional office. He or she speaks for the agency in that region and superintends its activities there. Given the political sensitivity of taxation and the role and status of the agency and its regional administrators, we conclude that the position is one that satisfies the first facet of the policymaker analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus reach the second prong of the inquiry. At that stage, the issue to be resolved is whether the position resembles that of a policymaker, whose functions are such that party affiliation is a concinnous criterion for selection and/or retention. <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242. In making this determination, what counts are the attributes inherent in the position &#8212; its duties and powers &#8212; as opposed to the work actually performed by a quondam holder of that position. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated above, a perusal of the job description for the position is the most useful starting point for determining the position's inherent attributes. <i>See Roldan-Plumey v.

Job descriptions with duties that are broad or open-ended generally allow for the latitude to exercise discretionary judgment (and, thus, tend to indicate that a position is policymaking in nature). <i>Roldan-Plumey,</i> 115 F.3d at 62. Conversely, job descriptions with duties that are narrowly circumscribed or rigidly delimited generally inhibit freedom of action (and, thus, tend to indicate that a position is not policymaking in nature). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The official job description for the regional administrator position lists twelve main areas of responsibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Taken in the ensemble, this compendium strongly suggests that the position is one in which political affiliation is an appropriate criterion for employment. A regional administrator's duties involve, among other things, the planning and supervision of all administrative activities of the regional center; the oversight of personnel; the establishment of work methods to implement CRIM's objectives; the giving of advice to mid-level supervisory personnel in matters such as drawing up work plans; the channeling of complex cases; and representation of the agency at various types of local assemblies, meetings, and conferences. In addition, the position vests the holder with the authority to determine what appraisals shall be made within the region, the power to resolve taxpayer problems (including the right to override preliminary determinations of the field staff or mid-level supervisors), the responsibility of maintaining relationships with the mayors of the affected municipalities in order to facilitate the performance of CRIM's work, and the duty of integrating CRIM's policies with the contribution needs and priorities of each municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are not purely mechanical or ministerial functions. They illustrate the wide sweep of discretionary powers inherent in the position of regional administrator. The responsibilities of a regional administrator, in CRIM's organizational structure, are not narrowly circumscribed, but, rather, are open-ended; they afford the position's occupant considerable leeway for discretionary policymaking and policy implementation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As the district court perspicuously noted, the performance of a regional administrator can affect the financial well-being of the communities within the region and can enhance or diminish CRIM's public image. <i>See Gonzalez,</i> 286 F.Supp.2d at 228-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law erases any lingering doubt.

This case is cut from the same cloth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the holder of a position is deeply involved in policy, even if only as an implementer or agency representative, no more is exigible to satisfy the <i>Elrod-Branti</i> analysis. Taking into account the position's \"relative pay, power to control others, authority to speak in the name of policymakers, public perception, influence on programs, contact with elected officials and responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders,\" <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), we conclude that, for First Amendment purposes, a regional administrator in the CRIM hierarchy is a policymaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the plaintiffs contend that CRIM's independence from the central government and the bipartisan makeup of its board of directors necessitate a finding that political affiliation is not an appropriate criterion for appointment as a regional administrator. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislature created CRIM on the understanding that the agency would be \"independent and separate from any other agency or instrumentality of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, &#167; 5802. Although this language establishes CRIM as a separate and independent agency, nothing in the statute declares that the agency is to be a political eunuch. In fact, the statute specifies that CRIM's board of directors shall consist of nine members, seven of whom are to be sitting mayors and two of whom are to be officials of the central government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, &#167; 5804. The seven mayors are elected by vote of all the incumbent mayors, but four of them must belong to \"the party winning the greatest number of municipalities in the general elections immediately preceding.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5804(a). These members serve four-year terms, roughly coincident with the four-year term of the governor. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5804(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, this scheme is informative in two respects. First, it makes party affiliation a conspicuously important integer in the decisional calculus and, thus, belies any desire on the part of the legislature to insulate CRIM from political influences. Second, even if one assumes, for argument's sake, that it is theoretically possible for the political affiliation of the majority on the board to differ from that of the leadership of the central government, this would simply shift the prevailing political agenda from one of the two major parties to the other. Whether or not the governor's party dominates the board of directors, some party will dominate it; that party will have an agenda; and the regional administrators will, therefore, remain deeply engrossed in matters of partisan political concern. Hence, we reject the plaintiffs' attempt to extricate this case from the mine-run of decisions applying the <i>Elrod-Branti</i> doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, a multifaceted analysis of the functions of CRIM, the attributes of the regional administrator's position, the plaintiffs' job descriptions, and the relevant case law persuades us that the position is open to patronage dismissals. Consequently, the district court did not err in entering summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' political discrimination claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the plaintiffs' claims under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Those claims derive from an assertion that each plaintiff had acquired a property interest in his regional administrator's position, so that his dismissal &#8212; which took place without either a hearing or a statement of cause &#8212; was in violation of due process. These claims are groundless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the Constitution affords due process protections to public employees who possess property interests in continued public employment. <i>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 541, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1487</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span> (1985). But the Constitution does not itself create property rights. <i>Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 350 (1st Cir.1992). Rather, the question of whether a public employee possessed a protectable property interest in a particular job is governed by local law and the terms and conditions of the employment arrangement. <i>See Ortiz-Pinero,</i> 84 F.3d at 17; <i>Rivera-Muriente,</i> 959 F.2d at 352.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico law establishes two categories of public employees: career and confidential. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1349. Confidential employees, sometimes known as trust employees, are \"those who intervene or collaborate substantially in the formation of the public policy, who advise directly or render direct services to the head of the agency.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1350. Regional directors of agencies are expressly included within this taxonomy. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1350(4). The plaintiffs, vis-&#224;-vis the positions at issue here, are therefore confidential employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. The plaintiffs admit that they ascended to the regional administrator positions by non-competitive appointment to positions designated by Puerto Rico law as trust positions. Appellants' Br. at 4. Unlike career employees, who are \"selected strictly on merit and can be removed only for cause,\" <i>Jimenez-Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 246, trust employees are, under Puerto Rico law, of \"free selection and removal,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1350(8). Thus, the holder of a trust position does not have a constitutionally protected property interest in that position. <i>See Ruiz-Roche v. Lausell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506665\"><a href=\"/opinion/506665/ramon-ruiz-roche-v-miguel-d-lausell-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1988). Accordingly, the plaintiffs' due process claims founder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
