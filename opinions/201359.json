R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-2260\n\n                          JOSEPH C. DRESSLER,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                      v.\n\n              COMMUNITY SERVICE COMMUNICATIONS, INC.,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                      FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n\n       [Hon. Margaret J. Kravchuk, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph C. Dressler on brief pro se.\n     S. Mason Pratt, Ella L. Brown, and Pierce Atwood on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           November 19, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam.    For four years Joseph Dressler was manager in\n\ncharge of the Human Resources department of Commtel, a Maine\n\ntelecommunications company.   In the fall of 2000, Dressler, with\n\ncompany approval, took intermittent leave to assist his wife,\n\nthen undergoing weekly treatments for cancer.     The Family and\n\nMedical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-54, requires the\n\nemployer to permit up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year to care\n\nfor a family member, intermittent leave being permitted at the\n\nemployer's discretion, id. § 2612.\n\n     At the time, the company was undergoing a dramatic expansion\n\ninto new areas.    In December 2000, Dressler told Scott Roberts,\n\nthe president and chief operating officer of the company, that he\n\nmight need additional FMLA leave, although he was unsure how much\n\nor when.   According to Dressler, Roberts replied that if he did\n\nso, the company might need to appoint a director of Human\n\nResources, over Dressler, to head the department.\n\n     Dressler in fact took only a few days of FMLA leave over the\n\nnext ten months.      Nevertheless, in the spring of 2001, the\n\ncompany did appoint a director to head the Human Resources unit;\n\nDressler kept his title and pay but no longer headed the unit.\n\nWhen financial reverses struck the company a few months later,\n\nthere was a major companywide reduction in force and Dressler\n\nlost his job while the new Human Resources director was retained.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f     Dressler filed suit against the company under the FMLA.\n\nAfter discovery, the company moved for summary judgment.                 An\n\nextensive opinion granting summary judgment to the company was\n\nentered, 275 F. Supp. 2d 17 (D. Me. 2003), and Dressler now\n\nappeals.\n\n     Although Dressler's claims have varied during the course of\n\nthe case, on appeal the issues have been narrowed.            Dressler now\n\ncomplains not about his ultimate discharge but rather about the\n\ncompany's decision to bring in a division chief over Dressler's\n\nhead or, if the position was to be created at all, the company's\n\nfailure to name Dressler to this position.             Under the FMLA, an\n\nemployee is entitled to be restored to his or her former position\n\nor an equivalent one after returning from FMLA leave, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2614(a)(1), and an employer is prohibited from interfering with\n\nthis right, id. § 2615(a)(1).       The FMLA also contains a ban on\n\nretaliating against an employee for exercising his or her rights,\n\nid. §§ 2615(a)(2), 2615(b); 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c), but Dressler\n\nno longer relies upon a retaliation theory.\n\n     The evidence surrounding the decision to install a new\n\ndivision chief for the Human Resources unit is complicated and is\n\ndescribed    in   considerable   detail     in   the    district    court's\n\ndecision.    275 F. Supp. 2d at 19-21.       Although the prospect of\n\nDressler's   taking   further    extended   leave      may   have   prompted\n\nRoberts to consider the possibility of such a position, there was\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fextensive       evidence       that   by   the     spring    of     2001,     Dressler's\n\nperformance       in     the    company      had    deteriorated          (there     were\n\ncomplaints from other managers); the company was also creating a\n\nnumber     of    new    division      directors,      during      the     same   period,\n\nrequiring the managers to report to those new chiefs; and the\n\ncompany was independently interested in expanding the capability\n\nof   the        Human    Resources         unit     to      include       a    so-called\n\n\"organizational         development\"       function–-a        set    of     skills   that\n\nDressler did not fully possess.                    There were thus substantial\n\nreasons for the company to introduce a new director, other than\n\nDressler, to head the division.\n\n     We will assume that Dressler, even though restored to his\n\noriginal title and salary, was not fully restored to his old\n\nposition because that position had once included the leadership\n\nof the Human Resources unit which was now in the hands of the\n\ndirector.        Nevertheless, the obligation to restore an employee\n\nwho has taken leave is qualified; if a change in position would\n\nhave occurred regardless of whether the employee took leave, the\n\nFMLA does not protect him against such change.                              29 U.S.C. §\n\n2614(a)(3)(B); 29 C.F.R. § 825.216(a).\n\n     In substance, the district court ruled that a director of\n\nthe unit would have been appointed regardless of whether Dressler\n\nhad taken leave and that, due to the judgments about Dressler's\n\nperformance and his lack of organizational development skills,\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fthat person would not have been Dressler.           275 F. Supp. 2d at 24-\n\n25.     The question for us is whether the district court was\n\nentitled to reach this conclusion at the summary judgment stage,\n\nfinding the evidence so one-sided that no material issue of\n\ndisputed fact was posed for a jury.\n\n        We have considered the same evidence, reviewed the matter de\n\nnovo and drawn all reasonable inferences in Dressler's favor.\n\nJoyal    v.   Hasbro,   Inc.,   380    F.3d   14,   16   (1st   Cir.   2004).\n\nNevertheless, we agree with the district court's evaluation. The\n\npossibility that Dressler would need considerable FMLA leave in\n\n2001 may have played a role in prompting Roberts to consider the\n\nneed for a director.      But directors were named in various other\n\ndepartments as well; Dressler only took minimal FMLA leave after\n\nDecember 2000; and the independent reasons for appointing a Human\n\nResources director other than Dressler were substantial and\n\nsufficient to explain the decision.            No reasonable jury could\n\nhave found otherwise.\n\n        Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
