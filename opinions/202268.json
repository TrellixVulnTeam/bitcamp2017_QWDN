Akin Onikoyi has petitioned for\n\nreview of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals denying\n\nhis   applications    for   adjustment      of     status   and    waiver     of\n\ninadmissibility.     He has also filed a motion for a stay of his\n\nvoluntary     departure   period.     We    conclude    that      we   have   no\n\njurisdiction to consider the merits of Onikoyi's petition for\n\nreview, given the discretionary nature of the underlying decisions\n\nof the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals.                 We\n\nalso deny his motion for a stay of his voluntary departure period.\n\nWe reject his argument that we have the authority to reinstate the\n\nvoluntary departure period after the expiration of the initial\n\nvoluntary departure period.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Onikoyi is a citizen of Nigeria who first entered the\n\nUnited States with his wife in 1981 and overstayed his visa.                  He\n\nwas deported under an alias in 1986 and later illegally reentered\n\nthe United States.     Onikoyi then applied for adjustment of status\n\nunder the government's amnesty program.             He did not inform the\n\nImmigration    and   Naturalization      Service    (\"INS\")1   that     he    had\n\npreviously been deported, which would have signaled that he was\n\nineligible for adjustment of status. On December 14, 1990, the INS\n\n\n1\n On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an agency within the\nDepartment of Justice. Its enforcement functions were transferred\nto the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), pursuant to §§ 441\nand 471 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296,\n116 Stat. 2135.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fadjusted Onikoyi's status to that of a lawful permanent resident.\n\n             In 1993, Onikoyi was arrested for theft.                      The arrest\n\nalerted the INS that he had previously been deported under an\n\nalias.    He was charged and convicted of illegal reentry.                   In 1994,\n\nthe   INS    issued    an    Order     to    Show    Cause      charging    him     with\n\ndeportability based on the conviction and his illegal status.\n\n             While the deportation proceedings were pending, Onikoyi's\n\nwife became a citizen.           She filed a I-130 spousal petition on his\n\nbehalf so that he could seek adjustment of status.                         During his\n\ndeportation hearing, Onikoyi applied for adjustment of status,\n\ndiscretionary waiver of inadmissibility, and, in the alternative,\n\nvoluntary departure.         In 2004, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied\n\nhis     applications      for    adjustment        of   status     and     waiver     of\n\ninadmissibility as a matter of discretion, emphasizing that Onikoyi\n\nhad deceived government officials on several occasions and that the\n\nequities     were   not     in   his   favor.        The   IJ    granted    voluntary\n\ndeparture.\n\n             Onikoyi appealed the IJ's decision to the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\").           On August 25, 2005, the BIA adopted\n\nand affirmed the IJ's decision.                   Onikoyi filed a petition for\n\nreview and a motion for a stay of deportation on September 23,\n\n2005.       The motion for a stay of deportation was denied.                          On\n\nSeptember 29, 2005, he filed a renewed motion for a stay of\n\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fdeportation and, for the first time, a motion for a stay of his\n\nvoluntary departure period.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.    Jurisdiction\n\n            We begin by addressing the statutory provisions governing\n\nour   jurisdiction   in   this     case.      When   Onikoyi's   proceedings\n\ncommenced in 1994, judicial review was governed by former § 106(a)\n\nof the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. 1105a(a)\n\n(1994).    During the pendency of Onikoyi's proceedings, however,\n\nCongress enacted two laws affecting our jurisdiction over claims\n\nraised in immigration petitions.            In 1996, Congress enacted the\n\nIllegal    Immigration    Reform    and     Immigrant   Responsibility   Act\n\n(\"IIRIRA\"), repealing INA § 106(a).          IIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208,\n\n§ 306(b), 110 Stat. 3009.          In deportation proceedings commenced\n\nprior to IIRIRA's effective date, April 1, 1997, IIRIRA applied\n\n\"transitional rules,\" which also narrowed the scope of judicial\n\nreview.    See IIRIRA § 309(c); Ruckbi v. INS, 159 F.3d 18, 20-21\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (describing transitional rules cases).              Because\n\nOnikoyi's proceedings commenced in 1994, the transitional rules\n\napplied to his case.      See Ruckbi, 159 F.3d at 21.\n\n            However, in 2005, Congress enacted the REAL ID Act, Pub.\n\nL. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231.         Section 106(d) of the REAL ID Act\n\nstates:\n\n            A petition for       review filed under former\n            section  106(a)       of  the  Immigration and\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           Nationality Act (as in effect before its\n           repeal by section 306(b) of the Illegal\n           Immigration      Reform    and      Immigrant\n           Responsibility Act of 1996 . . . ) shall be\n           treated as if it had been filed as a petition\n           for   review  under   section   242   of  the\n           Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.\n           1252), as amended by this section.\n\nThus, under the REAL ID Act, transitional rules cases are now\n\nsubject to the jurisdictional rules currently codified in 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252.    See Elia v. Gonzales, 431 F.3d 268, 272-73 (6th Cir.\n\n2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 2019 (2006).        We proceed on that\n\nbasis.\n\nB.   Onikoyi's Claims\n\n           Onikoyi   raises   two   issues   on   appeal.   First,   he\n\nchallenges the denials of his applications for adjustment of status\n\nand waiver of inadmissibility.        Second, he seeks a stay of his\n\nvoluntary departure period. We address each issue in turn. \"Where\n\nthe BIA deferred to or adopted the IJ's reasons for denying [the\n\npetitioner's] claims, we review those portions of the IJ's decision\n\nas part of the final decision of the BIA.\"        Hernandez-Barrera v.\n\nAshcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).\n\n           1.   Adjustment of Status and Waiver of Inadmissibility\n\n           We do not have jurisdiction to review the discretionary\n\ndenial of adjustment of status or waiver of inadmissibility.         8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (stating that \"no court shall have\n\njurisdiction to review . . . any judgment regarding the granting of\n\nrelief under [INA's provisions regarding discretionary waiver of\n\n                                    -5-\n\finadmissibility         and   adjustment      of    status]\").         We    do   have\n\njurisdiction    to      review    whether     an    applicant     is       statutorily\n\nineligible for discretionary relief, see Singh v. Gonzales, 413\n\nF.3d 156, 160 & n.4 (1st Cir. 2005), and other \"constitutional\n\nclaims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review,\" 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).\n\n           Onikoyi attempts to cast the arguments in his petition\n\nfor review as questions of law, rather than challenges to the IJ's\n\ndiscretionary determinations in his case.                He argues that the IJ\n\nfound him statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief and that\n\nshe   \"erred   as   a    matter   of   law\"    by   denying     him    a    waiver   of\n\ninadmissibility, determining that he had not demonstrated extreme\n\nhardship to his citizen spouse and children and finding no other\n\nfavorable equities in his case.\n\n           Onikoyi mischaracterizes the IJ's opinion.                      The IJ made\n\nclear, for each form of discretionary relief she was denying, that\n\nher decision was based on her exercise of discretion.                       The IJ did\n\nnot conclude that Onikoyi was statutorily ineligible for a waiver\n\nof inadmissibility or adjustment of status.                      Instead, the IJ\n\nweighed the equities and explained that \"[w]hen a person has the\n\ntype of criminal history that [Onikoyi] has and the tendency to lie\n\nto authorities whenever possible, [relief] should not be granted to\n\nhim in the proper exercise of this [c]ourt's discretion.\" Although\n\nthe IJ considered Onikoyi's arguments regarding family hardship,\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe IJ concluded that Onikoyi \"continued to defraud the United\n\nStates, and I haven't heard any excuse . . . .                      [A]ccordingly,\n\nrespondent's application for adjustment of status, the [] waiver,\n\nand   permission   to   return    to    the       United    States    after   being\n\npreviously deported are all hereby denied.\"                 The BIA adopted and\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision to deny his applications for relief \"as\n\na matter of discretion.\"         Thus, we do not have jurisdiction to\n\nreview the BIA's affirmance of the discretionary decision of the IJ\n\nin this case.\n\n           2.   Voluntary Departure\n\n           In its August 25, 2005 decision, the BIA granted Onikoyi\n\nthirty days to voluntarily depart following the issuance of its\n\norder.   Onikoyi did not depart during this time period.                   He filed\n\na timely petition for review, but did not request a stay of his\n\nvoluntary departure period until September 29, 2005, after the\n\nexpiration of his voluntary departure period.\n\n           In   cases   commenced      on    or    after    April    1,   1997,   the\n\neffective date of the enactment of the IIRIRA, we may suspend a\n\nvoluntary departure period only if the petitioner moves for the\n\nsuspension before the expiration of the initial voluntary departure\n\nperiod. See Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 268 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThis requirement was formulated in response to IIRIRA's amendments\n\nto the voluntary departure statute and the elimination of judicial\n\nreview of voluntary departure decisions.              Id.    As we explained,\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f          The IIRIRA materially changed the ground rules\n          for voluntary departure by stripping the\n          courts of appeals of jurisdiction to review\n          BIA decisions as to whether to grant voluntary\n          departure and, if so, for how long.\n          . . . .\n          [Post-IIRIRA,] an expired voluntary departure\n          period cannot be resuscitated retroactively.\n          After the period has elapsed, there is nothing\n          to suspend and any court order purporting to\n          toll an expired period of voluntary departure\n          would have the effect of creating a new\n          voluntary departure period. Under the IIRIRA,\n          that is impermissible.\n\nId. at 265, 268. (citations omitted).    We further held that the\n\npetitioner \"must ask explicitly for a stay of voluntary departure;\n\na motion that prays only for a stay of removal will not suffice.\"\n\nId. at 268.\n\n          Onikoyi did not seek to stay or suspend his voluntary\n\ndeparture period until after the period had expired.   Thus, in a\n\npost-IIRIRA world, where judicial review over voluntary departure\n\nperiods is eliminated, we would have no power to suspend or\n\nreinstate his voluntary departure period.    However, in a motion\n\nfiled after the briefs were submitted in this case, Onikoyi argues\n\nthat we may still consider his request because his deportation\n\nproceedings were commenced prior to the effective date of IIRIRA.\n\nThus, he argues that the pre-IIRIRA voluntary departure statute2\n\n\n2\n Along with its restrictions on judicial review and other changes,\nIIRIRA amended the voluntary departure statute through several new\nprovisions, including a limitation on the length of time during\nwhich a person may be permitted to depart voluntarily at the\n\n                               -8-\n\fand the IIRIRA's transitional rules apply.              Under those standards,\n\nwe had jurisdiction to review voluntary departure decisions and\n\ncould reinstate a period of voluntary departure if the petitioner's\n\nappeal \"was neither obviously meritless nor apparently interposed\n\nsolely for purposes of delay\" and \"the government does not suggest\n\n. . . any other reason for refusing the reinstatement.\"                 Umanzor-\n\nAlvarado    v.   INS,   896   F.2d   14,    16   (1st   Cir.    1990)   (emphasis\n\nomitted).    Onikoyi argues that he is entitled to an extension or\n\nreinstatement of his voluntary departure period under the pre-\n\nIIRIRA standards.\n\n            However, as we discussed above, the REAL ID Act ensures\n\nthat the restrictions on judicial review currently codified in 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252 apply to transitional rules cases.                  See Elia, 431\n\nF.3d at 272-73. Among those restrictions is the elimination of our\n\njurisdiction to review voluntary departure determinations.                       8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). Thus, the logic of Bocova applies here.\n\nSee Bocova, 412 F.3d at 266-68.             Without jurisdiction to review\n\nvoluntary    departure    determinations,         \"we   no     longer   have   the\n\nauthority . . . either to fashion a new voluntary departure period\n\n\n\nconclusion of his or her removal proceedings.      See 8 U.S.C. §\n1229c(b)(2)(\"Permission to depart voluntarily under this subsection\nshall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\"); see also 8\nC.F.R. § 1240.26(f).    IIRIRA also increased the penalties for\nfailing to depart voluntarily within the specified period. See 8\nU.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1) (imposing a ten-year bar to certain forms of\nrelief from removal and a civil penalty ranging from $ 1,000 to $\n5,000).\n\n                                      -9-\n\for to reinstate an expired one.\" Id. at 266.   We therefore deny\n\nOnikoyi's motion to stay his expired voluntary departure period.\n\n                              III.\n\n          The petition for review and the motion to stay the\n\npetitioner's voluntary departure period are denied.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

We do have jurisdiction to review whether an applicant is statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief, <i>see Singh v.

The IJ made clear, for each form of discretionary relief she was denying, that her decision was based on her exercise of discretion. The IJ did not conclude that Onikoyi was statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility or adjustment of status. Instead, the IJ weighed the equities and explained that \"[w]hen a person has the type of criminal history that [Onikoyi] has and the tendency to lie to authorities whenever possible, [relief] should not be granted to him in the proper exercise of this [c]ourt's discretion.\" Although the IJ considered Onikoyi's arguments regarding family hardship, the IJ concluded that Onikoyi \"continued to defraud the United States, and I haven't heard any excuse . . . . [A]ccordingly, respondent's application for adjustment of status, the [ ] waiver, and permission to return to the United States after being previously deported are all hereby denied.\" The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision to deny his applications for relief \"as a matter of discretion.\" Thus, we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA's affirmance of the discretionary decision of the IJ in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Voluntary Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its August 25, 2005 decision, the BIA granted Onikoyi thirty days to voluntarily depart following the issuance of its order. Onikoyi did not depart during this time period. He filed a timely petition for review, but did not request a stay of his voluntary departure period until September 29, 2005, after the expiration of his voluntary departure period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases commenced on or after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the enactment of the IIRIRA, we may suspend a voluntary departure period only if the petitioner moves for the suspension before the expiration of the initial voluntary departure period. <i>See Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 268 (1st Cir.2005). This requirement was formulated in response to IIRIRA's amendments to the voluntary departure statute and the elimination of judicial review of voluntary departure decisions. <i>Id.</i> As we explained,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IIRIRA materially changed the ground rules for voluntary departure by stripping the courts of appeals of jurisdiction to review BIA decisions as to whether to grant voluntary departure and, if so, for how long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Post-IIRIRA,] an expired voluntary departure period cannot be resuscitated retroactively. After the period has elapsed, there is nothing to suspend and any court order purporting to toll an expired period of voluntary departure would have the effect of creating a new voluntary departure period. Under the IIRIRA, that is impermissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 265, 268. (citations omitted). We further held that the petitioner \"must ask explicitly for a stay of voluntary departure; a motion that prays only for a stay of removal will not suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 268.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Onikoyi did not seek to stay or suspend his voluntary departure period until after the period had expired. Thus, in a post-IIRIRA world, where judicial review over voluntary departure periods is eliminated, we would have no power to suspend or reinstate his voluntary departure period. However, in a motion filed after the briefs were submitted in this case, Onikoyi argues that we may still consider his request because his deportation proceedings were commenced prior to the effective date of IIRIRA. Thus, he argues that the pre-IIRIRA voluntary departure statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the IIRIRA's transitional rules apply. Under those standards, we had jurisdiction to review voluntary departure decisions and could reinstate a period of voluntary departure if the petitioner's appeal \"was neither obviously meritless nor apparently interposed solely for purposes of delay\" and \"the government does not suggest . . . any other reason for refusing the reinstatement.\" <i>Umanzor-Alvarado v. INS,</i> 896 F.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis omitted). Onikoyi argues that he is entitled to an extension or reinstatement of his voluntary departure period under the pre-IIRIRA standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as we discussed above, the REAL ID Act ensures that the restrictions on judicial review currently codified in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252 apply to transitional rules cases. <i>See Elia,</i> 431 F.3d at 272-73. Among those restrictions is the elimination of our jurisdiction to review voluntary departure determinations. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). Thus, the logic of <i>Bocova</i> applies here. <i>See Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 266-68. Without jurisdiction to review voluntary departure determinations, \"we no longer have the authority . . . either to fashion a new voluntary departure period or to reinstate an expired one.\" <i>Id.</i> at 266.

We conclude that we have no jurisdiction to consider the merits of Onikoyi's petition for review, given the discretionary nature of the underlying decisions of the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals.

He was deported under an alias in 1986 and later illegally reentered the United States. Onikoyi then applied for adjustment of status under the government's amnesty program. He did not inform the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that he had previously been deported, which would have signaled that he was ineligible for adjustment of status. On December 14, 1990, the INS adjusted Onikoyi's status to that of a lawful permanent resident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Onikoyi was arrested for theft. The arrest alerted the INS that he had previously been deported under an alias. He was charged and convicted of illegal reentry. In 1994, the INS issued an Order to Show Cause charging him with deportability based on the conviction and his illegal status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the deportation proceedings were pending, Onikoyi's wife became a citizen. She filed a I-130 spousal petition on his behalf so that he could seek adjustment of status. During his deportation hearing, Onikoyi applied for adjustment of status, discretionary waiver of inadmissibility, and, in the alternative, voluntary departure. In 2004, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied his applications for adjustment of status and waiver of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion, emphasizing that Onikoyi had deceived government officials on several occasions and that the equities were not in his favor. The IJ granted voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Onikoyi appealed the IJ's decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). On August 25, 2005, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision. Onikoyi filed a petition for review and a motion for a stay of deportation on September 23, 2005. The motion for a stay of deportation was denied. On September 29, 2005, he filed a renewed motion for a stay of deportation and, for the first time, a motion for a stay of his voluntary departure period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

We further held that the petitioner \"must ask explicitly for a stay of voluntary departure; a motion that prays only for a stay of removal will not suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 268.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Onikoyi did not seek to stay or suspend his voluntary departure period until after the period had expired. Thus, in a post-IIRIRA world, where judicial review over voluntary departure periods is eliminated, we would have no power to suspend or reinstate his voluntary departure period. However, in a motion filed after the briefs were submitted in this case, Onikoyi argues that we may still consider his request because his deportation proceedings were commenced prior to the effective date of IIRIRA. Thus, he argues that the pre-IIRIRA voluntary departure statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the IIRIRA's transitional rules apply. Under those standards, we had jurisdiction to review voluntary departure decisions and could reinstate a period of voluntary departure if the petitioner's appeal \"was neither obviously meritless nor apparently interposed solely for purposes of delay\" and \"the government does not suggest . . . any other reason for refusing the reinstatement.\" <i>Umanzor-Alvarado v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536518\"><a href=\"/opinion/536518/florentin-umanzor-alvarado-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis omitted). Onikoyi argues that he is entitled to an extension or reinstatement of his voluntary departure period under the pre-IIRIRA standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as we discussed above, the REAL ID Act ensures that the restrictions on judicial review currently codified in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252 apply to transitional rules cases. <i>See Elia,</i> 431 F.3d at 272-73. Among those restrictions is the elimination of our jurisdiction to review voluntary departure determinations. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). Thus, the logic of <i>Bocova</i> applies here. <i>See Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 266-68. Without jurisdiction to review voluntary departure determinations, \"we no longer have the authority . . . either to fashion a new voluntary departure period or to reinstate an expired one.\" <i>Id.</i> at 266. We therefore deny Onikoyi's motion to stay his expired voluntary departure period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review and the motion to stay the petitioner's voluntary departure period are <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an agency within the Department of Justice.
