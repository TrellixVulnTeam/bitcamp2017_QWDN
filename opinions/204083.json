GONZÁLEZ-VÉLEZ,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n     [Hon. Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. Senior District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     María H. Sandoval, for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief,\nAppellate Division, and Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States\nAttorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        November ##, 2009\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.        In this appeal, defendant-\n\nappellant Rafael A. González-Vélez (\"González-Vélez\") challenges\n\nhis sentence following his conviction for participating in a\n\nconspiracy   to   distribute    narcotics.      The   135-month   sentence\n\ncurrently on appeal was imposed on re-sentencing after a previous\n\ndecision by this court, in which we affirmed the appellant's\n\nconviction but vacated his sentence due to the sentencing court's\n\nfailure to make an individualized drug quantity determination. See\n\nUnited States v. González-Vélez, 466 F.3d 27 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nAfter   careful   consideration,    we   affirm   the   appellant's   new\n\nsentence.\n\n                           I.    Background\n\n            As discussed in our prior opinion, the facts underlying\n\nthis appeal arise from an investigation of the drug point known as\n\n\"Las Malvinas\" in the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project in Puerto\n\nRico.   José Luis Rivera González, a/k/a \"Luis Lloréns,\" (\"Luis\n\nLloréns\") ran the drug point from 2000 until his death in 2002.\n\nThe FBI and the Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\") investigated\n\nthe drug point between the summer of 2001 and October 2002.           The\n\ninvestigation resulted in a grand jury indictment against nine\n\nindividuals, including the appellant.        González-Vélez was charged\n\nwith one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances,\n\nincluding powder cocaine, cocaine base, heroin, and marijuana, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. González-Vélez's role in the charged\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fconspiracy was that of a wholesale supplier of drugs, particularly\n\npowder cocaine, to the drug point.\n\n            González-Vélez was tried jointly with José A. Ramos-\n\nRomero (\"Ramos\"), a processor of drugs at Las Malvinas.                            In\n\naddition    to   asking   the   jury    to     render    a   verdict   as    to    the\n\ndefendants' participation in the conspiracy, the judge also gave\n\nthe jury a special verdict form asking it to decide whether or not\n\nthe amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy was at least five\n\nkilograms.       The jury found González-Vélez and Ramos guilty of\n\nconspiracy, and also found that the amount of cocaine in the\n\nconspiracy was at least five kilograms.\n\n            On   December   23,    2004,       the   district     court     held    a\n\nsentencing hearing for González-Vélez.                  The Pre-Sentence Report\n\n(\"PSR\") recommended a Base Offense Level (\"BOL\") of 32, based on\n\nthe jury's finding that the drug quantity in the conspiracy was at\n\nleast five kilograms.       The district court adopted this reasoning\n\nand assigned a BOL of 32.        González-Vélez had argued to the court\n\nthat   it    needed   to    make       an     individualized     drug       quantity\n\ndetermination, but the court concluded that drug quantity was a\n\nmatter reserved to the jury, and that the jury had rendered a\n\nsufficient finding.\n\n            González-Vélez also objected to the PSR on the ground\n\nthat he was entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E.1. After the verdict and before\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe   December    23,    2004    sentencing      hearing,   González-Vélez      had\n\nsubmitted    to    the    court      a     written   statement      admitting    to\n\nparticipating in the sale of drugs at the Lloréns Torres housing\n\nproject, stating that he was sorry for the damage he had done to\n\nsociety and to his family, and explaining that he had gone to trial\n\nonly because the drug amount with which he was being charged\n\noverstated his role in the conspiracy.               The probation officer who\n\nprepared the PSR recommended that the adjustment not be granted\n\nbecause González-Vélez had gone to trial and because González-Vélez\n\nhad indicated in an interview with the probation officer that he\n\nthought the government had a weak case.                The court accepted the\n\nprobation officer's view and denied the adjustment, noting that\n\nGonzález-Vélez \"went to trial at his own choice, with adequate\n\ncounsel,\" and saying that it would not \"take into consideration\"\n\nthe fact that the pre-trial plea negotiations were \"not fruitful.\"\n\nBased on a BOL of 32 and a criminal history category of I, the\n\napplicable    Sentencing        Guidelines       sentence   range    (\"GSR\")    was\n\ncalculated   to   be     121    to   151   months'   imprisonment;     the     court\n\nsentenced González-Vélez to 135 months.                 González-Vélez timely\n\nappealed.\n\n            In his first appeal, González-Vélez challenged both his\n\nconviction and his sentence.                 In challenging his conviction,\n\nGonzález-Vélez argued, inter alia, that the judge erred in asking\n\nthe jury to render a special verdict as to the conspiracy-wide\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fcocaine amount.      Instead, González-Vélez argued, the judge should\n\nhave asked the jury to render special verdicts as to the amount of\n\ncocaine each defendant handled individually.              González-Vélez did\n\nnot challenge the jury's finding that the conspiracy involved at\n\nleast five kilograms of cocaine.             In challenging his sentence,\n\nGonzález-Vélez argued that the district court should have made an\n\nindividualized drug quantity determination for sentencing purposes.\n\n              In our decision in González-Velez's first appeal, we\n\nupheld his conviction, but vacated the sentence and remanded the\n\ncase for re-sentencing.         As to the conviction for conspiracy, we\n\nheld   that    the   court's    instruction    to   the   jury    to    find   the\n\nconspiracy-wide amount of cocaine did not constitute error because\n\nthe conspiracy-wide amount was a factor in sentencing, rather than\n\na factor in conviction.1         González-Vélez, 466 F.3d at 36.            As to\n\nthe sentence, however, we held that the district court's failure to\n\nmake an individualized finding as to drug quantity was reversible\n\nerror.    Id. at 38.          We noted that in a conspiracy case, the\n\ndistrict court can rely on the conspiracy-wide drug quantity\n\ndetermination,       rather    than   an    individualized       drug    quantity\n\ndetermination, for the \"statutory maximum penalty.\"                     Id. at 36\n\n(emphasis added).      Specifically, we noted that any sentence longer\n\n\n1\n  González-Vélez also challenged his conviction on the ground that\nthere was insufficient evidence of his participation in the\nconspiracy.   We rejected this argument, noting that there was\nabundant evidence in the record of González-Vélez's participation\nin the conspiracy. Id. at 37-38.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthan the maximum corresponding to the conspiracy-wide amount could\n\ntrigger review under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),\n\nand Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), which require a\n\njury to make an individualized factual finding for any element that\n\nincreases a sentence beyond the statutory maximum. González-Vélez,\n\n466   F.3d   at   36-37.   In   González-Vélez's   case,   however,   the\n\nsentencing court relied on the jury's conspiracy-wide drug quantity\n\ndetermination to calculate the actual sentence (by using the\n\nconspiracy-wide quantity to compute the BOL), rather than the\n\nmaximum sentence.     We found that this contravened our holding in\n\nUnited States v. Colón-Solís that \"when a district court determines\n\ndrug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant convicted\n\nof participating in a drug trafficking conspiracy, the court is\n\nrequired to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts\n\nattributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.\" United States\n\nv. Colón-Solís, 354 F.3d 101, 103 (1st Cir. 2004), quoted in\n\nGonzález-Vélez, 466 F.3d at 38.      In reaching this conclusion, we\n\nfurther specified that \"all of the drugs in a conspiracy may not be\n\nautomatically assigned to an individual defendant.\"        Id. (emphasis\n\nadded) (citing United States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1197 (1st\n\nCir. 1993)).\n\n             Because of the sentencing error, we remanded the matter\n\nof González-Vélez's sentence \"for an individualized determination\n\nof drug quantity attributable to [González-Vélez].\"          Id. at 41.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fHowever, \"[w]ith respect to all other matters, we affirm[ed] the\n\ndistrict court.\"     Id. (emphasis added).\n\n            Upon remand for re-sentencing, the district court held a\n\npre-sentence hearing on March 27, 2007, where new evidence bearing\n\non drug quantity was presented, followed by a sentencing hearing on\n\nJuly 12, 2007, where legal arguments were made and a new sentence\n\nrendered by the court.         The same judge who had presided over\n\nGonzález-Vélez's criminal trial also presided over the new round of\n\npre-sentence and sentencing hearings. At the pre-sentence hearing,\n\nthe court advised González-Vélez that the case had been remanded by\n\nthe appeals court for the sole purpose of making an individualized\n\ndrug quantity determination and that the prior objections to the\n\nPSR   had   been   addressed   at   the    original   sentencing    hearing.\n\nGonzález-Vélez nevertheless renewed his request for a two-level\n\ndownward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.              The court\n\nultimately concluded, based on its examination of the sentencing\n\nmemoranda and the evidence presented during the trial and the\n\nvarious     sentencing   hearings,     that    González-Vélez      \"handled,\n\nanticipated handling, or could reasonably foresee the possession\n\nwith intent to distribute of more than five but less than 15 kilos\n\nof cocaine,\" and explained its reasons for the determination.             As\n\nbefore, that determination corresponded with a BOL of 32, which in\n\nturn resulted in a GSR of 121 to 151 months' imprisonment.               The\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fcourt again selected the 135-month sentence previously imposed.\n\nGonzález-Vélez now appeals this sentence.\n\n           As González-Vélez's main argument on appeal challenges\n\nthe district court's individualized drug quantity determination for\n\nsentencing purposes, we summarize the evidence in the record\n\nrelevant thereto.\n\nA. Testimony of Ángel Obregón\n\n           One of the government's key witnesses at both González-\n\nVélez's criminal trial and at the pre-sentence hearing was Ángel\n\nObregón (\"Obregón\").   Obregón testified at the March 27, 2007 pre-\n\nsentence hearing that he worked under Luis Lloréns at Las Malvinas.\n\nObregón testified about drug sales at Las Malvinas in various\n\nproceedings: before the Grand Jury in 2003, at González-Vélez's\n\ncriminal trial, and at the March 27, 2007 pre-sentence hearing. At\n\nthe criminal trial and before the grand jury, Obregón indicated\n\nthat there were at least four retail drug sellers at the drug\n\npoint.   Obregón also testified at the trial that Luis Lloréns told\n\nhim that the drug point sold 1/8 kg of cocaine per week.    Obregón\n\ntestified at the pre-sentence hearing that he saw González-Vélez at\n\nthe drug point \"almost everyday,\" and that whenever González-Vélez\n\ncame to the drug point, Luis Lloréns would pay González-Vélez with\n\nmoney from drug sales at the drug point.\n\n           Obregón testified about González-Vélez's cocaine sales to\n\nLuis Lloréns a total of six times in various proceedings.   On each\n\n\n                                -8-\n\foccasion he was asked in what quantity González-Vélez sold cocaine\n\nto Luis Lloréns.       On the first occasion, before the Grand Jury in\n\n2003, Obregón said González-Vélez provided one-eighth kilogram\n\nquantities (\"eighths\").          However, in later proceedings, Obregón\n\ntestified that González-Vélez supplied cocaine in both eighths and\n\none-half    kilogram    (\"half\")    quantities.       Furthermore,        at   the\n\ncriminal    trial,     Obregón    admitted    that   he    did    not   know   the\n\ndifference between an eighth, a half, and one kilogram of cocaine.\n\nObregón also gave inconsistent testimony about how many times he\n\nsaw González-Vélez sell cocaine to Luis Lloréns.                  At the trial,\n\nObregón initially said he did not remember how many sales he\n\nwitnessed.    Later, he said he saw more than 10 sales.            Later still,\n\nhe testified that he had only seen González-Vélez sell drugs \"a\n\ncouple of times.\"\n\n            At the March 27, 2007 pre-sentence hearing, on cross-\n\nexamination by González-Vélez's counsel, Obregón admitted that he\n\nhad   an   extensive    history    of   violent   crimes    and    that   he   was\n\ncooperating with the government.          Defense counsel also challenged\n\nObregón's credibility by pointing out that at the trial, Obregón\n\nsaid he did not know the difference between one eighth, one half,\n\nand one kilogram.        Obregón responded that he did know that an\n\neighth of a kilogram is less than one kilogram.              Obregón was also\n\nunable to correctly calculate his age, claiming he was 15 or 16 in\n\n1998 but that he was only 22 as of March 27, 2007.\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fB. Testimony of Héctor Luis Rivera-González\n\n            Héctor Luis Rivera-González (\"Rivera-González\") was the\n\nnephew of Luis Lloréns.       He testified at the March 27, 2007 pre-\n\nsentence hearing that he worked as a drug peddler at the drug point\n\nfor a total of 32 days, from April 8, 2002 until he was arrested\n\nfor robbery on May 10, 2002.     Rivera-González testified that while\n\nhe worked at the drug point, it was open every day and that it sold\n\ncocaine, crack, heroin, and marijuana.          He identified González-\n\nVélez as a wholesale supplier of drugs to the Las Malvinas drug\n\npoint.    Rivera-González said that González-Vélez sold cocaine to\n\nLuis Lloréns on credit. Rivera-González also said he saw González-\n\nVélez at the drug point twice a week.\n\n            Rivera-González    provided    certain   details   about   the\n\npackaging of cocaine.     The government asked him, \"specifically\n\nreferring to cocaine, powder cocaine,\" how cocaine was packaged and\n\nsold.    Rivera-González testified that Luis Lloréns would give him\n\n\"packages\" of powder cocaine containing 25 \"baggies\" each, which\n\nwould retail for $5 per \"baggie.\"         Rivera-González testified that\n\nhe sold \"five, six, or seven\" \"packages\" worth of cocaine per week.\n\nAfter asking Rivera-González about the packaging of cocaine, the\n\ngovernment asked, \"[W]hen you would sell cocaine at that drug\n\npoint, were you the only seller selling for your uncle at that drug\n\npoint at the time?\"   Rivera-González said that he was not the only\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fseller, and that \"three or four\" other people \"would sell for\" Luis\n\nLloréns at the drug point.\n\nC. Testimony of FBI Special Agent William Ortiz and Puerto Rico\nPolice Agent Héctor A. Orta-González.\n\n            FBI Special Agent William Ortiz (\"Ortiz\") and Puerto Rico\n\nPolice Agent Héctor A. Orta-González (\"Orta-González\") testified at\n\nthe March 27, 2007 pre-sentence hearing.          Both agents participated\n\nin the investigation into drug sales at Las Malvinas.               Agent Ortiz\n\ntestified that González-Vélez was one of four wholesale drug\n\nsuppliers    to   Las   Malvinas.      Both   agents    testified    that   they\n\nfrequently observed González-Vélez at the drug point.                On cross-\n\nexamination, both agents conceded that González-Vélez did not\n\nappear at all in the 730 hours of surveillance tape the FBI took at\n\nthe drug point.     However, Agent Orta testified that González-Vélez\n\nwould always enter the drug point through the rear entrance, where\n\nthere were no surveillance cameras.\n\nD. Recording By Jesús Samuel Matías-Cruz\n\n            Agent   Orta   also     testified   about    the   contents     of   a\n\nrecording secretly made by Jesús Samuel Matías-Cruz (\"Matías-\n\nCruz\"),     who worked for Luis Lloréns at the drug point.2               In the\n\nrecording, González-Vélez can be heard talking with Luis Lloréns\n\nabout the packaging and processing of cocaine, as well as about\n\nwhen Luis Lloréns would pay González-Vélez for cocaine the latter\n\n\n2\n   The recording itself was also part of the record before the\nsentencing court.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fhad supplied.     González-Vélez is also overheard saying that a pot\n\nthat was being used by one of Luis Lloréns's workers to \"cook\"\n\ncrack cocaine had broken.\n\nE. Other Evidence\n\n          The     judge   heard   González-Vélez's      allocution     at   the\n\nMarch 27, 2007 sentencing hearing.            González-Vélez stated that he\n\nhad always intended to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge, but\n\nthat he went to trial on the advice of his trial counsel because he\n\ncould not reach an agreement with the prosecution on the amount of\n\ndrugs he handled.     In order to explain his presence at Las Malvinas\n\nduring the period of the investigation, González-Vélez introduced\n\ninto evidence a certificate from the Puerto Rico Department of\n\nHousing and Public Administration showing that he was a resident of\n\nthe Lloréns Torres housing project from 1999 until 2003.\n\nF. Defendant's Sentencing Memo\n\n          On April 30, 2007, prior to the sentencing hearing,\n\nGonzález-Vélez filed a sentencing memorandum with the court.3\n\nGonzález-Vélez argued that the proper amount of cocaine that could\n\nbe attributed to him for sentencing purposes was one and five-\n\nsixteenth (15/16) kilograms.      He reached this number by multiplying\n\none-eighth   of   a   kilogram    --    the   lowest   amount   that   Obregón\n\ntestified to seeing González-Vélez sell to Luis Lloréns -- by ten\n\n\n3\n    González-Vélez submitted a second sentencing memorandum on\nMay 22, 2007 that expanded on the facts presented in the first memo\nand provided additional legal arguments.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f-- the maximum number of times Obregón said González-Vélez sold\n\ncocaine to Luis Lloréns -- and then adding the one-sixteenth of a\n\nkilogram amount mentioned in the recording by Matías-Cruz.                 Based\n\non this figure, González-Vélez argued that his BOL should be 26.\n\nG. The District Court's Sentence\n\n             The   district    court     held    the    sentencing    hearing    on\n\nJuly 13, 2007, wherein it recognized              its obligation, pursuant to\n\nthis Court's mandate, \"to make an individualized finding as to the\n\namount of drugs attributable to [González-Vélez] in the instant\n\noffense   of    conviction.\"      The    district      court   then   stated    its\n\ndetermination that González-Vélez \"handled, anticipated handling,\n\nor   could     reasonably     foresee    the     possession    with   intent     to\n\ndistribute . . . more than five but less than 15 kilos of cocaine,\"\n\nand proceeded to recount its reasons for that determination.                    The\n\ncourt first noted that evidence obtained from the drug point\n\nindicated that each \"baggie\" of cocaine sold at the point contained\n\none-tenth of a gram of cocaine.                Rivera-González testified that\n\neach \"package\" contained twenty five \"baggies,\" meaning that each\n\npackage contained 2.5 grams of cocaine. Based on Rivera-González's\n\ntestimony that he sold from five to seven \"packages\" per day, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that \"even using a conservative figure\n\n[Rivera-González] would distribute at least 35 packages a week,\"\n\nfor a total of 87.5 grams of cocaine.                  However, the court also\n\nnoted that both Rivera-González and Obregón testified that there\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fwere four to five sellers at the point.   Thus, the court held that\n\nthe \"evidence presented certainly corroborates the testimony of\n\nboth [Rivera-González] and Obregón that at least one eighth [of a\n\nkilogram, or 125 grams] of cocaine was sold\" per week at the drug\n\npoint.\n\n           The court then recounted the testimony of Agents Orta and\n\nOrtiz that they both observed González-Vélez at the drug point on\n\nmultiple occasions during the course of their investigation, which\n\nbegan in the summer of 2001 and was continuing until at least\n\nAugust of 2002.   The court also relied on the recording by Matías-\n\nCruz, in which González-Vélez is heard discussing retail drug sales\n\nand the breaking of the pot that was being used to cook crack\n\ncocaine.   The court noted that González-Vélez is heard saying that\n\nhe was waiting to be paid for an eighth of cocaine he had sold to\n\nLuis Lloréns.     Based on this evidence, the court found that\n\nGonzález-Vélez \"knew . . . the amount of drugs being distributed\n\nand/or could reasonably foresee that those amounts were being sold\n\nat the drug point supplied by him.\"    In reaching its conclusion,\n\nthe court also found that González-Vélez \"had extensive knowledge\n\nof the drug trafficking activities that took place at the Las\n\nMalvinas drug point.\"\n\n           In determining the proper guideline range, the court\n\nstated:\n\n           [T]he applicable case law indicates that in a\n           drug conspiracy the applicable statutory\n\n                                -14-\n\f              maximum imprisonment term is derived from a\n              conspiracy-wide perspective.    That does not\n              mean that the Defendant must have personally\n              handled the drugs for which he is being held\n              responsible. He could be held responsible for\n              relevant conduct, which could include the acts\n              of other conspiracy members, as long as their\n              conduct was reasonably foreseeable for the\n              Defendant.\n\nBased on its finding that González-Vélez knew how much cocaine was\n\nbeing sold at Las Malvinas, the court held that \"if at least one\n\neighth   of    cocaine   was   sold   every   week   during   the   ten   month\n\nconspiracy . . . [González-Vélez] should be held responsible for at\n\nleast five but not more than 15 kilos of cocaine.\"             When combined\n\nwith a Criminal History Category of I, the court explained, this\n\namount of cocaine triggered a BOL of 32 and a corresponding GSR of\n\n121 to 151 months.\n\n              The court then said that it had \"reviewed the applicable\n\nguideline adjustments\" and \"considered the other sentencing factors\n\nset forth in [18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)].\"          The court also stated that it\n\nfound the Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) to have \"adequately applied the\n\nGuideline computations and satisfactorily reflect[ed] components of\n\n[the] offense.\"      The court had previously held, at the March 27,\n\n2007 hearing, that since the PSR had not changed since the original\n\nsentence was handed down, any objections to the original report\n\nthat had already been ruled on were \"taken care of and ruled upon\n\nby the Court.\"     Ultimately, the court sentenced González-Vélez, as\n\nbefore, to 131 months.\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f                            II. Discussion\n\n           González-Vélez    makes   two   main   arguments   on   appeal.\n\nFirst, he argues that the district court committed reversible error\n\nin its drug quantity determination because the evidence does not\n\nsupport attributing five kilograms of cocaine to him.              Second,\n\nGonzález-Vélez argues that the district court erred in failing to\n\nstate its reasons for denying his request for a 2-level reduction\n\nfor   acceptance   of   responsibility.4     González-Vélez    does    not\n\nchallenge the jury's original finding that the conspiracy as a\n\nwhole involved at least five kilograms of cocaine.\n\n\n\n4\n  González-Vélez makes two additional arguments, neither of which\nmerits serious consideration.\n\n     First, he argues that the district court violated 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(c)(1) by failing to explain why it chose a BOL of 32.\nHowever, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1) does not require the court to\nexplain why it chose an offense level. Rather, once a court has\ndetermined a GSR based on the offense level, if the sentence range\nexceeds 24 months, § 3553(c)(1) requires the court to explain why\nit chose a particular sentence. Thus, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1) does\nnot come into play until after a decision is made on the\nappropriate offense level.\n\n     Second, González-Vélez argues that the district court\ncommitted a \"technical violation\" by not stating in Section IV(B)\nof the Statement of Reasons why it chose to impose a sentence in\nthe middle of the guideline range, and that this violation\nconstitutes reversible error. González-Vélez does not indicate how\nhe was prejudiced by this supposed \"technical violation\" in any\nway. Nor does he provide any support for his argument that this\nconstitutes reversible error. We therefore treat this argument as\nwaived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in\nthe most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work,\ncreate the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its\nbones.\").\n\n                                  -16-\n\fA.   Applicable Law and Standard of Review\n\n            A trial court's \"approximation of drug quantity will be\n\nupheld 'as long as it represents a reasoned estimate of quantity.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Huddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 224 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting United States v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\nSuch a determination need only be supported by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence.         Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1198.            Moreover, the drug\n\nquantity      determination    \"is     not     required      to     be    an     exact\n\ndetermination but rather only a reasoned estimate.\"                 United States\n\nv. Rodríguez, 525 F.3d 85, 107 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            However, as we explained in González-Vélez's previous\n\nappeal,    in    a    conspiracy   case,      the   sentencing      court      cannot\n\nautomatically assign the conspiracy-wide amount to a defendant.\n\nSee González-Vélez, 466 F.3d at 38.             Rather, the sentencing court\n\nmust   make     \"an     individualized       finding    as    to    drug       amounts\n\nattributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.\"                    Id. (quoting\n\nColón-Solís, 354 F.3d at 103).               When determining the amount of\n\ndrugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes, the\n\ndistrict court may examine the charged conduct plus the \"relevant\n\nuncharged conduct.\"       United States v. García, 954 F.2d 12, 15 (1st\n\nCir.   1992)     (internal     citations       omitted)      (emphasis         added).\n\n\"Relevant\"      uncharged    conduct    is    conduct    that      is    \"reasonably\n\nforeseeable by the defendant and committed in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.\"      Id.    \"'Thus, each co-conspirator is responsible not\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fonly for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount\n\nof drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within\n\nthe ambit of the conspiracy.'\" Rodríguez, 525 F.3d at 107 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n           We review the sentencing court's interpretation of the\n\nsentencing guideline de novo and its determination of facts for\n\nclear error.    United States v. Sicher, 576 F.3d 64, 70 (1st Cir.\n\n2009). The application of the guidelines is reviewed on a \"sliding\n\nscale\" between de novo review and clear error review \"depending on\n\nwhether the trial judge's conclusion is more law-oriented or more\n\nfact-driven.\"    Id. n.6.    Here, the application of the relevant\n\nsentencing guideline requires a drug quantity determination, which\n\nis a purely factual issue; therefore, it may only be set aside if\n\nit is clearly erroneous.    United States v. Olivero, 552 F.3d 34, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 2009); see also Santos, 357 F.3d at 141; United States v.\n\nSklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110-11 (1st Cir. 1990).   Under the clear error\n\nstandard, \"[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence,\n\nthe factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\"\n\nTsoulas v. Liberty Life Assur. Co., 454 F.3d 69, 76 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(quoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985)).\n\nB.   Drug Quantity Determination\n\n           In González-Vélez's previous appeal, this court vacated\n\nhis sentence and remanded to the district court with instructions\n\nto make an individualized finding as to whether he either \"handled\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f[or] anticipated handling\" five kilograms of cocaine or could\n\n\"reasonably foresee\" that the conspiracy would handle that amount.\n\nGonzález-Vélez, 466 F.3d at 38.   In the instant appeal, González-\n\nVélez argues that the district court again failed to properly carry\n\nout this obligation, and thus, clearly erred in basing his sentence\n\non the five kilogram conspiracy-wide amount. First, González-Vélez\n\nargues that the district court improperly relied upon the testimony\n\nof Obregón and Rivera-González in determining drug quantity, as\n\nthese witnesses lacked credibility.    Second, he argues that the\n\ncourt erred in its calculations underlying its drug quantity\n\ndetermination.   In particular, he argues that the court erred in\n\ncalculating both the drug amount he personally handled and the\n\namount of cocaine sold at Las Malvinas each week.      Finally, he\n\nargues that the district court wrongly concluded that he could\n\nreasonably foresee the full amount of cocaine distributed by the\n\nconspiracy.   We address these arguments in turn.\n\n          1. Credibility of Obregón and Rivera-González\n\n          First, González-Vélez argues that the district court\n\nerred in relying on the testimony of Obregón and Rivera-González as\n\nthe basis for its drug quantity determination because they were\n\nunreliable witnesses.   González-Vélez points out that Obregón gave\n\ninconsistent testimony both as to the number of times González-\n\nVélez sold cocaine to Luis Lloréns and as to the amount of cocaine\n\ninvolved in each sale.    González-Vélez also argues that Obregón\n\n\n                               -19-\n\flacked the intellectual capacity to be a reliable witness, as\n\nmanifested by his inability to calculate his own age. Furthermore,\n\nGonzález-Vélez argues that Obregón had a motive to lie because he\n\nwas a cooperating witness facing charges for involvement in the\n\nconspiracy, and that he was receiving payment for his testimony.\n\nFinally, González-Vélez points to Obregón's extensive criminal\n\nhistory.\n\n            As for Rivera-González, González-Vélez points out that\n\nRivera-González's testimony is based on his selling drugs at the\n\ndrug point for only 32 days.             Moreover, Rivera-González only\n\npersonally observed one sale by González-Vélez to Luis Lloréns; all\n\nof his other knowledge was hearsay testimony based on what Luis\n\nLloréns, who died in 2002, purportedly told him.\n\n            A district court has broad discretion to make credibility\n\njudgments relevant to sentencing.        See, e.g., Huddleston, 194 F.3d\n\nat 224; Webster, 54 F.3d at 5.      We will overturn a district court's\n\ncredibility determination only if \"we have a definite and firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\"              United States v.\n\nJones, 187 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     A   mistake   may   have   been   made   if   \"[d]ocuments   or\n\nobjective evidence . . . contradict the witness's story,\" or if the\n\nstory is \"'so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face\n\nthat a reasonable fact-finder would not credit it.'\" United States\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fv. Henderson, 463 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Anderson,\n\n470 U.S. at 575).\n\n          We find that \"[w]ithin wide limits, not exceeded here, it\n\nwas the exclusive role of the trial court to decide the weight to\n\ngive [Obregón and Rivera-González's] testimony and whether to use\n\nit as the basis of its drug quantity determination.\"     Rodríguez,\n\n525 F.3d at 108 (holding that sentencing court did not clearly err\n\nin relying on testimony of witness who was \"not especially exact in\n\nhis description of dates, times, weights, and numbers\").         We\n\nacknowledge that there are some internal inconsistencies in the\n\ntestimonies as to the number of times González-Vélez sold cocaine\n\nand the amount of cocaine González-Vélez sold each time.        In\n\nparticular, we note Obregón's inconsistent testimony about the\n\nquantity of drugs González-Vélez sold to Luis Lloréns.     However,\n\nthe judge, as the finder of fact at sentencing, was free to\n\ndisregard inconsistent portions of the testimony and credit the\n\nrelevant credible portions.   See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d\n\n183, 204 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating that fact-finders \"are not\n\nrequired to discard testimony that appears to contain internal\n\ninconsistencies, but may credit parts of a witness's testimony and\n\ndisregard other potentially contradictory portions\").\n\n          There is, moreover, a further distinction here.      The\n\nsentence in this case was not based on the amount of cocaine\n\nGonzález-Vélez individually handled.    Rather, the sentence was\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fbased on González-Vélez's ability to foresee the conspiracy-wide\n\namount of cocaine.          With respect to this aspect of the case,\n\nObregón's      and    Rivera-González's         testimonies     are        generally\n\nconsistent,     are   not   implausible    on     their    face,    and     are   not\n\ncontradicted by the other evidence in the record.                  Both witnesses\n\ntestified to seeing González-Vélez at the drug point frequently,\n\nand this testimony was corroborated by Agents Ortiz and Orta. Both\n\nwitnesses also testified that González-Vélez sold cocaine on credit\n\nto Luis Lloréns, which is something that González-Vélez himself\n\nadmits.    Furthermore, as we discuss in more detail below, Obregón\n\nand Rivera-González corroborated each other's testimony about the\n\namount of cocaine retailed at Las Malvinas.               Because the testimony\n\nof   Obregón   and    Rivera-González     was    consistent    as     to    the   two\n\nimportant factors in González-Vélez's sentence -- the conspiracy-\n\nwide amount, and the fact that González-Vélez could foresee that\n\namount -- we do not find the trial court's reliance on their\n\ntestimony to be \"unreasonable.\"           See Huddleston, 194 F.3d at 224\n\n(holding    that     \"[n]otwithstanding    some     minor     discrepancies        in\n\n[witness's] testimony, 'we do not think it unreasonable . . . to\n\nbelieve that the testimony of a man experienced in drug deals was\n\nsufficient to establish an appropriate drug quantity'\" (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 312-13 (1st Cir.                    1991)).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f           2. Calculations Underlying Drug Quantity Determination\n\n           González-Vélez next argues that even if the district\n\ncourt properly credited Obregón's testimony, it was obligated to\n\ncalculate the drug quantity attributable to González-Vélez using\n\nthe   lowest   amount   that   Obregón    said   González-Vélez    sold   per\n\ntransaction -- which was one-eighth of a kilogram.         González-Vélez\n\nrelies on the Third Circuit's decision in         United States v. Miele,\n\n989 F.2d 659 (3d Cir. 1993), in which that court remanded the case\n\nfor re-sentencing because of the lower court's failure to explain\n\nwhy, when deciding the defendant's sentence, it chose to rely on\n\nthe larger of two drug quantities testified to by a witness.              In\n\nthe present case, González-Vélez argues, the district court should\n\nhave multiplied one-eighth of a kilogram by the number of times\n\nGonzález-Vélez sold cocaine and then added the one-sixteenth of a\n\nkilogram referenced in the recording by Matías-Cruz.              This would\n\nyield one and five sixteenth (15/16) kilograms, not five, and result\n\nin a BOL of only 26 instead of 32.\n\n           We need not reach this issue because the district court\n\ndid not base its drug quantity determination on the amount of\n\ncocaine that González-Vélez personally handled. Instead, the court\n\narrived at the five kilogram figure based on its determination that\n\nthe minimum total amount of cocaine sold at the Las Malvinas drug\n\npoint in the course of the conspiracy was five kilograms. Because,\n\nas explained below, we find no clear error in the district court's\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fdetermination that González-Vélez could foresee that five kilograms\n\nof cocaine were involved in the conspiracy, we need not concern\n\nourselves with how much cocaine González-Vélez personally supplied\n\nto the operation.   We need not address Miele because Miele deals\n\nwith a drug quantity determination that was based on what the\n\ndefendant personally handled, rather than on what the defendant\n\ncould foresee.   989 F.2d at 666.\n\n          González-Vélez   also    argues   that   the    district   court\n\nperformed \"shoddy arithmetic\" in calculating that the drug point\n\nsold an eighth of a kilogram of cocaine per week.        First, González-\n\nVélez argues that the district court incorrectly calculated the\n\namount of cocaine individually sold by Rivera-González.         The court\n\nnoted that according to evidence seized at the drug point, a gram\n\nof cocaine would be packaged into ten $10 bags of cocaine, meaning\n\nthat each $10 bag would contain a tenth of a gram.              However,\n\nRivera-González testified that the \"baggies\" he sold retailed for\n\n$5.   Therefore, González-Vélez argues, each of the \"baggies\"\n\nRivera-González sold must have contained one twentieth of a gram,\n\nnot one tenth.   Thus, if each \"package\" contained 25 \"baggies\" and\n\nRivera-González sold between 35 and 49 packages per week, then\n\nRivera-González himself sold between 43.75 and 61.25 grams of\n\ncocaine per week, far less than the minimum of 87.5 grams that the\n\ncourt calculated.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f           González-Vélez then notes that the district court reached\n\nits figure of one eighth of a kilogram sold per week by multiplying\n\nthe amount of cocaine Rivera-González sold by the number of retail\n\nsellers that Rivera-González said were working at the drug point.\n\nGonzález-Vélez argues, however, that doing so was clearly erroneous\n\nbecause Rivera-González did not explicitly state at the March 27,\n\n2007 sentencing hearing that the other sellers sold powder cocaine.\n\nIt is undisputed that the drug point sold heroin, crack, and\n\nmarijuana as well as cocaine.         González-Vélez argues that because\n\nRivera-González did not clearly state that the other sellers sold\n\ncocaine, the district court was obligated to calculate total\n\ncocaine sales assuming that Rivera-González was the only person at\n\nthe drug point who sold powder cocaine.          This would mean that there\n\nwere weekly sales of only 61.25 grams of cocaine, which is roughly\n\none sixteenth of a kilogram rather than one eighth.\n\n           We   find   no    clear    error    in    the    district   court's\n\ndetermination that the drug point sold an eighth of a kilogram of\n\ncocaine per week.      González-Vélez's argument hinges on the fact\n\nthat Rivera-González did not explicitly state at the March 27, 2007\n\nhearing that the other sellers at Las Malvinas sold cocaine.\n\nHowever,   it   is   clear   from    the    record   that   the   government's\n\nexamination of Rivera-González at that hearing explicitly focused\n\non cocaine.     At no point in his testimony did Rivera-González\n\nsuggest that he was the only seller of powder cocaine.                      In\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\faddition, there is no evidence to indicate that the other sellers\n\ndid not sell cocaine, or to indicate that they sold substantially\n\nless cocaine than Rivera-González.             It is therefore reasonable to\n\ninterpret Rivera-González's testimony as indicating that the other\n\nsellers sold cocaine in similar quantities.                    Thus, even using\n\nGonzález-Vélez's figure of between 43.75 and 61.25 grams sold by\n\nRivera-González, it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude\n\nthat all four sellers combined sold at least 125 grams per week.\n\nMoreover,     the   125     gram   figure   was   corroborated    by   Obregón's\n\ntestimony.     Finally, we note that the district court's calculation\n\nis consistent with the jury's finding that the overall conspiracy\n\ninvolved at least five kilograms of cocaine, although the jury's\n\nfinding was insufficient alone to determine the amount reasonably\n\nforeseable.      Given that the district court's calculation of 125\n\ngrams   per    week   was     a    perfectly   \"permissible     view[]   of   the\n\nevidence,\" we cannot say that it was \"clearly erroneous,\" and hence\n\nwe will not overturn the district court's finding.                 See Tsoulas,\n\n454 F.3d at 76.\n\n              There is another, essentially independent point.              As we\n\ndiscuss   below,      the    district   court     ultimately    concluded     that\n\nGonzález-Vélez could reasonably foresee the total amount of cocaine\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy.          Thus, the    quantity of cocaine that is\n\nrelevant in this case is the total quantity of cocaine, not merely\n\nthe amount retailed at Las Malvinas in powder form.                 The jury in\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fGonzález-Vélez's criminal trial found that the conspiracy-wide\n\namount of cocaine was at least five kilograms, and this finding has\n\nnever   been    questioned    in    either       of    González-Vélez's     appeals.\n\nTherefore, even if the district court erred in its calculation of\n\nhow much powder cocaine was sold per week, and we do not believe it\n\ndid, we would still uphold the sentence so long as we found that\n\nthe district court correctly attributed the conspiracy-wide amount\n\nto González-Vélez.     As discussed below, we find that the court was\n\ncorrect.\n\n              3. Attribution of Conspiracy-Wide Amount to González-\n              Vélez\n\n              Finally, González-Vélez argues that attributing the full\n\nconspiracy-wide amount of five or more kilograms of cocaine to him\n\nwas   clearly     erroneous    as    it     was       not   established   that   the\n\nconspiracy-wide amount was foreseeable by him.                  The district court\n\nbased   its    determination       that    González-Vélez        could    reasonably\n\nforesee five or more kilograms on two primary factors.                    First, the\n\ncourt noted that González-Vélez was frequently seen at or near the\n\nLas Malvinas drug point.            Second, the court noted that in the\n\nrecording made by Matías-Cruz, González-Vélez could be overheard\n\nasking Luis Lloréns about cocaine sales and discussing the pot that\n\nbroke while \"Joey Oreja\" was using it to cook crack.\n\n              González-Vélez does not dispute that he was occasionally\n\npresent at or near the drug point or that he talked to people at\n\nthe drug point.      However, he argues that his mere presence at Las\n\n                                          -27-\n\fMalvinas cannot be used to tie him to drug sales.                 He notes that he\n\nhad lawful reasons for being at Las Malvinas, as he lived in the\n\nLloréns Torres housing project.             He     was also a friend of Luis\n\nLloréns and other persons involved with Las Malvinas, and at one\n\npoint was also romantically pursuing a woman who lived in the area.\n\nTherefore, he argues, his presence at the drug point cannot be\n\nconsidered \"relevant conduct,\" García, 954 F.2d at 15, for the\n\npurposes of sentencing.\n\n            González-Vélez      also      argues   that     the   district    court\n\nimproperly used his presence at Las Malvinas to tie him to retail\n\ndrug sales, which were beyond the scope of his role in the\n\nconspiracy as a wholesale drug seller.                  Although his brief is\n\nunclear, González-Vélez appears to argue that where a sentence\n\ndepends on quantity, a person charged for a particular role in a\n\nconspiracy can only be sentenced for the conspiracy-wide quantity\n\nif   he   had   a    supervisory   role    or    had   multiple     roles    in   the\n\nconspiracy.         He makes this argument by attempting to distinguish\n\nhis case from other cases in which this court has upheld the\n\nattribution     of     conspiracy-wide     amounts     to   defendants      who   had\n\nmultiple roles or high-level roles in a conspiracy.                    See United\n\nStates v. Pizarro-Berríos, 448 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2006) (court\n\nattributed full amount of financial loss in a credit card fraud\n\nscheme to defendant who was both a purchaser of merchandise for the\n\nscheme and a bodyguard for one of the scheme's leaders); United\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fStates v. Rodríguez, 162 F.3d 135, 140, 149 (1st Cir. 1998) (court\n\nattributed full amount of crack cocaine in conspiracy to defendant\n\nwho   controlled   the   drug   point    at   which    the    narcotics    were\n\ndistributed). Here, González-Vélez does not dispute that he was at\n\ntimes present at Las Malvinas for illegal activity.               However, he\n\nargues that there is no evidence that he participated in retail\n\nsales at Las Malvinas or that he could reasonably foresee the\n\nquantity of cocaine sold there.          He notes that in 730 hours of\n\nvideotape collected by the FBI, he was never seen at the drug point\n\nat all, much less seen retailing drugs.          He admits that he went to\n\nthe drug point to collect money, but he argues that this was\n\nbecause he sold cocaine to Luis Lloréns on credit and had to go to\n\nthe drug point to be paid.             González-Vélez argues that this\n\narrangement also explains why he was recorded asking Luis Lloréns\n\nhow much money Luis Lloréns could make from selling cocaine on the\n\nstreet, and asking, \"[W]here are my Washingtons?\"5\n\n           Since   his   sole   role    in    the    conspiracy      was   as   a\n\nwholesaler, González-Vélez argues that he cannot be sentenced for\n\nthe full five kilograms of cocaine unless he either personally\n\nsupplied or conspired to supply that amount to the drug point.               The\n\ngovernment   conceded    at   the   sentencing      hearing   that    it   could\n\ndirectly attribute less than two kilograms of cocaine to González-\n\nVélez.   Furthermore, the testimony of various government witnesses\n\n\n5\n    A slang term for $1 bills.\n\n                                    -29-\n\findicated that there were at least three other suppliers, and there\n\nwas   no   evidence       that    González-Vélez           conspired       with    them.\n\nTherefore, González-Vélez argues, the district court should have\n\ndetermined      the   amount     attributable         to   him    by    dividing     five\n\nkilograms by the total number of suppliers to the point.\n\n            We find no error, let alone clear error, in the district\n\ncourt's finding that \"[i]t is evident that [González-Vélez] knew\n\n. . . and/or could reasonably foresee\" that at least five kilograms\n\nof cocaine would be sold at Las Malvinas.                        We acknowledge that\n\nGonzález-Vélez was sometimes present at Las Malvinas for lawful\n\npurposes, that there is no evidence of cooperation between him and\n\nthe other suppliers to Las Malvinas, and that there is no evidence\n\nhe was involved in retail sales at the point.                      Nevertheless, the\n\nevidence relied on by the district court is clearly sufficient to\n\nsupport the court's conclusion that González-Vélez \"had extensive\n\nknowledge of the drug trafficking activities that took place at\n\n[Las Malvinas].\"      The district court noted that González-Vélez was\n\nfrequently seen at Las Malvinas, that he sold cocaine to Luis\n\nLloréns    on   credit,    and    that   he     was    recorded        \"discussing    the\n\nintricacies of the drug trade.\"           In light of this evidence, we find\n\nno error in the district court's conclusion.\n\n            That González-Vélez's only role in the conspiracy was as\n\na wholesale supplier, as opposed to a retailer, is of little\n\nimportance to this case.             In a drug distribution case, \"the\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fquantity of drugs attributable to [a defendant] for sentencing\n\npurposes . . . [is] bounded initially by the sum of the charged\n\nconduct . . . plus his relevant uncharged conduct.\"          United States\n\nv. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasis added).            In\n\nthis case, the conspiracy charged was a conspiracy to distribute\n\ndrugs at Las Malvinas, rather than to Las Malvinas.           Thus, retail\n\ndrug sales could clearly be relevant uncharged conduct for the\n\npurposes of the drug quantity determination.        What matters in this\n\ncase is whether the retail sales were \"acts that were reasonably\n\nforeseeable\" by González-Vélez \"in furtherance of the conspiracy\"\n\nto distribute drugs at Las Malvinas.        Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1197.\n\nBecause we find no error in the district court's determination that\n\nthe retail sales were acts reasonably foreseeable by González-Vélez\n\nin   furtherance   of   the   conspiracy,   we   find   no   error   in   the\n\nattribution of the full five kilograms of cocaine to González-\n\nVélez.6   We therefore affirm the district court's calculation of a\n\nBOL of 32.\n\n\n6\n   Moreover, contrary to González-Vélez's argument, this court has\nnever held that a quantity attributable to a conspiracy member is\ndependent on either the number of roles he had or the supervisory\nnature of his role. The cases on which González-Vélez relies to\nsupport this proposition, if properly read, do not help him. In\nPizarro-Berríos, we did not hold the defendant responsible for the\nconspiracy-wide financial damages merely because he had multiple\nroles; rather, we held that because the defendant was a friend of\none of the heads of the scheme and served as his bodyguard, the\ndefendant was in a position to know how much money was being\nstolen. 448 F.3d at 8-9. In Rodríguez, defendant Rodríguez's role\nas controller of the drug point made it clear that he could foresee\nhow much crack was sold there. 162 F.3d at 140, 149.\n\n                                   -31-\n\fC. Denial of the 2-Level Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n           González-Vélez argues that the district court committed\n\nreversible error by failing to explain why it denied his request\n\nfor a two-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. González-Vélez argues\n\nthat his eligibility for the reduction was a disputed issue of\n\nfact, and hence that the district court violated Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32(i)(3)(B) by failing to rule on his request.7\n\n           Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B), the sentencing court\n\nmust, for any disputed matter, \"rule on the dispute or determine\n\nthat a ruling is unnecessary.\"            We review a district court's\n\ncompliance with Fed. R. Crim. P. 32 de novo, and will remand if an\n\nerror    occurred   that   was   not   harmless.     United    States   v.\n\nGuadalupe-Rivera, 501 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2007).            We review a\n\ndistrict court's judgment about acceptance of responsibility for\n\nclear error.    United States v. Deppe, 509 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n\n\n\n7\n   González-Vélez also argues that the alleged failure to rule on\nthe acceptance of responsibility issue violates 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(c)(1). We need not address this argument in detail because\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1) does not apply to rulings on acceptance of\nresponsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. Section 3553(c)(1) applies\nto the court's choice of a sentence within a guideline range. See\nsupra n.4.    In contrast, U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 affects the offense\nlevel, from which the GSR is calculated.         Thus, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(c)(1) does not come into play until after a decision\nis made on the appropriate offense level.\n\n                                   -32-\n\f            Here, we find no error in the district court's compliance\n\nwith Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B).            The PSR before the district\n\ncourt upon remand for re-sentencing was the same report that was\n\nused in González-Vélez's original sentencing.                At the March 27,\n\n2007 pre-sentence hearing, the court stated that because the PSR\n\nwas \"the same as the last time . . . any objections that were made\n\nat the last time and taken care of . . . were taken care of and\n\nruled upon by the Court.\"       The court then allowed González-Vélez's\n\ncounsel    to   present   her   objections    again,   \"if    she   feels   it's\n\nnecessary.\"     In response, González-Vélez's counsel stated that she\n\nand her client \"renew[ed] [their] request for granting points [sic]\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility.\"\n\n            It is clear that the request for a reduction at the\n\nMarch 27, 2007 hearing was not a new objection, but rather a\n\nreiteration of a previous objection. Therefore, it was correct for\n\nthe district court to rest on its previous resolution of this\n\nissue.     Moreover, the district court properly complied with Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 32(i)(B)(3) when it addressed the responsibility issue\n\nat the original sentencing hearing. At that hearing, the court had\n\nnoted that González-Vélez \"went to trial at his own choice, with\n\nadequate counsel.\" González-Vélez had argued that the fact that he\n\nwent to trial should not be held against him, because he could not\n\nreach an agreement with the prosecutor regarding drug quantity.\n\nHowever,    the   court   had   said   that    it   would    not    \"take   into\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fconsideration\" the fact that the pre-trial plea negotiations were\n\n\"not fruitful.\" As we note below, a criminal defendant's choice to\n\ngo   to   trial   weighs   very   heavily    against   granting   a   downward\n\nadjustment    for    acceptance     of   responsibility;     only     in   rare\n\ncircumstances can the defendant overcome this effect, and the\n\nfailure of plea negotiations is generally not such a circumstance.\n\nIn light of this reality, we find the district court's discussion\n\nof the responsibility issue at the original hearing sufficient for\n\nthe purposes of Rule 32(i)(B)(3).           Because the district court had\n\nalready ruled on the responsibility issue in compliance with Rule\n\n32(i)(B)(3) at the original sentencing hearing, we find no error in\n\nthe district court's decision not to address the issue again at the\n\nMarch 27, 2007 pre-sentence hearing.\n\n                              III. Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's sentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\f",

Background\n\n            As discussed in our prior opinion, the facts underlying\n\nthis appeal arise from an investigation of the drug point known as\n\n\"Las Malvinas\" in the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project in Puerto\n\nRico.   José Luis Rivera González, a/k/a \"Luis Lloréns,\" (\"Luis\n\nLloréns\") ran the drug point from 2000 until his death in 2002.\n\nThe FBI and the Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\") investigated\n\nthe drug point between the summer of 2001 and October 2002.           The\n\ninvestigation resulted in a grand jury indictment against nine\n\nindividuals, including the appellant.        González-Vélez was charged\n\nwith one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances,\n\nincluding powder cocaine, cocaine base, heroin, and marijuana, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. González-Vélez's role in the charged\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fconspiracy was that of a wholesale supplier of drugs, particularly\n\npowder cocaine, to the drug point.\n\n            González-Vélez was tried jointly with José A. Ramos-\n\nRomero (\"Ramos\"), a processor of drugs at Las Malvinas.                            In\n\naddition    to   asking   the   jury    to     render    a   verdict   as    to    the\n\ndefendants' participation in the conspiracy, the judge also gave\n\nthe jury a special verdict form asking it to decide whether or not\n\nthe amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy was at least five\n\nkilograms.       The jury found González-Vélez and Ramos guilty of\n\nconspiracy, and also found that the amount of cocaine in the\n\nconspiracy was at least five kilograms.\n\n            On   December   23,    2004,       the   district     court     held    a\n\nsentencing hearing for González-Vélez.                  The Pre-Sentence Report\n\n(\"PSR\") recommended a Base Offense Level (\"BOL\") of 32, based on\n\nthe jury's finding that the drug quantity in the conspiracy was at\n\nleast five kilograms.       The district court adopted this reasoning\n\nand assigned a BOL of 32.        González-Vélez had argued to the court\n\nthat   it    needed   to    make       an     individualized     drug       quantity\n\ndetermination, but the court concluded that drug quantity was a\n\nmatter reserved to the jury, and that the jury had rendered a\n\nsufficient finding.\n\n            González-Vélez also objected to the PSR on the ground\n\nthat he was entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E.1. After the verdict and before\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe   December    23,    2004    sentencing      hearing,   González-Vélez      had\n\nsubmitted    to    the    court      a     written   statement      admitting    to\n\nparticipating in the sale of drugs at the Lloréns Torres housing\n\nproject, stating that he was sorry for the damage he had done to\n\nsociety and to his family, and explaining that he had gone to trial\n\nonly because the drug amount with which he was being charged\n\noverstated his role in the conspiracy.               The probation officer who\n\nprepared the PSR recommended that the adjustment not be granted\n\nbecause González-Vélez had gone to trial and because González-Vélez\n\nhad indicated in an interview with the probation officer that he\n\nthought the government had a weak case.                The court accepted the\n\nprobation officer's view and denied the adjustment, noting that\n\nGonzález-Vélez \"went to trial at his own choice, with adequate\n\ncounsel,\" and saying that it would not \"take into consideration\"\n\nthe fact that the pre-trial plea negotiations were \"not fruitful.\"\n\nBased on a BOL of 32 and a criminal history category of I, the\n\napplicable    Sentencing        Guidelines       sentence   range    (\"GSR\")    was\n\ncalculated   to   be     121    to   151   months'   imprisonment;     the     court\n\nsentenced González-Vélez to 135 months.                 González-Vélez timely\n\nappealed.\n\n            In his first appeal, González-Vélez challenged both his\n\nconviction and his sentence.                 In challenging his conviction,\n\nGonzález-Vélez argued, inter alia, that the judge erred in asking\n\nthe jury to render a special verdict as to the conspiracy-wide\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fcocaine amount.      Instead, González-Vélez argued, the judge should\n\nhave asked the jury to render special verdicts as to the amount of\n\ncocaine each defendant handled individually.              González-Vélez did\n\nnot challenge the jury's finding that the conspiracy involved at\n\nleast five kilograms of cocaine.             In challenging his sentence,\n\nGonzález-Vélez argued that the district court should have made an\n\nindividualized drug quantity determination for sentencing purposes.\n\n              In our decision in González-Velez's first appeal, we\n\nupheld his conviction, but vacated the sentence and remanded the\n\ncase for re-sentencing.         As to the conviction for conspiracy, we\n\nheld   that    the   court's    instruction    to   the   jury    to    find   the\n\nconspiracy-wide amount of cocaine did not constitute error because\n\nthe conspiracy-wide amount was a factor in sentencing, rather than\n\na factor in conviction.1         González-Vélez, 466 F.3d at 36.            As to\n\nthe sentence, however, we held that the district court's failure to\n\nmake an individualized finding as to drug quantity was reversible\n\nerror.    Id. at 38.

The same judge who had presided over\n\nGonzález-Vélez's criminal trial also presided over the new round of\n\npre-sentence and sentencing hearings. At the pre-sentence hearing,\n\nthe court advised González-Vélez that the case had been remanded by\n\nthe appeals court for the sole purpose of making an individualized\n\ndrug quantity determination and that the prior objections to the\n\nPSR   had   been   addressed   at   the    original   sentencing    hearing.\n\nGonzález-Vélez nevertheless renewed his request for a two-level\n\ndownward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.              The court\n\nultimately concluded, based on its examination of the sentencing\n\nmemoranda and the evidence presented during the trial and the\n\nvarious     sentencing   hearings,     that    González-Vélez      \"handled,\n\nanticipated handling, or could reasonably foresee the possession\n\nwith intent to distribute of more than five but less than 15 kilos\n\nof cocaine,\" and explained its reasons for the determination.             As\n\nbefore, that determination corresponded with a BOL of 32, which in\n\nturn resulted in a GSR of 121 to 151 months' imprisonment.               The\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fcourt again selected the 135-month sentence previously imposed.\n\nGonzález-Vélez now appeals this sentence.\n\n           As González-Vélez's main argument on appeal challenges\n\nthe district court's individualized drug quantity determination for\n\nsentencing purposes, we summarize the evidence in the record\n\nrelevant thereto.\n\nA. Testimony of Ángel Obregón\n\n           One of the government's key witnesses at both González-\n\nVélez's criminal trial and at the pre-sentence hearing was Ángel\n\nObregón (\"Obregón\").   Obregón testified at the March 27, 2007 pre-\n\nsentence hearing that he worked under Luis Lloréns at Las Malvinas.\n\nObregón testified about drug sales at Las Malvinas in various\n\nproceedings: before the Grand Jury in 2003, at González-Vélez's\n\ncriminal trial, and at the March 27, 2007 pre-sentence hearing. At\n\nthe criminal trial and before the grand jury, Obregón indicated\n\nthat there were at least four retail drug sellers at the drug\n\npoint.   Obregón also testified at the trial that Luis Lloréns told\n\nhim that the drug point sold 1/8 kg of cocaine per week.    Obregón\n\ntestified at the pre-sentence hearing that he saw González-Vélez at\n\nthe drug point \"almost everyday,\" and that whenever González-Vélez\n\ncame to the drug point, Luis Lloréns would pay González-Vélez with\n\nmoney from drug sales at the drug point.\n\n           Obregón testified about González-Vélez's cocaine sales to\n\nLuis Lloréns a total of six times in various proceedings.   On each\n\n\n                                -8-\n\foccasion he was asked in what quantity González-Vélez sold cocaine\n\nto Luis Lloréns.       On the first occasion, before the Grand Jury in\n\n2003, Obregón said González-Vélez provided one-eighth kilogram\n\nquantities (\"eighths\").          However, in later proceedings, Obregón\n\ntestified that González-Vélez supplied cocaine in both eighths and\n\none-half    kilogram    (\"half\")    quantities.       Furthermore,        at   the\n\ncriminal    trial,     Obregón    admitted    that   he    did    not   know   the\n\ndifference between an eighth, a half, and one kilogram of cocaine.\n\nObregón also gave inconsistent testimony about how many times he\n\nsaw González-Vélez sell cocaine to Luis Lloréns.                  At the trial,\n\nObregón initially said he did not remember how many sales he\n\nwitnessed.    Later, he said he saw more than 10 sales.            Later still,\n\nhe testified that he had only seen González-Vélez sell drugs \"a\n\ncouple of times.\"\n\n            At the March 27, 2007 pre-sentence hearing, on cross-\n\nexamination by González-Vélez's counsel, Obregón admitted that he\n\nhad   an   extensive    history    of   violent   crimes    and    that   he   was\n\ncooperating with the government.          Defense counsel also challenged\n\nObregón's credibility by pointing out that at the trial, Obregón\n\nsaid he did not know the difference between one eighth, one half,\n\nand one kilogram.        Obregón responded that he did know that an\n\neighth of a kilogram is less than one kilogram.              Obregón was also\n\nunable to correctly calculate his age, claiming he was 15 or 16 in\n\n1998 but that he was only 22 as of March 27, 2007.\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fB. Testimony of Héctor Luis Rivera-González\n\n            Héctor Luis Rivera-González (\"Rivera-González\") was the\n\nnephew of Luis Lloréns.       He testified at the March 27, 2007 pre-\n\nsentence hearing that he worked as a drug peddler at the drug point\n\nfor a total of 32 days, from April 8, 2002 until he was arrested\n\nfor robbery on May 10, 2002.     Rivera-González testified that while\n\nhe worked at the drug point, it was open every day and that it sold\n\ncocaine, crack, heroin, and marijuana.          He identified González-\n\nVélez as a wholesale supplier of drugs to the Las Malvinas drug\n\npoint.    Rivera-González said that González-Vélez sold cocaine to\n\nLuis Lloréns on credit. Rivera-González also said he saw González-\n\nVélez at the drug point twice a week.\n\n            Rivera-González    provided    certain   details   about   the\n\npackaging of cocaine.     The government asked him, \"specifically\n\nreferring to cocaine, powder cocaine,\" how cocaine was packaged and\n\nsold.    Rivera-González testified that Luis Lloréns would give him\n\n\"packages\" of powder cocaine containing 25 \"baggies\" each, which\n\nwould retail for $5 per \"baggie.\"         Rivera-González testified that\n\nhe sold \"five, six, or seven\" \"packages\" worth of cocaine per week.\n\nAfter asking Rivera-González about the packaging of cocaine, the\n\ngovernment asked, \"[W]hen you would sell cocaine at that drug\n\npoint, were you the only seller selling for your uncle at that drug\n\npoint at the time?\"   Rivera-González said that he was not the only\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fseller, and that \"three or four\" other people \"would sell for\" Luis\n\nLloréns at the drug point.\n\nC. Testimony of FBI Special Agent William Ortiz and Puerto Rico\nPolice Agent Héctor A. Orta-González.\n\n            FBI Special Agent William Ortiz (\"Ortiz\") and Puerto Rico\n\nPolice Agent Héctor A. Orta-González (\"Orta-González\") testified at\n\nthe March 27, 2007 pre-sentence hearing.          Both agents participated\n\nin the investigation into drug sales at Las Malvinas.               Agent Ortiz\n\ntestified that González-Vélez was one of four wholesale drug\n\nsuppliers    to   Las   Malvinas.      Both   agents    testified    that   they\n\nfrequently observed González-Vélez at the drug point.                On cross-\n\nexamination, both agents conceded that González-Vélez did not\n\nappear at all in the 730 hours of surveillance tape the FBI took at\n\nthe drug point.     However, Agent Orta testified that González-Vélez\n\nwould always enter the drug point through the rear entrance, where\n\nthere were no surveillance cameras.\n\nD. Recording By Jesús Samuel Matías-Cruz\n\n            Agent   Orta   also     testified   about    the   contents     of   a\n\nrecording secretly made by Jesús Samuel Matías-Cruz (\"Matías-\n\nCruz\"),     who worked for Luis Lloréns at the drug point.2               In the\n\nrecording, González-Vélez can be heard talking with Luis Lloréns\n\nabout the packaging and processing of cocaine, as well as about\n\nwhen Luis Lloréns would pay González-Vélez for cocaine the latter\n\n\n2\n   The recording itself was also part of the record before the\nsentencing court.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fhad supplied.     González-Vélez is also overheard saying that a pot\n\nthat was being used by one of Luis Lloréns's workers to \"cook\"\n\ncrack cocaine had broken.\n\nE. Other Evidence\n\n          The     judge   heard   González-Vélez's      allocution     at   the\n\nMarch 27, 2007 sentencing hearing.            González-Vélez stated that he\n\nhad always intended to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge, but\n\nthat he went to trial on the advice of his trial counsel because he\n\ncould not reach an agreement with the prosecution on the amount of\n\ndrugs he handled.     In order to explain his presence at Las Malvinas\n\nduring the period of the investigation, González-Vélez introduced\n\ninto evidence a certificate from the Puerto Rico Department of\n\nHousing and Public Administration showing that he was a resident of\n\nthe Lloréns Torres housing project from 1999 until 2003.\n\nF. Defendant's Sentencing Memo\n\n          On April 30, 2007, prior to the sentencing hearing,\n\nGonzález-Vélez filed a sentencing memorandum with the court.3\n\nGonzález-Vélez argued that the proper amount of cocaine that could\n\nbe attributed to him for sentencing purposes was one and five-\n\nsixteenth (15/16) kilograms.      He reached this number by multiplying\n\none-eighth   of   a   kilogram    --    the   lowest   amount   that   Obregón\n\ntestified to seeing González-Vélez sell to Luis Lloréns -- by ten\n\n\n3\n    González-Vélez submitted a second sentencing memorandum on\nMay 22, 2007 that expanded on the facts presented in the first memo\nand provided additional legal arguments.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f-- the maximum number of times Obregón said González-Vélez sold\n\ncocaine to Luis Lloréns -- and then adding the one-sixteenth of a\n\nkilogram amount mentioned in the recording by Matías-Cruz.                 Based\n\non this figure, González-Vélez argued that his BOL should be 26.\n\nG. The District Court's Sentence\n\n             The   district    court     held    the    sentencing    hearing    on\n\nJuly 13, 2007, wherein it recognized              its obligation, pursuant to\n\nthis Court's mandate, \"to make an individualized finding as to the\n\namount of drugs attributable to [González-Vélez] in the instant\n\noffense   of    conviction.\"      The    district      court   then   stated    its\n\ndetermination that González-Vélez \"handled, anticipated handling,\n\nor   could     reasonably     foresee    the     possession    with   intent     to\n\ndistribute . . . more than five but less than 15 kilos of cocaine,\"\n\nand proceeded to recount its reasons for that determination.                    The\n\ncourt first noted that evidence obtained from the drug point\n\nindicated that each \"baggie\" of cocaine sold at the point contained\n\none-tenth of a gram of cocaine.                Rivera-González testified that\n\neach \"package\" contained twenty five \"baggies,\" meaning that each\n\npackage contained 2.5 grams of cocaine. Based on Rivera-González's\n\ntestimony that he sold from five to seven \"packages\" per day, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that \"even using a conservative figure\n\n[Rivera-González] would distribute at least 35 packages a week,\"\n\nfor a total of 87.5 grams of cocaine.                  However, the court also\n\nnoted that both Rivera-González and Obregón testified that there\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fwere four to five sellers at the point.   Thus, the court held that\n\nthe \"evidence presented certainly corroborates the testimony of\n\nboth [Rivera-González] and Obregón that at least one eighth [of a\n\nkilogram, or 125 grams] of cocaine was sold\" per week at the drug\n\npoint.\n\n           The court then recounted the testimony of Agents Orta and\n\nOrtiz that they both observed González-Vélez at the drug point on\n\nmultiple occasions during the course of their investigation, which\n\nbegan in the summer of 2001 and was continuing until at least\n\nAugust of 2002.   The court also relied on the recording by Matías-\n\nCruz, in which González-Vélez is heard discussing retail drug sales\n\nand the breaking of the pot that was being used to cook crack\n\ncocaine.   The court noted that González-Vélez is heard saying that\n\nhe was waiting to be paid for an eighth of cocaine he had sold to\n\nLuis Lloréns.     Based on this evidence, the court found that\n\nGonzález-Vélez \"knew . . . the amount of drugs being distributed\n\nand/or could reasonably foresee that those amounts were being sold\n\nat the drug point supplied by him.\"    In reaching its conclusion,\n\nthe court also found that González-Vélez \"had extensive knowledge\n\nof the drug trafficking activities that took place at the Las\n\nMalvinas drug point.\"\n\n           In determining the proper guideline range, the court\n\nstated:\n\n           [T]he applicable case law indicates that in a\n           drug conspiracy the applicable statutory\n\n                                -14-\n\f              maximum imprisonment term is derived from a\n              conspiracy-wide perspective.    That does not\n              mean that the Defendant must have personally\n              handled the drugs for which he is being held\n              responsible. He could be held responsible for\n              relevant conduct, which could include the acts\n              of other conspiracy members, as long as their\n              conduct was reasonably foreseeable for the\n              Defendant.\n\nBased on its finding that González-Vélez knew how much cocaine was\n\nbeing sold at Las Malvinas, the court held that \"if at least one\n\neighth   of    cocaine   was   sold   every   week   during   the   ten   month\n\nconspiracy . . . [González-Vélez] should be held responsible for at\n\nleast five but not more than 15 kilos of cocaine.\"             When combined\n\nwith a Criminal History Category of I, the court explained, this\n\namount of cocaine triggered a BOL of 32 and a corresponding GSR of\n\n121 to 151 months.\n\n              The court then said that it had \"reviewed the applicable\n\nguideline adjustments\" and \"considered the other sentencing factors\n\nset forth in [18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)].\"          The court also stated that it\n\nfound the Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) to have \"adequately applied the\n\nGuideline computations and satisfactorily reflect[ed] components of\n\n[the] offense.\"      The court had previously held, at the March 27,\n\n2007 hearing, that since the PSR had not changed since the original\n\nsentence was handed down, any objections to the original report\n\nthat had already been ruled on were \"taken care of and ruled upon\n\nby the Court.\"     Ultimately, the court sentenced González-Vélez, as\n\nbefore, to 131 months.\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f                            II. Discussion\n\n           González-Vélez    makes   two   main   arguments   on   appeal.\n\nFirst, he argues that the district court committed reversible error\n\nin its drug quantity determination because the evidence does not\n\nsupport attributing five kilograms of cocaine to him.              Second,\n\nGonzález-Vélez argues that the district court erred in failing to\n\nstate its reasons for denying his request for a 2-level reduction\n\nfor   acceptance   of   responsibility.4     González-Vélez    does    not\n\nchallenge the jury's original finding that the conspiracy as a\n\nwhole involved at least five kilograms of cocaine.\n\n\n\n4\n  González-Vélez makes two additional arguments, neither of which\nmerits serious consideration.\n\n     First, he argues that the district court violated 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(c)(1) by failing to explain why it chose a BOL of 32.\nHowever, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1) does not require the court to\nexplain why it chose an offense level. Rather, once a court has\ndetermined a GSR based on the offense level, if the sentence range\nexceeds 24 months, § 3553(c)(1) requires the court to explain why\nit chose a particular sentence. Thus, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1) does\nnot come into play until after a decision is made on the\nappropriate offense level.\n\n     Second, González-Vélez argues that the district court\ncommitted a \"technical violation\" by not stating in Section IV(B)\nof the Statement of Reasons why it chose to impose a sentence in\nthe middle of the guideline range, and that this violation\nconstitutes reversible error. González-Vélez does not indicate how\nhe was prejudiced by this supposed \"technical violation\" in any\nway. Nor does he provide any support for his argument that this\nconstitutes reversible error. We therefore treat this argument as\nwaived. See United States v.

Drug Quantity Determination\n\n           In González-Vélez's previous appeal, this court vacated\n\nhis sentence and remanded to the district court with instructions\n\nto make an individualized finding as to whether he either \"handled\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f[or] anticipated handling\" five kilograms of cocaine or could\n\n\"reasonably foresee\" that the conspiracy would handle that amount.\n\nGonzález-Vélez, 466 F.3d at 38.   In the instant appeal, González-\n\nVélez argues that the district court again failed to properly carry\n\nout this obligation, and thus, clearly erred in basing his sentence\n\non the five kilogram conspiracy-wide amount. First, González-Vélez\n\nargues that the district court improperly relied upon the testimony\n\nof Obregón and Rivera-González in determining drug quantity, as\n\nthese witnesses lacked credibility.    Second, he argues that the\n\ncourt erred in its calculations underlying its drug quantity\n\ndetermination.   In particular, he argues that the court erred in\n\ncalculating both the drug amount he personally handled and the\n\namount of cocaine sold at Las Malvinas each week.      Finally, he\n\nargues that the district court wrongly concluded that he could\n\nreasonably foresee the full amount of cocaine distributed by the\n\nconspiracy.   We address these arguments in turn.\n\n          1. Credibility of Obregón and Rivera-González\n\n          First, González-Vélez argues that the district court\n\nerred in relying on the testimony of Obregón and Rivera-González as\n\nthe basis for its drug quantity determination because they were\n\nunreliable witnesses.   González-Vélez points out that Obregón gave\n\ninconsistent testimony both as to the number of times González-\n\nVélez sold cocaine to Luis Lloréns and as to the amount of cocaine\n\ninvolved in each sale.    González-Vélez also argues that Obregón\n\n\n                               -19-\n\flacked the intellectual capacity to be a reliable witness, as\n\nmanifested by his inability to calculate his own age. Furthermore,\n\nGonzález-Vélez argues that Obregón had a motive to lie because he\n\nwas a cooperating witness facing charges for involvement in the\n\nconspiracy, and that he was receiving payment for his testimony.\n\nFinally, González-Vélez points to Obregón's extensive criminal\n\nhistory.\n\n            As for Rivera-González, González-Vélez points out that\n\nRivera-González's testimony is based on his selling drugs at the\n\ndrug point for only 32 days.             Moreover, Rivera-González only\n\npersonally observed one sale by González-Vélez to Luis Lloréns; all\n\nof his other knowledge was hearsay testimony based on what Luis\n\nLloréns, who died in 2002, purportedly told him.\n\n            A district court has broad discretion to make credibility\n\njudgments relevant to sentencing.        See, e.g., Huddleston, 194 F.3d\n\nat 224; Webster, 54 F.3d at 5.

We\n\nacknowledge that there are some internal inconsistencies in the\n\ntestimonies as to the number of times González-Vélez sold cocaine\n\nand the amount of cocaine González-Vélez sold each time.        In\n\nparticular, we note Obregón's inconsistent testimony about the\n\nquantity of drugs González-Vélez sold to Luis Lloréns.     However,\n\nthe judge, as the finder of fact at sentencing, was free to\n\ndisregard inconsistent portions of the testimony and credit the\n\nrelevant credible portions.   See United States v.

The\n\nsentence in this case was not based on the amount of cocaine\n\nGonzález-Vélez individually handled.    Rather, the sentence was\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fbased on González-Vélez's ability to foresee the conspiracy-wide\n\namount of cocaine.          With respect to this aspect of the case,\n\nObregón's      and    Rivera-González's         testimonies     are        generally\n\nconsistent,     are   not   implausible    on     their    face,    and     are   not\n\ncontradicted by the other evidence in the record.                  Both witnesses\n\ntestified to seeing González-Vélez at the drug point frequently,\n\nand this testimony was corroborated by Agents Ortiz and Orta. Both\n\nwitnesses also testified that González-Vélez sold cocaine on credit\n\nto Luis Lloréns, which is something that González-Vélez himself\n\nadmits.    Furthermore, as we discuss in more detail below, Obregón\n\nand Rivera-González corroborated each other's testimony about the\n\namount of cocaine retailed at Las Malvinas.               Because the testimony\n\nof   Obregón   and    Rivera-González     was    consistent    as     to    the   two\n\nimportant factors in González-Vélez's sentence -- the conspiracy-\n\nwide amount, and the fact that González-Vélez could foresee that\n\namount -- we do not find the trial court's reliance on their\n\ntestimony to be \"unreasonable.\"           See Huddleston, 194 F.3d at 224\n\n(holding    that     \"[n]otwithstanding    some     minor     discrepancies        in\n\n[witness's] testimony, 'we do not think it unreasonable . . . to\n\nbelieve that the testimony of a man experienced in drug deals was\n\nsufficient to establish an appropriate drug quantity'\" (quoting\n\nUnited States v.

Miele,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603517\"><a href=\"/opinion/603517/united-states-v-anthony-m-miele-john-jay-mcelfresh-charles-j-walters/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1993), in which that court remanded the case\n\nfor re-sentencing because of the lower court's failure to explain\n\nwhy, when deciding the defendant's sentence, it chose to rely on\n\nthe larger of two drug quantities testified to by a witness.              In\n\nthe present case, González-Vélez argues, the district court should\n\nhave multiplied one-eighth of a kilogram by the number of times\n\nGonzález-Vélez sold cocaine and then added the one-sixteenth of a\n\nkilogram referenced in the recording by Matías-Cruz.              This would\n\nyield one and five sixteenth (15/16) kilograms, not five, and result\n\nin a BOL of only 26 instead of 32.\n\n           We need not reach this issue because the district court\n\ndid not base its drug quantity determination on the amount of\n\ncocaine that González-Vélez personally handled. Instead, the court\n\narrived at the five kilogram figure based on its determination that\n\nthe minimum total amount of cocaine sold at the Las Malvinas drug\n\npoint in the course of the conspiracy was five kilograms. Because,\n\nas explained below, we find no clear error in the district court's\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fdetermination that González-Vélez could foresee that five kilograms\n\nof cocaine were involved in the conspiracy, we need not concern\n\nourselves with how much cocaine González-Vélez personally supplied\n\nto the operation.   We need not address Miele because Miele deals\n\nwith a drug quantity determination that was based on what the\n\ndefendant personally handled, rather than on what the defendant\n\ncould foresee.   989 F.2d at 666.\n\n          González-Vélez   also    argues   that   the    district   court\n\nperformed \"shoddy arithmetic\" in calculating that the drug point\n\nsold an eighth of a kilogram of cocaine per week.        First, González-\n\nVélez argues that the district court incorrectly calculated the\n\namount of cocaine individually sold by Rivera-González.         The court\n\nnoted that according to evidence seized at the drug point, a gram\n\nof cocaine would be packaged into ten $10 bags of cocaine, meaning\n\nthat each $10 bag would contain a tenth of a gram.              However,\n\nRivera-González testified that the \"baggies\" he sold retailed for\n\n$5.   Therefore, González-Vélez argues, each of the \"baggies\"\n\nRivera-González sold must have contained one twentieth of a gram,\n\nnot one tenth.   Thus, if each \"package\" contained 25 \"baggies\" and\n\nRivera-González sold between 35 and 49 packages per week, then\n\nRivera-González himself sold between 43.75 and 61.25 grams of\n\ncocaine per week, far less than the minimum of 87.5 grams that the\n\ncourt calculated.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f           González-Vélez then notes that the district court reached\n\nits figure of one eighth of a kilogram sold per week by multiplying\n\nthe amount of cocaine Rivera-González sold by the number of retail\n\nsellers that Rivera-González said were working at the drug point.\n\nGonzález-Vélez argues, however, that doing so was clearly erroneous\n\nbecause Rivera-González did not explicitly state at the March 27,\n\n2007 sentencing hearing that the other sellers sold powder cocaine.\n\nIt is undisputed that the drug point sold heroin, crack, and\n\nmarijuana as well as cocaine.         González-Vélez argues that because\n\nRivera-González did not clearly state that the other sellers sold\n\ncocaine, the district court was obligated to calculate total\n\ncocaine sales assuming that Rivera-González was the only person at\n\nthe drug point who sold powder cocaine.          This would mean that there\n\nwere weekly sales of only 61.25 grams of cocaine, which is roughly\n\none sixteenth of a kilogram rather than one eighth.\n\n           We   find   no    clear    error    in    the    district   court's\n\ndetermination that the drug point sold an eighth of a kilogram of\n\ncocaine per week.      González-Vélez's argument hinges on the fact\n\nthat Rivera-González did not explicitly state at the March 27, 2007\n\nhearing that the other sellers at Las Malvinas sold cocaine.\n\nHowever,   it   is   clear   from    the    record   that   the   government's\n\nexamination of Rivera-González at that hearing explicitly focused\n\non cocaine.     At no point in his testimony did Rivera-González\n\nsuggest that he was the only seller of powder cocaine.                      In\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\faddition, there is no evidence to indicate that the other sellers\n\ndid not sell cocaine, or to indicate that they sold substantially\n\nless cocaine than Rivera-González.             It is therefore reasonable to\n\ninterpret Rivera-González's testimony as indicating that the other\n\nsellers sold cocaine in similar quantities.                    Thus, even using\n\nGonzález-Vélez's figure of between 43.75 and 61.25 grams sold by\n\nRivera-González, it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude\n\nthat all four sellers combined sold at least 125 grams per week.\n\nMoreover,     the   125     gram   figure   was   corroborated    by   Obregón's\n\ntestimony.     Finally, we note that the district court's calculation\n\nis consistent with the jury's finding that the overall conspiracy\n\ninvolved at least five kilograms of cocaine, although the jury's\n\nfinding was insufficient alone to determine the amount reasonably\n\nforeseable.      Given that the district court's calculation of 125\n\ngrams   per    week   was     a    perfectly   \"permissible     view[]   of   the\n\nevidence,\" we cannot say that it was \"clearly erroneous,\" and hence\n\nwe will not overturn the district court's finding.                 See Tsoulas,\n\n454 F.3d at 76.\n\n              There is another, essentially independent point.              As we\n\ndiscuss   below,      the    district   court     ultimately    concluded     that\n\nGonzález-Vélez could reasonably foresee the total amount of cocaine\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy.          Thus, the    quantity of cocaine that is\n\nrelevant in this case is the total quantity of cocaine, not merely\n\nthe amount retailed at Las Malvinas in powder form.                 The jury in\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fGonzález-Vélez's criminal trial found that the conspiracy-wide\n\namount of cocaine was at least five kilograms, and this finding has\n\nnever   been    questioned    in    either       of    González-Vélez's     appeals.\n\nTherefore, even if the district court erred in its calculation of\n\nhow much powder cocaine was sold per week, and we do not believe it\n\ndid, we would still uphold the sentence so long as we found that\n\nthe district court correctly attributed the conspiracy-wide amount\n\nto González-Vélez.     As discussed below, we find that the court was\n\ncorrect.\n\n              3. Attribution of Conspiracy-Wide Amount to González-\n              Vélez\n\n              Finally, González-Vélez argues that attributing the full\n\nconspiracy-wide amount of five or more kilograms of cocaine to him\n\nwas   clearly     erroneous    as    it     was       not   established   that   the\n\nconspiracy-wide amount was foreseeable by him.                  The district court\n\nbased   its    determination       that    González-Vélez        could    reasonably\n\nforesee five or more kilograms on two primary factors.                    First, the\n\ncourt noted that González-Vélez was frequently seen at or near the\n\nLas Malvinas drug point.            Second, the court noted that in the\n\nrecording made by Matías-Cruz, González-Vélez could be overheard\n\nasking Luis Lloréns about cocaine sales and discussing the pot that\n\nbroke while \"Joey Oreja\" was using it to cook crack.\n\n              González-Vélez does not dispute that he was occasionally\n\npresent at or near the drug point or that he talked to people at\n\nthe drug point.      However, he argues that his mere presence at Las\n\n                                          -27-\n\fMalvinas cannot be used to tie him to drug sales.                 He notes that he\n\nhad lawful reasons for being at Las Malvinas, as he lived in the\n\nLloréns Torres housing project.             He     was also a friend of Luis\n\nLloréns and other persons involved with Las Malvinas, and at one\n\npoint was also romantically pursuing a woman who lived in the area.\n\nTherefore, he argues, his presence at the drug point cannot be\n\nconsidered \"relevant conduct,\" García, 954 F.2d at 15, for the\n\npurposes of sentencing.\n\n            González-Vélez      also      argues   that     the   district    court\n\nimproperly used his presence at Las Malvinas to tie him to retail\n\ndrug sales, which were beyond the scope of his role in the\n\nconspiracy as a wholesale drug seller.                  Although his brief is\n\nunclear, González-Vélez appears to argue that where a sentence\n\ndepends on quantity, a person charged for a particular role in a\n\nconspiracy can only be sentenced for the conspiracy-wide quantity\n\nif   he   had   a    supervisory   role    or    had   multiple     roles    in   the\n\nconspiracy.         He makes this argument by attempting to distinguish\n\nhis case from other cases in which this court has upheld the\n\nattribution     of     conspiracy-wide     amounts     to   defendants      who   had\n\nmultiple roles or high-level roles in a conspiracy.

He notes that in 730 hours of\n\nvideotape collected by the FBI, he was never seen at the drug point\n\nat all, much less seen retailing drugs.          He admits that he went to\n\nthe drug point to collect money, but he argues that this was\n\nbecause he sold cocaine to Luis Lloréns on credit and had to go to\n\nthe drug point to be paid.             González-Vélez argues that this\n\narrangement also explains why he was recorded asking Luis Lloréns\n\nhow much money Luis Lloréns could make from selling cocaine on the\n\nstreet, and asking, \"[W]here are my Washingtons?\"5\n\n           Since   his   sole   role    in    the    conspiracy      was   as   a\n\nwholesaler, González-Vélez argues that he cannot be sentenced for\n\nthe full five kilograms of cocaine unless he either personally\n\nsupplied or conspired to supply that amount to the drug point.               The\n\ngovernment   conceded    at   the   sentencing      hearing   that    it   could\n\ndirectly attribute less than two kilograms of cocaine to González-\n\nVélez.   Furthermore, the testimony of various government witnesses\n\n\n5\n    A slang term for $1 bills.\n\n                                    -29-\n\findicated that there were at least three other suppliers, and there\n\nwas   no   evidence       that    González-Vélez           conspired       with    them.\n\nTherefore, González-Vélez argues, the district court should have\n\ndetermined      the   amount     attributable         to   him    by    dividing     five\n\nkilograms by the total number of suppliers to the point.\n\n            We find no error, let alone clear error, in the district\n\ncourt's finding that \"[i]t is evident that [González-Vélez] knew\n\n. . . and/or could reasonably foresee\" that at least five kilograms\n\nof cocaine would be sold at Las Malvinas.                        We acknowledge that\n\nGonzález-Vélez was sometimes present at Las Malvinas for lawful\n\npurposes, that there is no evidence of cooperation between him and\n\nthe other suppliers to Las Malvinas, and that there is no evidence\n\nhe was involved in retail sales at the point.                      Nevertheless, the\n\nevidence relied on by the district court is clearly sufficient to\n\nsupport the court's conclusion that González-Vélez \"had extensive\n\nknowledge of the drug trafficking activities that took place at\n\n[Las Malvinas].\"      The district court noted that González-Vélez was\n\nfrequently seen at Las Malvinas, that he sold cocaine to Luis\n\nLloréns    on   credit,    and    that   he     was    recorded        \"discussing    the\n\nintricacies of the drug trade.\"           In light of this evidence, we find\n\nno error in the district court's conclusion.\n\n            That González-Vélez's only role in the conspiracy was as\n\na wholesale supplier, as opposed to a retailer, is of little\n\nimportance to this case.             In a drug distribution case, \"the\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fquantity of drugs attributable to [a defendant] for sentencing\n\npurposes . . . [is] bounded initially by the sum of the charged\n\nconduct . . . plus his relevant uncharged conduct.\"          United States\n\nv. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604 (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasis added).            In\n\nthis case, the conspiracy charged was a conspiracy to distribute\n\ndrugs at Las Malvinas, rather than to Las Malvinas.           Thus, retail\n\ndrug sales could clearly be relevant uncharged conduct for the\n\npurposes of the drug quantity determination.        What matters in this\n\ncase is whether the retail sales were \"acts that were reasonably\n\nforeseeable\" by González-Vélez \"in furtherance of the conspiracy\"\n\nto distribute drugs at Las Malvinas.        Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1197.\n\nBecause we find no error in the district court's determination that\n\nthe retail sales were acts reasonably foreseeable by González-Vélez\n\nin   furtherance   of   the   conspiracy,   we   find   no   error   in   the\n\nattribution of the full five kilograms of cocaine to González-\n\nVélez.6   We therefore affirm the district court's calculation of a\n\nBOL of 32.\n\n\n6\n   Moreover, contrary to González-Vélez's argument, this court has\nnever held that a quantity attributable to a conspiracy member is\ndependent on either the number of roles he had or the supervisory\nnature of his role. The cases on which González-Vélez relies to\nsupport this proposition, if properly read, do not help him. In\nPizarro-Berríos, we did not hold the defendant responsible for the\nconspiracy-wide financial damages merely because he had multiple\nroles; rather, we held that because the defendant was a friend of\none of the heads of the scheme and served as his bodyguard, the\ndefendant was in a position to know how much money was being\nstolen. 448 F.3d at 8-9. In Rodríguez, defendant Rodríguez's role\nas controller of the drug point made it clear that he could foresee\nhow much crack was sold there. 162 F.3d at 140, 149.\n\n                                   -31-\n\fC. Denial of the 2-Level Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n           González-Vélez argues that the district court committed\n\nreversible error by failing to explain why it denied his request\n\nfor a two-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. González-Vélez argues\n\nthat his eligibility for the reduction was a disputed issue of\n\nfact, and hence that the district court violated Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32(i)(3)(B) by failing to rule on his request.7\n\n           Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B), the sentencing court\n\nmust, for any disputed matter, \"rule on the dispute or determine\n\nthat a ruling is unnecessary.\"            We review a district court's\n\ncompliance with Fed. R. Crim. P. 32 de novo, and will remand if an\n\nerror    occurred   that   was   not   harmless.     United    States   v.\n\nGuadalupe-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202910\"><a href=\"/opinion/202910/united-states-v-guadalupe-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 2007).            We review a\n\ndistrict court's judgment about acceptance of responsibility for\n\nclear error.    United States v. Deppe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203069\"><a href=\"/opinion/203069/united-states-v-deppe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n\n\n\n7\n   González-Vélez also argues that the alleged failure to rule on\nthe acceptance of responsibility issue violates 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(c)(1). We need not address this argument in detail because\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1) does not apply to rulings on acceptance of\nresponsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. Section 3553(c)(1) applies\nto the court's choice of a sentence within a guideline range. See\nsupra n.4.    In contrast, U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 affects the offense\nlevel, from which the GSR is calculated.         Thus, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(c)(1) does not come into play until after a decision\nis made on the appropriate offense level.\n\n                                   -32-\n\f            Here, we find no error in the district court's compliance\n\nwith Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B).            The PSR before the district\n\ncourt upon remand for re-sentencing was the same report that was\n\nused in González-Vélez's original sentencing.                At the March 27,\n\n2007 pre-sentence hearing, the court stated that because the PSR\n\nwas \"the same as the last time . . . any objections that were made\n\nat the last time and taken care of . . . were taken care of and\n\nruled upon by the Court.\"       The court then allowed González-Vélez's\n\ncounsel    to   present   her   objections    again,   \"if    she   feels   it's\n\nnecessary.\"     In response, González-Vélez's counsel stated that she\n\nand her client \"renew[ed] [their] request for granting points [sic]\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility.\"\n\n            It is clear that the request for a reduction at the\n\nMarch 27, 2007 hearing was not a new objection, but rather a\n\nreiteration of a previous objection. Therefore, it was correct for\n\nthe district court to rest on its previous resolution of this\n\nissue.     Moreover, the district court properly complied with Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 32(i)(B)(3) when it addressed the responsibility issue\n\nat the original sentencing hearing. At that hearing, the court had\n\nnoted that González-Vélez \"went to trial at his own choice, with\n\nadequate counsel.\" González-Vélez had argued that the fact that he\n\nwent to trial should not be held against him, because he could not\n\nreach an agreement with the prosecutor regarding drug quantity.\n\nHowever,    the   court   had   said   that    it   would    not    \"take   into\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fconsideration\" the fact that the pre-trial plea negotiations were\n\n\"not fruitful.\" As we note below, a criminal defendant's choice to\n\ngo   to   trial   weighs   very   heavily    against   granting   a   downward\n\nadjustment    for    acceptance     of   responsibility;     only     in   rare\n\ncircumstances can the defendant overcome this effect, and the\n\nfailure of plea negotiations is generally not such a circumstance.\n\nIn light of this reality, we find the district court's discussion\n\nof the responsibility issue at the original hearing sufficient for\n\nthe purposes of Rule 32(i)(B)(3).           Because the district court had\n\nalready ruled on the responsibility issue in compliance with Rule\n\n32(i)(B)(3) at the original sentencing hearing, we find no error in\n\nthe district court's decision not to address the issue again at the\n\nMarch 27, 2007 pre-sentence hearing.\n\n                              III. Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's sentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\f</pre>",
