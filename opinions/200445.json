Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michele J. Woods, with whom Joshua D. Franklin was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 29, 2003\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. This appeal involves, in part, the\n\nunusual claim that the defendant Michael Newton's retrial was\n\nbarred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V, because\n\nthe trial judge intentionally provoked his request for a mistrial.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n           Newton was indicted with Wyman Hogan, Ernest Membrino and\n\nEdward Hall on October 12, 2000, by a federal grand jury sitting in\n\nthe District of New Hampshire, and charged with conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute and to distribute fifty grams or\n\nmore of cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and 846. The facts of the conspiracy\n\npertain   to   an   extensive    operation    of   buying   powder   cocaine,\n\nmanufacturing crack cocaine, and selling both powder and crack\n\ncocaine from a number of residences in and around the Keene, New\n\nHampshire area.      Newton was primarily charged in connection with\n\nthe sale of cocaine in Keene, but outside of the residences\n\nallegedly controlled by the conspiracy's crack cocaine distribution\n\noperation.\n\n           On January 2, 2001, prior to jury selection, co-defendant\n\nEdward Hall notified the district court that he would present a\n\ndefense that would portray the co-defendants in an unfavorable\n\nlight, and moved to sever his case from the other defendants.             The\n\ndistrict court denied this motion.           The other three co-defendants\n\nthen moved for severance. The district court likewise denied their\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fmotion and proceeded to trial. After the jury was sworn, defendant\n\nHall's counsel delivered an opening statement that corroborated\n\nmuch       of   the   government's    version    of   events.    The    other   co-\n\ndefendants renewed their request for severance and moved for a\n\nmistrial, which the district court granted.               The retrial commenced\n\non January 16, 2001, and resulted in Newton's conviction for\n\nconspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine.\n\nOn May 16, 2001, Newton was sentenced to two hundred and thirty-\n\nfive       months'    imprisonment,    to   be   followed   by   five   years    of\n\nsupervised release.1\n\n                Newton appeals both the conviction and the sentence,\n\narguing that his retrial after an initial mistrial was prohibited\n\nby the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V, that the\n\nprosecutor violated Newton's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent\n\nby impermissibly commenting during closing argument on Newton's\n\nfailure to testify, and that the district court committed an error\n\n\n\n       1\n       Hogan was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent\nto distribute more than fifty grams of a substance containing\namounts of cocaine and cocaine base, and possession of cocaine\nbase.   He was sentenced to two hundred and sixty-two months'\nimprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release.\nMembrino was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to\ndistribute more than fifty grams of a substance containing amounts\nof cocaine and cocaine base and was sentenced to one hundred and\nfifty-one months' imprisonment, to be followed by five years of\nsupervised release. Hall was tried separately and convicted of\nmanaging a residence for the purpose of manufacturing, storing,\ndistributing and using cocaine and cocaine base. He was sentenced\nto twenty-four months of imprisonment and three years of supervised\nrelease.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fof   law   during    sentencing    by   failing   to   exercise   independent\n\njudgment on evidence presented pertinent to sentencing.               For the\n\nreasons stated below, we affirm Newton's conviction and decline to\n\nset aside his sentence.\n\n                             II.   Double Jeopardy\n\n            The     Double   Jeopardy    Clause   of   the   Fifth   Amendment\n\nprotects a defendant in a criminal proceeding against repeated\n\nprosecutions for the same offense.            United States v. Dinitz, 424\n\nU.S. 600, 606 (1976).        However, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not\n\nan absolute bar to successive trials. Justices of Boston Municipal\n\nCourt v. Lydon, 466 U.S. 294, 308 (1984).          The protection embodied\n\nin the Double Jeopardy Clause is a personal defense that may be\n\nwaived or foreclosed by a defendant's voluntary actions, including\n\na request for, or effectual consent to, a mistrial.            United States\n\nv. DiPietro, 936 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1991).            Thus, in this case of\n\nretrial following the declaration of a mistrial, the key question\n\nfor double jeopardy purposes is whether the mistrial was declared\n\nwith the defendant's consent.\n\n            If a mistrial is declared with the defendant's\n            consent, she is deemed to have waived any\n            double jeopardy claim she might otherwise\n            have.   If, on the other hand, the defendant\n            wishes to proceed to a verdict by the jury\n            empaneled to try her, and the court declares a\n            mistrial over her objection, the Double\n            Jeopardy Clause will bar the defendant's\n            retrial unless manifest necessity required the\n            court to so act.\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fUnited States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(citing Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 608).     The only circumstance in which\n\nthe defendant's consent to a mistrial does not operate as a waiver\n\nof her right to claim double jeopardy is where the prosecutor or\n\nthe judge intentionally provokes the defendant to request the\n\nmistrial: \"the circumstances under which [] a defendant may invoke\n\nthe bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are\n\nlimited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the\n\nsuccessful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the\n\ndefendant into moving for a mistrial.\" Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S.\n\n667, 678 (1982) (emphasis added).     Here, Newton insists that the\n\ntrial judge intentionally provoked his mistrial request.\n\nA.   Sequence of Events\n\n           To evaluate Newton's claim we must examine closely the\n\nsequence of events that prompted the judge to declare a mistrial,\n\nand what transpired between the judge and Newton's trial counsel.\n\nDefendant Hall's counsel first raised the issue of severance\n\nimmediately prior to jury selection.    Based on the vague assertion\n\nof a defense strategy that would be antagonistic to the other\n\ndefendants, Hall's counsel requested that Hall be severed from the\n\nother three defendants.    After requesting but failing to obtain\n\ndetails elucidating the proposed defense, the trial judge denied\n\nthe motion.   The three other defendants then made a joint motion to\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fsever based on Hall's request.          The judge similarly denied this\n\nmotion and proceeded to empanel the jury and begin the trial.\n\n            During     his    opening      statement,     Hall's    counsel\n\ncharacterized Hall as \"a victim . . . not a criminal\" and claimed\n\nthat Hall \"was used\" by his codefendants.         There were no immediate\n\nobjections by the other defendants to the defense outlined in\n\nHall's opening statement.      The following morning, however, counsel\n\nfor one of the other defendants noted Hall's antagonistic defense\n\nand raised the possibility of renewing the motion to sever Hall\n\nfrom the trial.       Newton's counsel joined in the renewed motion.\n\nThe judge reserved ruling on the motion until the afternoon.\n\n            That afternoon, during an extensive colloquy on the\n\nmotion to    sever,    the   judge   explained   to   defense   counsel   his\n\nposition on the motion:\n\n            I will not grant any motion to sever unless I\n            do an individual inquiry with each defendant\n            and ascertain from each defendant that they\n            understand what this means; that their case is\n            being severed that a mistrial is being granted\n            that they are waiving any double-jeopardy\n            claim that they may have; that they fully\n            understand that if they want to go ahead with\n            trial with the current jury, they can.\n\n            . . .\n\n            [I]f I were to grant a mistrial based on the\n            defendants' request for a mistrial because of\n            the failure to grant severance and the trial\n            evidence jointly being prejudicial to the\n            defendants in their eyes, I could grant that\n            request and not make a finding of manifest\n            necessity, and notwithstanding the absence of\n            a   finding   of  manifest   necessity,   the\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          defendants     could     be    reprosecuted,\n          notwithstanding the double-jeopardy clause.\n\nIn other words, the judge was telling the defendants that if they\n\nrequested a mistrial and he granted this request despite the\n\nabsence of manifest necessity for declaring such a mistrial, the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause would not bar their reprosecution.   Counsel\n\nfor one of the other defendants immediately interjected: \"we don't\n\nagree with that . . . if the case law supports the position that\n\nthis trial has gone so far that jeopardy has attached . . . and\n\nthat they're unable to be retried again and that it should be with\n\nprejudice, of course, we're not waiving that.\"   Realizing that the\n\ndefendants did not seem to understand the relationship between\n\ntheir request for a mistrial and their waiver of the double\n\njeopardy bar, the court offered further explanation:\n\n          Supreme Court precedent makes very clear that\n          where a defendant requests a mistrial, he\n          waives any right he has to assert that a\n          reprosecution gives rise to a double-jeopardy\n          violation . . . I can grant a mistrial over a\n          defendant's objection without presenting a\n          double-jeopardy question, only where there is\n          a manifest necessity . . . I don't think I\n          could make a manifest necessity finding here\n          unless I could conclude that there was an\n          overwhelming probability that the jury could\n          disregard my instructions to disregard any\n          comments in [Hall's] opening statement. . . I\n          couldn't make that finding. I couldn't find\n          manifest necessity.\n\n          Based on this determination that there was no manifest\n\nnecessity for a mistrial, the judge thoroughly explained to the\n\ndefendants their options regarding severance and mistrial:\n\n                               -7-\n\f         If [Hall] wants a mistrial and severance and\n         all three [other] defendants want a mistrial\n         and severance I could do either of two things.\n         I could either grant the severance motion and\n         mistrial as to [Hall] and proceed to trial\n         with the three defendants, giving a limiting\n         instruction to the jury to disregard [Hall's]\n         opening statement, or I could grant a\n         severance and mistrial as to the three\n         defendants, continue on with [Hall] and give\n         an instruction to the jury to disregard any\n         evidence that we determine is admissible\n         against the three but not against [Hall].\n\n         I at this time am not persuaded by any\n         argument that the defendants may have that\n         mistrial   is  absolutely   required   because\n         there's manifest necessity for a mistrial, but\n         nevertheless, if they want a mistrial and\n         there's a potential for reprosecution and\n         double-jeopardy issues are plainly addressed,\n         I'm willing to consider granting everyone\n         mistrials and just starting again with\n         separate trials for the two groups.\n\nThe judge then addressed each attorney individually to ascertain\n\nhow the defendants wished to proceed.\n\n          The Court:   Let me hear from the defendants.\n                       Let me go through one at a time.\n                       [Counsel for Membrino], what does\n                       your client wish to do?\n\n          Counsel 1:   Mr. Membrino has informed me that\n                       he wishes to sever the trial and\n                       he will waive his right to a --\n\n          The Court:   So he wants to sever and ask for a\n                       mistrial.\n\n          Counsel 1:   Sever and a mistrial, yes, your\n                       Honor.\n\n          The Court:   All right. What does your client\n                       want to do, [Counsel for Hogan]?\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f            Counsel 2:    Judge, I've conferred with him.\n                          Based upon the readings from the\n                          Court as to what the status of the\n                          law is on that, we're willing to -\n                          - what we want to see done is the\n                          case be severed, mistrial and\n                          severance. He will waive his --\n                          he will not assert his rights to\n                          double jeopardy.\n\n            The Court:    All right.     And [Counsel for\n                          Newton], what do you want to do?\n\n            Counsel 3:    We'd like to sever Mr. Hall and\n                          proceed.\n\n            The Court:    And proceed?\n\n            Counsel 3:    Or   to  have   a  mistrial with\n                          prejudice.   He does not want to\n                          waive his right to any claims.\n\nThus, at this point, two of the remaining defendants requested\n\nseverance   of   Hall    and   a   mistrial,   whereas    Newton    requested\n\nseverance   of   Hall    and   continuation    of   the   trial    before   the\n\nempaneled jury.    The judge understood Newton's alternate request\n\nfor \"mistrial with prejudice\" to mean that if the judge granted a\n\nmistrial and forced Newton to go to trial later with a new jury, it\n\nwould be over Newton's objection and that therefore, since the\n\njudge had already determined that there was no manifest necessity\n\nfor a mistrial, double jeopardy might bar Newton's retrial.\n\n            With only Newton wishing to proceed with the empaneled\n\njury, the judge made clear that he accepted the need for two trials\n\n-- one for Hall and another for the other three defendants -- but\n\nthat he was \"not going to . . . go through two separate trials for\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthat group of three.\"       The three remaining defendants would be\n\ntried together, either now with the empaneled jury or later with a\n\nnew jury.    He would not permit three trials: one for Newton before\n\nthe empaneled jury, a separate trial for Hall before another jury,\n\nand a third trial for the other two defendants before yet another\n\njury.     Because   of   this   requirement   that   the   three   remaining\n\ndefendants be tried together, and because he would not grant Newton\n\na mistrial over his objection, the judge confronted Newton with a\n\nchoice:     he could persist in his desire to be tried before the\n\nempaneled jury and thereby override the requests of the other two\n\ndefendants for a mistrial and a trial before a different jury; or\n\nhe could join them in their requests for a mistrial and hence waive\n\nany claim that double jeopardy bars retrial.                After a brief\n\nconference with the other defense attorneys, Newton's attorney\n\nindicated that Newton would \"waive his double jeopardy rights and\n\nask for a mistrial.\"\n\n            Before accepting this choice, the district court was\n\ncommendably careful to ensure that the defendant understood the\n\nconsequences of his decision to request a mistrial. In an extended\n\ncolloquy, the judge ascertained that Newton understood that he has\n\na constitutional right not to be tried twice on the same charge and\n\nthat by choosing to move for a mistrial, Newton would be giving up\n\nthis right:\n\n            The Court:          . . . But if you don't want a\n                                trial now, you have to understand\n\n                                      -10-\n\f                              that you will be retried again and\n                              you will give up your right to\n                              claim double jeopardy -- that\n                              double jeopardy prevents your\n                              retrial. Do you understand that?\n\n          Newton:             Yes, I do.\n\n          The Court:          Are you willing to give up that\n                              right?\n\n          Newton:             Yes.\n\nAfter this clarification of the consequences of requesting a\n\nmistrial, there was no further talk by Newton of a mistrial with\n\nprejudice.\n\nB.   Legal Analysis\n\n             On appeal, accepting that he \"reluctantly agreed to waive\n\nhis double jeopardy rights,\" Newton now argues that the trial judge\n\n\"induced\" him to do so by exerting pressure on him to request a\n\nmistrial to avoid the consequences of the judge's error in the\n\ndenial of the pre-trial motion to sever \"despite numerous warnings\n\nfrom counsel for Mr. Hall regarding Mr. Hall's anticipated defense\n\nstrategy.\"     He elaborates on this renewed demand for a \"mistrial\n\nwith prejudice\" as follows:\n\n             In the wake of that error and consequent\n             prejudice introduced in the opening statement\n             of Mr. Hall's counsel, the trial court should\n             have known that any conviction arising out of\n             the first trial likely would be reversed. As\n             such, the trial court presented Mr. Newton\n             with an ultimatum -- continue with an\n             irreparably prejudiced trial, at which Mr.\n             Newton had already been implicated by a co-\n             defendant, or consent to a mistrial.      Mr.\n             Newton was essentially forced to forego his\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            right not to be tried more than once in order\n            to minimize the significance of the trial\n            court's otherwise obvious error.\n\nNewton sees in this scenario a judge who \"intended to provoke the\n\ndefendant into moving for a mistrial,\" and thus argues that his\n\ncase falls within the \"narrow exception\" carved out by Oregon v.\n\nKennedy   to    the   rule    that    \"where       circumstances        develop    not\n\nattributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by\n\nthe defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any\n\nbarrier   to    reprosecution,       even    if    the    defendant's     motion    is\n\nnecessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error.\" Dinitz, 424 U.S.\n\nat 607.\n\n            Newton's \"intentional provocation\" scenario is a creative\n\nrewriting of what transpired at trial.                 The trial judge confronted\n\nNewton with a choice, not an ultimatum:                  he could be tried before\n\nthe empaneled jury with the other two defendants, or he could join\n\nthem in requesting a mistrial, waive his double jeopardy rights,\n\nand be tried with them before a new jury at a later date.                     However,\n\nthe mere fact that Newton was offered a choice of two imperfect\n\noptions does not imply compulsion. \"The criminal process, like the\n\nrest of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring the\n\nmaking of      difficult     judgments      as    to   which   course    to    follow.\n\nAlthough a defendant may have a right, even of constitutional\n\ndimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the Constitution\n\ndoes not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.\"\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fMcKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 41 (2002) (quoting McGautha v.\n\nCalifornia, 402 U.S. 183, 213 (1971)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            If there was any pressure on Newton as he considered the\n\nchoice posed by the court, it came from the co-defendants who\n\npreferred a mistrial.          However, the opportunity for Newton to\n\nproceed   with    the   empaneled    jury     remained,    and   there     is   no\n\nindication that, of the two options available to Newton, the judge\n\npreferred a mistrial for which he saw no manifest necessity.\n\nIndeed, when Newton first indicated that he wanted to proceed with\n\na   limiting   instruction     before   the    empaneled    jury,    the   judge\n\nimmediately determined that\n\n            the thing to do is to consider a potential\n            severance and mistrial as to [Hall] and try\n            the other three together. And they're asking\n            me for a mistrial, and I would deny it on the\n            grounds that there isn't manifest necessity,\n            and I will instruct the jury to disregard.\n\nThe essence of the double jeopardy protection is the right to be\n\ntried by the jury initially empaneled unless manifest necessity\n\nrequires otherwise.       United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 484\n\n(1971) (\"[W]here the judge, acting without the defendant's consent,\n\naborts the proceeding, the defendant has been deprived of his\n\n'valued   right   to    have   his   trial    completed    by    a   particular\n\ntribunal'\") (quoting Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 689 (1949)). To\n\nthis end, the judge took note of the principle articulated in\n\nScott, that \"the important consideration for purposes of the Double\n\n                                     -13-\n\fJeopardy Clause is that the defendant retain primary control over\n\nthe course to be followed in the event of [] error.\"                United States\n\nv. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 93-94 (1978).           Hence, the judge made clear\n\nhis willingness to issue a limiting instruction and proceed with\n\nthe jury already empaneled, thereby preserving Newton's right to be\n\ntried by the original jury and belying Newton's claim that he was\n\nprovoked into requesting a mistrial.                Although he specifically\n\nfound that there was no manifest necessity for judicial declaration\n\nof a mistrial, the judge told the defendants that he would grant\n\ntheir requests for a mistrial so long as they understood that they\n\nwere waiving any double jeopardy claim.             By giving the defendants\n\nthis mistrial option, the judge gave the defendants more latitude\n\nthan was strictly necessary in determining the course of their\n\ntrial.\n\n            When Newton's attorney indicated Newton's preference for\n\na new trial, the judge specifically asked her whether she felt that\n\n\"any improper pressure ha[d] been brought to bear.\"                  She replied\n\nthat she did not.          Nevertheless, the judge agreed to grant a\n\nmistrial    only       after   adequately      informing       Newton        of   the\n\nramifications of requesting a mistrial and determining that \"all of\n\nthe defendants have knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived\n\ntheir    right   to    claim   double    jeopardy    as   a   bar   to   a    second\n\nprosecution.\"         Newton cannot undo the trial judge's scrupulous\n\nattention to the double jeopardy issue with his revisionist account\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fof the trial.       By electing to request a mistrial, Newton waived any\n\ndouble jeopardy claim. His challenge to his retrial and subsequent\n\nconviction on this ground must fail.\n\n                III.    Closing Arguments of the Prosecutor\n\n            Newton claims that he deserves a new trial because of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct arising from statements made to the jury\n\nduring    closing      arguments.          Since       Newton      did   not    make     a\n\ncontemporaneous objection to these statements, we review for plain\n\nerror    the    question    of     whether       the   prosecutor        impermissibly\n\ncommented      on   Newton's     failure    to    testify.         United   States v.\n\nRoberts, 119 F.3d 1006, 1013-14 (1st Cir. 1997). Under plain error\n\nreview, \"the appellant must show (1) the occurrence of an error;\n\n(2) that the error is obvious or clear under current law; and (3)\n\nthat the error substantially and adversely affects the rights of\n\nthe appellant.\"        Id. at 1014.      Remedial discretion in the face of\n\nplain error should be exercised \"if the error seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited States v.        Olano,     507     U.S.    725,      736   (1993)   (citations\n\nomitted).       Because    the     comments       of   the    prosecutor       were    not\n\nimproper, we find no error at all in the trial judge's failure to\n\naddress these comments sua sponte.\n\n            Newton points to two comments made by the prosecutor\n\nduring his rebuttal to the defendants' closing arguments.                         These\n\ncomments must be evaluated in the context of Newton's defense as\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fadvanced in his closing argument. Newton did not present witnesses\n\nor his own testimony to deny his use or possession of drugs.2\n\nInstead,    his   defense   focused    on   the   charge   of   conspiracy,\n\nhighlighted the lack of evidence of an agreement between the\n\nalleged co-conspirators, and questioned the motives of the co-\n\noperating   witnesses.      Specifically,    in   her   closing,   Newton's\n\ncounsel said to the jury:\n\n            The   U.S.  Attorney's   office   has   bought\n            testimony from liars, from thieves, from\n            addicts,   from   dealers,   from   desperate,\n            desperate people.    From people who but for\n            their ability to come in here and say what the\n            U.S. Attorney wants, would most likely spend a\n            significant amount of time in jail.\n\nIn his rebuttal to this closing argument, the prosecutor asked: \"Is\n\nthere any testimony in this case that points otherwise, that really\n\npoints to other people who may have been the leaders, organizers of\n\nthis conspiracy besides these three.        I would suggest to you that\n\nthere was none.\"\n\n            In her closing argument, Newton's attorney also asserted:\n\n\"Mike Newton was a working man.       He worked and we know that because\n\nyou'll see his tax records, tax returns in evidence.\"3          In response\n\n\n     2\n       Newton was the only defendant who called a witness -- Glenn\nMarchand, an ex-police officer who had an interaction with one of\nthe prosecution witnesses. Although it is not entirely clear, the\napparent purpose in calling Marchand was to challenge the\ncredibility of the prosecution witness.\n     3\n       Although Newton's 1998 tax returns were listed on the\nGovernment's Exhibit List, we find no indication that they were\nintroduced at trial. Neither party makes an issue of this possible\n\n                                  -16-\n\fto this argument, the prosecutor stated at the close of his\n\nrebuttal:\n\n             [Defense Counsel] says, well, my client was\n             working and -- because that's what the tax\n             records show.     If you look at those tax\n             records, you will see I believe on the 1999\n             tax record, it says auto mechanic.        Ask\n             yourself was there any testimony in this case\n             indicating that he was involved in repairing\n             cars or anything of that like. I just want to\n             leave you with that thought.\n\nNewton   argues    that     this    statement     and   the   prior     one   by   the\n\nprosecutor constituted prohibited comment on his exercise of the\n\nright to remain silent.\n\n             It is well-established that \"the Fifth Amendment . . .\n\nforbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused's silence\n\nor instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of\n\nguilt.\" Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965).                            A\n\nprosecutor's      comment    does    not   need    to   be    direct;    rather,    a\n\nprosecutor may run afoul of the rule in Griffin by making such\n\ncomments inferentially.            See, e.g., Glantz v. United States, 810\n\nF.2d 316, 322.      Nevertheless, as we have pointed out repeatedly,\n\nthe standard is:\n\n            Whether,   in   the  circumstances   of   the\n            particular case, the language used was\n            manifestly intended or was of such character\n            that the jury would naturally and necessarily\n            take it to be a comment on the failure of the\n            accused to testify.\n\n\n\noversight.\n\n                                        -17-\n\fId. (internal quotations omitted); accord United States v. Taylor,\n\n54 F.3d 967, 979 (1st Cir. 1995).         Moreover, \"when a prosecutor's\n\ncomments, fairly viewed, are susceptible to two plausible meanings,\n\none of which is unexceptionable and one of which is forbidden,\n\ncontext frequently determines meaning.\"          Taylor, 54 F.3d at 979.\n\nIn addition, \"a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor\n\nintends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or\n\nthat a jury, sitting through a lengthy exhortation, will draw that\n\nmeaning   from   the   plethora   of   less   damaging   interpretations.\"\n\nDonnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 647 (1974).\n\n           With these rules as our guide, we conclude readily that\n\nthe prosecutor's comments did not run afoul of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nTo support his claim, advanced in closing argument, that the tax\n\nrecords established that he was a working man with a source of\n\nincome – namely, an auto mechanic - Newton \"would not have had to\n\nrely on his own testimony.\"       United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).       Knowledge of his work would easily have been\n\nwithin the competence of other witnesses who could have testified\n\nat the trial.    Hence, this is not a situation \"when contradiction\n\n[of the government's case] would have required the defendant to\n\ntake the stand,\"   United States v. Flannery, 451 F.2d 880, 881 (1st\n\nCir. 1971), and hence the prosecutor's question in rebuttal (\"Ask\n\nyourself was there any testimony in this case indicating that he\n\nwas involved in repairing cars or anything of that like.\") did not\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fconstitute inappropriate comment on the defendant's failure to\n\ntestify.   See Bey, 188 F.3d at 9; Flannery, 451 F.2d at 882.\n\n           When the prosecutor asked in rebuttal if there was any\n\ntestimony in the case that \"really points to other people who may\n\nhave been the leaders, organizers of this conspiracy besides these\n\nthree,\" he was responding to the theory of the defense, also\n\nadvanced in closing argument, that the prosecution witnesses who\n\ntestified about the role of the defendants in the drug conspiracy\n\nshould not be believed because they were \"liars . . . thieves . .\n\n. addicts . . . desperate, desperate people.\"               Viewed in context,\n\nthe prosecutor's question is a \"comment on the plausibility of the\n\ndefense theory . . . [T]he government is entitled, to some extent,\n\nto comment on a defendant's failure to produce evidence supporting\n\nthe defense theory of the case.\"           Glantz, 810 F.2d at 321.      Hence\n\nthe comment   at    issue    did    not   constitute   improper     comment   on\n\nNewton's exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n                              IV.    Sentencing\n\n           Newton   was     convicted     by   the   jury   of   conspiracy   to\n\ndistribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine.               In response to\n\na special question on the verdict form, the jury specifically found\n\nthat \"Michael Newton reasonably foresaw while he was a member of\n\nthe conspiracy that the conspirators possessed with intent to\n\ndistribute and/or intended to possess with intent to distribute\n\nfifty grams or more of crack cocaine as part of the conspiracy.\"\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fBased on this finding, the prosecution argued at sentencing that\n\nthe   weight    of    \"all   buys   occurring    during   the   course   of   the\n\nconspiracy . . .\" should be attributable to him for sentencing\n\npurposes.\n\n            The sentencing judge found \"by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence\"      that    one   hundred   and      fifty   grams   of   crack    was\n\nattributable to Newton based on the fact that he was a member of\n\nthe conspiracy:\n\n            The conspiracy was to distribute in excess of\n            one hundred and fifty grams of crack. While\n            Mr. Newton was a member of the conspiracy, he\n            could reasonably foresee that in fact that was\n            the objective of the conspiracy during the\n            time that he was a member of it, and therefore\n            it is my judgement that that crack should be\n            attributed to him for purposes of sentencing.\"\n\nBased on this finding, the judge gave Newton \"the lightest sentence\n\nfor a level thirty six, criminal history category three defendant\n\nthat I can give you, which is two hundred and thirty-five months.\"\n\nHe added that, even if he had found that only fifty to one hundred\n\nand fifty grams of crack cocaine had been attributable to Newton,\n\nhe \"still would have given him a two hundred and thirty-five-month\n\nsentence because two hundred and thirty-five months would have been\n\nwithin the applicable range there.\"\n\n            Newton argues that his sentence should be vacated because\n\nthe district court erred as a matter of law by failing to \"exercise\n\nindependent judgment\" in its consideration of evidence pertinent to\n\nsentencing. The sentencing court's duty \"independently to consider\n\n                                       -20-\n\fproffered information that is relevant to matters of consequence in\n\nthe sentencing determination,\" United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d\n\n301, 307 (1st Cir. 1993), derives from the Due Process Clause,\n\nwhich guarantees every defendant a \"right to be sentenced upon\n\ninformation which is not false or materially incorrect.\"                     Id. at\n\n305.     Specifically,     Newton     argues       that   the    district     court\n\nimproperly disregarded the testimony on the extent of Newton's\n\ninvolvement in and knowledge of the conspiracy, and failed to\n\nconsider Newton's arguments on the quantity of drugs attributable\n\nto him for sentencing purposes.\n\n             Section 6A1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines\n\nrequires   that    \"when   any    factor     important     to    the   sentencing\n\ndetermination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given\n\nan   adequate   opportunity      to   present      information    to   the    court\n\nregarding that factor.\"           U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §\n\n6A1.3(a) (2001).       While this provision encompasses a duty to\n\nconsider the information presented, Tavano, 12 F.3d at 306, it does\n\nnot imply a \"duty of blind acceptance.\"                   Id. at 307.         After\n\nexamining the relevant evidence, the sentencing court has broad\n\ndiscretion    to   \"pick   and   choose\"     and    ultimately     credit     trial\n\ntestimony if it carries persuasive force in a particular case. Id.\n\n           Here,     the   district        judge     afforded     Newton      ample\n\nopportunity to submit arguments pertinent to sentencing and gave\n\ncareful and thorough consideration to the arguments presented.\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fWhen it became clear during the initial sentencing hearing that\n\nthere was a dispute as to the quantity of drugs that could be\n\nattributed     to    Newton    for    sentencing       purposes,    the      court\n\nspecifically deferred making a judgment on the weight of the drugs\n\nuntil it received supplemental memoranda from both the parties\n\nsupporting their respective arguments.\n\n           Newton argues that the court ran afoul of its \"duty to\n\nconsider\" by summarily disregarding both the memorandum Newton\n\nsubmitted on the drug quantity4 and Hogan's testimony at the\n\nsentencing hearing regarding the extent of Newton's involvement in\n\nthe conspiracy.      However, unlike Tavano, where the district court\n\n\"formulated a per se rule declaring trial testimony determinative\n\nof drug quantity, to the exclusion of all other evidence bearing up\n\non the same set of transactions,\" Tavano, 12 F.3d at 304-05, the\n\ndistrict     court   here     carefully      read    Newton's   memoranda     and\n\nconsidered the evidence before making an independent determination\n\nthat his arguments were without merit.              The court not only allowed\n\nHogan's    testimony     but     it   also     questioned       Hogan   on    the\n\n\n\n     4\n       Newton initially submitted two memoranda but subsequently\nfiled a motion to withdraw one. The court cautioned Newton that\n\"the memo that you are left with takes a position that is frivolous\nbased on the facts of this case and I will never accept it.\"\nDespite Newton's insistence that the memorandum the court deemed\nmore beneficial to Newton be withdrawn, the court stated: \"I've\nread [the withdrawn] memo, and if I think there's anything in it\nthat will benefit Mr. Newton, I will give him the benefit of those\narguments.\"    This statement further demonstrates the court's\nwillingness to consider the totality of the evidence presented.\n\n                                      -22-\n\finconsistencies between the testimony offered and the confession\n\nthat    he     made    during    his    own    sentencing.       Based    on   these\n\ndiscrepancies, the court found Hogan to be an unreliable witness\n\nand    did    not     credit   his    testimony.     These     are   precisely   the\n\ndeterminations of fact that the sentencing court has discretion to\n\nmake.        Because it adequately considered the proffered evidence\n\nrelevant to sentencing, the court did not offend the dictates of\n\ndue process set forth in Tavano.                Therefore, it did not err as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n               We     review    for    clear     error   the    court's    factual\n\ndetermination on the quantity of drugs attributable to Newton for\n\nsentencing purposes.            The court found by \"a preponderance of the\n\nevidence\" that, due to his membership in the conspiracy and the\n\nforseeability of the objectives of the conspiracy, 150 grams of\n\ncrack were attributable to Newton.              Contrary to Newton's argument,\n\nthe sentencing court is not required to make explicit factual\n\nfindings on the details of each transaction conducted in the course\n\nof the conspiracy, when such findings have been detailed at trial\n\nand in the submissions of the parties.              Tavano, 12 F.3d at 307 (\"As\n\na general rule, a trial court lawfully may make implicit findings\n\nwith regard to sentencing matters, incorporating by reference\n\nsuitably detailed suggestions limned in the PSI Report or advanced\n\nby a party.\").         Thus, it was well within the bounds of the court's\n\ndiscretion to credit evidence produced at trial and set forth in\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fthe government's sentencing memorandum.5      Therefore, we reject\n\nNewton's argument that the court erred in its determination of the\n\nquantity of drugs attributable to Newton for sentencing purposes.\n\n                          V.   Conclusion\n\n          The district court was thorough, fair and legally correct\n\nat all stages of Newton's trial.   For the reasons stated above, the\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       Newton complains that the court failed to resolve a dispute\nover conversion of powder cocaine to crack cocaine. However, in\nthe absence of expert testimony on the relative weights, the court\ndid not consider the government's argument that Newton sold more\nthan 150 grams of crack based on his purchase of more than 150\ngrams of powder cocaine.     Therefore, the court restricted its\ndetermination of the quantity of crack attributable to Newton to\nthe amount sold by the conspiracy of which Newton was reasonably\naware.   Because this removed from the sentencing equation the\nquantity of crack cocaine that could be made from the powder\ncocaine that Newton purchased, this decision not to make a\nconversion finding worked in Newton's favor.\n\n                                -24-\n\f",

V, because the trial judge intentionally provoked his request for a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton was indicted with Wyman Hogan, Ernest Membrino and Edward Hall on October 12, 2000, by a federal grand jury sitting in the District of New Hampshire, and charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and 846. The facts of the conspiracy pertain to an extensive operation of buying powder cocaine, manufacturing crack cocaine, and selling both powder and crack cocaine from a number of residences in and around the Keene, New Hampshire area. Newton was primarily charged in connection with the sale of cocaine in Keene, but outside of the residences allegedly controlled by the conspiracy's crack cocaine distribution operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2001, prior to jury selection, co-defendant Edward Hall notified the district court that he would present a defense that would portray the co-defendants in an unfavorable light, and moved to sever his case from the other defendants. The district court denied this motion. The other three co-defendants then moved for severance. The district court likewise denied their motion and proceeded to trial. After the jury was sworn, defendant Hall's counsel delivered an opening statement that corroborated much of the government's version of events. The other co-defendants renewed their request for severance and moved for a mistrial, which the district court granted. The retrial commenced on January 16, 2001, and resulted in Newton's conviction for conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine. On May 16, 2001, Newton was sentenced to two hundred and thirty-five months' imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton appeals both the conviction and the sentence, arguing that his retrial after an initial mistrial was prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V, that the prosecutor violated Newton's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent by impermissibly commenting during closing argument on Newton's failure to testify, and that the district court committed an error of law during sentencing by failing to exercise independent judgment on evidence presented pertinent to sentencing. For the reasons stated below, we affirm Newton's conviction and decline to set aside his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects a defendant in a criminal proceeding against repeated prosecutions for the same offense. <i>United States v. Dinitz,</i> 424 U.S. 600, 606, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976). However, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not an absolute bar to successive trials. <i>Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon,</i> 466 U.S. 294, 308, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984). The protection embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause is a personal defense that may be waived or foreclosed by a defendant's voluntary actions, including a request for, or effectual consent to, a mistrial. <i>United States v. DiPietro,</i> 936 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir.1991). Thus, in this case of retrial following the declaration of a mistrial, the key question for double jeopardy purposes is whether the mistrial was declared with the defendant's consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a mistrial is declared with the defendant's consent, she is deemed to have waived any double jeopardy claim she might otherwise have. If, on the other hand, the defendant wishes to proceed to a verdict by the jury empaneled to try her, and the court declares a mistrial over her objection, the Double Jeopardy Clause will bar the defendant's retrial unless manifest necessity required the court to so act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta,</i> 957 F.2d 18, 22 (1st Cir.1992) (citing <i>Dinitz,</i> 424 U.S. at 608, 96 S.Ct. 1075). The only circumstance in which the defendant's consent to a mistrial does not operate as a waiver of her right to claim double jeopardy is where the prosecutor or the judge intentionally provokes the defendant to request the mistrial: \"the circumstances under which [ ] a defendant may invoke the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are limited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was <i>intended</i> to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\" <i>Oregon v. Kennedy,</i> 456 U.S. 667, 678, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982) (emphasis added). Here, Newton insists that the trial judge intentionally provoked his mistrial request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sequence of Events</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To evaluate Newton's claim we must examine closely the sequence of events that prompted the judge to declare a mistrial, and what transpired between the judge and Newton's trial counsel. Defendant Hall's counsel first raised the issue of severance immediately prior to jury selection. Based on the vague assertion of a defense strategy that would be antagonistic to the other defendants, Hall's counsel requested that Hall be severed from the other three defendants. After requesting but failing to obtain details elucidating the proposed defense, the trial judge denied the motion. The three other defendants then made a joint motion to sever based on Hall's request. The judge similarly denied this motion and proceeded to empanel the jury and begin the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his opening statement, Hall's counsel characterized Hall as \"a victim ... not a criminal\" and claimed that Hall \"was used\" by his codefendants. There were no immediate objections by the other defendants to the defense outlined in Hall's opening statement. The following morning, however, counsel for one of the other defendants noted Hall's antagonistic defense and raised the possibility of renewing the motion to sever Hall from the trial. Newton's counsel joined in the renewed motion. The judge reserved ruling on the motion until the afternoon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That afternoon, during an extensive colloquy on the motion to sever, the judge explained to defense counsel his position on the motion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will not grant any motion to sever unless I do an individual inquiry with each defendant and ascertain from each defendant that they understand what this means; that their case is being severed that a mistrial is being granted that they are waiving any double-jeopardy claim that they may have; that they fully understand that if they want to go ahead with trial with the current jury, they can.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f I were to grant a mistrial based on the defendants' request for a mistrial because of the failure to grant severance and the trial evidence jointly being prejudicial to the defendants in their eyes, I could grant that request and not make a finding of manifest necessity, and notwithstanding the absence of a finding of manifest necessity, the defendants could be reprosecuted, notwithstanding the double-jeopardy clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the judge was telling the defendants that if they requested a mistrial and he granted this request despite the absence of manifest necessity for declaring such a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not bar their reprosecution. Counsel for one of the other defendants immediately interjected: \"we don't agree with that ... if the case law supports the position that this trial has gone so far that jeopardy has attached ... and that they're unable to be retried again and that it should be with prejudice, of course, we're not waiving that.\" Realizing that the defendants did not seem to understand the relationship between their request for a mistrial and their waiver of the double jeopardy bar, the court offered further explanation: Supreme Court precedent makes very clear that where a defendant <i>requests</i> a mistrial, he waives any right he has to assert that a reprosecution gives rise to a double-jeopardy violation ... I can grant a mistrial <i>over a defendant's objection</i> without presenting a double-jeopardy question, only where there is a manifest necessity ... I don't think I could make a manifest necessity finding here unless I could conclude that there was an overwhelming probability that the jury could disregard my instructions to disregard any comments in [Hall's] opening statement ... I couldn't make that finding. I couldn't find manifest necessity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this determination that there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial, the judge thoroughly explained to the defendants their options regarding severance and mistrial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If [Hall] wants a mistrial and severance and all three [other] defendants want a mistrial and severance I could do either of two things. I could either grant the severance motion and mistrial as to [Hall] and proceed to trial with the three defendants, giving a limiting instruction to the jury to disregard [Hall's] opening statement, or I could grant a severance and mistrial as to the three defendants, continue on with [Hall] and give an instruction to the jury to disregard any evidence that we determine is admissible against the three but not against [Hall].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I at this time am not persuaded by any argument that the defendants may have that mistrial is absolutely required because there's manifest necessity for a mistrial, but nevertheless, if they want a mistrial and there's a potential for reprosecution and double-jeopardy issues are plainly addressed, I'm willing to consider granting everyone mistrials and just starting again with separate trials for the two groups.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge then addressed each attorney individually to ascertain how the defendants wished to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Let me hear from the defendants. Let me go through one at a time. [Counsel for Membrino], what does your client wish to do?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel 1: Mr. Membrino has informed me that he wishes to sever the trial and he will waive his right to a &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: So he wants to sever and ask for a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel 1: Sever and a mistrial, yes, your Honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: All right. What does your client want to do, [Counsel for Hogan]?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel 2: Judge, I've conferred with him. Based upon the readings from the Court as to what the status of the law is on that, we're willing to &#8212; what we want to see done is the case be severed, mistrial and severance. He will waive his &#8212; he will not assert his rights to double jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: All right. And [Counsel for Newton], what do you want to do?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel 3: We'd like to sever Mr. Hall and proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: And proceed?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel 3: Or to have a mistrial with prejudice. He does not want to waive his right to any claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, at this point, two of the remaining defendants requested severance of Hall and a mistrial, whereas Newton requested severance of Hall and continuation of the trial before the empaneled jury. The judge understood Newton's alternate request for \"mistrial with prejudice\" to mean that if the judge granted a mistrial and forced Newton to go to trial later with a new jury, it would be over Newton's objection and that therefore, since the judge had already determined that there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial, double jeopardy might bar Newton's retrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With only Newton wishing to proceed with the empaneled jury, the judge made clear that he accepted the need for two trials &#8212; one for Hall and another for the other three defendants &#8212; but that he was \"not going to ... go through two separate trials for that group of three.\" The three remaining defendants would be tried together, either now with the empaneled jury or later with a new jury. He would not permit three trials: one for Newton before the empaneled jury, a separate trial for Hall before another jury, and a third trial for the other two defendants before yet another jury. Because of this requirement that the three remaining defendants be tried together, and because he would not grant Newton a mistrial over his objection, the judge confronted Newton with a choice: he could persist in his desire to be tried before the empaneled jury and thereby override the requests of the other two defendants for a mistrial and a trial before a different jury; or he could join them in their requests for a mistrial and hence waive any claim that double jeopardy bars retrial. After a brief conference with the other defense attorneys, Newton's attorney indicated that Newton would \"waive his double jeopardy rights and ask for a mistrial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before accepting this choice, the district court was commendably careful to ensure that the defendant understood the consequences of his decision to request a mistrial. In an extended colloquy, the judge ascertained that Newton understood that he has a constitutional right not to be tried twice on the same charge and that by choosing to move for a mistrial, Newton would be giving up this right:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: ... But if you don't want a trial now, you have to understand that you will be retried again and you will give up your right to claim double jeopardy &#8212; that double jeopardy prevents your retrial. Do you understand that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton: Yes, I do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Are you willing to give up that right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this clarification of the consequences of requesting a mistrial, there was no further talk by Newton of a mistrial with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, accepting that he \"reluctantly agreed to waive his double jeopardy rights,\" Newton now argues that the trial judge \"induced\" him to do so by exerting pressure on him to request a mistrial to avoid the consequences of the judge's error in the denial of the pre-trial motion to sever \"despite numerous warnings from counsel for Mr. Hall regarding Mr. Hall's anticipated defense strategy.\" He elaborates on this renewed demand for a \"mistrial with prejudice\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the wake of that error and consequent prejudice introduced in the opening statement of Mr. Hall's counsel, the trial court should have known that any conviction arising out of the first trial likely would be reversed. As such, the trial court presented Mr. Newton with an ultimatum &#8212; continue with an irreparably prejudiced trial, at which Mr. Newton had already been implicated by a co-defendant, or consent to a mistrial. Mr. Newton was essentially forced to forego his right not to be tried more than once in order to minimize the significance of the trial court's otherwise obvious error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton sees in this scenario a judge who \"intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial,\" and thus argues that his case falls within the \"narrow exception\" carved out by <i>Oregon v. Kennedy</i> to the rule that \"where circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant's motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error.\" <i>Dinitz,</i> 424 U.S. at 607, 96 S.Ct. 1075.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton's \"intentional provocation\" scenario is a creative rewriting of what transpired at trial. The trial judge confronted Newton with a choice, not an ultimatum: he could be tried before the empaneled jury with the other two defendants, or he could join them in requesting a mistrial, waive his double jeopardy rights, and be tried with them before a new jury at a later date. However, the mere fact that Newton was offered a choice of two imperfect options does not imply compulsion. \"The criminal process, like the rest of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which course to follow. Although a defendant may have a right, even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.\" <i>McKune v. Lile,</i> 536 U.S. 24, 41, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002) (quoting <i>McGautha v. California,</i> 402 U.S. 183, 213, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there was any pressure on Newton as he considered the choice posed by the court, it came from the co-defendants who preferred a mistrial. However, the opportunity for Newton to proceed with the empaneled jury remained, and there is no indication that, of the two options available to Newton, the judge preferred a mistrial for which he saw no manifest necessity. Indeed, when Newton first indicated that he wanted to proceed with a limiting instruction before the empaneled jury, the judge immediately determined that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the thing to do is to consider a potential severance and mistrial as to [Hall] and try the other three together. And they're asking me for a mistrial, and I would deny it on the grounds that there isn't manifest necessity, and I will instruct the jury to disregard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essence of the double jeopardy protection is the right to be tried by the jury initially empaneled unless manifest necessity requires otherwise. <i>United States v. Jorn,</i> 400 U.S. 470, 484, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) (\"[W]here the judge, acting without the defendant's consent, aborts the proceeding, the defendant has been deprived of his `valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal'\") (quoting <i>Wade v. Hunter,</i> 336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949)). To this end, the judge took note of the principle articulated in <i>Scott,</i> that \"the important consideration for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of [ ] error.\" <i>United States v. Scott,</i> 437 U.S. 82, 93-94, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978). Hence, the judge made clear his willingness to issue a limiting instruction and proceed with the jury already empaneled, thereby preserving Newton's right to be tried by the original jury and belying Newton's claim that he was provoked into requesting a mistrial. Although he specifically found that there was no manifest necessity for judicial declaration of a mistrial, the judge told the defendants that he would grant their requests for a mistrial so long as they understood that they were waiving any double jeopardy claim. By giving the defendants this mistrial option, the judge gave the defendants more latitude than was strictly necessary in determining the course of their trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Newton's attorney indicated Newton's preference for a new trial, the judge specifically asked her whether she felt that \"any improper pressure ha[d] been brought to bear.\" She replied that she did not. Nevertheless, the judge agreed to grant a mistrial only after adequately informing Newton of the ramifications of requesting a mistrial and determining that \"all of the defendants have knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived their right to claim double jeopardy as a bar to a second prosecution.\" Newton cannot undo the trial judge's scrupulous attention to the double jeopardy issue with his revisionist account of the trial. By electing to request a mistrial, Newton waived any double jeopardy claim. His challenge to his retrial and subsequent conviction on this ground must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Closing Arguments of the Prosecutor</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton claims that he deserves a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct arising from statements made to the jury during closing arguments. Since Newton did not make a contemporaneous objection to these statements, we review for plain error the question of whether the prosecutor impermissibly commented on Newton's failure to testify. <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> 119 F.3d 1006, 1013-14 (1st Cir.1997). Under plain error review, \"the appellant must show (1) the occurrence of an error; (2) that the error is obvious or clear under current law; and (3) that the error substantially and adversely affects the rights of the appellant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1014. Remedial discretion in the face of plain error should be exercised \"if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (citations omitted). Because the comments of the prosecutor were not improper, we find no error at all in the trial judge's failure to address these comments sua sponte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton points to two comments made by the prosecutor during his rebuttal to the defendants' closing arguments. These comments must be evaluated in the context of Newton's defense as advanced in his closing argument. Newton did not present witnesses or his own testimony to deny his use or possession of drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Instead, his defense focused on the charge of conspiracy, highlighted the lack of evidence of an agreement between the alleged co-conspirators, and questioned the motives of the co-operating witnesses. Specifically, in her closing, Newton's counsel said to the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. Attorney's office has bought testimony from liars, from thieves, from addicts, from dealers, from desperate, desperate people. From people who but for their ability to come in here and say what the U.S. Attorney wants, would most likely spend a significant amount of time in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his rebuttal to this closing argument, the prosecutor asked: \"Is there any testimony in this case that points otherwise, that really points to other people who may have been the leaders, organizers of this conspiracy besides these three. I would suggest to you that there was none.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her closing argument, Newton's attorney also asserted: \"Mike Newton was a working man. He worked and we know that because you'll see his tax records, tax returns in evidence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In response to this argument, the prosecutor stated at the close of his rebuttal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Defense Counsel] says, well, my client was working and &#8212; because that's what the tax records show. If you look at those tax records, you will see I believe on the 1999 tax record, it says auto mechanic. Ask yourself was there any testimony in this case indicating that he was involved in repairing cars or anything of that like. I just want to leave you with that thought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton argues that this statement and the prior one by the prosecutor constituted prohibited comment on his exercise of the right to remain silent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that \"the Fifth Amendment ... forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused's silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\" <i>Griffin v. California,</i> 380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). A prosecutor's comment does not need to be direct; rather, a prosecutor may run afoul of the rule in <i>Griffin</i> by making such comments inferentially. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir.1987). Nevertheless, as we have pointed out repeatedly, the standard is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted); <i>accord United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 979 (1st Cir.1995). Moreover, \"when a prosecutor's comments, fairly viewed, are susceptible to two plausible meanings, one of which is unexceptionable and one of which is forbidden, context frequently determines meaning.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 979. In addition, \"a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through a lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\" <i>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo,</i> 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these rules as our guide, we conclude readily that the prosecutor's comments did not run afoul of the Fifth Amendment. To support his claim, advanced in closing argument, that the tax records established that he was a working man with a source of income &#8212; namely, an auto mechanic &#8212; Newton \"would not have had to rely on his own testimony.\" <i>United States v. Bey,</i> 188 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1999). Knowledge of his work would easily have been within the competence of other witnesses who could have testified at the trial. Hence, this is not a situation \"when contradiction [of the government's case] would have required the defendant to take the stand,\" <i>United States v. Flannery,</i> 451 F.2d 880, 881 (1st Cir.1971), and hence the prosecutor's question in rebuttal (\"Ask yourself was there any testimony in this case indicating that he was involved in repairing cars or anything of that like.\") did not constitute inappropriate comment on the defendant's failure to testify. <i>See</i> <i>Bey,</i> 188 F.3d at 9; <i>Flannery,</i> 451 F.2d at 882.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the prosecutor asked in rebuttal if there was any testimony in the case that \"really points to other people who may have been the leaders, organizers of this conspiracy besides these three,\" he was responding to the theory of the defense, also advanced in closing argument, that the prosecution witnesses who testified about the role of the defendants in the drug conspiracy should not be believed because they were \"liars ... thieves ... addicts ... desperate, desperate people.\" Viewed in context, the prosecutor's question is a \"comment on the plausibility of the defense theory ... [T]he government is entitled, to some extent, to comment on a defendant's failure to produce evidence supporting the defense theory of the case.\" <i>Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d at 321. Hence the comment at issue did not constitute improper comment on Newton's exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton was convicted by the jury of conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine. In response to a special question on the verdict form, the jury specifically found that \"Michael Newton reasonably foresaw while he was a member of the conspiracy that the conspirators possessed with intent to distribute and/or intended to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine as part of the conspiracy.\" Based on this finding, the prosecution argued at sentencing that the weight of \"all buys occurring during the course of the conspiracy...\" should be attributable to him for sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge found \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that one hundred and fifty grams of crack was attributable to Newton based on the fact that he was a member of the conspiracy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy was to distribute in excess of one hundred and fifty grams of crack. While Mr. Newton was a member of the conspiracy, he could reasonably foresee that in fact that was the objective of the conspiracy during the time that he was a member of it, and therefore it is my judgement that that crack should be attributed to him for purposes of sentencing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this finding, the judge gave Newton \"the lightest sentence for a level thirty six, criminal history category three defendant that I can give you, which is two hundred and thirty-five months.\" He added that, even if he had found that only fifty to one hundred and fifty grams of crack cocaine had been attributable to Newton, he \"still would have given him a two hundred and thirty-five-month sentence because two hundred and thirty-five months would have been within the applicable range there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton argues that his sentence should be vacated because the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to \"exercise independent judgment\" in its consideration of evidence pertinent to sentencing. The sentencing court's duty \"independently to consider proffered information that is relevant to matters of consequence in the sentencing determination,\" <i>United States v. Tavano,</i> 12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st Cir.1993), derives from the Due Process Clause, which guarantees every defendant a \"right to be sentenced upon information which is not false or materially incorrect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 305. Specifically, Newton argues that the district court improperly disregarded the testimony on the extent of Newton's involvement in and knowledge of the conspiracy, and failed to consider Newton's arguments on the quantity of drugs attributable to him for sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 6A1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines requires that \"when any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present information to the court regarding that factor.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &#167; 6A1.3(a) (2001). While this provision encompasses a duty to consider the information presented, <i>Tavano,</i> 12 F.3d at 306, it does not imply a \"duty of blind acceptance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 307. After examining the relevant evidence, the sentencing court has broad discretion to \"pick and choose\" and ultimately credit trial testimony if it carries persuasive force in a particular case. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district judge afforded Newton ample opportunity to submit arguments pertinent to sentencing and gave careful and thorough consideration to the arguments presented. When it became clear during the initial sentencing hearing that there was a dispute as to the quantity of drugs that could be attributed to Newton for sentencing purposes, the court specifically deferred making a judgment on the weight of the drugs until it received supplemental memoranda from both the parties supporting their respective arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton argues that the court ran afoul of its \"duty to consider\" by summarily disregarding both the memorandum Newton submitted on the drug quantity<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and Hogan's testimony at the sentencing hearing regarding the extent of Newton's involvement in the conspiracy. However, unlike <i>Tavano,</i> where the district court \"formulated a per se rule declaring trial testimony determinative of drug quantity, to the exclusion of all other evidence bearing up on the same set of transactions,\" <i>Tavano,</i> 12 F.3d at 304-05, the district court here carefully read Newton's memoranda and considered the evidence before making an independent determination that his arguments were without merit. The court not only allowed Hogan's testimony but it also questioned Hogan on the inconsistencies between the testimony offered and the confession that he made during his own sentencing. Based on these discrepancies, the court found Hogan to be an unreliable witness and did not credit his testimony. These are precisely the determinations of fact that the sentencing court has discretion to make. Because it adequately considered the proffered evidence relevant to sentencing, the court did not offend the dictates of due process set forth in <i>Tavano.</i> Therefore, it did not err as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for clear error the court's factual determination on the quantity of drugs attributable to Newton for sentencing purposes. The court found by \"a preponderance of the evidence\" that, due to his membership in the conspiracy and the foreseeability of the objectives of the conspiracy, 150 grams of crack were attributable to Newton. Contrary to Newton's argument, the sentencing court is not required to make explicit factual findings on the details of each transaction conducted in the course of the conspiracy, when such findings have been detailed at trial and in the submissions of the parties. <i>Tavano,</i> 12 F.3d at 307 (\"As a general rule, a trial court lawfully may make implicit findings with regard to sentencing matters, incorporating by reference suitably detailed suggestions limned in the PSI Report or advanced by a party.\"). Thus, it was well within the bounds of the court's discretion to credit evidence produced at trial and set forth in the government's sentencing memorandum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Therefore, we reject Newton's argument that the court erred in its determination of the quantity of drugs attributable to Newton for sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was thorough, fair and legally correct at all stages of Newton's trial.

Therefore, the court restricted its determination of the quantity of crack attributable to Newton to the amount sold by the conspiracy of which Newton was reasonably aware. Because this removed from the sentencing equation the quantity of crack cocaine that could be made from the powder cocaine that Newton purchased, this decision not to make a conversion finding worked in Newton's favor</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton was indicted with Wyman Hogan, Ernest Membrino and Edward Hall on October 12, 2000, by a federal grand jury sitting in the District of New Hampshire, and charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and 846. The facts of the conspiracy pertain to an extensive operation of buying powder cocaine, manufacturing crack cocaine, and selling both powder and crack cocaine from a number of residences in and around the Keene, New Hampshire area. Newton was primarily charged in connection with the sale of cocaine in Keene, but outside of the residences allegedly controlled by the conspiracy's crack cocaine distribution operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2001, prior to jury selection, co-defendant Edward Hall notified the district court that he would present a defense that would portray the co-defendants in an unfavorable light, and moved to sever his case from the other defendants. The district court denied this motion. The other three co-defendants then moved for severance. The district court likewise denied their motion and proceeded to trial. After the jury was sworn, defendant Hall's counsel delivered an opening statement that corroborated much of the government's version of events. The other co-defendants renewed their request for severance and moved for a mistrial, which the district court granted. The retrial commenced on January 16, 2001, and resulted in Newton's conviction for conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine. On May 16, 2001, Newton was sentenced to two hundred and thirty-five months' imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton appeals both the conviction and the sentence, arguing that his retrial after an initial mistrial was prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V, that the prosecutor violated Newton's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent by impermissibly commenting during closing argument on Newton's failure to testify, and that the district court committed an error of law during sentencing by failing to exercise independent judgment on evidence presented pertinent to sentencing. For the reasons stated below, we affirm Newton's conviction and decline to set aside his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects a defendant in a criminal proceeding against repeated prosecutions for the same offense. <i>United States v.

The protection embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause is a personal defense that may be waived or foreclosed by a defendant's voluntary actions, including a request for, or effectual consent to, a mistrial. <i>United States v.

The only circumstance in which the defendant's consent to a mistrial does not operate as a waiver of her right to claim double jeopardy is where the prosecutor or the judge intentionally provokes the defendant to request the mistrial: \"the circumstances under which [ ] a defendant may invoke the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are limited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was <i>intended</i> to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\" <i>Oregon v.

Here, Newton insists that the trial judge intentionally provoked his mistrial request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sequence of Events</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To evaluate Newton's claim we must examine closely the sequence of events that prompted the judge to declare a mistrial, and what transpired between the judge and Newton's trial counsel. Defendant Hall's counsel first raised the issue of severance immediately prior to jury selection. Based on the vague assertion of a defense strategy that would be antagonistic to the other defendants, Hall's counsel requested that Hall be severed from the other three defendants. After requesting but failing to obtain details elucidating the proposed defense, the trial judge denied the motion. The three other defendants then made a joint motion to sever based on Hall's request. The judge similarly denied this motion and proceeded to empanel the jury and begin the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his opening statement, Hall's counsel characterized Hall as \"a victim ... not a criminal\" and claimed that Hall \"was used\" by his codefendants. There were no immediate objections by the other defendants to the defense outlined in Hall's opening statement. The following morning, however, counsel for one of the other defendants noted Hall's antagonistic defense and raised the possibility of renewing the motion to sever Hall from the trial. Newton's counsel joined in the renewed motion. The judge reserved ruling on the motion until the afternoon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That afternoon, during an extensive colloquy on the motion to sever, the judge explained to defense counsel his position on the motion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will not grant any motion to sever unless I do an individual inquiry with each defendant and ascertain from each defendant that they understand what this means; that their case is being severed that a mistrial is being granted that they are waiving any double-jeopardy claim that they may have; that they fully understand that if they want to go ahead with trial with the current jury, they can.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f I were to grant a mistrial based on the defendants' request for a mistrial because of the failure to grant severance and the trial evidence jointly being prejudicial to the defendants in their eyes, I could grant that request and not make a finding of manifest necessity, and notwithstanding the absence of a finding of manifest necessity, the defendants could be reprosecuted, notwithstanding the double-jeopardy clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the judge was telling the defendants that if they requested a mistrial and he granted this request despite the absence of manifest necessity for declaring such a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not bar their reprosecution. Counsel for one of the other defendants immediately interjected: \"we don't agree with that ... if the case law supports the position that this trial has gone so far that jeopardy has attached ... and that they're unable to be retried again and that it should be with prejudice, of course, we're not waiving that.\" Realizing that the defendants did not seem to understand the relationship between their request for a mistrial and their waiver of the double jeopardy bar, the court offered further explanation: Supreme Court precedent makes very clear that where a defendant <i>requests</i> a mistrial, he waives any right he has to assert that a reprosecution gives rise to a double-jeopardy violation ... I can grant a mistrial <i>over a defendant's objection</i> without presenting a double-jeopardy question, only where there is a manifest necessity ... I don't think I could make a manifest necessity finding here unless I could conclude that there was an overwhelming probability that the jury could disregard my instructions to disregard any comments in [Hall's] opening statement ... I couldn't make that finding. I couldn't find manifest necessity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this determination that there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial, the judge thoroughly explained to the defendants their options regarding severance and mistrial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If [Hall] wants a mistrial and severance and all three [other] defendants want a mistrial and severance I could do either of two things. I could either grant the severance motion and mistrial as to [Hall] and proceed to trial with the three defendants, giving a limiting instruction to the jury to disregard [Hall's] opening statement, or I could grant a severance and mistrial as to the three defendants, continue on with [Hall] and give an instruction to the jury to disregard any evidence that we determine is admissible against the three but not against [Hall].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I at this time am not persuaded by any argument that the defendants may have that mistrial is absolutely required because there's manifest necessity for a mistrial, but nevertheless, if they want a mistrial and there's a potential for reprosecution and double-jeopardy issues are plainly addressed, I'm willing to consider granting everyone mistrials and just starting again with separate trials for the two groups.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge then addressed each attorney individually to ascertain how the defendants wished to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Let me hear from the defendants.

Based upon the readings from the Court as to what the status of the law is on that, we're willing to &#8212; what we want to see done is the case be severed, mistrial and severance. He will waive his &#8212; he will not assert his rights to double jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: All right. And [Counsel for Newton], what do you want to do?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel 3: We'd like to sever Mr. Hall and proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: And proceed?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel 3: Or to have a mistrial with prejudice. He does not want to waive his right to any claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, at this point, two of the remaining defendants requested severance of Hall and a mistrial, whereas Newton requested severance of Hall and continuation of the trial before the empaneled jury. The judge understood Newton's alternate request for \"mistrial with prejudice\" to mean that if the judge granted a mistrial and forced Newton to go to trial later with a new jury, it would be over Newton's objection and that therefore, since the judge had already determined that there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial, double jeopardy might bar Newton's retrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With only Newton wishing to proceed with the empaneled jury, the judge made clear that he accepted the need for two trials &#8212; one for Hall and another for the other three defendants &#8212; but that he was \"not going to ... go through two separate trials for that group of three.\" The three remaining defendants would be tried together, either now with the empaneled jury or later with a new jury. He would not permit three trials: one for Newton before the empaneled jury, a separate trial for Hall before another jury, and a third trial for the other two defendants before yet another jury. Because of this requirement that the three remaining defendants be tried together, and because he would not grant Newton a mistrial over his objection, the judge confronted Newton with a choice: he could persist in his desire to be tried before the empaneled jury and thereby override the requests of the other two defendants for a mistrial and a trial before a different jury; or he could join them in their requests for a mistrial and hence waive any claim that double jeopardy bars retrial. After a brief conference with the other defense attorneys, Newton's attorney indicated that Newton would \"waive his double jeopardy rights and ask for a mistrial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before accepting this choice, the district court was commendably careful to ensure that the defendant understood the consequences of his decision to request a mistrial. In an extended colloquy, the judge ascertained that Newton understood that he has a constitutional right not to be tried twice on the same charge and that by choosing to move for a mistrial, Newton would be giving up this right:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: ... But if you don't want a trial now, you have to understand that you will be retried again and you will give up your right to claim double jeopardy &#8212; that double jeopardy prevents your retrial. Do you understand that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton: Yes, I do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Are you willing to give up that right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this clarification of the consequences of requesting a mistrial, there was no further talk by Newton of a mistrial with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, accepting that he \"reluctantly agreed to waive his double jeopardy rights,\" Newton now argues that the trial judge \"induced\" him to do so by exerting pressure on him to request a mistrial to avoid the consequences of the judge's error in the denial of the pre-trial motion to sever \"despite numerous warnings from counsel for Mr. Hall regarding Mr. Hall's anticipated defense strategy.\" He elaborates on this renewed demand for a \"mistrial with prejudice\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the wake of that error and consequent prejudice introduced in the opening statement of Mr. Hall's counsel, the trial court should have known that any conviction arising out of the first trial likely would be reversed. As such, the trial court presented Mr. Newton with an ultimatum &#8212; continue with an irreparably prejudiced trial, at which Mr. Newton had already been implicated by a co-defendant, or consent to a mistrial. Mr. Newton was essentially forced to forego his right not to be tried more than once in order to minimize the significance of the trial court's otherwise obvious error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton sees in this scenario a judge who \"intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial,\" and thus argues that his case falls within the \"narrow exception\" carved out by <i>Oregon v. Kennedy</i> to the rule that \"where circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant's motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error.\" <i>Dinitz,</i> 424 U.S. at 607, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109395\"><a href=\"/opinion/109395/united-states-v-dinitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The trial judge confronted Newton with a choice, not an ultimatum: he could be tried before the empaneled jury with the other two defendants, or he could join them in requesting a mistrial, waive his double jeopardy rights, and be tried with them before a new jury at a later date. However, the mere fact that Newton was offered a choice of two imperfect options does not imply compulsion. \"The criminal process, like the rest of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which course to follow. Although a defendant may have a right, even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.\" <i>McKune v.

However, the opportunity for Newton to proceed with the empaneled jury remained, and there is no indication that, of the two options available to Newton, the judge preferred a mistrial for which he saw no manifest necessity. Indeed, when Newton first indicated that he wanted to proceed with a limiting instruction before the empaneled jury, the judge immediately determined that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the thing to do is to consider a potential severance and mistrial as to [Hall] and try the other three together.

To this end, the judge took note of the principle articulated in <i>Scott,</i> that \"the important consideration for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of [ ] error.\" <i>United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109895\"><a href=\"/opinion/109895/united-states-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 93-94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109895\"><a href=\"/opinion/109895/united-states-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hence, the judge made clear his willingness to issue a limiting instruction and proceed with the jury already empaneled, thereby preserving Newton's right to be tried by the original jury and belying Newton's claim that he was provoked into requesting a mistrial. Although he specifically found that there was no manifest necessity for judicial declaration of a mistrial, the judge told the defendants that he would grant their requests for a mistrial so long as they understood that they were waiving any double jeopardy claim. By giving the defendants this mistrial option, the judge gave the defendants more latitude than was strictly necessary in determining the course of their trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Newton's attorney indicated Newton's preference for a new trial, the judge specifically asked her whether she felt that \"any improper pressure ha[d] been brought to bear.\" She replied that she did not. Nevertheless, the judge agreed to grant a mistrial only after adequately informing Newton of the ramifications of requesting a mistrial and determining that \"all of the defendants have knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived their right to claim double jeopardy as a bar to a second prosecution.\" Newton cannot undo the trial judge's scrupulous attention to the double jeopardy issue with his revisionist account of the trial. By electing to request a mistrial, Newton waived any double jeopardy claim. His challenge to his retrial and subsequent conviction on this ground must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Closing Arguments of the Prosecutor</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton claims that he deserves a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct arising from statements made to the jury during closing arguments. Since Newton did not make a contemporaneous objection to these statements, we review for plain error the question of whether the prosecutor impermissibly commented on Newton's failure to testify. <i>United States v.

Because the comments of the prosecutor were not improper, we find no error at all in the trial judge's failure to address these comments sua sponte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton points to two comments made by the prosecutor during his rebuttal to the defendants' closing arguments. These comments must be evaluated in the context of Newton's defense as advanced in his closing argument. Newton did not present witnesses or his own testimony to deny his use or possession of drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Instead, his defense focused on the charge of conspiracy, highlighted the lack of evidence of an agreement between the alleged co-conspirators, and questioned the motives of the co-operating witnesses. Specifically, in her closing, Newton's counsel said to the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. Attorney's office has bought testimony from liars, from thieves, from addicts, from dealers, from desperate, desperate people.

Nevertheless, as we have pointed out repeatedly, the standard is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted); <i>accord United States v.

Moreover, \"when a prosecutor's comments, fairly viewed, are susceptible to two plausible meanings, one of which is unexceptionable and one of which is forbidden, context frequently determines meaning.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 979. In addition, \"a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through a lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\" <i>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109024\"><a href=\"/opinion/109024/donnelly-v-dechristoforo/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 647, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109024\"><a href=\"/opinion/109024/donnelly-v-dechristoforo/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To support his claim, advanced in closing argument, that the tax records established that he was a working man with a source of income &#8212; namely, an auto mechanic &#8212; Newton \"would not have had to rely on his own testimony.\" <i>United States v. Bey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765731\"><a href=\"/opinion/765731/united-states-v-joseph-bey-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1999). Knowledge of his work would easily have been within the competence of other witnesses who could have testified at the trial. Hence, this is not a situation \"when contradiction [of the government's case] would have required the defendant to take the stand,\" <i>United States v. Flannery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"300190\"><a href=\"/opinion/300190/united-states-v-john-flannery/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 881 (1st Cir.1971), and hence the prosecutor's question in rebuttal (\"Ask yourself was there any testimony in this case indicating that he was involved in repairing cars or anything of that like.\") did not constitute inappropriate comment on the defendant's failure to testify. <i>See</i> <i>Bey,</i> 188 F.3d at 9; <i>Flannery,</i> 451 F.2d at 882.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the prosecutor asked in rebuttal if there was any testimony in the case that \"really points to other people who may have been the leaders, organizers of this conspiracy besides these three,\" he was responding to the theory of the defense, also advanced in closing argument, that the prosecution witnesses who testified about the role of the defendants in the drug conspiracy should not be believed because they were \"liars ... thieves ... addicts ... desperate, desperate people.\" Viewed in context, the prosecutor's question is a \"comment on the plausibility of the defense theory ... [T]he government is entitled, to some extent, to comment on a defendant's failure to produce evidence supporting the defense theory of the case.\" <i>Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d at 321. Hence the comment at issue did not constitute improper comment on Newton's exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton was convicted by the jury of conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine. In response to a special question on the verdict form, the jury specifically found that \"Michael Newton reasonably foresaw while he was a member of the conspiracy that the conspirators possessed with intent to distribute and/or intended to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine as part of the conspiracy.\" Based on this finding, the prosecution argued at sentencing that the weight of \"all buys occurring during the course of the conspiracy...\" should be attributable to him for sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge found \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that one hundred and fifty grams of crack was attributable to Newton based on the fact that he was a member of the conspiracy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy was to distribute in excess of one hundred and fifty grams of crack. While Mr. Newton was a member of the conspiracy, he could reasonably foresee that in fact that was the objective of the conspiracy during the time that he was a member of it, and therefore it is my judgement that that crack should be attributed to him for purposes of sentencing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this finding, the judge gave Newton \"the lightest sentence for a level thirty six, criminal history category three defendant that I can give you, which is two hundred and thirty-five months.\" He added that, even if he had found that only fifty to one hundred and fifty grams of crack cocaine had been attributable to Newton, he \"still would have given him a two hundred and thirty-five-month sentence because two hundred and thirty-five months would have been within the applicable range there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton argues that his sentence should be vacated because the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to \"exercise independent judgment\" in its consideration of evidence pertinent to sentencing. The sentencing court's duty \"independently to consider proffered information that is relevant to matters of consequence in the sentencing determination,\" <i>United States v. Tavano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195113\"><a href=\"/opinion/195113/united-states-v-tavano/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir.1993), derives from the Due Process Clause, which guarantees every defendant a \"right to be sentenced upon information which is not false or materially incorrect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 305. Specifically, Newton argues that the district court improperly disregarded the testimony on the extent of Newton's involvement in and knowledge of the conspiracy, and failed to consider Newton's arguments on the quantity of drugs attributable to him for sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 6A1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines requires that \"when any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present information to the court regarding that factor.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &#167; 6A1.3(a) (2001). While this provision encompasses a duty to consider the information presented, <i>Tavano,</i> 12 F.3d at 306, it does not imply a \"duty of blind acceptance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 307. After examining the relevant evidence, the sentencing court has broad discretion to \"pick and choose\" and ultimately credit trial testimony if it carries persuasive force in a particular case. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district judge afforded Newton ample opportunity to submit arguments pertinent to sentencing and gave careful and thorough consideration to the arguments presented. When it became clear during the initial sentencing hearing that there was a dispute as to the quantity of drugs that could be attributed to Newton for sentencing purposes, the court specifically deferred making a judgment on the weight of the drugs until it received supplemental memoranda from both the parties supporting their respective arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton argues that the court ran afoul of its \"duty to consider\" by summarily disregarding both the memorandum Newton submitted on the drug quantity<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and Hogan's testimony at the sentencing hearing regarding the extent of Newton's involvement in the conspiracy. However, unlike <i>Tavano,</i> where the district court \"formulated a per se rule declaring trial testimony determinative of drug quantity, to the exclusion of all other evidence bearing up on the same set of transactions,\" <i>Tavano,</i> 12 F.3d at 304-05, the district court here carefully read Newton's memoranda and considered the evidence before making an independent determination that his arguments were without merit. The court not only allowed Hogan's testimony but it also questioned Hogan on the inconsistencies between the testimony offered and the confession that he made during his own sentencing. Based on these discrepancies, the court found Hogan to be an unreliable witness and did not credit his testimony. These are precisely the determinations of fact that the sentencing court has discretion to make. Because it adequately considered the proffered evidence relevant to sentencing, the court did not offend the dictates of due process set forth in <i>Tavano.</i> Therefore, it did not err as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for clear error the court's factual determination on the quantity of drugs attributable to Newton for sentencing purposes. The court found by \"a preponderance of the evidence\" that, due to his membership in the conspiracy and the foreseeability of the objectives of the conspiracy, 150 grams of crack were attributable to Newton. Contrary to Newton's argument, the sentencing court is not required to make explicit factual findings on the details of each transaction conducted in the course of the conspiracy, when such findings have been detailed at trial and in the submissions of the parties. <i>Tavano,</i> 12 F.3d at 307 (\"As a general rule, a trial court lawfully may make implicit findings with regard to sentencing matters, incorporating by reference suitably detailed suggestions limned in the PSI Report or advanced by a party.\"). Thus, it was well within the bounds of the court's discretion to credit evidence produced at trial and set forth in the government's sentencing memorandum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Therefore, we reject Newton's argument that the court erred in its determination of the quantity of drugs attributable to Newton for sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was thorough, fair and legally correct at all stages of Newton's trial.

He was sentenced to two hundred and sixty-two months' imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release. Membrino was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of a substance containing amounts of cocaine and cocaine base and was sentenced to one hundred and fifty-one months' imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release. Hall was tried separately and convicted of managing a residence for the purpose of manufacturing, storing, distributing and using cocaine and cocaine base.

Although it is not entirely clear, the apparent purpose in calling Marchand was to challenge the credibility of the prosecution witness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although Newton's 1998 tax returns were listed on the Government's Exhibit List, we find no indication that they were introduced at trial.

The court cautioned Newton that \"the memo that you are left with takes a position that is frivolous based on the facts of this case and I will never accept it.\" Despite Newton's insistence that the memorandum the court deemed more beneficial to Newton be withdrawn, the court stated: \"I've read [the withdrawn] memo, and if I think there's anything in it that will benefit Mr. Newton, I will give him the benefit of those arguments.\" This statement further demonstrates the court's willingness to consider the totality of the evidence presented</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Newton complains that the court failed to resolve a dispute over conversion of powder cocaine to crack cocaine. However, in the absence of expert testimony on the relative weights, the court did not consider the government's argument that Newton sold more than 150 grams of crack based on his purchase of more than 150 grams of powder cocaine. Therefore, the court restricted its determination of the quantity of crack attributable to Newton to the amount sold by the conspiracy of which Newton was reasonably aware. Because this removed from the sentencing equation the quantity of crack cocaine that could be made from the powder cocaine that Newton purchased, this decision not to make a conversion finding worked in Newton's favor</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
