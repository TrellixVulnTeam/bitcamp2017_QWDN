We therefore have substituted\nAttorney General Gonzales for John Ashcroft as the respondent.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f            Per Curiam.      Petitioner Alice Kaggwa seeks review of a\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order summarily affirming the\n\ndecision of an immigration judge (IJ) denying her motion to reopen\n\nher asylum case.     We deny the petition.\n\n            Kaggwa is a citizen of Uganda who came to the United\n\nStates on a six-month visa in September 1999.                After her visa\n\nexpired, she remained in the United States and filed for asylum.\n\nIn January 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\n\ninitiated     removal   proceedings        against    the    petitioner     for\n\noverstaying her visa.1\n\n            On February 14, 2002, Kaggwa appeared before an IJ in\n\nBoston, Massachusetts, where she was living at the time. She asked\n\nfor and received a continuance of the hearing until September 19,\n\n2002.     In March 2002, she relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, and\n\nsought a change of venue of the immigration proceeding from Boston\n\nto Kansas City.     Her first attempt to change venue failed because\n\nshe   did   not   properly   serve   the    INS.      She   claims   that   she\n\nsubsequently refiled the change of venue request, but there is no\n\ndocumentary evidence that she did so.              In any event, Kaggwa was\n\nnever granted a change of venue.\n\n\n\n      1\n      On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an agency within\nthe Department of Justice.        Its enforcement functions were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002).\nBecause the events at issue predate that reorganization, we refer\nto the INS in this opinion.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           On September 15, 2002, the petitioner's sister died of\n\nmeningitis in Uganda.          In an affidavit filed to accompany the\n\nmotion to reopen, the petitioner testified that she planned to\n\ndrive from Kansas City to Boston on September 18th to attend the\n\nSeptember 19th hearing which was scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m.\n\nBut on the morning of September 17th, she alleges, she received\n\nword that her sister had died.         Kaggwa claims that, because of her\n\ngrief,   she   could   not    travel   to    Boston   on    September    18th    as\n\npreviously planned.          Instead, she asserts that she called the\n\nimmigration court on the morning of the hearing to inform it that\n\nshe could not attend because of the death in her family.                The court\n\nrecords indicate that the petitioner called to say that she lived\n\nin Kansas City and could not attend court that day; the records do\n\nnot indicate whether she mentioned her sister's death. The IJ went\n\nahead with the hearing and, based on the information presented by\n\nthe INS, entered an in absentia order that the petitioner be\n\nremoved to Uganda.\n\n           After   receiving      notice     of   the      removal   order,     the\n\npetitioner filed the motion to reopen the proceedings, on the basis\n\nof exceptional circumstances arising from her sister's death.                   The\n\nIJ denied the motion because (1) there was insufficient evidence of\n\nthe sister's death, and (2) the petitioner should have allowed\n\nherself more than one day of traveling time to drive from Kansas\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCity to Boston.     Kaggwa appealed to the BIA, which summarily\n\naffirmed the IJ's order.\n\n          We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion.    See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323-24\n\n(1994).   Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision, we\n\nconsider the IJ's decision directly.   See Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325\n\nF.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2003).    For a decision to survive the abuse\n\nof discretion standard, the decision must \"simply [provide] a\n\nrational explanation\" for its conclusion.    Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d\n\n289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          An in absentia removal order may be reopened if a motion\n\nto reopen is filed within 180 days after the date of the order and\n\nthe alien demonstrates that her failure to appear resulted from\n\nexceptional circumstances.     See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(5)(C).   The\n\nstatute is directed to \"exceptional circumstances (such as serious\n\nillness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse,\n\nchild or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling\n\ncircumstances) beyond the control of the alien.\"        8 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1229a(e)(1).   The exceptional circumstances standard is a \"fairly\n\ntough one,\" Georceley v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir. 2004),\n\nand will be met in only \"rare cases.\" Herbert, 325 F.3d at 72.\n\n          The government does not dispute that the petitioner's\n\nmotion was timely or that, at least in some circumstances, notice\n\nof the death of a sibling just prior to a hearing could constitute\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fan   exceptional    circumstance       excusing      the   failure    to   appear.\n\nRather, it contends that the motion was properly denied because the\n\nevidence supports the government's view that the petitioner did not\n\nintend to appear regardless of her sister's death.\n\n           On the record before us, we cannot say that the IJ abused\n\nher discretion in denying the motion to reopen.               As stated above,\n\nthe immigration court records indicate only that, on the morning of\n\nthe hearing, Kaggwa called to say that she lived in Kansas City and\n\nwould not appearing in court that day.              Cf. Georceley, 375 F.3d at\n\n51   (affirming    denial    of   a   motion   to    reopen   where    the   alien\n\nbelatedly informed the immigration court of the reason for the\n\nabsence); Lonyem v. United States Att'y General, 352 F.3d 1338,\n\n1341 (11th Cir. 2003) (similar).               Moreover, the petitioner's\n\nasserted plan to drive from Kansas City to Boston in one day to\n\nattend the 9:00 a.m. hearing was very risky, given the distance\n\nbetween the cities.         Under the strict standard of review that we\n\nmust apply, these facts adequately ground the IJ's decision not to\n\nreopen the proceedings.2\n\n           Petition denied.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The petitioner also filed a motion for reconsideration which\nthe BIA denied. Some of the arguments in the petitioner's brief\nrelate to the BIA's ruling on the motion for reconsideration. But\nthe petitioner did not seek review of this ruling, and we are\ntherefore without jurisdiction to consider it.       See Asaba v.\nAshcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                       -5-\n\f",
