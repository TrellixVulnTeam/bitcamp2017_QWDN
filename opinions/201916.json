Plaintiffs herein appeal from\n\nthe district court's order compelling arbitration of their maritime\n\ndispute, with the court first staying and then dismissing the case.\n\nWe conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction and therefore\n\ndismiss this appeal.\n\n                                I.\n\n          In July 2002, during a voyage from Palma de Mallorca,\n\nSpain to Newport, Rhode Island, two sailing yachts, the EIVISSA and\n\nthe CRASAVITSIA, were damaged while onboard the transportation\n\nvessel M.V. SUPER SERVANT 3.   The damage was apparently sustained\n\nwhen the crew of the SUPER SERVANT were spray painting a portion of\n\ntheir own ship, near to where the two sailing vessels were stowed.\n\nApparently some overspray occurred, causing damage to both vessels.\n\n          Yacht owners Eugene Scanlon and Dennis Sokol and their\n\ninsurer Indemnity Insurance Company of North America (\"plaintiffs\")\n\nbrought an action alleging breach of contract and tort against the\n\nSUPER SERVANT, Dockwise Shipping B.V., Dockwise B.V., and Dockwise\n\nN.V. (\"Dockwise,\" or \"defendants\") in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Rhode Island on June 20, 2003.   Dockwise\n\nin turn sought to compel arbitration pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 4 on\n\nthe basis of an arbitration clause contained within the written\n\ncontracts of carriage, or \"booking notes,\" into which plaintiff\n\nyacht owners and Dockwise had entered prior to undertaking the\n\nvoyage.   The parties agreed that the arbitration clause at issue\n\n\n                                -2-\n\ffell within the scope of the Convention on the Recognition and\n\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (\"the Convention\"), as\n\nimplemented by 9 U.S.C. § 201, et seq.        Plaintiffs contended,\n\nhowever, that an exculpatory clause1 contained within the booking\n\nnotes releasing Dockwise from all liability was contrary to U.S.\n\nlaw and policy and would be implemented under Dutch law,2 thus\n\n\n\n1\n    Clause 7 of the booking note provided in relevant part:\n\n      (3) The Yacht Owner shall be liable for\n            (a) any loss or damage or delay, howsoever caused\n      and of whatever nature, to or sustained by the Yacht\n      (including damage to the Yacht's interior), and including\n      any property on board the Vessel which is operated,\n      owned, hired or leased by the Yacht Owner, its employees,\n      servants, agents or subcontractors, regardless of whether\n      such property is to be shipped or not;\n      . . .\n            (d) any loss, costs and damages consequent upon\n      loss, damage or delay (including delay resulting from\n      delayed shipment) to the Yacht; all of which shall be for\n      the account of the Yacht Owner, without recourse to the\n      Carrier, its servants or agents or insurers.\n\n      The Yacht Owner shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless\n      the Carrier from and against any and all claims, losses,\n      costs, damages and expenses of every kind and nature\n      arising from the foregoing.\n2\n    Clause 6 of the booking note provided:\n\n      (1) Disputes arising from this Agreement which cannot be\n      settled amicably, will be referred exclusively to\n      arbitration in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\n\n      (2) Arbitration in Rotterdam will be conducted in\n      accordance with the Rules of the Transport and Maritime\n      Arbitration Association (TAMARA). Insofar as anything\n      has not been dealt with by the terms and conditions of\n      this Agreement, the law of the Netherlands shall apply\n      . . . .\n\n                                -3-\n\frendering the arbitration agreement unenforceable under the narrow\n\nexception set forth in Art. II., § 3 of the Convention.3\n\n            On February 25, 2004, the district court entered an order\n\nto compel arbitration and stay the action in its entirety during\n\nthe pendency of arbitration.         The district court found that the\n\nexculpatory clause did not place the arbitration agreement within\n\nthe Convention's narrow § 3 exception as it has been construed in\n\nthis   circuit   and   advised   plaintiffs    that   their    argument    was\n\n\"premature\" and would be \"more properly presented if, and when, the\n\narbitrator     applies    [the   exculpatory     clause]      and     judicial\n\nenforcement of the arbitration award is sought.\"\n\n            More than four months later, on July 1, 2004, plaintiffs\n\nmoved to amend the order of February 25 so as to certify an\n\ninterlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).               At the time\n\nof that filing, plaintiffs acknowledged that in reliance upon the\n\nadvice    of   their   Dutch   law   expert,   they   had     not    commenced\n\narbitration proceedings in the Netherlands as required by the\n\n\n\n3\n    Under the Convention:\n\n       (3) The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an\n       action in a matter in respect to which the parties have\n       made an agreement within the meaning of this article,\n       shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the\n       parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said\n       agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of\n       being performed.\n\nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral\nAwards, Art. II, § 3, as implemented by 9 U.S.C. § 201.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fbooking note and the order of the district court.            Their expert had\n\napparently warned that the arbitrator would apply Dutch law and\n\nthat the exculpatory clause would be enforced under Dutch law.\n\nPlaintiffs sought to appeal in part because their claims were now\n\ntime-barred under the applicable arbitration provisions.                        The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion as untimely.\n\n            Thereafter   on    August   17,   2004,    plaintiffs       requested\n\n\"reconsideration and clarification\" of the denial of interlocutory\n\nappeal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6), and were again denied.\n\nIn that motion, plaintiffs provided no new information with which\n\nthe court might reconsider its previous denial of § 1292 relief but\n\nadded   a   completely   new   request    for   a     lift   of   the    stay    of\n\nproceedings and dismissal in favor of defendant.\n\n            On February 11, 2005, the district court requested a\n\nstatus report on this case, and, on March 15, plaintiffs moved for\n\ndismissal in favor of defendants.         The district court granted the\n\nmotion for dismissal on the following day.             This appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            The threshold question in this case is whether this court\n\nhas jurisdiction to hear an appeal brought by a party which has\n\nconsented to the very judgment from which it then appeals. Several\n\ncircuits refuse appellate jurisdiction in such cases.               See, e.g.,\n\nTel-Phonic Servs., Inc. v. TBS Int'l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1137\n\n(5th Cir. 1992) (\"A party will not be heard to appeal the propriety\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fof an order to which it agreed.\"); Stewart v. Lincoln-Douglas Hotel\n\nCorp., 208 F.2d 379, 381 (7th Cir. 1953) (\"It is a generally\n\naccepted rule of long standing that a party who agrees or consents\n\nto the entry of an order or judgment thereby waives his right to\n\nclaim that the trial court committed error in the entry of the\n\norder.\"); Marks v. Feist, 8 F.2d 460, 462 (2d Cir. 1925) (\"So far\n\nas   this   record     shows,    the    complaint    was    dismissed      on    the\n\nplaintiff's motion, and the decree entered was in effect a decree\n\nby consent. And from such a decree the plaintiff cannot appeal.\").\n\n            Although    this     circuit      generally    holds   a     party   who\n\nconsents to a judgment to have waived the right of appeal, we have\n\nallowed a limited exception: \"'it is possible for a party to\n\nconsent to a judgment and still preserve [its] right to appeal' a\n\nprevious ruling on a contested matter in the case, as long as it\n\n'reserve[s] that right unequivocally.\" BIW Deceived v. Local S6,\n\nIndustrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America,\n\nIAMAW District Lodge 4, 132 F.3d 824, 828 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting\n\nCoughlin v. Regan, 768 F.2d 468, 469-70 (1st Cir. 1985)).\n\n            In BIW Deceived, we held that plaintiff-appellants had\n\npreserved their right to appeal despite having successfully sought\n\ndismissal    below     because    the    record     clearly    reflected         \"the\n\nplaintiffs' unequivocal intention\" to seek review.                 Id.    In order\n\nto apply the \"unequivocal intention\" standard in this case, it is\n\nhelpful to revisit BIW Deceived in some detail.               In that case, the\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fBath Iron Works Union (\"BIW\") had hired several electricians and\n\npipefitters, allegedly under false pretenses.       When they were laid\n\noff, the former employees brought suit in Maine state court, and\n\ndefendant BIW removed to federal court.         When plaintiffs' motion\n\nfor remand was denied, they made three separate submissions to the\n\ncourt regarding their intentions to appeal.       First, they moved for\n\nentry of \"a final and appealable judgment\" in favor of defendants,\n\nbut were denied.    Id.   In the status conference which followed,\n\n\"plaintiffs represented . . . that they desired the entry of final\n\njudgment in order to 'appeal the [district court's] preemption\n\nruling.'\"     Id.   Finally,   upon   renewed   motion   for   dismissal,\n\nplaintiffs \"solicited the entry of a 'final judgment, without\n\nprejudice to the plaintiff's right to seek appeal.'\"             Id.   On\n\nappeal, we were convinced that the record \"clearly show[ed] the\n\nplaintiffs' unequivocal intention.\"     Id.     Such is not the present\n\ncase.\n\n            In the case before us, plaintiffs failed \"unequivocally\"\n\nto reserve their right to appeal within the meaning of the standard\n\nestablished in BIW Deceived, and thus we are compelled to conclude\n\nthat they have forfeited that right.     Although plaintiffs maintain\n\nthat they have made a \"concerted, consistent, and ultimately\n\neffective effort\" to reserve their right to appeal throughout this\n\ncase, the record does not support their assessment.             In their\n\nMarch 15, 2005 motion, plaintiffs sought dismissal in favor of\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdefendants \"in the interest of finality,\" making no mention of\n\ntheir intent to appeal.           Not only did they fail specifically to\n\nsolicit a dismissal in the unequivocal language of BIW Deceived\n\n(\"without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to seek appeal\"), but\n\ntheir employment of the word \"finality\" verged on the disingenuous\n\nif in fact they sought dismissal solely for the purpose of mounting\n\nan appeal, which they now claim to have done.           It is insufficient\n\nthat plaintiffs at one point in the course of the proceedings\n\nexpressed a desire to appeal.        The declaration of intent to appeal\n\nmust be made concurrently with the motion for dismissal.              It is at\n\nthis point that they were required unequivocally to reserve their\n\nright to appeal.\n\n              Plaintiffs contend that their motion for dismissal did\n\nnot    expressly    state   their   intention    to   seek   review   because\n\ndefendants \"would have objected\" if that purpose had been made\n\nplain.       This is almost certainly the case, as plaintiffs' wish to\n\nseek relief in the U.S. courts rather than in an arbitral court in\n\nthe Netherlands was precisely the subject of the action below.\n\nSuch    an    argument   merely   emphasizes    plaintiffs'   inappropriate\n\ntactics.      The decision on the motion was for the district court to\n\nmake.\n\n              Plaintiffs dismiss the unequivocal intention standard as\n\nsimply a matter of \"magic words\" and evidence of defendants'\n\n\"efforts to elevate form over substance.\"              And although it is\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fwithout doubt that courts do, on occasion, favor bright-line rules\n\nat the expense of equitable results, we are confident that this is\n\nnot such an instance.   The general principle that a party cannot\n\nappeal from a judgment to which he has consented finds roots in\n\nsome of the fundamental public policy priorities of the federal\n\njudiciary: conserving judicial resources and avoiding delay.\n\n          Plaintiffs improperly rely on this court's determination\n\nthat \"the proper way to appeal an interlocutory order is to move\n\nfor a voluntary dismissal with prejudice.\" John's Insulation, Inc.\n\nv. L. Addison and Associates, Inc., 156 F.3d 101, 107 (1st Cir.\n\n1998). Plaintiffs misapply John's Insulation when they gloss over\n\nthe additional requirements it imposes: namely, that such dismissal\n\nmust be sought without delay, and that the intent to appeal must be\n\nmade explicit.\n\n          [P]laintiffs may sometimes find that an\n          interlocutory ruling has so damaged their case\n          that seeing it to trial would be a waste of\n          resources. However, in such situations, the\n          proper course of action is not to delay the\n          proceedings, but to file a motion for\n          voluntary dismissal with prejudice, stating\n          explicitly that the purpose is to seek\n          immediate review of the interlocutory order in\n          question. Such a voluntary dismissal has the\n          virtues of giving the defendants and the\n          district court notice of the plaintiff's\n          intentions, and of preventing excessive delay.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n          Plaintiffs' intent to appeal was not made explicit in\n\ntheir motion for dismissal.   Plaintiffs expressed a desire to have\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fthe case dismissed as early as August 17, 2004, but they did so\n\nineptly, tacking the submission on to the end of a \"motion for\n\nreconsideration\" (when dismissal had not been under consideration\n\nin the previous order) rather than submitting a proper motion to\n\ndismiss.    Their March 15, 2005 motion explicitly requested a lift\n\nof the stay of proceedings and entry of a judgment of dismissal \"in\n\nthe interest of finality\" and made no mention of their intent to\n\nseek review, immediate or otherwise.\n\n            Rather than filing immediately for voluntary dismissal\n\nwith prejudice as directed by John's Insulation, plaintiffs filed\n\na dilatory motion for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292\n\n(b),   which   the    district    court   denied   as   untimely.    Although\n\nplaintiffs in this case did ultimately file a motion for voluntary\n\ndismissal with prejudice, they did not do so until March 15, 2005\n\n--   more   than     one   year   after   the   original   order    to   compel\n\narbitration and stay proceedings.            It was not until the district\n\ncourt requested a status report in February 2005 that plaintiffs\n\nmanaged to effectively request -- and obtain -- dismissal of this\n\naction, but they failed explicitly to reserve their right to\n\nappeal.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we find that this court is\n\nwithout appellate jurisdiction to review the merits of this case.\n\n            Dismissed.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f",

SUPER SERVANT 3. The damage was apparently sustained when the crew of the SUPER SERVANT were spray painting a portion of their own ship, near to where the two sailing vessels were stowed. Apparently some overspray occurred, causing damage to both vessels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yacht owners Eugene Scanlon and Dennis Sokol and their insurer Indemnity Insurance Company of North America (\"plaintiffs\") brought an action alleging breach of contract and tort against the SUPER SERVANT, Dockwise Shipping B.V., Dockwise B.V., and Dockwise N.V. (\"Dockwise,\" or \"defendants\") in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island on June 20, 2003. Dockwise in turn sought to compel arbitration pursuant to 9 U.S.C. &#167; 4 on the basis of an arbitration clause contained within the written contracts of carriage, or \"booking notes,\" into which plaintiff yacht owners and Dockwise had entered prior to undertaking the voyage. The parties agreed that the arbitration clause at issue fell within the scope of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (\"the Convention\"), as implemented by 9 U.S.C. &#167; 201, <i>et seq.</i> Plaintiffs contended, however, that an exculpatory clause<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> contained within the booking notes releasing Dockwise from all liability was contrary to U.S. law and policy and would be implemented under Dutch law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> thus rendering the arbitration agreement unenforceable under the narrow exception set forth in Art. II., &#167; 3 of the Convention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 2004, the district court entered an order to compel arbitration and stay the action in its entirety during the pendency of arbitration. The district court found that the exculpatory clause did not place the arbitration agreement within the Convention's narrow &#167; 3 exception as it has been construed in this circuit and advised plaintiffs that their argument was \"premature\" and would be \"more properly presented if, and when, the arbitrator applies [the exculpatory clause] and judicial enforcement of the arbitration award is sought.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than four months later, on July 1, 2004, plaintiffs moved to amend the order of February 25 so as to certify an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b). At the time of that filing, plaintiffs acknowledged that in reliance upon the advice of their Dutch law expert, they had not commenced arbitration proceedings in the Netherlands as required by the booking note and the order of the district court. Their expert had apparently warned that the arbitrator would apply Dutch law and that the exculpatory clause would be enforced under Dutch law. Plaintiffs sought to appeal in part because their claims were now time-barred under the applicable arbitration provisions. The district court denied the motion as untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter on August 17, 2004, plaintiffs requested \"reconsideration and clarification\" of the denial of interlocutory appeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), and were again denied. In that motion, plaintiffs provided no new information with which the court might reconsider its previous denial of &#167; 1292 relief but added a completely new request for a lift of the stay of proceedings and dismissal in favor of defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 11, 2005, the district court requested a status report on this case, and, on March 15, plaintiffs moved for dismissal in favor of defendants.

It was not until the district court requested a status report in February 2005 that plaintiffs managed to effectively request&#8212;and obtain&#8212;dismissal of this action, but they failed explicitly to reserve their right to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that this court is without appellate jurisdiction to review the merits of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Clause 7 of the booking note provided in relevant part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(3) The Yacht Owner shall be liable for</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(a) any loss or damage or delay, howsoever caused and of whatever nature, to or sustained by the Yacht (including damage to the Yacht's interior), and including any property on board the Vessel which is operated, owned, hired or leased by the Yacht Owner, its employees, servants, agents or subcontractors, regardless of whether such property is to be shipped or not;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(d) any loss, costs and damages consequent upon loss, damage or delay (including delay resulting from delayed shipment) to the Yacht; all of which shall be for the account of the Yacht Owner, without recourse to the Carrier, its servants or agents or insurers.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Yacht Owner shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Carrier from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, damages and expenses of every kind and nature arising from the foregoing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Clause 6 of the booking note provided:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(1) Disputes arising from this Agreement which cannot be settled amicably, will be referred exclusively to arbitration in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(2) Arbitration in Rotterdam will be conducted in accordance with the Rules of the Transport and Maritime Arbitration Association (TAMARA).
