After    a   hearing,    an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) denied Jean Gardy Domercant’s claims for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT). On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) affirmed the IJ’s decision.                Finding no error in the BIA’s\n\ndecision, we affirm the BIA’s order and deny Domercant’s petition\n\nfor review.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            Domercant, a native and citizen of Haiti, entered the\n\nUnited States at the U.S. Virgin Islands on or about August 15,\n\n2003.      On October 14, 2003, well within the one-year filing\n\ndeadline,     Domercant       submitted    an     I-589       Application,      seeking\n\npolitical asylum and withholding of removal.                        Subsequently, the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged him with\n\nremovability      under   §    212(a)(6)(A)(i)           of   the     Immigration     and\n\nNationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present\n\nin the United States without being admitted or paroled.                      Domercant\n\nconceded removability, but applied for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval,    and   protection      under     the    CAT.        In     support   of    his\n\napplication for relief, he submitted a personal statement, his\n\nbirth certificate, a membership card and letter from Mochrena, a\n\nHaitian political party, a Haitian driver’s license and tax ID\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fcard, his child’s birth certificate, and a number of articles\n\nrelating to country conditions in Haiti.1\n\n               At the hearing before the IJ, Domercant described three\n\nincidents of what he deemed politically motivated harassment, which\n\nhe attributed to his membership in Mochrena, a minority political\n\nparty in Haiti.2         The first alleged incident occurred on April 25,\n\n2002,       after   a   customer   accused    Domercant   of   harboring   anti-\n\ngovernment sentiments because of remarks he made during a political\n\ndiscussion.         Domercant testified that, on his way home from work\n\nthat night, he was accosted by the same customer and two police\n\nofficers, pushed to the ground, and kicked.                    He stated that,\n\nfollowing the attack, he went to the police station and reported\n\nthe incident, but the police would not help him.               In August 2002,\n\nfour men allegedly invaded Domercant’s home and accused him of\n\ntrying to destabilize the government.            Domercant testified that he\n\nbelieved that these men were sent by the men who had attacked him\n\nin April.       The final incident took place in late March 2003, when\n\ntwo men allegedly entered the home of a friend with whom Domercant\n\n        1\n     The government objected to the admission of these documents\nbecause they had not been authenticated. The government further\nnoted that, despite its requests, the originals of the documents\nwere never turned over for forensic analysis. The IJ allowed the\ndocuments into evidence but, acknowledging the evidentiary\nshortcomings, informed Domercant that the documents would be given\nvery limited weight.\n        2\n     Domercant described Mochrena as “the Christian Movement for\na New Haiti” and claimed that he became a regular member of the\nparty in June 2002 because he agreed with its ideology of\nadvocating peace, education, and work for all.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwas staying3 and beat both Domercant and his friend’s mother.\n\nDomercant testified that the men threatened that “this was just the\n\nbeginning.”   He also claimed that both he and his friend’s mother\n\nreceived medical treatment for the injuries they sustained during\n\nthe beatings. According to Domercant, he traveled to the Dominican\n\nRepublic shortly after leaving the hospital and lived in Santo\n\nDomingo until he entered the United States in August 2003.\n\n           When questioned by the government about his involvement\n\nwith Mochrena, Domercant admitted that he had never paid any party\n\ndues, attended any rallies or demonstrations, or voted in Haitian\n\nelections.    Furthermore, he acknowledged that he was unaware\n\nwhether any branches of Mochrena existed in the United States,\n\nwhether Mochrena held three seats in the Haitian parliament, or\n\nwhich candidate Mochrena was supporting in the upcoming Haitian\n\npresidential election.    He also demonstrated limited knowledge of\n\nthe   Democratic   Convergence,   a   Haitian   coalition   of   political\n\nparties of which Mochrena was a member.\n\n           Domercant also testified that he had a son, Christopher\n\nDomercant, who was born in the United States on April 10, 2003.         He\n\nadmitted that Christopher’s mother, Marie Ambroise, told Domercant\n\n\n      3\n     Domercant claimed that, after his home was invaded in August\n2002, fear of further harassment forced him into hiding.       He\ntestified that he quit his job and moved in with a friend in\nSeptember 2002. He stated that he stayed with this friend until\nJanuary 2003, at which time he moved in with another friend. The\nthird incident occurred about two months after Domercant moved in\nwith the second friend.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fthat she was pregnant in September 2002, before she moved to the\n\nUnited States.     He further disclosed that he communicated with\n\nAmbroise intermittently after she arrived in the United States.\n\nWhen the government questioned his failure to include Christopher\n\non his asylum application, Domercant answered: “The reason I said\n\nthat is because I wasn’t quite sure.   She [, Ambroise,] did tell me\n\nthat she was pregnant but I had not proof.”   He also stated that he\n\nwas not present for Christopher’s birth and that he was not listed\n\non the birth certificate.    He denied the government’s accusation\n\nthat he came to the United States to be with Christopher and\n\nAmbroise.\n\n            In an oral decision, the IJ found that Domercant was not\n\ncredible based on the following facts: (1) Domercant’s statements\n\nregarding his political involvement were vague, indicated that he\n\nknew little about his alleged political party, and showed that he\n\nwas uninterested in Haitian politics; (2) that he had offered\n\nconflicting testimony about whether he was for or against the\n\nruling party of Haiti; (3) that he claimed he was in hiding while\n\nliving with his friends in Haiti, but his asylum application\n\nneither listed the addresses of these friends nor indicated that he\n\nwas ever in hiding; (4) that he testified he quit his job in 2002,\n\nbut his application for asylum stated that he was employed until\n\n2003; (5) that he failed to mention his child on his asylum\n\napplication; and (6) that he lacked evidence to corroborate his\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\farrival in the United States, his alleged hospital stay, and his\n\nclaim that he reported the incidents to the police.                        Because\n\nDomercant’s testimony was not credible, the IJ denied Domercant’s\n\nclaim for political asylum.\n\n            Notwithstanding the adverse credibility finding, the IJ\n\nfurther held that Domercant’s claim for asylum failed because he\n\nhad neither established past persecution nor a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution if returned to Haiti.                 According to the IJ,\n\nDomercant could not establish past persecution because he did not\n\nsufficiently     link    his   political       opinion   to   the    attacks       he\n\ndescribed.      Furthermore, the IJ determined that Domercant could\n\nhave relocated within Haiti to avoid his perceived problems with\n\nhis   alleged    persecutors.        As   to   future    persecution,       the    IJ\n\nconcluded    that   Domercant’s      apparent     disinterest       and    lack    of\n\nknowledge    regarding     Haitian    politics     suggested    that       he     had\n\nabsolutely nothing to fear if he returned to Haiti.                 Having found\n\nthat Domercant had not proven his eligibility for asylum, the IJ\n\ndenied his concurrent claim for withholding of removal.                   His claim\n\nfor CAT protection was likewise rejected because Domercant had\n\noffered no evidence that it was more likely than not that he would\n\nbe tortured if forced to return to Haiti.\n\n            On appeal, the BIA upheld the IJ’s decision in a per\n\ncuriam opinion.     The BIA agreed that Domercant was not credible,\n\nstating that the IJ’s adverse credibility determination was based\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fon   specific    and    cogent    reasons     manifest    in   the   record.\n\nSpecifically,    the    BIA    discussed      the   discrepancies    between\n\nDomercant’s asylum application and his testimony, his lack of\n\nknowledge and involvement in Haitian politics, his inability to\n\ncorroborate that he had received medical treatment after the\n\nalleged beatings, and his failure to articulate any reason why he\n\ncould not safely relocate within Haiti.4             In addition, the BIA\n\nfound that Domercant had presented no evidence showing “that anyone\n\nwas looking for him for any reason.”          Because the BIA disposed of\n\nDomercant’s claims for asylum and withholding of removal on the\n\nground that he was not credible, the BIA declined to address his\n\npersecution arguments. The BIA also affirmed the IJ’s finding that\n\nDomercant’s     claim    for     protection    under     the   CAT   failed.\n\nAccordingly, the BIA dismissed Domercant’s appeal.             Domercant now\n\npetitions for review of the BIA’s dismissal, arguing that its\n\nadverse credibility determination is not supported by the record.5\n\n     4\n     The BIA’s finding that Domercant could safely relocate appears\nmisplaced because it is a factor typically considered when\ndetermining whether persecution has been established, not when\nassessing the credibility of an asylum applicant.\n     5\n      On appeal, Domercant seeks review of the IJ’s finding of\nadverse credibility.     He contends that we should review the\nfindings of the IJ and not the BIA because the BIA merely adopted\nthe findings of the IJ. See Simo v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 7, 11 (1st\nCir. 2006)(“[T]o the extent that the [BIA] has adopted the decision\nof an IJ, we review the adopted portion of the opinion of the IJ as\nif it were part of the opinion of the [BIA].”). However, in this\ncase, the BIA made its own findings with regard to Domercant’s\ncredibility and eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and\nCAT protection and did not adopt the decision of the IJ.\nTherefore, we will review the BIA’s decision and treat Domercant’s\n\n                                     -7-\n\f                                        II.\n\n              We   review    the   factual       findings   of    the   BIA     under   a\n\nsubstantial evidence standard and will uphold the BIA’s decision if\n\nit is “supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence\n\non the record considered as a whole.”               Attia v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d\n\n21, 23 (1st Cir. 2007)(citing Carcamo-Recinos v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d\n\n253,    256   (1st    Cir.   2004)).        We    will   not     reverse    a   factual\n\ndetermination of the BIA unless “any reasonable adjudicator would\n\nbe     compelled     to   conclude     to    the    contrary.”          8     U.S.C.    §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B); see also Simo v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n              An applicant for political asylum bears the burden of\n\nshowing that he suffered past persecution, or that he has a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution, on account of his political\n\nopinion.       Ouk v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nSimilarly, an applicant seeking withholding of removal on political\n\ngrounds must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he\n\nwill be persecuted on account of his political opinion if he is\n\nforced to return to the country of removal.                    Pan v. Gonzales, 489\n\nF.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir. 2007); 8                    C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).               The\n\nstandard for a grant of withholding of removal is more stringent\n\n\n\narguments as if they were addressed to the findings of the BIA.\nSee Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003)\n(“Ordinarily, Courts of Appeals review decisions of the [BIA], and\nnot those of an IJ.” (alteration in original)(internal citation\nomitted)).\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthan that of asylum.         Pan, 489 F.3d at 86.       As a result, “[a]\n\npetitioner who is unable to establish eligibility for asylum a\n\nfortiori    fails    to   establish    eligibility    for   withholding   of\n\ndeportation.”       Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n            An asylum applicant must offer credible and specific\n\nevidence to support his claim of past persecution or well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.      Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d\n\n14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999).      If the testimony of an asylum applicant is\n\nfound    credible,    that   alone    may   be   sufficient   to   meet   the\n\napplicant’s burden.       See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); see also Settenda,\n\n377 F.3d at 93.       Conversely, “if the proffered testimony is not\n\ncredible, it may be either disregarded or sharply discounted,\n\ndepending on the circumstances.”        Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d\n\n115, 121 (1st Cir. 2005). Because the success of applicant’s claim\n\nmay be at stake, “an adverse credibility determination cannot rest\n\non trivia but must be based on discrepancies that involve[] the\n\nheart of the asylum claim.”       Bojorques-Villanueva, 194 F.3d at 16\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).              “Further, the\n\ndiscrepancies or omissions relied upon ... ‘must actually be\n\npresent in the record ... and ... a convincing explanation for the\n\ndiscrepancies or omissions must not have been supplied by the\n\nalien.’”    Lin v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 2007) (second\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fand third alterations in original)(quoting Zheng v. Gonzales, 464\n\nF.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 2006)).\n\n            On   appeal,    Domercant    argues    that       the    BIA’s adverse\n\ncredibility determination rested on erroneous findings.                    First, he\n\ncontends the BIA’s conclusion that he knew next to nothing about\n\nHaitian politics was incorrect because it was based on Domercant’s\n\nunawareness of facts about Haitian politics that were never proven\n\ntrue by the government.         For example, the government offered no\n\nevidence to prove that Mochrena was a member of the Democratic\n\nConvergence or that Mochrena held three seats in the Haitian\n\nparliament.      On these bases, Domercant argues that it was improper\n\nfor the BIA to find that he lacked knowledge of Haitian politics.\n\nHowever, the soundness of the factual predicates underlying the\n\ngovernment’s questions regarding Haitian politics is irrelevant.\n\nIt is relevant that, in responding to these questions, Domercant\n\ndisplayed a general lack of knowledge regarding the subject, either\n\nbecause he was unaware of the facts being asserted, could not\n\nanswer the questions asked, or did not attempt to refute any\n\nincorrect assertions.        The record, therefore, supports the BIA’s\n\nfinding.\n\n            Domercant    also   argues    on    appeal    that      he    adequately\n\nexplained the discrepancies cited by the BIA in support of its\n\nadverse    credibility     finding.      In    defense   of    his       omission   of\n\nChristopher from his asylum application, Domercant maintains that,\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fat the time he filled out his application, he only knew that\n\nAmbroise was pregnant, not whether the child had been born or if he\n\nwas the father.     Moreover, he was not living with Ambroise and he\n\nis not listed as the father on Christopher’s birth certificate. Be\n\nthat as it may, given that Christopher was born in April 2003, and\n\nthat the application was filled out in October 2003, Domercant may\n\nin fact have been aware of the child’s birth.                      In addition,\n\nDomercant had ample time and opportunity to amend his asylum\n\napplication between October 2003 and his hearing in October 2005,\n\nbut he neglected to do so.                Considering these facts, it was\n\nreasonable for the BIA to conclude that this discrepancy was not\n\nsufficiently justified by Domercant’s testimonial explanation.\n\n            Additionally, Domercant explains that the inconsistencies\n\nbetween his asylum application and his testimony regarding his\n\nresidence and the date he left his job were merely a result of\n\nmistranslation.     To this end, he reminds us that he filled out his\n\nasylum application with the assistance of a translator because he\n\nis not fluent in English.         He further asserts that, even if there\n\nwere no translation issues, it would not be unreasonable for him to\n\nprovide    only   his   home    address    because    most   people   would    not\n\nconsider    the   homes    of    friends    that     they    are   staying    with\n\ntemporarily to be their residences. However, the I-589 application\n\nexplicitly asks the applicant to provide the last address he lived\n\nat before coming to the United States and information about his\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fresidences during the previous five years.                  In response to these\n\nrequests, Domercant provided only his home address as his last\n\nresidence before coming to the United States and an address in St.\n\nThomas as his present address.            It was within the discretion of the\n\nBIA to accept or deny Domercant’s explanation for failing to list\n\nthe addresses at which he temporarily resided.                      See Chen v.\n\nGonzales, 418 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir. 2005)(“That the [BIA] might\n\nhave        accepted    [the      petitioner’s]       explanations       for     his\n\ninconsistencies is not to say [it] was required to do so.”).                   Since\n\nnothing in the record compels us to conclude that the discrepancy\n\nwas adequately explained, we will not disturb the decision of the\n\nBIA.6\n\n                 We conclude that there was substantial evidence on the\n\nrecord      to    support   the   BIA’s    finding   that    Domercant    was   not\n\ncredible.          Consequently,     we    affirm    the    BIA’s   dismissal    of\n\nDomercant’s claims for asylum and withholding of removal.7\n\n        6\n      Domercant sets forth an additional argument that the IJ erred\nin giving limited weight to his Mochrena membership card because it\nwas not an “official” document and, therefore, did not require\nauthentication under 8 C.F.R. § 287.6. He contends that it may\nhave affected the IJ’s finding that Domercant was not involved in\nHaitian politics. The BIA did not mention the card in its opinion\nand, therefore, the IJ’s opinion on this matter is irrelevant.\n        7\n     Domercant also contests the IJ’s findings with respect to\npersecution.   However, the BIA dismissed Domercant’s claims for\nasylum and withholding of removal based solely on its finding that\nDomercant was not credible. It specifically refused to address\nDomercant’s arguments related to persecution. Because we review\nthe decision of the BIA unless it has adopted the decision of the\nIJ, we are without jurisdiction to consider Domercant’s arguments\nregarding persecution.

After    a   hearing,    an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) denied Jean Gardy Domercant’s claims for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT). On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) affirmed the IJ’s decision.                Finding no error in the BIA’s\n\ndecision, we affirm the BIA’s order and deny Domercant’s petition\n\nfor review.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            Domercant, a native and citizen of Haiti, entered the\n\nUnited States at the U.S. Virgin Islands on or about August 15,\n\n2003.      On October 14, 2003, well within the one-year filing\n\ndeadline,     Domercant       submitted    an     I-589       Application,      seeking\n\npolitical asylum and withholding of removal.                        Subsequently, the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged him with\n\nremovability      under   §    212(a)(6)(A)(i)           of   the     Immigration     and\n\nNationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present\n\nin the United States without being admitted or paroled.                      Domercant\n\nconceded removability, but applied for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval,    and   protection      under     the    CAT.        In     support   of    his\n\napplication for relief, he submitted a personal statement, his\n\nbirth certificate, a membership card and letter from Mochrena, a\n\nHaitian political party, a Haitian driver’s license and tax ID\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fcard, his child’s birth certificate, and a number of articles\n\nrelating to country conditions in Haiti.1\n\n               At the hearing before the IJ, Domercant described three\n\nincidents of what he deemed politically motivated harassment, which\n\nhe attributed to his membership in Mochrena, a minority political\n\nparty in Haiti.2         The first alleged incident occurred on April 25,\n\n2002,       after   a   customer   accused    Domercant   of   harboring   anti-\n\ngovernment sentiments because of remarks he made during a political\n\ndiscussion.         Domercant testified that, on his way home from work\n\nthat night, he was accosted by the same customer and two police\n\nofficers, pushed to the ground, and kicked.                    He stated that,\n\nfollowing the attack, he went to the police station and reported\n\nthe incident, but the police would not help him.               In August 2002,\n\nfour men allegedly invaded Domercant’s home and accused him of\n\ntrying to destabilize the government.            Domercant testified that he\n\nbelieved that these men were sent by the men who had attacked him\n\nin April.       The final incident took place in late March 2003, when\n\ntwo men allegedly entered the home of a friend with whom Domercant\n\n        1\n     The government objected to the admission of these documents\nbecause they had not been authenticated. The government further\nnoted that, despite its requests, the originals of the documents\nwere never turned over for forensic analysis. The IJ allowed the\ndocuments into evidence but, acknowledging the evidentiary\nshortcomings, informed Domercant that the documents would be given\nvery limited weight.\n        2\n     Domercant described Mochrena as “the Christian Movement for\na New Haiti” and claimed that he became a regular member of the\nparty in June 2002 because he agreed with its ideology of\nadvocating peace, education, and work for all.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwas staying3 and beat both Domercant and his friend’s mother.\n\nDomercant testified that the men threatened that “this was just the\n\nbeginning.”   He also claimed that both he and his friend’s mother\n\nreceived medical treatment for the injuries they sustained during\n\nthe beatings. According to Domercant, he traveled to the Dominican\n\nRepublic shortly after leaving the hospital and lived in Santo\n\nDomingo until he entered the United States in August 2003.\n\n           When questioned by the government about his involvement\n\nwith Mochrena, Domercant admitted that he had never paid any party\n\ndues, attended any rallies or demonstrations, or voted in Haitian\n\nelections.    Furthermore, he acknowledged that he was unaware\n\nwhether any branches of Mochrena existed in the United States,\n\nwhether Mochrena held three seats in the Haitian parliament, or\n\nwhich candidate Mochrena was supporting in the upcoming Haitian\n\npresidential election.    He also demonstrated limited knowledge of\n\nthe   Democratic   Convergence,   a   Haitian   coalition   of   political\n\nparties of which Mochrena was a member.\n\n           Domercant also testified that he had a son, Christopher\n\nDomercant, who was born in the United States on April 10, 2003.         He\n\nadmitted that Christopher’s mother, Marie Ambroise, told Domercant\n\n\n      3\n     Domercant claimed that, after his home was invaded in August\n2002, fear of further harassment forced him into hiding.       He\ntestified that he quit his job and moved in with a friend in\nSeptember 2002. He stated that he stayed with this friend until\nJanuary 2003, at which time he moved in with another friend. The\nthird incident occurred about two months after Domercant moved in\nwith the second friend.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fthat she was pregnant in September 2002, before she moved to the\n\nUnited States.     He further disclosed that he communicated with\n\nAmbroise intermittently after she arrived in the United States.\n\nWhen the government questioned his failure to include Christopher\n\non his asylum application, Domercant answered: “The reason I said\n\nthat is because I wasn’t quite sure.   She [, Ambroise,] did tell me\n\nthat she was pregnant but I had not proof.”   He also stated that he\n\nwas not present for Christopher’s birth and that he was not listed\n\non the birth certificate.    He denied the government’s accusation\n\nthat he came to the United States to be with Christopher and\n\nAmbroise.\n\n            In an oral decision, the IJ found that Domercant was not\n\ncredible based on the following facts: (1) Domercant’s statements\n\nregarding his political involvement were vague, indicated that he\n\nknew little about his alleged political party, and showed that he\n\nwas uninterested in Haitian politics; (2) that he had offered\n\nconflicting testimony about whether he was for or against the\n\nruling party of Haiti; (3) that he claimed he was in hiding while\n\nliving with his friends in Haiti, but his asylum application\n\nneither listed the addresses of these friends nor indicated that he\n\nwas ever in hiding; (4) that he testified he quit his job in 2002,\n\nbut his application for asylum stated that he was employed until\n\n2003; (5) that he failed to mention his child on his asylum\n\napplication; and (6) that he lacked evidence to corroborate his\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\farrival in the United States, his alleged hospital stay, and his\n\nclaim that he reported the incidents to the police.                        Because\n\nDomercant’s testimony was not credible, the IJ denied Domercant’s\n\nclaim for political asylum.\n\n            Notwithstanding the adverse credibility finding, the IJ\n\nfurther held that Domercant’s claim for asylum failed because he\n\nhad neither established past persecution nor a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution if returned to Haiti.                 According to the IJ,\n\nDomercant could not establish past persecution because he did not\n\nsufficiently     link    his   political       opinion   to   the    attacks       he\n\ndescribed.      Furthermore, the IJ determined that Domercant could\n\nhave relocated within Haiti to avoid his perceived problems with\n\nhis   alleged    persecutors.        As   to   future    persecution,       the    IJ\n\nconcluded    that   Domercant’s      apparent     disinterest       and    lack    of\n\nknowledge    regarding     Haitian    politics     suggested    that       he     had\n\nabsolutely nothing to fear if he returned to Haiti.                 Having found\n\nthat Domercant had not proven his eligibility for asylum, the IJ\n\ndenied his concurrent claim for withholding of removal.                   His claim\n\nfor CAT protection was likewise rejected because Domercant had\n\noffered no evidence that it was more likely than not that he would\n\nbe tortured if forced to return to Haiti.\n\n            On appeal, the BIA upheld the IJ’s decision in a per\n\ncuriam opinion.     The BIA agreed that Domercant was not credible,\n\nstating that the IJ’s adverse credibility determination was based\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fon   specific    and    cogent    reasons     manifest    in   the   record.\n\nSpecifically,    the    BIA    discussed      the   discrepancies    between\n\nDomercant’s asylum application and his testimony, his lack of\n\nknowledge and involvement in Haitian politics, his inability to\n\ncorroborate that he had received medical treatment after the\n\nalleged beatings, and his failure to articulate any reason why he\n\ncould not safely relocate within Haiti.4             In addition, the BIA\n\nfound that Domercant had presented no evidence showing “that anyone\n\nwas looking for him for any reason.”          Because the BIA disposed of\n\nDomercant’s claims for asylum and withholding of removal on the\n\nground that he was not credible, the BIA declined to address his\n\npersecution arguments. The BIA also affirmed the IJ’s finding that\n\nDomercant’s     claim    for     protection    under     the   CAT   failed.\n\nAccordingly, the BIA dismissed Domercant’s appeal.             Domercant now\n\npetitions for review of the BIA’s dismissal, arguing that its\n\nadverse credibility determination is not supported by the record.5\n\n     4\n     The BIA’s finding that Domercant could safely relocate appears\nmisplaced because it is a factor typically considered when\ndetermining whether persecution has been established, not when\nassessing the credibility of an asylum applicant.\n     5\n      On appeal, Domercant seeks review of the IJ’s finding of\nadverse credibility.     He contends that we should review the\nfindings of the IJ and not the BIA because the BIA merely adopted\nthe findings of the IJ. See Simo v.

First, he\n\ncontends the BIA’s conclusion that he knew next to nothing about\n\nHaitian politics was incorrect because it was based on Domercant’s\n\nunawareness of facts about Haitian politics that were never proven\n\ntrue by the government.         For example, the government offered no\n\nevidence to prove that Mochrena was a member of the Democratic\n\nConvergence or that Mochrena held three seats in the Haitian\n\nparliament.      On these bases, Domercant argues that it was improper\n\nfor the BIA to find that he lacked knowledge of Haitian politics.\n\nHowever, the soundness of the factual predicates underlying the\n\ngovernment’s questions regarding Haitian politics is irrelevant.\n\nIt is relevant that, in responding to these questions, Domercant\n\ndisplayed a general lack of knowledge regarding the subject, either\n\nbecause he was unaware of the facts being asserted, could not\n\nanswer the questions asked, or did not attempt to refute any\n\nincorrect assertions.        The record, therefore, supports the BIA’s\n\nfinding.\n\n            Domercant    also   argues    on    appeal    that      he    adequately\n\nexplained the discrepancies cited by the BIA in support of its\n\nadverse    credibility     finding.      In    defense   of    his       omission   of\n\nChristopher from his asylum application, Domercant maintains that,\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fat the time he filled out his application, he only knew that\n\nAmbroise was pregnant, not whether the child had been born or if he\n\nwas the father.     Moreover, he was not living with Ambroise and he\n\nis not listed as the father on Christopher’s birth certificate. Be\n\nthat as it may, given that Christopher was born in April 2003, and\n\nthat the application was filled out in October 2003, Domercant may\n\nin fact have been aware of the child’s birth.                      In addition,\n\nDomercant had ample time and opportunity to amend his asylum\n\napplication between October 2003 and his hearing in October 2005,\n\nbut he neglected to do so.                Considering these facts, it was\n\nreasonable for the BIA to conclude that this discrepancy was not\n\nsufficiently justified by Domercant’s testimonial explanation.\n\n            Additionally, Domercant explains that the inconsistencies\n\nbetween his asylum application and his testimony regarding his\n\nresidence and the date he left his job were merely a result of\n\nmistranslation.     To this end, he reminds us that he filled out his\n\nasylum application with the assistance of a translator because he\n\nis not fluent in English.         He further asserts that, even if there\n\nwere no translation issues, it would not be unreasonable for him to\n\nprovide    only   his   home    address    because    most   people   would    not\n\nconsider    the   homes    of    friends    that     they    are   staying    with\n\ntemporarily to be their residences. However, the I-589 application\n\nexplicitly asks the applicant to provide the last address he lived\n\nat before coming to the United States and information about his\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fresidences during the previous five years.                  In response to these\n\nrequests, Domercant provided only his home address as his last\n\nresidence before coming to the United States and an address in St.\n\nThomas as his present address.            It was within the discretion of the\n\nBIA to accept or deny Domercant’s explanation for failing to list\n\nthe addresses at which he temporarily resided.                      See Chen v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201763\"><a href=\"/opinion/201763/chen-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114 (1st Cir. 2005)(“That the [BIA] might\n\nhave        accepted    [the      petitioner’s]       explanations       for     his\n\ninconsistencies is not to say [it] was required to do so.”).                   Since\n\nnothing in the record compels us to conclude that the discrepancy\n\nwas adequately explained, we will not disturb the decision of the\n\nBIA.6\n\n                 We conclude that there was substantial evidence on the\n\nrecord      to    support   the   BIA’s    finding   that    Domercant    was   not\n\ncredible.          Consequently,     we    affirm    the    BIA’s   dismissal    of\n\nDomercant’s claims for asylum and withholding of removal.7\n\n        6\n      Domercant sets forth an additional argument that the IJ erred\nin giving limited weight to his Mochrena membership card because it\nwas not an “official” document and, therefore, did not require\nauthentication under 8 C.F.R. § 287.6. He contends that it may\nhave affected the IJ’s finding that Domercant was not involved in\nHaitian politics. The BIA did not mention the card in its opinion\nand, therefore, the IJ’s opinion on this matter is irrelevant.\n        7\n     Domercant also contests the IJ’s findings with respect to\npersecution.   However, the BIA dismissed Domercant’s claims for\nasylum and withholding of removal based solely on its finding that\nDomercant was not credible. It specifically refused to address\nDomercant’s arguments related to persecution. Because we review\nthe decision of the BIA unless it has adopted the decision of the\nIJ, we are without jurisdiction to consider Domercant’s arguments\nregarding persecution. See Albathani, 318 F.3d at 373.\n\n                                          -12-\n\f                              III.\n\n          For the aforementioned reasons, the petition for review\n\nis denied.\n\n\n\n\n                              -13-\n\f</pre>",
