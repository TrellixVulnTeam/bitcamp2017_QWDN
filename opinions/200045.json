Michael   A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                 Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n\n              and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Richard E.

Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Dina Michael\nChaitowitz, Appellate Chief, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 25, 2002\n\n\n\n\n______________\n*Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA,    Circuit   Judge.         In     this    appeal,     petitioner-\n\nappellant Herbert Derman challenges the district court's denial of\n\nhis application for post-conviction relief.                    He argues that the\n\nSupreme Court's holding in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000) — announced after we rejected his direct appeal but before\n\nthe expiration of the time within which he was eligible to apply\n\nfor   a   writ   of   certiorari     —    demands      that    we   set    aside     his\n\nconviction.        Although    his   appeal     is     ably    argued     and   raises\n\nintricate    issues    (including        one   that    has    divided     our   sister\n\ncircuits and another that is of first impression at the appellate\n\nlevel), it is in the end unavailing.                Consequently, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of the application for post-conviction\n\nrelief.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            We limn those facts pertinent to the instant appeal,\n\nreferring readers who crave more exegetic detail to our opinion\n\naffirming the petitioner's conviction.                   See United States v.\n\nDerman, 211 F.3d 175 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Beginning     in    1984,      Marcel      Rosenzweig         oversaw     an\n\nunderground greenhouse on property owned by the petitioner.                         This\n\nfacility housed a huge marijuana-growing operation.                       The venture\n\nprospered for several years.\n\n            When word of a large-scale marijuana grow leaked in 1991,\n\npolice officers visited the site.              They were thrown off the scent\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fby a legal above-ground greenhouse that Rosenzweig and his cohorts\n\nran to conceal the illegal activities below.          Because the officers\n\ndid not realize what lay beneath, their search revealed only trace\n\namounts of marijuana.\n\n          In    an     abundance    of   caution,   Rosenzweig   moved   the\n\nenterprise to a different locus.            The culprits continued growing\n\nand distributing marijuana until the federal government cracked the\n\ncase four years later.            A federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts soon indicted the petitioner and six\n\nother persons (including Rosenzweig).           The indictment charged the\n\ndefendants     with,    inter    alia,   conspiring   to   manufacture   and\n\ndistribute marijuana.      See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.      As part of\n\nthe conspiracy charge, the indictment specifically mentioned a\n\nstatutory provision mandating a ten-year minimum sentence for\n\nconspiracies involving at least 1,000 marijuana plants.           See id. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A).\n\n          All the defendants, save only the petitioner, pleaded\n\nguilty to the charges.          The petitioner maintained his innocence,\n\nasserting that he had no knowledge of either the underground\n\ngreenhouse or its unlawful contents. The district court instructed\n\nthe jury on the standard issues, but not on the question of drug\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fquantity.   The jury found the petitioner guilty on the conspiracy\n\ncount and on a related forfeiture count.1\n\n            The jury returned its verdict on July 29, 1998.    The\n\ndistrict court denied the petitioner's post-trial motions and\n\nscheduled the disposition hearing to take place on March 5, 1999.\n\nDrug quantity was a contested issue. See United States v. O'Campo,\n\n973 F.2d 1015, 1026 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[T]he base offense level of\n\na co-conspirator at sentencing should reflect only the quantity of\n\ndrugs he reasonably foresees it is the object of the conspiracy to\n\ndistribute after he joins the conspiracy.\").   The relevant measure\n\nof drug quantity in this case was the number of marijuana plants\n\ninvolved. Leaving recidivism to one side, a defendant convicted of\n\nparticipation in a conspiracy that involves fewer than fifty plants\n\ncan receive an incarcerative sentence of no more than five years.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D).   If the conspiracy involved fifty plants\n\nor more, the maximum sentence is twenty years. Id. § 841(b)(1)(C).\n\nFor a conspiracy of 100 plants or more, the maximum sentence is\n\nforty years.    Id. § 841(b)(1)(B).   Finally, for a conspiracy of\n\n1,000 plants or more, the maximum sentence is life.          Id. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A).   The number of marijuana plants also can dictate a\n\nmandatory minimum sentence: five years for 100 plants or more, id.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The jury acquitted the petitioner on several other charges,\nincluding money laundering. Because the acquitted conduct is not\nrelevant to the issues on appeal, we do not elaborate on those\ncounts.\n\n                                -4-\n\f§ 841(b)(1)(B), and ten years for 1,000 plants or more, id. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A).\n\n            In this instance, the probation department prepared a\n\npresentence investigation report (the PSI Report) concluding that\n\nthe petitioner was responsible for 213,000 marijuana plants.                     The\n\npetitioner objected, claiming that he could not reasonably have\n\nforeseen    the    vast   amounts    of    marijuana    grown   underneath       his\n\nproperty and elsewhere. On that basis, he argued that his sentence\n\nshould not be more than five years.                   See id. § 841(b)(1)(D)\n\n(establishing a five-year default statutory maximum for a quantity\n\nof marijuana less than fifty plants).\n\n            The    district     court     flatly   rejected   the   petitioner's\n\ncontention.       Focusing on the fact that 1,000 plants was the number\n\nof marijuana plants needed to trigger a ten-year mandatory minimum\n\nsentence, see id. § 841(b)(1)(A), the court stated:                 \"I would have\n\nto find that the sky was green to conclude that there weren't at\n\nleast a thousand plants that were foreseeable in this conspiracy at\n\nthe time that [the petitioner] entered into it . . . .\"                That said,\n\nthe court     proceeded    to     calculate     the   total   number   of   plants\n\nattributable to the petitioner.                 The court presumed that the\n\npetitioner reasonably could have foreseen an output of 200 plants\n\na month (a total of 26,400 plants over the eleven-year span of the\n\nconspiracy).        The   court    then    sentenced    the   petitioner    to    an\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fincarcerative term of 121 months (one month above the applicable\n\nmandatory minimum).\n\n            The petitioner appealed his conviction, but not his\n\nsentence.    We rejected his direct appeal on May 5, 2000.            Derman,\n\n211 F.3d at 177.        In the course of that appeal, he assigned no\n\nerror implicating either the jury instructions or the lower court's\n\nassessment of drug quantity.\n\n            The petitioner had ninety days from the date of entry of\n\nour judgment to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States.            See Sup. Ct. R. 13(1).       The\n\nSupreme Court decided Apprendi on June 26, 2000 — well within that\n\nninety-day window.         Apprendi's core holding is that \"[o]ther than\n\nthe fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty\n\nfor a   crime      beyond   the   prescribed   statutory   maximum   must    be\n\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"                 530\n\nU.S. at     490.     The    petitioner's     trial   seemingly   flouted   this\n\nprinciple: after all, the district court did not instruct the jury\n\non a fact — drug quantity — that increased the maximum penalty for\n\nthe petitioner's crime from five years (the default statutory\n\nmaximum) to life imprisonment.           Compare 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D)\n\nwith id. § 841(b)(1)(A).          The petitioner claims that he instructed\n\nhis appellate counsel to file a certiorari petition on this ground\n\nduring the period in which that opportunity was available to him,\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fbut that counsel neglected to comply.         So ended direct review of\n\nthe petitioner's conviction and sentence.\n\n            The petitioner thereafter retained a new lawyer.              On\n\nApril 27, 2001, he launched a collateral attack in the district\n\ncourt.   See 28 U.S.C. § 2255.       He asserted that the court had\n\nsentenced him in violation of Apprendi, and that he had received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel because his appellate attorney\n\nhad ignored his instructions to file a petition for a writ of\n\ncertiorari.\n\n            The district court held a hearing on October 9, 2001.\n\nRuling from the bench, the court dismissed the petition.                Three\n\ndays later, the court elaborated on its reasoning in a written\n\nrescript.     To summarize, the court rejected the petitioner's\n\nApprendi claim for three reasons.        It held that Apprendi could not\n\nbe applied retroactively to the petitioner's habeas claim; that the\n\npetitioner had waived any and all objections to his sentence by\n\nfailing to challenge the sentence on direct appeal; and that, in\n\nall events,    the   district   court's   failure   to   submit   the   drug\n\nquantity question to the jury was harmless because the record\n\ncontained overwhelming evidence that the number of marijuana plants\n\ninvolved in the plot exceeded the number necessary to bring an\n\nelevated maximum sentence into play.         On much the same basis the\n\ncourt also rejected the petitioner's ineffective assistance claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           This   appeal   ensued.         We   granted   a    certificate   of\n\nappealability to decide the Apprendi issues.                  See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2253(c).\n\nII.   FINALITY\n\n           We begin our analysis by determining the applicability of\n\nApprendi to this petition — a determination that requires us to\n\ndecide when the petitioner's conviction became \"final\" within the\n\nmeaning of the relevant statute.\n\n           Whether a convicted defendant may find refuge in a rule\n\nof criminal procedure newly announced by the Supreme Court depends\n\nin large part on timing.      If the conviction is not yet final when\n\nthe Supreme Court announces the rule, then inferior courts must\n\napply that rule to the defendant's case. Griffith v. Kentucky, 479\n\nU.S. 314, 322 (1987).        If, however, the conviction is already\n\nfinal, then the defendant ordinarily may not avail himself of the\n\nnewly announced rule.      Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 310 (1989).2\n\n           But words often are chameleons, taking on different\n\nshades of meaning in different contexts.            The question, then, is\n\nhow to define the word \"final\" in this setting.               At the time the\n\nCourt decided Teague, the definition seemed clear:               a conviction\n\nbecomes final when \"a judgment of conviction has been rendered, the\n\n\n\n      2\n      To be sure, there are certain circumstances in which a newly\nannounced rule may be applied retroactively to a conviction that\nbecame final beforehand. See Teague, 489 U.S. at 310. Given the\ntiming here, see text infra, we need not explore these exceptions.\n\n                                     -8-\n\favailability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for\n\ncertiorari [has] elapsed or a petition for certiorari [filed and]\n\nfinally denied.\"      Griffith, 479 U.S. at 321 n.6.\n\n             But the law, by its nature, evolves over time, and the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No.\n\n104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), casts a shadow on the Griffith\n\ndefinition.      In     that   statute,       Congress    for   the    first   time\n\nestablished    time     limits    applicable      to    the   filing   of   habeas\n\npetitions:     a prisoner (state or federal) has one year from the\n\ndate on which his conviction becomes \"final\" within which to seek\n\nfederal habeas relief.3          See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244(d)(1), 2255.              In\n\ndiscussing finality in this context, Congress employed slightly\n\ndifferent terminology in regard to the time limits applicable to\n\nstate as opposed to federal prisoners.                 The one-year period for\n\nfiling a petition from a state court conviction begins to run on\n\n\"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of\n\ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking such\n\nreview.\"     28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A).                The one-year period for\n\nfiling   a   petition    challenging      a    federal    court   conviction     is\n\ndescribed more tersely; that period begins to run from and after\n\n\"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final . . .\n\n.\"   Id. § 2255.\n\n\n     3\n      This one-year limit is subject to certain periods of tolling.\nSee, e.g., Neverson v. Bissonnette, 261 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir.\n2001). These refinements are not relevant here.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f              In Gendron v. United States, 154 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 1998)\n\n(per curiam), the Seventh Circuit determined that the linguistic\n\ndifferences in the two provisions meant that Congress intended\n\ndivergent versions of finality for state and federal convictions.\n\nThe court reasoned that \"[w]here Congress includes particular\n\nlanguage in one section of an act but omits it another section of\n\nthe same act, . . . the language will not be implied where it has\n\nbeen excluded.\"       Id. at 674.         Since Congress used the phrase\n\n\"expiration of the time for seeking such review\" only in regard to\n\nstate prisoners, the court concluded that \"federal prisoners who\n\ndecide not to seek certiorari with the Supreme Court will have the\n\nperiod of limitations begin to run on the date [the court of\n\nappeals] issues the mandate in their direct criminal appeal.\"                  Id.\n\n              In Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d 565 (3d Cir. 1999),\n\nthe Third Circuit took issue with this interpretation.                   The court\n\nexpressed concern that Gendron invited a series of unfortunate\n\nresults.      Taken at face value, the Gendron rationale means that a\n\nfederal prisoner can file a collateral attack in the district court\n\nand   then    continue   his   pursuit    of   direct    review     by   filing   a\n\ncertiorari      petition.      Id.   at   570-71.       Moreover,    under   that\n\nrationale, finality will be defined differently for limitation\n\npurposes than for purposes of the Teague \"new rule\" analysis.                 Id.\n\nat 572.      Last — but far from least — the Gendron rationale creates\n\nan artificial distinction between state and federal prisoners — a\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdistinction that Congress, given the common origin and purpose of\n\nthe two AEDPA provisions, would have had no reason to draw.   Id. at\n\n575.     In light of these realities, the court determined that\n\nCongress intended sections 2244 and 2255 to operate on the same\n\ntime line.    Id.   Thus, under the Third Circuit's reading of the\n\nAEDPA, a conviction — whether state or federal — does not become\n\nfinal until \"the later of (1) the date on which the Supreme Court\n\naffirms the conviction and sentence on the merits or denies the\n\ndefendant's timely filed petition for certiorari, or (2) the date\n\non which the defendant's time for filing a timely petition for\n\ncertiorari review expires.\"   Id. at 577.\n\n           Although the Fourth Circuit has followed Gendron, see\n\nUnited States v. Torres, 211 F.3d 836, 839-41 (4th Cir. 2000), a\n\nclear majority of the circuit courts that have addressed the\n\nquestion have marched in lockstep with Kapral. See, e.g., Kaufmann\n\nv. United States, 282 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Garcia, 210 F.3d 1058, 1060 (9th Cir. 2000); United\n\nStates v. Gamble, 208 F.3d 536, 536-37 (5th Cir. 2000) (per\n\ncuriam); United States v. Burch, 202 F.3d 1274, 1279 (10th Cir.\n\n2000).    We too find the Kapral formulation the more persuasive.\n\nWhile it would be pleonastic to rehearse the Third Circuit's\n\nanalysis, we feel obliged to emphasize a factor that has special\n\nrelevance to the instant appeal:       the relationship between the\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\ffinality of the defendant's conviction and the announcement of new\n\nrules of criminal procedure by the Supreme Court.\n\n            Five years after Teague was decided, the Court made\n\npellucid that \"[a] state conviction and sentence become final for\n\npurposes of [the Teague analysis] when the availability of direct\n\nappeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for\n\nfiling a petition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely\n\nfiled petition has been finally denied.\"                  Caspari v. Bohlen, 510\n\nU.S. 383, 390 (1994).            Accordingly, were we to follow Gendron's\n\nlead and distinguish between the finality of state and federal\n\nconvictions, we would be forced to deny federal prisoners the\n\nbenefit of     a   new    rule    available   to       similarly     situated   state\n\nprisoners. Such a result is counter-intuitive, and we do not think\n\nthat Congress intended the nature of the particular sovereign\n\ndetaining the prisoner to have such a powerful impact on which\n\ndefendants may avail themselves of a new rule.                       Indeed, we can\n\ndiscern no sensible reason why Congress might wish to classify\n\nprisoners    in    this   peculiar     manner      —    and    under   the    best   of\n\ncircumstances, such a taxonomy would be difficult to administer.\n\n            Certainly,      the    minor   variation          in   language   between\n\nsection 2244 and section 2255, respectively, does not demand such\n\nan awkward result.         Section 2255 directs that a federal court\n\njudgment be \"final\" — and that term has a well-defined meaning in\n\nfederal law.       See, e.g., Griffith, 479 U.S. at 321 n.6; Hanover\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fIns. Co. v. United States, 880 F.2d 1503, 1509 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nSection 2244 contains the same directive with respect to state\n\ncourt convictions, but finality is a concept that has differing\n\nmeanings under the laws of the several states.      Compare, e.g.,\n\nWarren v. State, 833 S.W.2d 101, 102 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992) (\"If\n\none convicted of a crime takes no action to perfect his right to\n\nappeal, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of\n\nfinal conviction\"), with, e.g., Mont. Code. Ann. § 46-21-102(1)\n\n(defining finality for purposes of state habeas proceedings in a\n\nmanner similar to 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A)). Thus, Congress chose\n\nto ensure uniformity by explaining what \"final\" means in the\n\ncontext of a federal habeas petition that seeks to challenge a\n\nstate court conviction.     No similar need existed with respect to\n\nfederal court convictions (and, thus, the explanatory language was\n\nomitted in section 2255).\n\n          We will not paint the lily.     We hold that a conviction\n\nfor a federal defendant who fails to file a petition for a writ of\n\ncertiorari becomes final when the period in which he seasonably\n\nmight have done so expires. This levels the playing field as\n\nbetween state and federal prisoners desirous of seeking federal\n\nhabeas relief.\n\n          Our construction of section 2255 resolves the threshold\n\nquestion presented in this appeal.       Because the Supreme Court\n\ndecided Apprendi while the petitioner still had breathing room\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fwithin which to file a petition for certiorari, his conviction was\n\nnot yet final at that time.          It follows inexorably that the\n\nApprendi rule applies to the petitioner's case. Griffith, 479 U.S.\n\nat 322.    What remains to be seen is whether Apprendi aids the\n\npetitioner's cause.\n\nIII.   THE MERITS\n\n           We next trace the contours of the Apprendi error that\n\noccurred during the petitioner's trial and decide whether it\n\nnecessitates vacation of the petitioner's sentence.\n\n                       A.     The Apprendi Error.\n\n           The   government    concedes   that   the   petitioner's   case\n\nsuffers from a strain of Apprendi error.         In hindsight, the trial\n\ncourt should have asked the jury to determine, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, whether the underlying conspiracy involved a drug quantity\n\nsufficient to trigger a sentence higher than the five-year default\n\nstatutory maximum. See United States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 177-\n\n78 (1st Cir.) (explaining the genesis of the default statutory\n\nmaximum in an analogous context), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 379\n\n(2001); see also 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) (setting five-year\n\nmaximum for a conspiracy involving fewer than fifty marijuana\n\nplants).   Absent such a determination, the sentence imposed by the\n\ndistrict court — ten years and one month — is open to question.\n\n           The petitioner tries to define the district court's error\n\nmore broadly.    He asserts that the court transgressed Apprendi by\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fdetermining the drug quantity that was reasonably foreseeable to\n\nhim rather than tendering that question to the jury.                         In other\n\nwords, he claims that the court should have submitted to the jurors\n\nnot only the question of drug quantity vis-à-vis the conspiracy but\n\nalso       the   individualized    question       of   what    drug    quantity    was\n\nattributable to him as a coconspirator.                  We do not agree:          the\n\nApprendi error         is   far   narrower   in    scope      than    the   petitioner\n\nsuggests.\n\n                 In Edwards v. United States, 523 U.S. 511 (1998), the\n\nSupreme Court held that, as long as (1) the jury finds beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that a defendant participated in a conspiracy, and\n\n(2) the Court sentences him within the statutory maximum applicable\n\nto that conspiracy, the court may \"determine both the amount and\n\nthe kind of 'controlled substances' for which [the] defendant\n\nshould be held accountable — and then . . . impose a sentence that\n\nvaries depending upon amount and kind.\"                Id. at 513-14.        Apprendi,\n\ndecided two years later, did not purport to overrule Edwards, and\n\nthe two decisions are easily harmonized:                   in a drug conspiracy\n\ncase, the jury should determine the existence vel non of the\n\nconspiracy as well as any facts about the conspiracy that will\n\nincrease the possible penalty for the crime of conviction beyond\n\nthe default statutory maximum;4 and the judge should determine, at\n\n\n       4\n      This does not mean that a jury need return a special verdict\ndescribing the precise amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy.\nIt is enough that the jury supportably determines, beyond a\n\n                                       -15-\n\fsentencing, the particulars regarding the involvement of each\n\nparticipant in the conspiracy.      See Edwards, 523 U.S. at 514.      This\n\nmeans that   once    the   jury   has   determined   that   the   conspiracy\n\ninvolved a type and quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a\n\nsentence above the default statutory maximum and has found a\n\nparticular defendant guilty of participation in the conspiracy, the\n\njudge lawfully may determine the drug quantity attributable to that\n\ndefendant and sentence him accordingly (so long as the sentence\n\nfalls within the statutory maximum made applicable by the jury's\n\nconspiracy-wide drug quantity determination). Cf. United States v.\n\nEirby, 262 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding, post-Apprendi,\n\nthat when a sentence falls within the statutory maximum, \"judicial\n\ndetermination   of   drug   quantity     under   a   preponderance-of-the-\n\nevidence standard remains a viable option\").           The rule, then, is\n\nthat the government need only allege and prove to the jury the bare\n\nfacts necessary to increase the statutory sentencing maximum for\n\nthe conspiracy as a whole (e.g., that the conspiracy involved at\n\nleast 1,000 marijuana plants). See United States v. Patterson, 292\n\nF.3d 615, 623 (9th Cir. 2002) (upholding conviction based on jury\n\nfinding that the defendant was guilty of manufacturing 100 or more\n\n\n\nreasonable doubt, that the conspiracy involves a drug quantity that\nsurpasses the threshold amount needed to trigger the relevant\n(higher) statutory maximum. See, e.g., United States v. Patterson,\n292 F.3d 615, 623 (9th Cir. 2002) (finding no Apprendi error when\njury returned a guilty verdict after being instructed on only a\nthreshold quantity).\n\n                                    -16-\n\fplants, although the jury was not instructed to determine the exact\n\namount).\n\n           The decisions cited by the petitioner in support of a\n\ncontrary rule do not withstand scrutiny.       He relies chiefly on\n\nUnited States v. Nordby, 225 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir. 2000), but no\n\nextended discussion of that decision is warranted.    It suffices to\n\nsay that the Ninth Circuit severely limited Nordby's reach in\n\nUnited States v. Buckland, 289 F.3d 558, 567-68 (9th Cir. 2002) (en\n\nbanc), and then issued a decision in Patterson that coheres with\n\nthe decision we reach today.     See Patterson, 292 F.3d at 623.\n\n           Our recent opinion in United States v. Bailey, 270 F.3d\n\n83 (1st Cir. 2001), does not advance the petitioner's position.\n\nThere, the defendant argued that the jury — and not the judge —\n\nshould have decided the quantity of drugs attributed to him at\n\nsentencing.   Id. at 85-86.    We agreed that, because the defendant\n\nhad been sentenced to a term above the default statutory maximum,\n\nan Apprendi error had occurred.      Id. at 89.   We then considered\n\nwhether the error was harmless and concluded that it was not; the\n\nevidence needed to boost the statutory maximum to the next level\n\nwas sketchy and permitted a reasonable factfinder to decide the\n\ndrug quantity issue either way.     Id. at 89-90.   Consequently, we\n\nvacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing.      Id. at 90.\n\nThe decisive factor in Bailey, however, was the government's\n\ninability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\finvolved the requisite drug quantity necessary to elevate the\n\napplicable statutory maximum to the next level.                That weakness is\n\nnot present here.      See infra Part III(B).\n\n            To    summarize,     we   conclude     that   an    Apprendi   error\n\noccurred,   but    that    the   trial   court's    determination     that   the\n\npetitioner reasonably could have foreseen that the conspiracy would\n\nencompass at least 26,400 marijuana plants should not be regarded\n\nas part and parcel of that error.         See Edwards, 523 U.S. at 513-14.\n\nInstead, the Apprendi error relates to the failure to have the jury\n\ndetermine the number of plants involved in the conspiracy.                 It is\n\nto the effect of that error that we now turn.\n\n                      B.    The Effect of the Error.\n\n            The next step in the pavane requires that we determine\n\nwhether the discerned error invalidates the petitioner's sentence.\n\nOn this point, the petitioner faces an uphill climb.              The fact that\n\nApprendi is available to him in theory (because his conviction was\n\nnot yet final when Apprendi was decided) does not mean that he can\n\ntake advantage of that decision in practice; the rub is that he\n\nfailed either to object to the jury instructions or to contest the\n\ntrial court's sentencing determination on direct appeal.                   These\n\nomissions transgress the general rule that a criminal defendant\n\nmust seasonably advance an objection to a potential constitutional\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\finfirmity in order to preserve the point for collateral attack.5\n\nSee Burks v. Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n             The rationale behind the rule is straightforward:\n\n             A contemporaneous objection enables the record\n             to be made with respect to the constitutional\n             claim when the recollections of witnesses are\n             freshest, not years later in a federal habeas\n             proceeding. It enables the judge who observed\n             the demeanor of those witnesses to make the\n             factual determinations necessary for properly\n             deciding the federal constitutional question.\n\nWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 88 (1977).      Moreover, the rule\n\nprevents \"'sandbagging' on the part of defense lawyers, who may\n\ntake their chances on a verdict of not guilty in a state trial\n\ncourt with the intent to raise their constitutional claims in a\n\nfederal habeas court if their initial gamble does not pay off.\"\n\nId. at 89.\n\n             The petitioner concedes that he failed to raise and\n\npreserve an Apprendi objection at his trial, but he nonetheless\n\nseeks to avoid any penalty for this procedural default on the\n\nground that Apprendi changed the traditional method of determining\n\ndrug quantity for sentencing purposes, and, thus, constituted a\n\nwatershed decision.       Whether or not this characterization of\n\nApprendi is apt, the petitioner's argument is misguided.         The\n\n\n     5\n      This rule was first developed in the context of examinations\nby federal habeas courts into independent and adequate grounds for\nprocedural default in state trials. E.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433\nU.S. 72, 86-89 (1977). The Supreme Court has extended the rule to\nfederal convictions. E.g., Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614,\n622 (1998).\n\n                                 -19-\n\finquiry into the applicability of the procedural default rule is,\n\nfor the most part, black or white:         either the defendant proffered\n\na   timely   objection   or   he   did   not.   While   there   are   a   few\n\nexceptions, see, e.g., Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 621-\n\n22 (1998) (discussing exception for claims that could not be\n\npresented without further factual development, e.g., a claim that\n\na guilty plea was coerced), the subsequent announcement of a\n\nSupreme Court ruling — whether or not it blazes new trails — is not\n\none of them.6\n\n             Bousley illustrates this point.        That case involved a\n\nhabeas application prosecuted by an individual who had pleaded\n\nguilty to a federal firearms offense that was later circumscribed\n\nby the Court.    Id. at 616-18 (citing Bailey v. United States, 516\n\n\n      6\n      This is not to say that how one categorizes Apprendi is\nirrelevant.   Whether Apprendi may properly be classified as a\nwatershed opinion and whether the petitioner could have foreseen\nthe Court's ruling are factors that go to the \"cause\" prong of the\nprocedural default analysis. See Bousley, 523 U.S. at 623. Those\ncourts of appeals that have grappled with these questions to date\nhave held unanimously that Apprendi was not a watershed decision,\nthat the Court's opinion was foreseeable to criminal defendants,\nand, therefore, that no cause existed sufficient to excuse a\nprocedural default. E.g., McCoy v. United States, 266 F.3d 1245,\n1258-59 (11th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 2362 (2002);\nUnited States v. Moss, 252 F.3d 993, 1001-03 (8th Cir. 2001), cert.\ndenied, 122 S. Ct. 848 (2002); United States v. Sanders, 247 F.3d\n139, 145-46 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 573 (2001); United\nStates v. Smith, 241 F.3d 546, 548-59 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 122\nS. Ct. 267 (2001).    We recognize, however, that most of these\ndecisions produced vociferous dissents, see, e.g., McCoy, 266 F.3d\nat 1272-74 (Barkett, J., dissenting); Moss, 252 F.3d at 1005-06 (R.\nArnold, J., dissenting), and, given the utter absence of any\nprejudice here, it would serve no useful purpose to dive\ngratuitously into these murky waters.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fU.S. 137, 143-50 (1995)).        Even though the defendant entered his\n\nplea without knowing that the Court subsequently would curtail the\n\nstatute in a way that might have affected the outcome of his case,\n\nthe Court performed an archetypical procedural default analysis\n\nwhen it considered his habeas petition.              See id. at 621-22.    We see\n\nno principled distinction here.\n\n          We    thus   proceed       to   the       question   of    whether   the\n\npetitioner's procedural default is excused.                    A defendant can\n\nsurmount this hurdle in one of two ways.                  First, he can offer\n\nevidence sufficient to prove that he is actually innocent of the\n\nunderlying charge.       Id. at 622.         The petitioner makes no such\n\nclaim.\n\n          The   second    way   in    which     a    defendant   can   clear   the\n\nprocedural default hurdle is by showing good cause for the default\n\nand actual prejudice resulting therefrom.               Burks, 55 F.3d at 716.\n\nWe use the conjunctive purposefully because the defendant must\n\ncarry the devoir of persuasion as to both cause and prejudice.                 Id.\n\nBecause   the   petitioner      in    this      case    has    not   sufficiently\n\ndemonstrated prejudice, see text infra, we need not inquire into\n\nthe question of cause.7\n\n\n     7\n      This means, of course, that we need not dwell on the\npetitioner's allegation that his appellate counsel was ineffective\nin failing to file a petition for certiorari. It bears mention,\nhowever, that the Supreme Court has explicitly held that the\nfailure to file a petition for discretionary review cannot\nconstitute cognizable ineffective assistance of counsel, and, thus,\nsuch a failure cannot constitute cause sufficient to excuse a\n\n                                      -21-\n\f            The showing of prejudice needed to cure a procedural\n\ndefault generally requires a habeas petitioner to demonstrate \"that\n\n'there is a reasonable probability' that the result of the trial\n\nwould have been different\" absent the error.     Strickler v. Green,\n\n527 U.S. 263, 289 (1999) (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419,\n\n433 (1995)).     The question is not whether the petitioner, qua\n\ndefendant, would more likely have received a different verdict had\n\nthe error not occurred, but whether he received a fair trial,\n\nunderstood as a trial worthy of confidence, notwithstanding the\n\nbevue.    See Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434; see also Prou v. United States,\n\n199 F.3d 37, 49 (equating the prejudice standard for ineffective\n\nassistance cases with the standard for showing case and prejudice\n\nunder United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152 (1982)).\n\n            To be sure, the Supreme Court has not elaborated the\n\nprecise definition of the cause and prejudice standard for all\n\nclaims.    See Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U.S. 214, 221 (1988).8   Still, any\n\nerror that results in unfairness so patent as to violate the Due\n\n\n\n\nprocedural default.     Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 752-53\n(1991).\n     8\n      The Court recently held, however, that a defendant's failure\nto object to an Apprendi error at trial engenders plain error\nreview on direct appeal. United States v. Cotton, 122 S. Ct. 1781,\n1785 (2002). This is a rigorous standard — under it, a court will\nreverse a conviction only if, among other things, the error\nseriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\nthe trial — but the showing of prejudice required to excuse a\nprocedural default is even more demanding. Frady, 456 U.S. at 166.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fProcess Clause will necessarily satisfy the Strickler and Kyles\n\nstandards.     See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 494 (1986).\n\n             We analyze the issue of prejudice based on an examination\n\nof the record as a whole.       See Frady, 456 U.S. at 169.               Here, our\n\ninquiry focuses on the likelihood that the jury, had it been asked\n\nthe question, would have found that the underlying conspiracy\n\ninvolved   the    manufacture   and    distribution          of    at   least   fifty\n\nmarijuana plants. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C); see also Harris v.\n\nUnited States, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 2418 (2002).                The burden rests with\n\nthe petitioner to show that there is a reasonable probability that\n\nthe jury would have reached a different, more favorable conclusion.\n\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); Burks, 55 F.3d at\n\n716.\n\n           This    inquiry   need    not     detain    us.        The   evidence     is\n\ncommanding that the conspiracy of which the appellant was a member\n\ninvolved far more than fifty plants, and that any rational jury\n\nwould have found as much.           After all, during the course of the\n\ntrial the government presented detailed evidence about the size,\n\nscope, and inner workings of the criminal cabal.                   During the seven\n\nyears that the coconspirators operated the underground greenhouse\n\non the petitioner's property, marijuana was grown in three rooms.\n\nTwo rooms were 104 feet long and 36 feet wide, and the other 72\n\nfeet long and 38 feet wide.     The facility was equipped with special\n\nair-conditioning     and   heating    systems,        and    was    powered     by   an\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\findependent   generator.   At   its    high   point,   the   underground\n\ngreenhouse housed as many as 20,000 plants.       Individual harvests\n\nyielded as many as 5,000 plants.       The alternate site was on the\n\nsame order of magnitude; the government seized 5,600 plants when it\n\nraided the premises in 1995.\n\n          In a nutshell, no reasonable juror could have found that\n\nthe conspiracy involved fewer than several thousand marijuana\n\nplants. The evidence of the size and duration of the operation was\n\ncopious. So too was the evidence of the petitioner's participation\n\nin the enterprise (indeed, he does not now contest that the\n\ngovernment adequately tied him to the marijuana-growing operation).\n\nFairly viewed, the record as a whole does not lend credence to the\n\npetitioner's plaint that the outcome might have been different but\n\nfor the Apprendi error.\n\n          In an effort to blunt the force of this conclusion, the\n\npetitioner argues that, had the district court consigned the drug-\n\nquantity issue to the jury, he would have contested that issue more\n\nvigorously. This argument rings hollow. The indictment explicitly\n\nstated that the petitioner was charged with conspiracy in the\n\nmanufacture and distribution of 1,000 or more marijuana plants, and\n\nhe was thus on notice that he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of\n\nten years unless he could cast doubt upon that allegation.          That\n\nwas incentive enough to mount as robust a challenge as possible.\n\nAnd to cinch matters, the petitioner has alluded to no evidence\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fupon which he could have based a credible claim that the conspiracy\n\ninvolved only a small number of marijuana plants.\n\n            The petitioner also posits that he did not know of the\n\nbreadth of the conspiracy, and, thus, could not have foreseen the\n\nnumber of plants attributed to him at sentencing. That argument is\n\nmoot. As we have said, once it was established that the petitioner\n\nwas a participant in a conspiracy that involved at least fifty\n\nmarijuana plants, the district court was free, under Edwards and\n\nApprendi, to determine foreseeability and sentence the petitioner\n\nwithin the elevated statutory maximum.       The court did so — and the\n\npetitioner eschewed a timely challenge to that determination.9\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. Although the jury instructions in\n\nthis case did not anticipate Apprendi, that unpreserved error did\n\nnot result in cognizable prejudice. Neither the petitioner's trial\n\nnor   his   sentence     were   fundamentally    unfair.

Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Dina Michael Chaitowitz, Appellate Chief, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA and LYNCH, Circuit Judges, and SCHWARZER,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> Senior District Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, petitioner-appellant Herbert Derman challenges the district court's denial of his application for post-conviction relief. He argues that the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) &#8212; announced after we rejected his direct appeal but before the expiration of the time within which he was eligible to apply for a writ of certiorari &#8212; demands that we set aside his conviction. Although his appeal is ably argued and raises intricate issues (including one that has divided our sister circuits and another that is of first impression at the appellate level), it is in the end unavailing. Consequently, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the application for post-conviction relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We limn those facts pertinent to the instant appeal, referring readers who crave more exegetic detail to our opinion affirming the petitioner's conviction. <i>See United States v. Derman,</i> 211 F.3d 175 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1984, Marcel Rosenzweig oversaw an underground greenhouse on property owned by the petitioner. This facility housed a huge marijuana-growing operation. The venture prospered for several years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When word of a large-scale marijuana grow leaked in 1991, police officers visited the site. They were thrown off the scent by a legal above-ground greenhouse that Rosenzweig and his cohorts ran to conceal the illegal activities below. Because the officers did not realize what lay beneath, their search revealed only trace amounts of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an abundance of caution, Rosenzweig moved the enterprise to a different locus. The culprits continued growing and distributing marijuana until the federal government cracked the case four years later. A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Massachusetts soon indicted the petitioner and six other persons (including Rosenzweig). The indictment charged the defendants with, inter alia, conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846. As part of the conspiracy charge, the indictment specifically mentioned a statutory provision mandating a ten-year minimum sentence for conspiracies involving at least 1,000 marijuana plants. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the defendants, save only the petitioner, pleaded guilty to the charges. The petitioner maintained his innocence, asserting that he had no knowledge of either the underground greenhouse or its unlawful contents. The district court instructed the jury on the standard issues, but not on the question of drug quantity. The jury found the petitioner guilty on the conspiracy count and on a related forfeiture count.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned its verdict on July 29, 1998. The district court denied the petitioner's post-trial motions and scheduled the disposition hearing to take place on March 5, 1999. Drug quantity was a contested issue. <i>See United States v. O'Campo,</i> 973 F.2d 1015, 1026 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[T]he base offense level of a co-conspirator at sentencing should reflect only the quantity of drugs he reasonably foresees it is the object of the conspiracy to distribute after he joins the conspiracy.\"). The relevant measure of drug quantity in this case was the number of marijuana plants involved. Leaving recidivism to one side, a defendant convicted of participation in a conspiracy that involves fewer than fifty plants can receive an incarcerative sentence of no more than five years. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(D). If the conspiracy involved fifty plants or more, the maximum sentence is twenty years. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). For a conspiracy of 100 plants or more, the maximum sentence is forty years. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(B). Finally, for a conspiracy of 1,000 plants or more, the maximum sentence is life. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). The number of marijuana plants also can dictate a mandatory minimum sentence: five years for 100 plants or more, <i>id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), and ten years for 1,000 plants or more, <i>id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the probation department prepared a presentence investigation report (the PSI Report) concluding that the petitioner was responsible for 213,000 marijuana plants. The petitioner objected, claiming that he could not reasonably have foreseen the vast amounts of marijuana grown underneath his property and elsewhere. On that basis, he argued that his sentence should not be more than five years. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(D) (establishing a five-year default statutory maximum for a quantity of marijuana less than fifty plants).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court flatly rejected the petitioner's contention. Focusing on the fact that 1,000 plants was the number of marijuana plants needed to trigger a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), the court stated: \"I would have to find that the sky was green to conclude that there weren't at least a thousand plants that were foreseeable in this conspiracy at the time that [the petitioner] entered into it....\" That said, the court proceeded to calculate the total number of plants attributable to the petitioner. The court presumed that the petitioner reasonably could have foreseen an output of 200 plants a month (a total of 26,400 plants over the eleven-year span of the conspiracy). The court then sentenced the petitioner to an incarcerative term of 121 months (one month above the applicable mandatory minimum).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed his conviction, but not his sentence. We rejected his direct appeal on May 5, 2000. <i>Derman,</i> 211 F.3d at 177. In the course of that appeal, he assigned no error implicating either the jury instructions or the lower court's assessment of drug quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner had ninety days from the date of entry of our judgment to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. <i>See</i> Sup.Ct. R. 13(1). The Supreme Court decided <i>Apprendi</i> on June 26, 2000 &#8212; well within that ninety-day window. <i>Apprendi</i>'s core holding is that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The petitioner's trial seemingly flouted this principle: after all, the district court did not instruct the jury on a fact &#8212; drug quantity &#8212; that increased the maximum penalty for the petitioner's crime from five years (the default statutory maximum) to life imprisonment. <i>Compare</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(D) <i>with id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). The petitioner claims that he instructed his appellate counsel to file a certiorari petition on this ground during the period in which that opportunity was available to him, but that counsel neglected to comply. So ended direct review of the petitioner's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner thereafter retained a new lawyer. On April 27, 2001, he launched a collateral attack in the district court. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. He asserted that the court had sentenced him in violation of <i>Apprendi,</i> and that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because his appellate attorney had ignored his instructions to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing on October 9, 2001. Ruling from the bench, the court dismissed the petition. Three days later, the court elaborated on its reasoning in a written rescript. To summarize, the court rejected the petitioner's <i>Apprendi</i> claim for three reasons. It held that <i>Apprendi</i> could not be applied retroactively to the petitioner's habeas claim; that the petitioner had waived any and all objections to his sentence by failing to challenge the sentence on direct appeal; and that, in all events, the district court's failure to submit the drug quantity question to the jury was harmless because the record contained overwhelming evidence that the number of marijuana plants involved in the plot exceeded the number necessary to bring an elevated maximum sentence into play. On much the same basis the court also rejected the petitioner's ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal ensued. We granted a certificate of appealability to decide the <i>Apprendi</i> issues. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. FINALITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis by determining the applicability of <i>Apprendi</i> to this petition &#8212; a determination that requires us to decide when the petitioner's conviction became \"final\" within the meaning of the relevant statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a convicted defendant may find refuge in a rule of criminal procedure newly announced by the Supreme Court depends in large part on timing. If the conviction is not yet final when the Supreme Court announces the rule, then inferior courts must apply that rule to the defendant's case. <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 322, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987). If, however, the conviction is already final, then the defendant ordinarily may not avail himself of the newly announced rule. <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But words often are chameleons, taking on different shades of meaning in different contexts. The question, then, is how to define the word \"final\" in this setting. At the time the Court decided <i>Teague,</i> the definition seemed clear: a conviction becomes final when \"a judgment of conviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for certiorari [has] elapsed or a petition for certiorari [filed and] finally denied.\" <i>Griffith,</i> 479 U.S. at 321 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the law, by its nature, evolves over time, and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), casts a shadow on the <i>Griffith</i> definition. In that statute, Congress for the first time established time limits applicable to the filing of habeas petitions: a prisoner (state or federal) has one year from the date on which his conviction becomes \"final\" within which to seek federal habeas relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2244(d)(1), 2255. In discussing finality in this context, Congress employed slightly different terminology in regard to the time limits applicable to state as opposed to federal prisoners. The one-year period for filing a petition from a state court conviction begins to run on \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A). The one-year period for filing a petition challenging a federal court conviction is described more tersely; that period begins to run from and after \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Gendron v. United States,</i> 154 F.3d 672 (7th Cir.1998) (per curiam), the Seventh Circuit determined that the linguistic differences in the two provisions meant that Congress intended divergent versions of finality for state and federal convictions. The court reasoned that \"[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of an act but omits it in another section of the same act, ... the language will not be implied where it has been excluded.\" <i>Id.</i> at 674. Since Congress used the phrase \"expiration of the time for seeking such review\" only in regard to state prisoners, the court concluded that \"federal prisoners who decide not to seek certiorari with the Supreme Court will have the period of limitations begin to run on the date [the court of appeals] issues the mandate in their direct criminal appeal.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Kapral v. United States,</i> 166 F.3d 565 (3d Cir.1999), the Third Circuit took issue with this interpretation. The court expressed concern that <i>Gendron</i> invited a series of unfortunate results. Taken at face value, the <i>Gendron</i> rationale means that a federal prisoner can file a collateral attack in the district court and then continue his pursuit of direct review by filing a certiorari petition. <i>Id.</i> at 570-71. Moreover, under that rationale, finality will be defined differently for limitation purposes than for purposes of the <i>Teague</i> \"new rule\" analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 572. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the <i>Gendron</i> rationale creates an artificial distinction between state and federal prisoners &#8212; a distinction that Congress, given the common origin and purpose of the two AEDPA provisions, would have had no reason to draw. <i>Id.</i> at 575. In light of these realities, the court determined that Congress intended sections 2244 and 2255 to operate on the same time line. <i>Id.</i> Thus, under the Third Circuit's reading of the AEDPA, a conviction &#8212; whether state or federal &#8212; does not become final until \"the later of (1) the date on which the Supreme Court affirms the conviction and sentence on the merits or denies the defendant's timely filed petition for certiorari, or (2) the date on which the defendant's time for filing a timely petition for certiorari review expires.\" <i>Id.</i> at 577.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Fourth Circuit has followed <i>Gendron, see United States v. Torres,</i> 211 F.3d 836, 839-41 (4th Cir.2000), a clear majority of the circuit courts that have addressed the question have marched in lockstep with <i>Kapral. See, e.g., Kaufmann v. United States,</i> 282 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 210 F.3d 1058, 1060 (9th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Gamble,</i> 208 F.3d 536, 536-37 (5th Cir.2000) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Burch,</i> 202 F.3d 1274, 1279 (10th Cir.2000). We too find the <i>Kapral</i> formulation the more persuasive. While it would be pleonastic to rehearse the Third Circuit's analysis, we feel obliged to emphasize a factor that has special relevance to the instant appeal: the relationship between the finality of the defendant's conviction and the announcement of new rules of criminal procedure by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five years after <i>Teague</i> was decided, the Court made pellucid that \"[a] state conviction and sentence become final for purposes of [the <i>Teague</i> analysis] when the availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely filed petition has been finally denied.\" <i>Caspari v. Bohlen,</i> 510 U.S. 383, 390, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994). Accordingly, were we to follow <i>Gendron</i>'s lead and distinguish between the finality of state and federal convictions, we would be forced to deny federal prisoners the benefit of a new rule available to similarly situated state prisoners. Such a result is counter-intuitive, and we do not think that Congress intended the nature of the particular sovereign detaining the prisoner to have such a powerful impact on which defendants may avail themselves of a new rule. Indeed, we can discern no sensible reason why Congress might wish to classify prisoners in this peculiar manner &#8212; and under the best of circumstances, such a taxonomy would be difficult to administer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the minor variation in language between section 2244 and section 2255, respectively, does not demand such an awkward result. Section 2255 directs that a federal court judgment be \"final\" &#8212; and that term has a well-defined meaning in federal law. <i>See, e.g., Griffith,</i> 479 U.S. at 321 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 708; <i>Hanover Ins. Co. v. United States,</i> 880 F.2d 1503, 1509 (1st Cir.1989). Section 2244 contains the same directive with respect to state court convictions, but finality is a concept that has differing meanings under the laws of the several states. <i>Compare, e.g., Warren v. State,</i> 833 S.W.2d 101, 102 (Tenn.Crim. App.1992) (\"If one convicted of a crime takes no action to perfect his right to appeal, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of final conviction\"), <i>with, e.g.,</i> Mont.Code. Ann. &#167; 46-21-102(1) (defining finality for purposes of state habeas proceedings in a manner similar to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A)). Thus, Congress chose to ensure uniformity by explaining what \"final\" means in the context of a federal habeas petition that seeks to challenge a state court conviction. No similar need existed with respect to federal court convictions (and, thus, the explanatory language was omitted in section 2255).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily. We hold that a conviction for a federal defendant who fails to file a petition for a writ of certiorari becomes final when the period in which he seasonably might have done so expires. This levels the playing field as between state and federal prisoners desirous of seeking federal habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our construction of section 2255 resolves the threshold question presented in this appeal. Because the Supreme Court decided <i>Apprendi</i> while the petitioner still had breathing room within which to file a petition for certiorari, his conviction was not yet final at that time. It follows inexorably that the <i>Apprendi</i> rule applies to the petitioner's case. <i>Griffith,</i> 479 U.S. at 322, 107 S.Ct. 708. What remains to be seen is whether <i>Apprendi</i> aids the petitioner's cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next trace the contours of the <i>Apprendi</i> error that occurred during the petitioner's trial and decide whether it necessitates vacation of the petitioner's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Apprendi Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government concedes that the petitioner's case suffers from a strain of <i>Apprendi</i> error. In hindsight, the trial court should have asked the jury to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, whether the underlying conspiracy involved a drug quantity sufficient to trigger a sentence higher than the five-year default statutory maximum. <i>See United States v. Barnes,</i> 244 F.3d 172, 177-78 (1st Cir.) (explaining the genesis of the default statutory maximum in an analogous context), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 379, 151 L.Ed.2d 289 (2001); <i>see also</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(D) (setting five-year maximum for a conspiracy involving fewer than fifty marijuana plants). Absent such a determination, the sentence imposed by the district court &#8212; ten years and one month &#8212; is open to question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner tries to define the district court's error more broadly. He asserts that the court transgressed <i>Apprendi</i> by determining the drug quantity that was reasonably foreseeable to him rather than tendering that question to the jury. In other words, he claims that the court should have submitted to the jurors not only the question of drug quantity vis-&#224;-vis the conspiracy but also the individualized question of what drug quantity was attributable to him as a coconspirator. We do not agree: the <i>Apprendi</i> error is far narrower in scope than the petitioner suggests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Edwards v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 511, 118 S.Ct. 1475, 140 L.Ed.2d 703 (1998), the Supreme Court held that, as long as (1) the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant participated in a conspiracy, and (2) the Court sentences him within the statutory maximum <i>applicable to that conspiracy,</i> the court may \"determine both the amount and the kind of `controlled substances' for which [the] defendant should be held accountable &#8212; and then ... impose a sentence that varies depending upon amount and kind.\" <i>Id.</i> at 513-14, 118 S.Ct. 1475. <i>Apprendi,</i> decided two years later, did not purport to overrule <i>Edwards,</i> and the two decisions are easily harmonized: in a drug conspiracy case, the jury should determine the existence <i>vel non</i> of the conspiracy as well as any facts about the conspiracy that will increase the possible penalty for the crime of conviction beyond the default statutory maximum;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and the judge should determine, at sentencing, the particulars regarding the involvement of each participant in the conspiracy. <i>See Edwards,</i> 523 U.S. at 514, 118 S.Ct. 1475. This means that once the jury has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the default statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant guilty of participation in the conspiracy, the judge lawfully may determine the drug quantity attributable to that defendant and sentence him accordingly (so long as the sentence falls within the statutory maximum made applicable by the jury's conspiracy-wide drug quantity determination). <i>Cf. United States v. Eirby,</i> 262 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding, post-<i>Apprendi,</i> that when a sentence falls within the statutory maximum, \"judicial determination of drug quantity under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard remains a viable option\"). The rule, then, is that the government need only allege and prove to the jury the bare facts necessary to increase the statutory sentencing maximum <i>for the conspiracy as a whole</i> (e.g., that the conspiracy involved at least 1,000 marijuana plants). <i>See United States v. Patterson,</i> 292 F.3d 615, 623 (9th Cir.2002) (upholding conviction based on jury finding that the defendant was guilty of manufacturing 100 or more plants, although the jury was not instructed to determine the exact amount).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decisions cited by the petitioner in support of a contrary rule do not withstand scrutiny. He relies chiefly on <i>United States v. Nordby,</i> 225 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir.2000), but no extended discussion of that decision is warranted. It suffices to say that the Ninth Circuit severely limited <i>Nordby</i>'s reach in <i>United States v. Buckland,</i> 289 F.3d 558, 567-68 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), and then issued a decision in <i>Patterson</i> that coheres with the decision we reach today. <i>See Patterson,</i> 292 F.3d at 623.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our recent opinion in <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 270 F.3d 83 (1st Cir.2001), does not advance the petitioner's position. There, the defendant argued that the jury &#8212; and not the judge &#8212; should have decided the quantity of drugs attributed to him at sentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 85-86. We agreed that, because the defendant had been sentenced to a term above the default statutory maximum, an <i>Apprendi</i> error had occurred. <i>Id.</i> at 89. We then considered whether the error was harmless and concluded that it was not; the evidence needed to boost the statutory maximum to the next level was sketchy and permitted a reasonable factfinder to decide the drug quantity issue either way. <i>Id.</i> at 89-90. Consequently, we vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 90. The decisive factor in <i>Bailey,</i> however, was the government's inability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy involved the requisite drug quantity necessary to elevate the applicable statutory maximum to the next level. That weakness is not present here. <i>See infra</i> Part III(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we conclude that an <i>Apprendi</i> error occurred, but that the trial court's determination that the petitioner reasonably could have foreseen that the conspiracy would encompass at least 26,400 marijuana plants should not be regarded as part and parcel of that error. <i>See Edwards,</i> 523 U.S. at 513-14, 118 S.Ct. 1475. Instead, the <i>Apprendi</i> error relates to the failure to have the jury determine the number of plants involved in the conspiracy. It is to the effect of that error that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Effect of the Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step in the pavane requires that we determine whether the discerned error invalidates the petitioner's sentence. On this point, the petitioner faces an uphill climb. The fact that <i>Apprendi</i> is available to him in theory (because his conviction was not yet final when <i>Apprendi</i> was decided) does not mean that he can take advantage of that decision in practice; the rub is that he failed either to object to the jury instructions or to contest the trial court's sentencing determination on direct appeal. These omissions transgress the general rule that a criminal defendant must seasonably advance an objection to a potential constitutional infirmity in order to preserve the point for collateral attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See Burks v. Dubois,</i> 55 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale behind the rule is straightforward:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A contemporaneous objection enables the record to be made with respect to the constitutional claim when the recollections of witnesses are freshest, not years later in a federal habeas proceeding. It enables the judge who observed the demeanor of those witnesses to make the factual determinations necessary for properly deciding the federal constitutional question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 88, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). Moreover, the rule prevents \"`sandbagging' on the part of defense lawyers, who may take their chances on a verdict of not guilty in a state trial court with the intent to raise their constitutional claims in a federal habeas court if their initial gamble does not pay off.\" <i>Id.</i> at 89, 97 S.Ct. 2497.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner concedes that he failed to raise and preserve an <i>Apprendi</i> objection at his trial, but he nonetheless seeks to avoid any penalty for this procedural default on the ground that <i>Apprendi</i> changed the traditional method of determining drug quantity for sentencing purposes, and, thus, constituted a watershed decision. Whether or not this characterization of <i>Apprendi</i> is apt, the petitioner's argument is misguided. The inquiry into the applicability of the procedural default rule is, for the most part, black or white: either the defendant proffered a timely objection or he did not. While there are a few exceptions, <i>see, e.g., Bousley v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 614, 621-22, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (discussing exception for claims that could not be presented without further factual development, e.g., a claim that a guilty plea was coerced), the subsequent announcement of a Supreme Court ruling &#8212; whether or not it blazes new trails &#8212; is not one of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bousley</i> illustrates this point. That case involved a habeas application prosecuted by an individual who had pleaded guilty to a federal firearms offense that was later circumscribed by the Court. <i>Id.</i> at 616-18, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (citing <i>Bailey v. United States,</i> 516 U.S. 137, 143-50, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995)). Even though the defendant entered his plea without knowing that the Court subsequently would curtail the statute in a way that might have affected the outcome of his case, the Court performed an archetypical procedural default analysis when it considered his habeas petition. <i>See id.</i> at 621-22, 118 S.Ct. 1604. We see no principled distinction here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus proceed to the question of whether the petitioner's procedural default is excused. A defendant can surmount this hurdle in one of two ways. First, he can offer evidence sufficient to prove that he is actually innocent of the underlying charge. <i>Id.</i> at 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604. The petitioner makes no such claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second way in which a defendant can clear the procedural default hurdle is by showing good cause for the default and actual prejudice resulting therefrom. <i>Burks,</i> 55 F.3d at 716. We use the conjunctive purposefully because the defendant must carry the devoir of persuasion as to both cause and prejudice. <i>Id.</i> Because the petitioner in this case has not sufficiently demonstrated prejudice, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we need not inquire into the question of cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The showing of prejudice needed to cure a procedural default generally requires a habeas petitioner to demonstrate \"that `there is a reasonable probability' that the result of the trial would have been different\" absent the error. <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (quoting <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995)). The question is not whether the petitioner, <i>qua</i> defendant, would more likely have received a different verdict had the error not occurred, but whether he received a fair trial, understood as a trial worthy of confidence, notwithstanding the bevue. <i>See Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555; <i>see also Prou v. United States,</i> 199 F.3d 37, 49 (equating the prejudice standard for ineffective assistance cases with the standard for showing case and prejudice under <i>United States v. Frady,</i> 456 U.S. 152, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the Supreme Court has not elaborated the precise definition of the cause and prejudice standard for all claims. <i>See Amadeo v. Zant,</i> 486 U.S. 214, 221, 108 S.Ct. 1771, 100 L.Ed.2d 249 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Still, any error that results in unfairness so patent as to violate the Due Process Clause will necessarily satisfy the <i>Strickler</i> and <i>Kyles</i> standards. <i>See Murray v. Carrier,</i> 477 U.S. 478, 494, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We analyze the issue of prejudice based on an examination of the record as a whole. <i>See Frady,</i> 456 U.S. at 169, 102 S.Ct. 1584. Here, our inquiry focuses on the likelihood that the jury, had it been asked the question, would have found that the underlying conspiracy involved the manufacture and distribution of at least fifty marijuana plants. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C); <i>see also Harris v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2418, 153 L.Ed.2d 524, ___ (2002). The burden rests with the petitioner to show that there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different, more favorable conclusion. <i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> 501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); <i>Burks,</i> 55 F.3d at 716.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This inquiry need not detain us. The evidence is commanding that the conspiracy of which the appellant was a member involved far more than fifty plants, and that any rational jury would have found as much. After all, during the course of the trial the government presented detailed evidence about the size, scope, and inner workings of the criminal cabal. During the seven years that the coconspirators operated the underground greenhouse on the petitioner's property, marijuana was grown in three rooms. Two rooms were 104 feet long and 36 feet wide, and the other 72 feet long and 38 feet wide. The facility was equipped with special air-conditioning and heating systems, and was powered by an independent generator. At its high point, the underground greenhouse housed as many as 20,000 plants. Individual harvests yielded as many as 5,000 plants. The alternate site was on the same order of magnitude; the government seized 5,600 plants when it raided the premises in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, no reasonable juror could have found that the conspiracy involved fewer than several thousand marijuana plants. The evidence of the size and duration of the operation was copious. So too was the evidence of the petitioner's participation in the enterprise (indeed, he does not now contest that the government adequately tied him to the marijuana-growing operation). Fairly viewed, the record as a whole does not lend credence to the petitioner's plaint that the outcome might have been different but for the <i>Apprendi</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this conclusion, the petitioner argues that, had the district court consigned the drug-quantity issue to the jury, he would have contested that issue more vigorously. This argument rings hollow. The indictment explicitly stated that the petitioner was charged with conspiracy in the manufacture and distribution of 1,000 or more marijuana plants, and he was thus on notice that he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years unless he could cast doubt upon that allegation. That was incentive enough to mount as robust a challenge as possible. And to cinch matters, the petitioner has alluded to no evidence upon which he could have based a credible claim that the conspiracy involved only a small number of marijuana plants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also posits that he did not know of the breadth of the conspiracy, and, thus, could not have foreseen the number of plants attributed to him at sentencing. That argument is moot. As we have said, once it was established that the petitioner was a participant in a conspiracy that involved at least fifty marijuana plants, the district court was free, under <i>Edwards</i> and <i>Apprendi,</i> to determine foreseeability and sentence the petitioner within the elevated statutory maximum. The court did so &#8212; and the petitioner eschewed a timely challenge to that determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although the jury instructions in this case did not anticipate <i>Apprendi,</i> that unpreserved error did not result in cognizable prejudice. Neither the petitioner's trial nor his sentence were fundamentally unfair. Under the circumstances, the district court appropriately denied the application for post-conviction relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The jury acquitted the petitioner on several other charges, including money laundering.

Given the timing here, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we need not explore these exceptions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This one-year limit is subject to certain periods of tolling<i>See, e.g., Neverson v. Bissonnette,</i> 261 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir.2001).

It is enough that the jury supportably determines, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the conspiracy involves a drug quantity that surpasses the threshold amount needed to trigger the relevant (higher) statutory maximum<i>See, e.g., United States v. Patterson,</i> 292 F.3d 615, 623 (9th Cir.2002) (finding no <i>Apprendi</i> error when jury returned a guilty verdict after being instructed on only a threshold quantity).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This rule was first developed in the context of examinations by federal habeas courts into independent and adequate grounds for procedural default in state trials<i>E.g., Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 86-89, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). The Supreme Court has extended the rule to federal convictions. <i>E.g., Bousley v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 614, 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This is not to say that how one categorizes<i>Apprendi</i> is irrelevant. Whether <i>Apprendi</i> may properly be classified as a watershed opinion and whether the petitioner could have foreseen the Court's ruling are factors that go to the \"cause\" prong of the procedural default analysis. <i>See Bousley,</i> 523 U.S. at 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604. Those courts of appeals that have grappled with these questions to date have held unanimously that <i>Apprendi</i> was not a watershed decision, that the Court's opinion was foreseeable to criminal defendants, and, therefore, that no cause existed sufficient to excuse a procedural default. <i>E.g., McCoy v. United States,</i> 266 F.3d 1245, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2362, 153 L.Ed.2d 183 (2002); <i>United States v. Moss,</i> 252 F.3d 993, 1001-03 (8th Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 848, 151 L.Ed.2d 725 (2002); <i>United States v.

We recognize, however, that most of these decisions produced vociferous dissents, <i>see, e.g., McCoy,</i> 266 F.3d at 1272-74 (Barkett, J., dissenting); <i>Moss,</i> 252 F.3d at 1005-06 (R.

It bears mention, however, that the Supreme Court has explicitly held that the failure to file a petition for discretionary review cannot constitute cognizable ineffective assistance of counsel, and, thus, such a failure cannot constitute cause sufficient to excuse a procedural default<i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> 501 U.S. 722, 752-53, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The Court recently held, however, that a defendant's failure to object to an<i>Apprendi</i> error at trial engenders plain error review on direct appeal. <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). This is a rigorous standard &#8212; under it, a court will reverse a conviction only if, among other things, the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the trial &#8212; but the showing of prejudice required to excuse a procedural default is even more demanding. <i>Frady,</i> 456 U.S. at 166, 102 S.Ct. 1584.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Even were the issue of foreseeability still open, the district court's findings seem unimpugnable.

The indictment charged the defendants with, inter alia, conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846. As part of the conspiracy charge, the indictment specifically mentioned a statutory provision mandating a ten-year minimum sentence for conspiracies involving at least 1,000 marijuana plants. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the defendants, save only the petitioner, pleaded guilty to the charges. The petitioner maintained his innocence, asserting that he had no knowledge of either the underground greenhouse or its unlawful contents. The district court instructed the jury on the standard issues, but not on the question of drug quantity.

The relevant measure of drug quantity in this case was the number of marijuana plants involved. Leaving recidivism to one side, a defendant convicted of participation in a conspiracy that involves fewer than fifty plants can receive an incarcerative sentence of no more than five years. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(D). If the conspiracy involved fifty plants or more, the maximum sentence is twenty years. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). For a conspiracy of 100 plants or more, the maximum sentence is forty years. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(B). Finally, for a conspiracy of 1,000 plants or more, the maximum sentence is life. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). The number of marijuana plants also can dictate a mandatory minimum sentence: five years for 100 plants or more, <i>id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), and ten years for 1,000 plants or more, <i>id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the probation department prepared a presentence investigation report (the PSI Report) concluding that the petitioner was responsible for 213,000 marijuana plants. The petitioner objected, claiming that he could not reasonably have foreseen the vast amounts of marijuana grown underneath his property and elsewhere. On that basis, he argued that his sentence should not be more than five years. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(D) (establishing a five-year default statutory maximum for a quantity of marijuana less than fifty plants).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court flatly rejected the petitioner's contention. Focusing on the fact that 1,000 plants was the number of marijuana plants needed to trigger a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), the court stated: \"I would have to find that the sky was green to conclude that there weren't at least a thousand plants that were foreseeable in this conspiracy at the time that [the petitioner] entered into it....\" That said, the court proceeded to calculate the total number of plants attributable to the petitioner. The court presumed that the petitioner reasonably could have foreseen an output of 200 plants a month (a total of 26,400 plants over the eleven-year span of the conspiracy). The court then sentenced the petitioner to an incarcerative term of 121 months (one month above the applicable mandatory minimum).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed his conviction, but not his sentence.

The Supreme Court decided <i>Apprendi</i> on June 26, 2000 &#8212; well within that ninety-day window. <i>Apprendi</i>'s core holding is that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The petitioner's trial seemingly flouted this principle: after all, the district court did not instruct the jury on a fact &#8212; drug quantity &#8212; that increased the maximum penalty for the petitioner's crime from five years (the default statutory maximum) to life imprisonment. <i>Compare</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(D) <i>with id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).

Ruling from the bench, the court dismissed the petition. Three days later, the court elaborated on its reasoning in a written rescript. To summarize, the court rejected the petitioner's <i>Apprendi</i> claim for three reasons. It held that <i>Apprendi</i> could not be applied retroactively to the petitioner's habeas claim; that the petitioner had waived any and all objections to his sentence by failing to challenge the sentence on direct appeal; and that, in all events, the district court's failure to submit the drug quantity question to the jury was harmless because the record contained overwhelming evidence that the number of marijuana plants involved in the plot exceeded the number necessary to bring an elevated maximum sentence into play.

The question, then, is how to define the word \"final\" in this setting. At the time the Court decided <i>Teague,</i> the definition seemed clear: a conviction becomes final when \"a judgment of conviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for certiorari [has] elapsed or a petition for certiorari [filed and] finally denied.\" <i>Griffith,</i> 479 U.S. at 321 n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), casts a shadow on the <i>Griffith</i> definition. In that statute, Congress for the first time established time limits applicable to the filing of habeas petitions: a prisoner (state or federal) has one year from the date on which his conviction becomes \"final\" within which to seek federal habeas relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2244(d)(1), 2255. In discussing finality in this context, Congress employed slightly different terminology in regard to the time limits applicable to state as opposed to federal prisoners. The one-year period for filing a petition from a state court conviction begins to run on \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A). The one-year period for filing a petition challenging a federal court conviction is described more tersely; that period begins to run from and after \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Gendron v.

The court reasoned that \"[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of an act but omits it in another section of the same act, ... the language will not be implied where it has been excluded.\" <i>Id.</i> at 674. Since Congress used the phrase \"expiration of the time for seeking such review\" only in regard to state prisoners, the court concluded that \"federal prisoners who decide not to seek certiorari with the Supreme Court will have the period of limitations begin to run on the date [the court of appeals] issues the mandate in their direct criminal appeal.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Kapral v.

The court expressed concern that <i>Gendron</i> invited a series of unfortunate results. Taken at face value, the <i>Gendron</i> rationale means that a federal prisoner can file a collateral attack in the district court and then continue his pursuit of direct review by filing a certiorari petition. <i>Id.</i> at 570-71. Moreover, under that rationale, finality will be defined differently for limitation purposes than for purposes of the <i>Teague</i> \"new rule\" analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 572. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the <i>Gendron</i> rationale creates an artificial distinction between state and federal prisoners &#8212; a distinction that Congress, given the common origin and purpose of the two AEDPA provisions, would have had no reason to draw. <i>Id.</i> at 575. In light of these realities, the court determined that Congress intended sections 2244 and 2255 to operate on the same time line. <i>Id.</i> Thus, under the Third Circuit's reading of the AEDPA, a conviction &#8212; whether state or federal &#8212; does not become final until \"the later of (1) the date on which the Supreme Court affirms the conviction and sentence on the merits or denies the defendant's timely filed petition for certiorari, or (2) the date on which the defendant's time for filing a timely petition for certiorari review expires.\" <i>Id.</i> at 577.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Fourth Circuit has followed <i>Gendron, see United States v.

We too find the <i>Kapral</i> formulation the more persuasive.

Accordingly, were we to follow <i>Gendron</i>'s lead and distinguish between the finality of state and federal convictions, we would be forced to deny federal prisoners the benefit of a new rule available to similarly situated state prisoners. Such a result is counter-intuitive, and we do not think that Congress intended the nature of the particular sovereign detaining the prisoner to have such a powerful impact on which defendants may avail themselves of a new rule. Indeed, we can discern no sensible reason why Congress might wish to classify prisoners in this peculiar manner &#8212; and under the best of circumstances, such a taxonomy would be difficult to administer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the minor variation in language between section 2244 and section 2255, respectively, does not demand such an awkward result. Section 2255 directs that a federal court judgment be \"final\" &#8212; and that term has a well-defined meaning in federal law. <i>See, e.g., Griffith,</i> 479 U.S. at 321 n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Section 2244 contains the same directive with respect to state court convictions, but finality is a concept that has differing meanings under the laws of the several states. <i>Compare, e.g., Warren v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></span>, 102 (Tenn.Crim. App.1992) (\"If one convicted of a crime takes no action to perfect his right to appeal, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of final conviction\"), <i>with, e.g.,</i> Mont.Code. Ann. &#167; 46-21-102(1) (defining finality for purposes of state habeas proceedings in a manner similar to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A)). Thus, Congress chose to ensure uniformity by explaining what \"final\" means in the context of a federal habeas petition that seeks to challenge a state court conviction. No similar need existed with respect to federal court convictions (and, thus, the explanatory language was omitted in section 2255).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.

This means that once the jury has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the default statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant guilty of participation in the conspiracy, the judge lawfully may determine the drug quantity attributable to that defendant and sentence him accordingly (so long as the sentence falls within the statutory maximum made applicable by the jury's conspiracy-wide drug quantity determination). <i>Cf.

The rule, then, is that the government need only allege and prove to the jury the bare facts necessary to increase the statutory sentencing maximum <i>for the conspiracy as a whole</i> (e.g., that the conspiracy involved at least 1,000 marijuana plants). <i>See United States v.

There, the defendant argued that the jury &#8212; and not the judge &#8212; should have decided the quantity of drugs attributed to him at sentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 85-86. We agreed that, because the defendant had been sentenced to a term above the default statutory maximum, an <i>Apprendi</i> error had occurred. <i>Id.</i> at 89. We then considered whether the error was harmless and concluded that it was not; the evidence needed to boost the statutory maximum to the next level was sketchy and permitted a reasonable factfinder to decide the drug quantity issue either way. <i>Id.</i> at 89-90. Consequently, we vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 90. The decisive factor in <i>Bailey,</i> however, was the government's inability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy involved the requisite drug quantity necessary to elevate the applicable statutory maximum to the next level. That weakness is not present here. <i>See infra</i> Part III(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we conclude that an <i>Apprendi</i> error occurred, but that the trial court's determination that the petitioner reasonably could have foreseen that the conspiracy would encompass at least 26,400 marijuana plants should not be regarded as part and parcel of that error. <i>See Edwards,</i> 523 U.S. at 513-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118200\"><a href=\"/opinion/118200/edwards-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On this point, the petitioner faces an uphill climb. The fact that <i>Apprendi</i> is available to him in theory (because his conviction was not yet final when <i>Apprendi</i> was decided) does not mean that he can take advantage of that decision in practice; the rub is that he failed either to object to the jury instructions or to contest the trial court's sentencing determination on direct appeal.

The evidence is commanding that the conspiracy of which the appellant was a member involved far more than fifty plants, and that any rational jury would have found as much. After all, during the course of the trial the government presented detailed evidence about the size, scope, and inner workings of the criminal cabal. During the seven years that the coconspirators operated the underground greenhouse on the petitioner's property, marijuana was grown in three rooms. Two rooms were 104 feet long and 36 feet wide, and the other 72 feet long and 38 feet wide. The facility was equipped with special air-conditioning and heating systems, and was powered by an independent generator. At its high point, the underground greenhouse housed as many as 20,000 plants. Individual harvests yielded as many as 5,000 plants. The alternate site was on the same order of magnitude; the government seized 5,600 plants when it raided the premises in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, no reasonable juror could have found that the conspiracy involved fewer than several thousand marijuana plants. The evidence of the size and duration of the operation was copious. So too was the evidence of the petitioner's participation in the enterprise (indeed, he does not now contest that the government adequately tied him to the marijuana-growing operation). Fairly viewed, the record as a whole does not lend credence to the petitioner's plaint that the outcome might have been different but for the <i>Apprendi</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this conclusion, the petitioner argues that, had the district court consigned the drug-quantity issue to the jury, he would have contested that issue more vigorously. This argument rings hollow. The indictment explicitly stated that the petitioner was charged with conspiracy in the manufacture and distribution of 1,000 or more marijuana plants, and he was thus on notice that he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years unless he could cast doubt upon that allegation. That was incentive enough to mount as robust a challenge as possible. And to cinch matters, the petitioner has alluded to no evidence upon which he could have based a credible claim that the conspiracy involved only a small number of marijuana plants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also posits that he did not know of the breadth of the conspiracy, and, thus, could not have foreseen the number of plants attributed to him at sentencing. That argument is moot. As we have said, once it was established that the petitioner was a participant in a conspiracy that involved at least fifty marijuana plants, the district court was free, under <i>Edwards</i> and <i>Apprendi,</i> to determine foreseeability and sentence the petitioner within the elevated statutory maximum. The court did so &#8212; and the petitioner eschewed a timely challenge to that determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although the jury instructions in this case did not anticipate <i>Apprendi,</i> that unpreserved error did not result in cognizable prejudice. Neither the petitioner's trial nor his sentence were fundamentally unfair. Under the circumstances, the district court appropriately denied the application for post-conviction relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The jury acquitted the petitioner on several other charges, including money laundering.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span> (1977). The Supreme Court has extended the rule to federal convictions. <i>E.g., Bousley v.

Whether <i>Apprendi</i> may properly be classified as a watershed opinion and whether the petitioner could have foreseen the Court's ruling are factors that go to the \"cause\" prong of the procedural default analysis. <i>See Bousley,</i> 523 U.S. at 623, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1604</span></a></span>. Those courts of appeals that have grappled with these questions to date have held unanimously that <i>Apprendi</i> was not a watershed decision, that the Court's opinion was foreseeable to criminal defendants, and, therefore, that no cause existed sufficient to excuse a procedural default. <i>E.g., McCoy v.

We recognize, however, that most of these decisions produced vociferous dissents, <i>see, e.g., McCoy,</i> 266 F.3d at 1272-74 (Barkett, J., dissenting); <i>Moss,</i> 252 F.3d at 1005-06 (R.

It bears mention, however, that the Supreme Court has explicitly held that the failure to file a petition for discretionary review cannot constitute cognizable ineffective assistance of counsel, and, thus, such a failure cannot constitute cause sufficient to excuse a procedural default<i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 752-53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Cotton,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is a rigorous standard &#8212; under it, a court will reverse a conviction only if, among other things, the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the trial &#8212; but the showing of prejudice required to excuse a procedural default is even more demanding. <i>Frady,</i> 456 U.S. at 166, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110693\"><a href=\"/opinion/110693/united-states-v-frady/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Given the sheer size of the marijuana-growing operation, its duration, and the mass of evidence indicating that the petitioner played an integral role in it, there is no realistic possibility, let alone a reasonable probability, that a jury would have attributed fewer than fifty marijuana plants to him</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
