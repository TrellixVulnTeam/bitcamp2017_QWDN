FRANCO,\n\n                           Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n    José R. Franco on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n                         May 27, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam.            Attorney José R. Franco appeals an order\n\nfrom the United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico suspending him from the practice of law before that court\n\nfor a period of 18 months. Having carefully reviewed the record\n\nin this case, we vacate the suspension order and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n           In 2001, a former client filed a disciplinary complaint\n\nagainst   Franco       in     which      she    alleged    that    her    employment\n\ndiscrimination case had been dismissed with prejudice because of\n\nFranco's failure to respond to defendant's motions. The client\n\nalleged that she had frequently contacted Franco's office and had\n\nbeen repeatedly told that her case was proceeding well.                             She\n\nfurther   alleged          that    two     acquaintances         had    had   similar\n\nexperiences.          Upon     questioning        Franco       subsequent     to    the\n\ndismissals, the three were told that he failed to respond to the\n\nmotions to dismiss because someone in his office had misfiled the\n\nmotions and thus he was unaware of their existence.\n\n           The matter was referred to Magistrate Judge Arenas for\n\ninvestigation.        After    taking      testimony      from    several     parties,\n\nincluding the complaining witnesses and Franco, the magistrate\n\njudge issued      a    report      in    which    he   found     that    disciplinary\n\nproceedings were warranted because Franco \"had probably violated\"\n\nseveral   Rules       of    Professional       Responsibility.           These     rules\n\nessentially require that a lawyer act with reasonable diligence\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fin representing a client, as well as keep a client reasonably\n\ninformed about the status of a matter.        They also require that\n\nthe lawyer make reasonable efforts to assure that non-lawyer\n\nassistants act in a manner compatible with the professional\n\nobligations of the lawyer.\n\n           In response, Franco complained, inter alia, that the\n\nmagistrate judge had made reference to Franco's conduct in other\n\nunrelated cases without fully investigating those cases.\n\n           After considering the magistrate judge's report and\n\n\"having taken judicial notice of various [unspecified] orders\n\nsanctioning respondent,\" the district judge issued an order for\n\nFranco to show cause why he should not be suspended for 18 months\n\nfrom the practice of law before the court.          In response, Franco\n\nrepeated his prior objections. In particular, he emphasized once\n\nagain that the magistrate judge's reference to cases beyond those\n\nof the complaining witnesses was unwarranted.\n\n           After considering the response to the show cause order,\n\nthe   district   judge   suspended   Franco   for    18   months.   The\n\nsuspension was based both on the magistrate judge's preliminary\n\nreport and on the court's taking judicial notice of other cases\n\nwhich were either dismissed for Franco's failure to prosecute or\n\nin which he was fined for failure to appear at a scheduled time.\n\nSeveral of the cases relied upon by the court had neither been\n\nreferred nor investigated by the magistrate judge.            After his\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fmotion for reconsideration was denied, Franco appealed to this\n\ncourt.\n\n            This court reviews a district court decision to impose\n\ndiscipline for abuse of discretion.               In re Cordova-Gonzalez, 996\n\nF.2d 1334, 1335 (1st Cir. 1993).              Although Franco raises several\n\nissues on appeal, we find it necessary only to address one at\n\nthis time.\n\n            In    its     order    imposing    the    18-month      sanction,   the\n\ndistrict court explicitly relied on its judicial notice of\n\nseveral   cases      other    than    those      involving     the    complaining\n\nwitnesses. Franco was neither informed that the court would rely\n\non these cases nor was he given an opportunity to respond.\n\nMoreover,    most    of    these     had   not    been   investigated      by   the\n\nmagistrate       judge.       The     district       court    appears,    without\n\ninvestigation, to have concluded from the mere fact of the\n\ndismissals that Franco had failed in his ethical duty to act with\n\nreasonable diligence in representing his clients.\n\n             \"[A]n      attorney     facing      discipline    is    entitled    to\n\nprocedural due process, including notice and an opportunity to be\n\nheard.\"      In re Cordova-Gonzalez, 996 F.2d 1334, 1335 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) (citations omitted).             In the instant case, Franco was\n\nneither given prior notice of the court's intention to rely on\n\nthe majority of the cases cited in the suspension order nor was\n\nhe offered       an opportunity to be heard on them. Therefore, the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdistrict court order is vacated and the case is remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings in accord with this judgment. On remand, the\n\ncourt should either reach a decision based on the record compiled\n\nduring the investigation, or, if it desires to expand the scope\n\nof the investigation to include additional cases, it should refer\n\nthe matter for further investigation, as well as provide Franco\n\nwith prior notice of its intentions and an opportunity to be\n\nheard and to object.    See United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico, Rule 83.5(b).\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
