This is a case arising under\n\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (\"OSH Act\" or the\n\n\"Act\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 651-678.                   Petitioner Modern Continental\n\nConstruction, Inc. (\"MCC\") seeks review of a final decision by the\n\nOccupational        Safety    and     Health        Review    Commission      (the\n\n\"Commission\"), which affirmed the citations issued against MCC\n\nunder the OSH Act by the Secretary of Labor.                  Finding that the\n\ncitations     are     supported      by     substantial      evidence    in   the\n\nadministrative record, we deny MCC's petition for review and affirm\n\nthe Commission's order.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            MCC is a general contractor at a work site associated\nwith the \"Big Dig,\" a massive construction project that will\n\nsubmerge a section of interstate highway below the streets of\nBoston.     The events in question took place in an underground room\n-- approximately forty feet long, twenty to thirty feet wide, and\n\ntwenty feet     deep    --   built   to     provide   ventilation   to     highway\ntunnels.     On Saturday, July 22, 2000, MCC employees, under the\ndirection of general foreman Pasquale Pezzano (\"Pezzano\"), engaged\nin the dangerous, but not uncommon, task of hoisting shoring\n\nmaterials from this underground room.                  The hoisting required\n\nemployees in the underground room to manually secure, or \"rig,\"\n\nloads of shoring materials to a crane for withdrawal through a\n\nsmall rectangular opening at the surface.\n\n             Generally, loads are rigged in a horizontal fashion.\n\nThis manner promotes balance and increases safety.                  However, on\n\n                                          -2-\n\fthis   particular   day,    at   least   one   load   could   not   be   rigged\n\nhorizontally because its width exceeded that of the opening at the\n\nsurface. Instead, this load was rigged vertically, a dangerous and\nawkward method.\n\n           In addition to the difficulty inherent in hoisting an\n\nunstable vertical load, the access hole itself presented a problem.\nAccording to Pezzano and Anthony Cappuccio (\"Cappuccio\"), another\n\nMCC foreman working that day, the surface hole was the smallest\n\nfrom which they had ever removed shoring.             Despite the fact that\n\nhoisting a load vertically through a small opening requires a great\n\ndegree of skill and presents an increased element of danger, MCC\n\nprovided no formal training to its employees on securing a load for\n\nvertical hoisting.         Nor was training provided for alternative\nrigging methods, such as rigging the load diagonally or removing\n\neach piece of shoring by hand.\n\n           The vertical load in question was initially rigged by MCC\nemployee Natalio Elías (\"Elías\"), an inexperienced worker with\n\nlimited English proficiency. On his first attempt, Elías used only\n\na single strap to secure a load of about twenty cross-braces.\n\nThough it was inadequately secured, Foreman Cappuccio was given the\n\nsignal to raise the one-hundred-pound bundle.             From the surface,\n\nCappuccio noticed that the strap was slipping as the load was being\n\nraised, so he signaled for it to be lowered.            Cappuccio explained\n\nto Elías that he either needed to double-wrap the cross-braces or\n\nuse an additional strap.         No other instructions concerning the\n\nsecuring of the load were given.           When Elías did not appear to\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\funderstand Cappuccio's explanation, another employee, fluent in\n\nElías' native Portugese, was summoned to translate.\n\n          After these efforts failed, Louis Sousa, another MCC\nforeman, eventually rigged the vertical bundle himself and signaled\n\nfor Cappuccio to begin lifting.              As the heavy load was being\n\nraised, its weight shifted, and the entire load slipped and fell\nback down through the access hole.           One of the cross-braces struck\n\nElías, impaling him through the head.\n\n          On July 24, 2000, two days after the accident, Compliance\n\nOfficer   Eric    Jones,   of   the     Occupational    Safety   and   Health\n\nAdministration     (\"OSHA\"),    began    a    post-accident    investigation.\n\nFollowing the inspection, OSHA issued MCC the following citations:\n\n           1. Serious Citation 1, Item 1, alleging a\n           violation of 29 C.F.R. § 1926.21(b)(2) because\n           \"employees were not adequately trained in\n           rigging methods.\"\n          2. Repeat Citation 2, Item 1, alleging a\n          violation of 29 C.F.R. § 1926.550(a)(19) for\n          failing to assure that all employees were kept\n          clear of suspended loads.\n\n          The     Administrative      Law    Judge   (\"ALJ\")   affirmed   both\ncitations.1   Sec'y of Labor v. Modern Cont'l Constr. Co., 19 OSHC\n\n(BNA) 1760 (OSHA ALJ Div. 2001).             MCC then challenged the ALJ's\n\ndecision by filing a Petition for Discretionary Review with the\n\nCommission.      When no Commission Member directed the matter for\n\n\n1\n   Serious Citation 1, Item 2 was withdrawn by the Secretary at the\nhearing.     That citation alleged a violation of 29 C.F.R.\n§ 1926.251(a)(1) (\"Rigging equipment for material handling shall be\ninspected prior to use on each shift and as necessary during its\nuse to ensure that it is safe. Defective rigging equipment shall\nbe removed from service.\").\n\n                                      -4-\n\freview, the ALJ's decision automatically became a final order of\n\nthe Commission by operation of law.            See 29 U.S.C. § 661(j).       MCC\n\nthen   filed   a   timely   petition    with    this   Court   to   review   the\nCommission's final order.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           Our review of the Commission's order is deferential.\n\nFinal orders of the Commission are subject to the general judicial\n\nreview provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 701-706.    See P. Gioioso & Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC, 115 F.3d 100,\n\n107-08 (1st Cir. 1997).        Under those provisions, we will uphold\nagency determinations unless they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an\n\nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"                 5\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).     In making this determination, we defer to the\nagency's reasonable interpretation of the OSH Act and the governing\n\nregulations. See Beaver Plant Operations, Inc. v. Herman, 223 F.3d\n\n25, 29 (1st Cir. 2000).         The OSH Act also directs that \"[t]he\nfindings of the Commission with respect to questions of fact, if\n\nsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a\nwhole, shall be conclusive.\"           29 U.S.C. § 660(a); see also P.\n\nGioioso & Sons, 115 F.3d at 108. This deferential standard governs\n\neven where, as here, the Commission does not hear the case itself\nbut instead adopts an ALJ's findings.            Modern Cont'l/Obayashi v.\n\nOSHRC, 196 F.3d 274, 280 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           MCC disputes the Commission's adverse determination on\nboth of the citations against it, arguing that neither is supported\n\nby substantial evidence or relevant law.           MCC also challenges the\n\n                                       -5-\n\fpropriety of the penalty assessed against it.           We address each\n\nargument in turn.\n\n          A.    Citation 1 - Failure to Train\n\n          Congress enacted the OSH Act to reduce employment-related\n\ninjury and illness.     See 29 U.S.C. § 651.        To that end, the Act\n\nplaces primary responsibility on employers -- that is, those who\n\noversee and control the work environment -- to achieve compliance\n\nwith its standards and ensure a safe workplace.          See S. Rep. No.\n\n91-1282, at 9 (1970), reprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5177, 5186\n\n(\"Employers have primary control of the work environment and should\ninsure that it is safe and healthful.\").        Thus, under the Act, an\n\nemployer must \"comply with occupational safety and health standards\npromulgated under this chapter,\" 29 U.S.C. § 654(a)(2), and, if no\napplicable standards exist, \"furnish to each of his employees . . .\n\na place of employment which [is] free from recognized hazards that\nare causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to\nhis employees.\"     Id. § 654(a)(1).\n\n          For    further    guidance,    Congress   provided   OSHA   with\nauthority to promulgate occupational safety and health standards by\nregulation.    Id. § 655.   Pursuant to this authority, the agency has\n\nissued two types of standards.      The first, known as the \"general\nindustry standards,\" see 29 C.F.R. pt. 1910, act as a default set\n\nof standards.     In addition, OSHA has presented various sets of\n\nstandards applicable only to certain industries.          The agency has\npromulgated a set of such industry-specific standards for the\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fimplementation of the OSH Act in the construction industry.2                    See\n\n29 C.F.R. pt. 1926.       These regulations are applicable to any place\n\nof employment where construction work is performed.               See 29 C.F.R.\n§ 1910.12(a).\n\n             The construction-industry standard applicable to MCC's\n\nfirst citation provides: \"The employer shall instruct each employee\nin the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the\n\nregulations applicable to his work environment to control or\n\neliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.\"                   29\n\nC.F.R. § 1926.21(b)(2).         The citation against MCC specifically\n\ncharged that \"employees were not adequately trained in rigging\n\nmethods.\" \"In order to establish a violation of an [OSH Act]\n\nstandard, the Secretary must show: (a) the applicability of the\ncited standard; (b) the employer's noncompliance with the standard;\n\n(c) employee     access    to   the   violative    condition;      and    (d)   the\n\nemployer's actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.\"\nModern Cont'l/Obayashi, 196 F.3d at 279.                 MCC challenges the\n\nCommission's order with respect to the failure-to-train citation on\n\nboth legal and factual grounds.\n\n             MCC argues first that, as a matter of law, the citation\n\nis defective because there is no \"rigging\" standard established by\n\nOSHA   and   that   improper    rigging     is   not   one   of   the    \"hazards\"\n\ncontemplated by § 1926.21(b)(2). According to MCC, the true hazard\n\n2\n   The construction-industry standards were adopted shortly after\nthe passage of the OSH Act, and are comprised of federal standards\nthat had previously been promulgated under the Construction Safety\nAct of 1969, 40 U.S.C. § 333. See Reich v. Simpson, Gumpertz &\nHeger, Inc., 3 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                      -7-\n\fin this case is the danger of a falling load, a hazard that is\n\nalready covered        by   a   separate       regulation   and    that   cannot    be\n\ncompletely eliminated by training in alternate rigging methods.\n              MCC    interprets   the     protections       of   the   Act   far   too\n\nnarrowly.     The training regulation in question provides in general\n\nterms    that       employers    must     instruct     each      employee    in    the\n\"recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions.\"                         29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1926.21(b)(2).        The purview of the regulation is not limited to\n\ntraining for hazards expressly identified by OSHA regulation.                      The\n\nCommission has stated that \"[u]nder § 1926.21(b)(2), an employer\n\nmust instruct its employees in the recognition and avoidance of\n\nthose hazards of which a reasonably prudent employer would have\n\nbeen aware.\" Capform, Inc., 19 OSHC (BNA) 1374, 1376 (OSHRC 2001),\n\naff'd,   34     Fed.   Appx.    152     (5th    Cir.   2002).      Similarly,      the\n\nregulation does not require only such training as will completely\n\neliminate hazards; it also requires training in the \"avoidance\" and\n\"control\" of dangerous conditions.                 29 C.F.R. § 1926.21(b)(2).\n\nTherefore, as a legal matter, it is of no moment that OSHA has not\nprescribed a specific \"rigging\" standard.               Rather, the question is\n\nwhether a reasonably prudent employer would have been aware of the\n\nhazard arising from the failure to train in proper rigging methods.\n\nNotably, MCC does not claim that a reasonable employer would not\n\nhave been aware of the dangers inherent in failing to train\n\nemployees in the safe rigging of loads.                 Nor does MCC claim that\n\nsuch training departs from standards in the industry.                        Thus, we\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fconclude that the failure-to-train citation stands on a solid legal\n\nfoundation.\n\n          MCC also challenges the factual basis for the ALJ's\ndecision, arguing that the record clearly demonstrates that MCC\n\ngave adequate training in proper rigging methods.       According to\n\nMCC, training in safe rigging was taught on an on-the-job basis by\nother laborers and journeymen.\n\n          In concluding that MCC did not satisfy the training\n\nrequirements under § 1926.21(b)(2), the ALJ weighed the evidence\n\npresented by MCC against the evidence presented by the Secretary.\n\nInterestingly, both sides arrived at the same conclusion: MCC\n\nemployees received little or no training on how to rig loads that\n\ncould not be rigged horizontally.      For instance, the testimony of\nthree high-ranking MCC employees, Foremen Cappuccio and Pezzano and\n\nWayne Rice (\"Rice\"), MCC's vice-president of corporate safety,\n\nadmitted that hoisting a load vertically was not recommended\nbecause it was less stable and more difficult than lifting a load\n\nhorizontally. Yet, none of these witnesses could identify any form\n\nof employee training in alternate methods.      In addition, the ALJ\n\nheard testimony from a former MCC employee, Scott Collins, who did\n\nnot recall ever receiving any training in rigging for small access\n\nholes, loose bundles, or vertical loads.\n\n          The foregoing demonstrates that the ALJ's decision was\n\namply supported by substantial evidence in the record.      And since\n\nMCC has not provided any compelling evidence to the contrary, we\n\naffirm the ALJ's conclusion as to the failure-to-train citation.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f           B.   Citation 2 - Repeat Violation\n\n           MCC was also charged with a repeat violation of 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1926.550(a)(19), which provides that \"[a]ll employees shall be\n\nkept clear of loads about to be lifted and of suspended loads.\"\n\nId.   Although it is apparent that the standard was violated -- the\n\naccident itself shows that Elías was not clear of the suspended\n\nload -- MCC argues it should not be held accountable because the\n\nviolation resulted from idiosyncratic employee conduct that it\n\ncould not, and was not required by law to, control.      MCC argues\n\nfurther that the ALJ erred in concluding that MCC's failure to\nabide by § 1926.550(a)(19) constitutes a \"repeat\" violation, which\n\nis subject to additional penalties under the OSH Act.        See 29\nU.S.C. § 666(a).\n           We first address MCC's argument that it established a\n\ncomplete defense to the violation.     As this Court has explained\nbefore:\n           The OSH Act requires that an employer do\n           everything reasonably within its power to\n           ensure that its personnel do not violate\n           safety standards. But if an employer lives up\n           to that billing and an employee nonetheless\n           fails to use proper equipment or otherwise\n           ignores firmly established safety measures, it\n           seems unfair to hold the employer liable.\nP. Gioioso & Sons, 115 F.3d at 109.    We have therefore recognized\n\nan affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct.     In\norder to reach the safe harbor of this defense, an employer must\ndemonstrate: (1) that it established a work rule to prevent the\n\nreckless behavior or unsafe condition from occurring; (2) that it\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fadequately communicated the rule to its employees; (3) that it took\n\nsteps to discover incidents of noncompliance; and (4) that it\n\neffectively enforced the rule whenever employees transgressed it.\nId. at 109.        Our review of the ALJ's analysis of these factors\n\ncomports with the usual deferential standards.\n\n             As to the first element of the defense, MCC contends that\nit had an established work rule, often repeated to employees, to\n\n\"stay clear of the load\" and \"stay away from the hole.\"            The ALJ\n\nconcluded that these general admonitions were insufficient as a\n\nwork rule to prevent violations of the standard.           The ALJ pointed\n\nout that this general rule gave no indication of when employees\n\nwere required to stay clear of the hole, a necessary consideration,\n\ngiven the fact that the employees in the enclosed area were\nexpected to continue working near the hole at times when no load\n\nwas being hoisted.         The ALJ also credited evidence from the\n\nSecretary indicating that the employees working below the loads had\nan obstructed view of the access hole and thus had no knowledge of\n\nwhen    a   load   was   being   hoisted.3   Given   the   total   lack   of\n\nspecificity in MCC's rule and the obvious insufficiency of its\n\ncommand, we have no problem affirming the ALJ's conclusion that the\n\nadmonition to \"stay away from the hole\" was not an adequate work\n\nrule.   See PBR, Inc. v. Sec'y of Labor, 643 F.2d 890, 895 (1st Cir.\n\n3\n   MCC presented photographs, taken ten months after the accident,\nas evidence that employees in the access hole could clearly see\nwhen a load was overhead. The ALJ concluded that the Secretary's\nconflicting photographs, taken shortly after the accident, were\nmore reliable. Given the great deference we owe to the ALJ on such\nmatters, we see no reason to disturb the fact-finder's evaluation\nof the photographs.\n\n                                     -11-\n\f1981)   (\"[The     employer]    cannot     escape   responsibility       for   the\n\nviolation because it warned its employees to exercise caution.\n\nSuch delegation of employee safety to the employees themselves is\nclearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the Act.\").\n\n              The ALJ also found that MCC failed to establish the\n\nsecond prong of the affirmative defense -- namely, that the work\nrule was adequately communicated to employees.              In particular, the\n\nALJ found that the training provided was not tailored to the needs\n\nof    those    employees     with     little   experience   or    with   limited\n\nunderstanding of English, such as Elías, the employee injured in\n\nthe accident.      The ALJ observed that MCC's training materials were\n\nprovided only in English, despite a large number of employees with\n\nlimited English proficiency.\n              Furthermore, the ALJ found that MCC did not establish\n\nthat it took steps to discover violations of the rule or that it\n\ntook any disciplinary action when such violations were discovered.\nTestimony from Rice, Cappuccio, and Pezzano supported this finding.\n\nRice admitted that MCC did not note violations in personnel files\n\nand that the company's foremen, who have direct supervision over\n\nlaborers, were reluctant to issue warnings. In addition, Cappuccio\n\nand Pezzano testified that they could not recall any employee who\n\nhad been \"written up,\" suspended, or otherwise disciplined for\n\nviolating the work rule to stay clear of a load.                 MCC thus failed\n\nto satisfy the third and fourth prongs of their proposed defense.\n\n              Based on this evidence, the ALJ found that MCC had not\n\nmet   its     burden   in   proving    unpreventable   employee      misconduct.\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fAgain, we decline to upset a ruling so firmly rooted in the\n\nadministrative record.\n\n           As   a   backup    argument,       MCC     claims    that,       even   if    it\nviolated the    standard,      the    ALJ     erred    in   concluding        that      the\n\nviolation was a \"repeat\" violation for purposes of the additional\n\npenalty provisions of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. § 666(a).                                   \"A\nviolation is 'repeated' if the employer 'violated the same standard\n\non an earlier occasion in a substantially similar fashion.'\"\n\nModern Cont'l/Obayashi, 196 F. 3d at 283 (citing P. Gioioso & Sons,\n\n115 F.3d at 103 n.2.).          The Secretary establishes substantial\n\nsimilarity \"by showing that the prior and present violations are\n\nfor failure to comply with the same standard, at which point the\n\nburden shifts to the employer to rebut that showing.\"                          Sec'y of\n\nLabor v. Monitor Constr. Co., 16 OSHC (BNA) 1589, 1594 (OSHRC\n\n1994).\n\n           MCC raises two arguments to the imposition of this\nassessment.     First, MCC argues that there is no prior violation\n\nbecause   the   earlier      citation    resulted        only    in     a    settlement\nagreement that contained exculpatory language.                  Second, MCC argues\n\nthat, even assuming the informal agreement was evidence of a prior\n\nviolation, the facts and circumstances of the prior violation were\n\nsubstantially different from the current violation.                          Though we\n\naddress each argument, we find that neither has merit.\n\n           In   February      2000,     MCC    was     cited    for     violation        of\n\n§ 1926.550(a)(19).        The citation was resolved by means of an\n\ninformal settlement agreement.              MCC argues that this settlement\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fcannot form the antecedent for a consequent finding of a \"repeat\"\n\nviolation under 29 U.S.C. § 666(a).                  As MCC notes, courts have\n\ngenerally held that repeated violations require a previous final\norder against the employer for a substantially similar violation of\n\nthe same standard.           See, e.g., Reich v. D.M. Sabia Co., 90 F.3d\n\n854, 860 (3d Cir. 1996).\n            However, settlement agreements, even those with some\n\nexculpatory language, have often been found to qualify as a final\n\norder against an employer.           See Sec'y of Labor v. Ford Dev. Corp.,\n\n15   OSHC   (BNA)     2003    (OSHRC      1992)    (holding     that    a   settlement\n\nagreement has the force and effect of an adjudication and can serve\n\nas the basis for finding a later violation \"repeated\" within the\n\nmeaning of the OSH Act); Sec'y of Labor v. DIC-Underhill, 9 OSHC\n(BNA)   2223    (OSHRC       1980)   (same);       Sec'y   of   Labor       v.   Dun-Par\n\nEngineered     Form   Co.,     8   OSHC    (BNA)    1044   (OSHRC      1980)     (same).\n\nMoreover, the language contained in the settlement agreement at\nissue here does not exempt MCC from the possibility of a repeat\n\nviolation.     Indeed, the agreement provides that the                  \"agreements,\nstatement, stipulations, findings and actions taken herein . . .\n\nshall not be used for any purpose, except for proceedings and\n\nmatters arising under the OSHA Act [sic] (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.)\"\n\n(emphasis added).             We therefore find no error in the ALJ's\n\nconclusion that this settlement agreement could be used to prove a\n\nrepeat violation.\n\n            MCC also argues that the facts and circumstances of the\n\nprior violation were substantially different from the present one.\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fMCC bore the burden of making this showing, and the ALJ concluded\n\nthat it failed to do so.            MCC's previous violation of 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1926.550(a)(19)occurred when it allowed employees to work in a\nconfined underground space below a suspended man-basket.                       The\n\ncurrent    violation    concerns      employees     working    in   a    confined\n\nunderground space below suspended shoring materials. The ALJ found\nthat in both instances, the employees were exposed to the same\n\nhazard: working below suspended materials in an enclosed area.\n\nBased on the record and evidence before us, we conclude that the\n\nALJ had substantial evidence to support such a finding.                         We\n\ntherefore affirm the classification of this violation as repeated.\n\n            C.   Penalty assessment\n\n            Finally, MCC challenges the ALJ's penalty assessment,\narguing that it was entitled to a reduction based on its safety\n\nrecord and good faith attempts to enforce a safety program.                    The\nOSH Act gives the Commission \"the authority to assess all civil\npenalties.\" 29 U.S.C. §666(j). In the exercise of this authority,\n\nthe   Commission       must    \"giv[e]        due   consideration        to    the\nappropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of the\nbusiness   of    the   employer      being    charged,   the   gravity    of   the\n\nviolation, the good faith of the employer, and the history of\nprevious violations.\"         Id.     We review the Commission's penalty\nassessment only for a manifest abuse of discretion. See Union Tank\n\nCar Co. v. OSHRC, 192 F.3d 701, 707 (7th Cir. 1999); Bush &\n\nBurchett, Inc. v. Reich, 117 F.3d 932, 939 (6th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f            The ALJ was authorized to assess a penalty up to $70,000\n\nfor   the   repeat   violation   and   up   to   $7,000   for   the   training\n\nviolation.    See 29 U.S.C. § 666(a) & (b).         The penalties imposed,\ntotaling $42,000, were well within the bounds of the Act.              It was\n\nalso within the ALJ's discretion to refuse to give reductions for\n\ngood faith or prior history based on what he found the evidence in\nthis case established.     The four factors set out in 29 U.S.C. § 666\n\n(j) need not be given equal weight.          The gravity of a particular\n\nviolation may warrant the assessment of a weighty penalty, \"even\n\nthough the employer may rate perfect marks on the other three\n\ncriteria.\"    Bush & Burchett, 117 F.3d at 940 (citing Sec'y of Labor\n\nv. Nacirema Operating Co., 1 OSHC (BNA) 1001, 1003 (OSHRC 1972)).\n\nWe therefore see no need to disturb the ALJ's decision with respect\nto the appropriate penalty.\n\n                                   III.\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm the order of the\n\nCommission and deny MCC's petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f",

Petitioner Modern Continental Construction, Inc. (\"MCC\") seeks review of a final decision by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the \"Commission\"), which affirmed the citations issued against MCC under the OSH Act by the Secretary of Labor. Finding that the citations are supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, we deny MCC's petition for review and affirm the Commission's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC is a general contractor at a work site associated with the \"Big Dig,\" a massive construction project that will submerge a section of interstate highway below the streets of Boston. The events in question took place in an underground room &#8212; approximately forty feet long, twenty to thirty feet wide, and twenty feet deep &#8212; built to provide ventilation to highway tunnels. On Saturday, July 22, 2000, MCC employees, under the direction of general foreman Pasquale Pezzano (\"Pezzano\"), engaged in the dangerous, but not uncommon, task of hoisting shoring materials from this underground room. The hoisting required employees in the underground room to manually secure, or \"rig,\" loads of shoring materials to a crane for withdrawal through a small rectangular opening at the surface.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, loads are rigged in a horizontal fashion. This manner promotes balance and increases safety. However, on this particular day, at least one load could not be rigged horizontally because its width exceeded that of the opening at the surface. Instead, this load was rigged vertically, a dangerous and awkward method.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the difficulty inherent in hoisting an unstable vertical load, the access hole itself presented a problem. According to Pezzano and Anthony Cappuccio (\"Cappuccio\"), another MCC foreman working that day, the surface hole was the smallest from which they had ever removed shoring. Despite the fact that hoisting a load vertically through a small opening requires a great degree of skill and presents an increased element of danger, MCC provided no formal training to its employees on securing a load for vertical hoisting. Nor was training provided for alternative rigging methods, such as rigging the load diagonally or removing each piece of shoring by hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vertical load in question was initially rigged by MCC employee Natalio El&#237;as (\"El&#237;as\"), an inexperienced worker with limited English proficiency. On his first attempt, El&#237;as used only a single strap to secure a load of about twenty cross-braces. Though it was inadequately secured, Foreman Cappuccio was given the signal to raise the one-hundred-pound bundle. From the surface, Cappuccio noticed that the strap was slipping as the load was being raised, so he signaled for it to be lowered. Cappuccio explained to El&#237;as that he either needed to double-wrap the cross-braces or use an additional strap. No other instructions concerning the securing of the load were given. When El&#237;as did not appear to understand Cappuccio's explanation, another employee, fluent in El&#237;as' native Portugese, was summoned to translate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After these efforts failed, Louis Sousa, another MCC foreman, eventually rigged the vertical bundle himself and signaled for Cappuccio to begin lifting. As the heavy load was being raised, its weight shifted, and the entire load slipped and fell back down through the access hole. One of the cross-braces struck El&#237;as, impaling him through the head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 2000, two days after the accident, Compliance Officer Eric Jones, of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"), began a post-accident investigation. Following the inspection, OSHA issued MCC the following citations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Modern Cont'l Constr. Co.,</i> 19 OSHC (BNA) 1760 (O.S.H.R.C. A.L.J. Div.2001). MCC then challenged the ALJ's decision by filing a Petition for Discretionary Review with the Commission. When no Commission Member directed the matter for review, the ALJ's decision automatically became a final order of the Commission by operation of law. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 661(j). MCC then filed a timely petition with this Court to review the Commission's final order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the Commission's order is deferential. Final orders of the Commission are subject to the general judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-706. <i>See P. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC,</i> 115 F.3d 100, 107-08 (1st Cir.1997). Under those provisions, we will uphold agency determinations unless they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A). In making this determination, we defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation of the OSH Act and the governing regulations. <i>See Beaver Plant Operations, Inc. v. Herman,</i> 223 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2000). The OSH Act also directs that \"[t]he findings of the Commission with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a); <i>see also P. Gioioso &amp; Sons,</i> 115 F.3d at 108. This deferential standard governs even where, as here, the Commission does not hear the case itself but instead adopts an ALJ's findings. <i>Modern Cont'l/Obayashi v.

MCC also challenges the propriety of the penalty assessed against it. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Citation 1 &#8212; Failure to Train</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the OSH Act to reduce employment-related injury and illness. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 651. To that end, the Act places primary responsibility on employers &#8212; that is, those who oversee and control the work environment &#8212; to achieve compliance with its standards and ensure a safe workplace. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 91-1282, at 9 (1970), <i>reprinted in</i> 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5177, 5186 (\"Employers have primary control of the work environment and should insure that it is safe and healthful.\"). Thus, under the Act, an employer must \"comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 654(a)(2), and, if no applicable standards exist, \"furnish to each of his employees ... a place of employment which [is] free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 654(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For further guidance, Congress provided OSHA with authority to promulgate occupational safety and health standards by regulation. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 655. Pursuant to this authority, the agency has issued two types of standards. The first, known as the \"general industry standards,\" <i>see</i> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1910, act as a default set of standards. In addition, OSHA has presented various sets of standards applicable only to certain industries. The agency has promulgated a set of such industry-specific standards for the implementation of the OSH Act in the construction industry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1926. These regulations are applicable to any place of employment where construction work is performed. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1910.12(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The construction-industry standard applicable to MCC's first citation provides: \"The employer shall instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.21(b)(2). The citation against MCC specifically charged that \"employees were not adequately trained in rigging methods.\" \"In order to establish a violation of an [OSH Act] standard, the Secretary must show: (a) the applicability of the cited standard; (b) the employer's non-compliance with the standard; (c) employee access to the violative condition; and (d) the employer's actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.\" <i>Modern Cont'l/Obayashi,</i> 196 F.3d at 279. MCC challenges the Commission's order with respect to the failure-to-train citation on both legal and factual grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC argues first that, as a matter of law, the citation is defective because there is no \"rigging\" standard established by OSHA and that improper rigging is not one of the \"hazards\" contemplated by &#167; 1926.21(b)(2). According to MCC, the true hazard in this case is the danger of a falling load, a hazard that is already covered by a separate regulation and that cannot be completely eliminated by training in alternate rigging methods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC interprets the protections of the Act far too narrowly. The training regulation in question provides in general terms that employers must instruct each employee in the \"recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.21(b)(2). The purview of the regulation is not limited to training for hazards expressly identified by OSHA regulation. The Commission has stated that \"[u]nder &#167; 1926.21(b)(2), an employer must instruct its employees in the recognition and avoidance of those hazards of which a reasonably prudent employer would have been aware.\" <i>Capform, Inc.,</i> 19 OSHC (BNA) 1374, 1376 (O.S.H.R.C.2001), <i>aff'd,</i> 34 Fed. Appx. 152 (5th Cir.2002). Similarly, the regulation does not require only such training as will completely eliminate hazards; it also requires training in the \"avoidance\" and \"control\" of dangerous conditions. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.21(b)(2). Therefore, as a legal matter, it is of no moment that OSHA has not prescribed a specific \"rigging\" standard. Rather, the question is whether a reasonably prudent employer would have been aware of the hazard arising from the failure to train in proper rigging methods. Notably, MCC does not claim that a reasonable employer would not have been aware of the dangers inherent in failing to train employees in the safe rigging of loads. Nor does MCC claim that such training departs from standards in the industry. Thus, we conclude that the failure-to-train citation stands on a solid legal foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC also challenges the factual basis for the ALJ's decision, arguing that the record clearly demonstrates that MCC gave adequate training in proper rigging methods. According to MCC, training in safe rigging was taught on an on-the-job basis by other laborers and journeymen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that MCC did not satisfy the training requirements under &#167; 1926.21(b)(2), the ALJ weighed the evidence presented by MCC against the evidence presented by the Secretary. Interestingly, both sides arrived at the same conclusion: MCC employees received little or no training on how to rig loads that could not be rigged horizontally. For instance, the testimony of three high-ranking MCC employees, Foremen Cappuccio and Pezzano and Wayne Rice (\"Rice\"), MCC's vice-president of corporate safety, admitted that hoisting a load vertically was not recommended because it was less stable and more difficult than lifting a load horizontally. Yet, none of these witnesses could identify any form of employee training in alternate methods. In addition, the ALJ heard testimony from a former MCC employee, Scott Collins, who did not recall ever receiving any training in rigging for small access holes, loose bundles, or vertical loads.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing demonstrates that the ALJ's decision was amply supported by substantial evidence in the record. And since MCC has not provided any compelling evidence to the contrary, we affirm the ALJ's conclusion as to the failure-to-train citation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Citation 2&#8212;Repeat Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC was also charged with a repeat violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.550(a)(19), which provides that \"[a]ll employees shall be kept clear of loads about to be lifted and of suspended loads.\" <i>Id.</i> Although it is apparent that the standard was violated &#8212; the accident itself shows that El&#237;as was not clear of the suspended load &#8212; MCC argues it should not be held accountable because the violation resulted from idiosyncratic employee conduct that it could not, and was not required by law to, control. MCC argues further that the ALJ erred in concluding that MCC's failure to abide by &#167; 1926.550(a)(19) constitutes a \"repeat\" violation, which is subject to additional penalties under the OSH Act. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address MCC's argument that it established a complete defense to the violation. As this Court has explained before:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OSH Act requires that an employer do everything reasonably within its power to ensure that its personnel do not violate safety standards. But if an employer lives up to that billing and an employee nonetheless fails to use proper equipment or otherwise ignores firmly established safety measures, it seems unfair to hold the employer liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons,</i> 115 F.3d at 109. We have therefore recognized an affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct. In order to reach the safe harbor of this defense, an employer must demonstrate: (1) that it established a work rule to prevent the reckless behavior or unsafe condition from occurring; (2) that it adequately communicated the rule to its employees; (3) that it took steps to discover incidents of noncompliance; and (4) that it effectively enforced the rule whenever employees transgressed it. <i>Id.</i> at 109. Our review of the ALJ's analysis of these factors comports with the usual deferential standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first element of the defense, MCC contends that it had an established work rule, often repeated to employees, to \"stay clear of the load\" and \"stay away from the hole.\" The ALJ concluded that these general admonitions were insufficient as a work rule to prevent violations of the standard. The ALJ pointed out that this general rule gave no indication of <i>when</i> employees were required to stay clear of the hole, a necessary consideration, given the fact that the employees in the enclosed area were expected to continue working near the hole at times when no load was being hoisted. The ALJ also credited evidence from the Secretary indicating that the employees working below the loads had an obstructed view of the access hole and thus had no knowledge of when a load was being hoisted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Given the total lack of specificity in MCC's rule and the obvious insufficiency of its command, we have no problem affirming the ALJ's conclusion that the admonition to \"stay away from the hole\" was not an adequate work rule. <i>See PBR, Inc. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 643 F.2d 890, 895 (1st Cir.1981) (\"[The employer] cannot escape responsibility for the violation because it warned its employees to exercise caution. Such delegation of employee safety to the employees themselves is clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the Act.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ also found that MCC failed to establish the second prong of the affirmative defense&#8212;namely, that the work rule was adequately communicated to employees. In particular, the ALJ found that the training provided was not tailored to the needs of those employees with little experience or with limited understanding of English, such as El&#237;as, the employee injured in the accident. The ALJ observed that MCC's training materials were provided only in English, despite a large number of employees with limited English proficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the ALJ found that MCC did not establish that it took steps to discover violations of the rule or that it took any disciplinary action when such violations were discovered. Testimony from Rice, Cappuccio, and Pezzano supported this finding. Rice admitted that MCC did not note violations in personnel files and that the company's foremen, who have direct supervision over laborers, were reluctant to issue warnings. In addition, Cappuccio and Pezzano testified that they could not recall any employee who had been \"written up,\" suspended, or otherwise disciplined for violating the work rule to stay clear of a load. MCC thus failed to satisfy the third and fourth prongs of their proposed defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, the ALJ found that MCC had not met its burden in proving unpreventable employee misconduct. Again, we decline to upset a ruling so firmly rooted in the administrative record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a backup argument, MCC claims that, even if it violated the standard, the ALJ erred in concluding that the violation was a \"repeat\" violation for purposes of the additional penalty provisions of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a). \"A violation is `repeated' if the employer `violated the same standard on an earlier occasion in a substantially similar fashion.'\" <i>Modern Cont'l/Obayashi,</i> 196 F.3d at 283 (citing <i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons,</i> 115 F.3d at 103 n. 2.). The Secretary establishes substantial similarity \"by showing that the prior and present violations are for failure to comply with the same standard, at which point the burden shifts to the employer to rebut that showing.\" <i>Sec'y of Labor v. Monitor Constr. Co.,</i> 16 OSHC (BNA) 1589, 1594 (OSHRC 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC raises two arguments to the imposition of this assessment. First, MCC argues that there is no prior violation because the earlier citation resulted only in a settlement agreement that contained exculpatory language. Second, MCC argues that, even assuming the informal agreement was evidence of a prior violation, the facts and circumstances of the prior violation were substantially different from the current violation. Though we address each argument, we find that neither has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2000, MCC was cited for violation of &#167; 1926.550(a)(19). The citation was resolved by means of an informal settlement agreement. MCC argues that this settlement cannot form the antecedent for a consequent finding of a \"repeat\" violation under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a). As MCC notes, courts have generally held that repeated violations require a previous final order against the employer for a substantially similar violation of the same standard. <i>See, e.g., Reich v. D.M. Sabia Co.,</i> 90 F.3d 854, 860 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, settlement agreements, even those with some exculpatory language, have often been found to qualify as a final order against an employer. <i>See Sec'y of Labor v. Ford Dev. Corp.,</i> 15 OSHC (BNA) 2003 (OSHRC 1992) (holding that a settlement agreement has the force and effect of an adjudication and can serve as the basis for finding a later violation \"repeated\" within the meaning of the OSH Act); <i>Sec'y of Labor v. DIC-Underhill,</i> 9 OSHC (BNA) 2223 (OSHRC 1980) (same); <i>Sec'y of Labor v. Dun-Par Engineered</i> <i>Form Co.,</i> 8 OSHC (BNA) 1044 (OSHRC 1980) (same). Moreover, the language contained in the settlement agreement at issue here does not exempt MCC from the possibility of a repeat violation. Indeed, the agreement provides that the \"agreements, statement, stipulations, findings and actions taken herein ... shall not be used for any purpose, <i>except for proceedings and matters arising under the OSHA Act</i> [sic] (29 U.S.C. &#167; 651 et seq.)\" (emphasis added). We therefore find no error in the ALJ's conclusion that this settlement agreement could be used to prove a repeat violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC also argues that the facts and circumstances of the prior violation were substantially different from the present one. MCC bore the burden of making this showing, and the ALJ concluded that it failed to do so. MCC's previous violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.550(a)(19)occurred when it allowed employees to work in a confined underground space below a suspended man-basket. The current violation concerns employees working in a confined underground space below suspended shoring materials. The ALJ found that in both instances, the employees were exposed to the same hazard: working below suspended materials in an enclosed area. Based on the record and evidence before us, we conclude that the ALJ had substantial evidence to support such a finding. We therefore affirm the classification of this violation as repeated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Penalty assessment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, MCC challenges the ALJ's penalty assessment, arguing that it was entitled to a reduction based on its safety record and good faith attempts to enforce a safety program. The OSH Act gives the Commission \"the authority to assess all civil penalties.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(j). In the exercise of this authority, the Commission must \"giv[e] due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of the business of the employer being charged, the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer, and the history of previous violations.\" <i>Id.</i> We review the Commission's penalty assessment only for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See Union Tank Car Co. v. OSHA,</i> 192 F.3d 701, 707 (7th Cir.1999); <i>Bush &amp; Burchett, Inc. v. Reich,</i> 117 F.3d 932, 939 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ was authorized to assess a penalty up to $70,000 for the repeat violation and up to $7,000 for the training violation. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a) &amp; (b). The penalties imposed, totaling $42,000, were well within the bounds of the Act. It was also within the ALJ's discretion to refuse to give reductions for good faith or prior history based on what he found the evidence in this case established. The four factors set out in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(j) need not be given equal weight. The gravity of a particular violation may warrant the assessment of a weighty penalty, \"even though the employer may rate perfect marks on the other three criteria.\" <i>Bush &amp; Burchett,</i> 117 F.3d at 940 (citing <i>Sec'y of Labor v. Nacirema Operating Co.,</i> 1 OSHC (BNA) 1001, 1003 (OSHRC 1972)). We therefore see no need to disturb the ALJ's decision with respect to the appropriate penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the order of the Commission and deny MCC's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Serious Citation 1, Item 2 was withdrawn by the Secretary at the hearing.

Petitioner Modern Continental Construction, Inc. (\"MCC\") seeks review of a final decision by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the \"Commission\"), which affirmed the citations issued against MCC under the OSH Act by the Secretary of Labor. Finding that the citations are supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, we deny MCC's petition for review and affirm the Commission's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC is a general contractor at a work site associated with the \"Big Dig,\" a massive construction project that will submerge a section of interstate highway below the streets of Boston. The events in question took place in an underground room &#8212; approximately forty feet long, twenty to thirty feet wide, and twenty feet deep &#8212; built to provide ventilation to highway tunnels. On Saturday, July 22, 2000, MCC employees, under the direction of general foreman Pasquale Pezzano (\"Pezzano\"), engaged in the dangerous, but not uncommon, task of hoisting shoring materials from this underground room. The hoisting required employees in the underground room to manually secure, or \"rig,\" loads of shoring materials to a crane for withdrawal through a small rectangular opening at the surface.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, loads are rigged in a horizontal fashion. This manner promotes balance and increases safety. However, on this particular day, at least one load could not be rigged horizontally because its width exceeded that of the opening at the surface. Instead, this load was rigged vertically, a dangerous and awkward method.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the difficulty inherent in hoisting an unstable vertical load, the access hole itself presented a problem. According to Pezzano and Anthony Cappuccio (\"Cappuccio\"), another MCC foreman working that day, the surface hole was the smallest from which they had ever removed shoring. Despite the fact that hoisting a load vertically through a small opening requires a great degree of skill and presents an increased element of danger, MCC provided no formal training to its employees on securing a load for vertical hoisting. Nor was training provided for alternative rigging methods, such as rigging the load diagonally or removing each piece of shoring by hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vertical load in question was initially rigged by MCC employee Natalio El&#237;as (\"El&#237;as\"), an inexperienced worker with limited English proficiency. On his first attempt, El&#237;as used only a single strap to secure a load of about twenty cross-braces. Though it was inadequately secured, Foreman Cappuccio was given the signal to raise the one-hundred-pound bundle. From the surface, Cappuccio noticed that the strap was slipping as the load was being raised, so he signaled for it to be lowered. Cappuccio explained to El&#237;as that he either needed to double-wrap the cross-braces or use an additional strap. No other instructions concerning the securing of the load were given. When El&#237;as did not appear to understand Cappuccio's explanation, another employee, fluent in El&#237;as' native Portugese, was summoned to translate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After these efforts failed, Louis Sousa, another MCC foreman, eventually rigged the vertical bundle himself and signaled for Cappuccio to begin lifting. As the heavy load was being raised, its weight shifted, and the entire load slipped and fell back down through the access hole. One of the cross-braces struck El&#237;as, impaling him through the head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 2000, two days after the accident, Compliance Officer Eric Jones, of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"), began a post-accident investigation. Following the inspection, OSHA issued MCC the following citations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

When no Commission Member directed the matter for review, the ALJ's decision automatically became a final order of the Commission by operation of law. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 661(j).

To that end, the Act places primary responsibility on employers &#8212; that is, those who oversee and control the work environment &#8212; to achieve compliance with its standards and ensure a safe workplace. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 91-1282, at 9 (1970), <i>reprinted in</i> 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5177, 5186 (\"Employers have primary control of the work environment and should insure that it is safe and healthful.\"). Thus, under the Act, an employer must \"comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 654(a)(2), and, if no applicable standards exist, \"furnish to each of his employees ... a place of employment which [is] free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 654(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For further guidance, Congress provided OSHA with authority to promulgate occupational safety and health standards by regulation. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 655.

According to MCC, the true hazard in this case is the danger of a falling load, a hazard that is already covered by a separate regulation and that cannot be completely eliminated by training in alternate rigging methods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC interprets the protections of the Act far too narrowly. The training regulation in question provides in general terms that employers must instruct each employee in the \"recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.21(b)(2). The purview of the regulation is not limited to training for hazards expressly identified by OSHA regulation. The Commission has stated that \"[u]nder &#167; 1926.21(b)(2), an employer must instruct its employees in the recognition and avoidance of those hazards of which a reasonably prudent employer would have been aware.\" <i>Capform, Inc.,</i> 19 OSHC (BNA) 1374, 1376 (O.S.H.R.C.2001), <i>aff'd,</i> 34 Fed. Appx. 152 (5th Cir.2002). Similarly, the regulation does not require only such training as will completely eliminate hazards; it also requires training in the \"avoidance\" and \"control\" of dangerous conditions. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.21(b)(2). Therefore, as a legal matter, it is of no moment that OSHA has not prescribed a specific \"rigging\" standard. Rather, the question is whether a reasonably prudent employer would have been aware of the hazard arising from the failure to train in proper rigging methods. Notably, MCC does not claim that a reasonable employer would not have been aware of the dangers inherent in failing to train employees in the safe rigging of loads. Nor does MCC claim that such training departs from standards in the industry. Thus, we conclude that the failure-to-train citation stands on a solid legal foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC also challenges the factual basis for the ALJ's decision, arguing that the record clearly demonstrates that MCC gave adequate training in proper rigging methods. According to MCC, training in safe rigging was taught on an on-the-job basis by other laborers and journeymen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that MCC did not satisfy the training requirements under &#167; 1926.21(b)(2), the ALJ weighed the evidence presented by MCC against the evidence presented by the Secretary. Interestingly, both sides arrived at the same conclusion: MCC employees received little or no training on how to rig loads that could not be rigged horizontally. For instance, the testimony of three high-ranking MCC employees, Foremen Cappuccio and Pezzano and Wayne Rice (\"Rice\"), MCC's vice-president of corporate safety, admitted that hoisting a load vertically was not recommended because it was less stable and more difficult than lifting a load horizontally. Yet, none of these witnesses could identify any form of employee training in alternate methods. In addition, the ALJ heard testimony from a former MCC employee, Scott Collins, who did not recall ever receiving any training in rigging for small access holes, loose bundles, or vertical loads.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing demonstrates that the ALJ's decision was amply supported by substantial evidence in the record. And since MCC has not provided any compelling evidence to the contrary, we affirm the ALJ's conclusion as to the failure-to-train citation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Citation 2&#8212;Repeat Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC was also charged with a repeat violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.550(a)(19), which provides that \"[a]ll employees shall be kept clear of loads about to be lifted and of suspended loads.\" <i>Id.</i> Although it is apparent that the standard was violated &#8212; the accident itself shows that El&#237;as was not clear of the suspended load &#8212; MCC argues it should not be held accountable because the violation resulted from idiosyncratic employee conduct that it could not, and was not required by law to, control. MCC argues further that the ALJ erred in concluding that MCC's failure to abide by &#167; 1926.550(a)(19) constitutes a \"repeat\" violation, which is subject to additional penalties under the OSH Act. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address MCC's argument that it established a complete defense to the violation. As this Court has explained before:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OSH Act requires that an employer do everything reasonably within its power to ensure that its personnel do not violate safety standards. But if an employer lives up to that billing and an employee nonetheless fails to use proper equipment or otherwise ignores firmly established safety measures, it seems unfair to hold the employer liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons,</i> 115 F.3d at 109. We have therefore recognized an affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct. In order to reach the safe harbor of this defense, an employer must demonstrate: (1) that it established a work rule to prevent the reckless behavior or unsafe condition from occurring; (2) that it adequately communicated the rule to its employees; (3) that it took steps to discover incidents of noncompliance; and (4) that it effectively enforced the rule whenever employees transgressed it. <i>Id.</i> at 109. Our review of the ALJ's analysis of these factors comports with the usual deferential standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first element of the defense, MCC contends that it had an established work rule, often repeated to employees, to \"stay clear of the load\" and \"stay away from the hole.\" The ALJ concluded that these general admonitions were insufficient as a work rule to prevent violations of the standard. The ALJ pointed out that this general rule gave no indication of <i>when</i> employees were required to stay clear of the hole, a necessary consideration, given the fact that the employees in the enclosed area were expected to continue working near the hole at times when no load was being hoisted. The ALJ also credited evidence from the Secretary indicating that the employees working below the loads had an obstructed view of the access hole and thus had no knowledge of when a load was being hoisted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Given the total lack of specificity in MCC's rule and the obvious insufficiency of its command, we have no problem affirming the ALJ's conclusion that the admonition to \"stay away from the hole\" was not an adequate work rule. <i>See PBR, Inc. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388177\"><a href=\"/opinion/388177/9-osh-casbna-1357-1981-oshd-cch-p-25237-pbr-inc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 895 (1st Cir.1981) (\"[The employer] cannot escape responsibility for the violation because it warned its employees to exercise caution. Such delegation of employee safety to the employees themselves is clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the Act.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ also found that MCC failed to establish the second prong of the affirmative defense&#8212;namely, that the work rule was adequately communicated to employees. In particular, the ALJ found that the training provided was not tailored to the needs of those employees with little experience or with limited understanding of English, such as El&#237;as, the employee injured in the accident. The ALJ observed that MCC's training materials were provided only in English, despite a large number of employees with limited English proficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the ALJ found that MCC did not establish that it took steps to discover violations of the rule or that it took any disciplinary action when such violations were discovered. Testimony from Rice, Cappuccio, and Pezzano supported this finding. Rice admitted that MCC did not note violations in personnel files and that the company's foremen, who have direct supervision over laborers, were reluctant to issue warnings. In addition, Cappuccio and Pezzano testified that they could not recall any employee who had been \"written up,\" suspended, or otherwise disciplined for violating the work rule to stay clear of a load. MCC thus failed to satisfy the third and fourth prongs of their proposed defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, the ALJ found that MCC had not met its burden in proving unpreventable employee misconduct. Again, we decline to upset a ruling so firmly rooted in the administrative record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a backup argument, MCC claims that, even if it violated the standard, the ALJ erred in concluding that the violation was a \"repeat\" violation for purposes of the additional penalty provisions of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a). \"A violation is `repeated' if the employer `violated the same standard on an earlier occasion in a substantially similar fashion.'\" <i>Modern Cont'l/Obayashi,</i> 196 F.3d at 283 (citing <i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons,</i> 115 F.3d at 103 n. 2.). The Secretary establishes substantial similarity \"by showing that the prior and present violations are for failure to comply with the same standard, at which point the burden shifts to the employer to rebut that showing.\" <i>Sec'y of Labor v. Monitor Constr. Co.,</i> 16 OSHC (BNA) 1589, 1594 (OSHRC 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC raises two arguments to the imposition of this assessment. First, MCC argues that there is no prior violation because the earlier citation resulted only in a settlement agreement that contained exculpatory language. Second, MCC argues that, even assuming the informal agreement was evidence of a prior violation, the facts and circumstances of the prior violation were substantially different from the current violation. Though we address each argument, we find that neither has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2000, MCC was cited for violation of &#167; 1926.550(a)(19). The citation was resolved by means of an informal settlement agreement. MCC argues that this settlement cannot form the antecedent for a consequent finding of a \"repeat\" violation under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a). As MCC notes, courts have generally held that repeated violations require a previous final order against the employer for a substantially similar violation of the same standard. <i>See, e.g., Reich v. D.M. Sabia Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722551\"><a href=\"/opinion/722551/robert-b-reich-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span>, 860 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, settlement agreements, even those with some exculpatory language, have often been found to qualify as a final order against an employer. <i>See Sec'y of Labor v. Ford Dev. Corp.,</i> 15 OSHC (BNA) 2003 (OSHRC 1992) (holding that a settlement agreement has the force and effect of an adjudication and can serve as the basis for finding a later violation \"repeated\" within the meaning of the OSH Act); <i>Sec'y of Labor v. DIC-Underhill,</i> 9 OSHC (BNA) 2223 (OSHRC 1980) (same); <i>Sec'y of Labor v. Dun-Par Engineered</i> <i>Form Co.,</i> 8 OSHC (BNA) 1044 (OSHRC 1980) (same). Moreover, the language contained in the settlement agreement at issue here does not exempt MCC from the possibility of a repeat violation. Indeed, the agreement provides that the \"agreements, statement, stipulations, findings and actions taken herein ... shall not be used for any purpose, <i>except for proceedings and matters arising under the OSHA Act</i> [sic] (29 U.S.C. &#167; 651 et seq.)\" (emphasis added). We therefore find no error in the ALJ's conclusion that this settlement agreement could be used to prove a repeat violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCC also argues that the facts and circumstances of the prior violation were substantially different from the present one. MCC bore the burden of making this showing, and the ALJ concluded that it failed to do so. MCC's previous violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.550(a)(19)occurred when it allowed employees to work in a confined underground space below a suspended man-basket. The current violation concerns employees working in a confined underground space below suspended shoring materials. The ALJ found that in both instances, the employees were exposed to the same hazard: working below suspended materials in an enclosed area. Based on the record and evidence before us, we conclude that the ALJ had substantial evidence to support such a finding. We therefore affirm the classification of this violation as repeated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Penalty assessment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, MCC challenges the ALJ's penalty assessment, arguing that it was entitled to a reduction based on its safety record and good faith attempts to enforce a safety program. The OSH Act gives the Commission \"the authority to assess all civil penalties.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(j). In the exercise of this authority, the Commission must \"giv[e] due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of the business of the employer being charged, the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer, and the history of previous violations.\" <i>Id.</i> We review the Commission's penalty assessment only for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See Union Tank Car Co. v. OSHA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766270\"><a href=\"/opinion/766270/union-tank-car-company-inc-v-occupational-safety-and-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>, 707 (7th Cir.1999); <i>Bush &amp; Burchett, Inc. v.

The penalties imposed, totaling $42,000, were well within the bounds of the Act. It was also within the ALJ's discretion to refuse to give reductions for good faith or prior history based on what he found the evidence in this case established. The four factors set out in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(j) need not be given equal weight. The gravity of a particular violation may warrant the assessment of a weighty penalty, \"even though the employer may rate perfect marks on the other three criteria.\" <i>Bush &amp; Burchett,</i> 117 F.3d at 940 (citing <i>Sec'y of Labor v. Nacirema Operating Co.,</i> 1 OSHC (BNA) 1001, 1003 (OSHRC 1972)). We therefore see no need to disturb the ALJ's decision with respect to the appropriate penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the order of the Commission and deny MCC's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Serious Citation 1, Item 2 was withdrawn by the Secretary at the hearing.
