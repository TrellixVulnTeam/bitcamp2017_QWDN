Cortés, López López & Associates, for appellees\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Authority, Rodríguez-Ruiz, and\nHernández-Ramos in their official capacities.\n\n\n                          December 18, 2009\n\f            PER CURIAM.       Appellant Maritza Ramos-Mercado commenced\n\nthis   action   pursuant   to    42   U.S.C.      § 1983     against      her   former\n\nemployer,   appellee    Puerto     Rico       Electric   Power     Authority,      and\n\nothers.   She alleged in her complaint that the appellees deprived\n\nher of property without due process of law when they refused to\n\nreinstate her as a career attorney following a ten-year leave of\n\nabsence. The district court dismissed her complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim.\n\n            We affirm, concluding that Ramos-Mercado was provided\n\nwith all the process that was due under the facts of this case.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            Ramos-Mercado's      claims        arise   out   of    her    employment\n\nrelationship     with   the     Puerto    Rico     Electric       Power    Authority\n\n(\"PREPA\"), a public corporation of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nPREPA originally hired Ramos-Mercado as a career attorney in 1980.\n\nRamos-Mercado worked in that capacity until 1997, when she was\n\nappointed to a twelve-year term as a Superior Court Judge for the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.             At the time of the appointment,\n\nRamos-Mercado agreed to be voluntarily separated from her PREPA\n\nposition. She alleges that the terms of the separation granted her\n\nthe right to return to PREPA at the end of her judicial service, at\n\na pay grade commensurate to that of her former position.\n\n            On February 27, 2007, two years before Ramos-Mercado's\n\njudicial term expired, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court permanently\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fand immediately removed her from office.           The following week,\n\nRamos-Mercado met in person with appellee Jorge Rodríguez-Ruiz,\n\nPREPA's Executive Director at the time, to ask to be reinstated as\n\na PREPA attorney.        Rodríguez-Ruiz assured Ramos-Mercado that he\n\nwould    forward   her   reinstatement   request   to   appellee   Aníbal\n\nHernández-Ramos, PREPA's Director of Human Resources.\n\n            By letter dated April 11, 2007, Rodríguez-Ruiz advised\n\nRamos-Mercado that she was ineligible for immediate reinstatement.\n\nHe cited Public Law No. 184 of August 3, 2004, § 6.8, and PREPA's\n\npersonnel regulations, which limit the right of certain individuals\n\nwho have been removed from public office to be employed as civil\n\nservants.    Rodríguez-Ruiz pointed out that Ramos-Mercado had been\n\nremoved from her position in the judiciary and concluded that she\n\nwould therefore be ineligible for employment with PREPA until she\n\nhad undergone \"habilitation\" with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nOffice of Human Resources.1\n\n            In a response dated April 20, 2007, Ramos-Mercado argued\n\nthat the law cited by Rodríguez-Ruiz was inapplicable to public\n\ncorporations such as PREPA.     She stated her view that there was \"no\n\nlegal impediment\" to her reinstatement.       She did not ask for any\n\n\n\n     1\n          The Director of the Office of Human Resources is\nauthorized, in his or her discretion, to readmit certain\nindividuals to the public service who would otherwise be\nineligible. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1462g(2). The process\nfor requesting and receiving the Director's permission is known as\n\"habilitation\" or \"rehabilitation.\"\n\n                                   -3-\n\ffurther meetings, nor did she dispute the factual basis for PREPA's\n\ndecision (i.e., her removal from the judiciary).\n\n            Rodríguez-Ruiz wrote a final response on June 11, 2007.\n\nHe once again cited Ramos-Mercado's removal from public office as\n\na barrier to her reinstatement, listing a number of laws and\n\nregulations that made her ineligible for employment.           The letter\n\nconcluded: \"If you are not in agreement with this decision, you\n\nhave a term of thirty days from receipt of this notice in which to\n\nrequest review before the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals.\"\n\n            The following month, Ramos-Mercado filed a complaint\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico, naming PREPA, Rodríguez-Ruiz, Hernández-\n\nRamos, and others as defendants.           She alleged that she had a\n\nprotected property interest in her employment with PREPA and that\n\nthe defendants deprived her of that interest without due process of\n\nlaw when they refused to reinstate her, all in violation of her\n\nconstitutional rights. She also asserted supplemental claims under\n\nPuerto Rico law.\n\n            The defendants filed a motion to dismiss Ramos-Mercado's\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim.            See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).    The district court granted the motion, finding that\n\nRamos-Mercado did not have a protected property interest in her\n\nemployment   with   PREPA.   The   court    also   declined   to   exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the Commonwealth law claims. See 28\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fU.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).     Judgment was entered for the defendants, and\n\nthis appeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de\n\nnovo, accepting as true the well-pleaded factual allegations in the\n\ncomplaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nplaintiff.    Rivera v. Centro Médico de Turabo, Inc., 575 F.3d 10,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            Ramos-Mercado alleges that the appellees violated the\n\nConstitution by depriving her of the right to be reinstated as a\n\ncareer attorney without due process of law.         To prevail on that\n\nclaim at trial, she would have to prove that: (1) she had a\n\nprotected property interest in her right to be reinstated, and (2)\n\nthe appellees, acting under color of Commonwealth law, deprived her\n\nof   that   interest   without   providing   constitutionally   adequate\n\nprocedures.    See Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina, 491 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).\n\n            The district court held that Ramos-Mercado did not have\n\na protected property interest in her right to be reinstated.        See\n\nRamos-Mercado v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth., 550 F. Supp. 2d 287, 292\n\n(D.P.R. 2008).   We find it unnecessary to address that issue.     Even\n\nassuming that Ramos-Mercado had a protected property interest in\n\nher right to be reinstated, it is evident from the face of the\n\ncomplaint and its attachments that the appellees provided her with\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f\"all the process that was due\" before they deprived her of that\n\ninterest.    Mard v. Town of Amherst, 350 F.3d 184, 194 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n            Before explaining why that is so, we emphasize the focus\n\nof the relevant inquiry.        The procedural component of the Due\n\nProcess Clause is concerned with process rather than outcome.               See\n\nZinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125-26 (1990).                  Although the\n\nparties vigorously dispute the correctness of PREPA's decision as\n\na matter of Commonwealth law, that debate is not material to the\n\nconstitutional      question   of      what     process   was    due.       See\n\nTorres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nRather,    \"to   determine   whether    a     constitutional    violation   has\n\noccurred, it is necessary to ask what process [PREPA] provided, and\n\nwhether it was constitutionally adequate.\"            Zinermon, 494 U.S. at\n\n126.\n\nA.   Constitutional Adequacy of the Procedure\n\n            Constitutional     adequacy        is   measured     against    the\n\nfundamental principle that \"individuals whose property interests\n\nare at stake are entitled to 'notice and an opportunity to be\n\nheard.'\"    Dusenbery v. United States, 534 U.S. 161, 167 (2002)\n\n(quoting United States v. James Daniel Good Real Prop., 510 U.S.\n\n43, 48 (1993)). Beyond that, however, due process is \"flexible and\n\ncalls for such procedural protections as the particular situation\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdemands.\"    Gilbert v. Homar, 520 U.S. 924, 930 (1997) (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n            There is no question that Ramos-Mercado was on notice of\n\nPREPA's position as of April 19, 2007, when she acknowledges having\n\nreceived    the   first     letter    from    Rodríguez-Ruiz.          That   letter\n\ninformed    her    of   PREPA's      decision      not    to   reinstate    her    and\n\nadequately   described       the   basis     for   that    decision.        The   only\n\nquestion, then, is whether Ramos-Mercado was given a sufficient\n\nopportunity to contest PREPA's decision.                       See Chmielinski v.\n\nMassachusetts, 513 F.3d 309, 316 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            In that regard, we note that Ramos-Mercado could have\n\nsought post-deprivation judicial review of PREPA's decision in the\n\nCommonwealth court system.            See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 2102,\n\n2171-2176; id. tit 4, § 24y(c).                 Although the availability of\n\ncomprehensive post-deprivation procedures of that sort does not\n\nnecessarily eliminate the need for a pre-deprivation check against\n\nmistaken decisions, it does affect the necessary scope of such pre-\n\ndeprivation procedures.        See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,\n\n470 U.S. 532, 545-47 & n.12 (1985); Mard, 350 F.3d at 193.\n\n            PREPA argues that, under the facts of this case, the\n\nexchange    of    letters    between    Ramos-Mercado          and   Rodríguez-Ruiz\n\nprovided    Ramos-Mercado      with    a     constitutionally        adequate     pre-\n\ndeprivation opportunity to challenge PREPA's position.                     As we have\n\nindicated, Ramos-Mercado clearly articulated her legal argument in\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fopposition to PREPA's position in her April 20, 2007, letter.\n\nRodríguez-Ruiz then replied on June 11, 2007, indicating that PREPA\n\nhad considered and rejected her argument.\n\n          Only one fact was material to PREPA's decision: the fact\n\nthat the Puerto Rico Supreme Court removed Ramos-Mercado from her\n\njudicial office.    That \"independently verifiable\" fact has never\n\nbeen disputed.     Gilbert, 520 U.S. at 933 (citing Codd v. Velger,\n\n429 U.S. 624, 627-28 (1977) (per curiam)). Ramos-Mercado and PREPA\n\ndiffered only as to the proper interpretation and application of\n\nCommonwealth law and PREPA's personnel regulations.2\n\n          Given the purely legal character of the dispute, the\n\nnature of the interests involved, and the availability of post-\n\ndeprivation judicial review, we conclude that the opportunity for\n\nRamos-Mercado to present her legal argument in writing was all the\n\nprocess that was due prior to the deprivation in this case.     See\n\nGilbert, 520 U.S. at 933-34; Dixon v. Love, 431 U.S. 105, 113-14\n\n(1977); Penobscot Air Servs. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 164 F.3d 713,\n\n723-24 (1st Cir. 1999).      Ramos-Mercado has therefore failed to\n\n\n     2\n          Although Ramos-Mercado has never disputed the fact of her\nremoval from the judiciary, she suggested for the first time on\nappeal that there were other factual disputes between her and\nPREPA. We deem that argument waived. In any event, it is beside\nthe point because the supposedly disputed facts were not material\nto PREPA's decision, which turned solely on the fact that Ramos-\nMercado had been removed from office. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3,\n§ 1462g(1) (removal from public service renders individual\nineligible for public employment until habilitated); P.R. Elec.\nPower Auth., Regulations for Career Service Personnel Management,\n§ VIII(G) (Oct. 2006) (same).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fstate a due process claim. Our disposition makes it unnecessary to\n\naddress   the   individual   capacity    appellees'   qualified   immunity\n\narguments.\n\nB.   Supplemental Claims\n\n           In addition to her due process claim, Ramos-Mercado\n\nasserted a supplemental Commonwealth law claim in her complaint.\n\nThe district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over that\n\nclaim, citing its dismissal of the federal claim.             See Ramos-\n\nMercado, 550 F. Supp. 2d at 293.        We hold that the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in so doing, as the motion to dismiss\n\nwas decided far in advance of trial and all claims over which the\n\ndistrict court had original jurisdiction were properly dismissed.\n\nSee McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d 262 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

The   court    also   declined   to   exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the Commonwealth law claims. See 28\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fU.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).

To prevail on that\n\nclaim at trial, she would have to prove that: (1) she had a\n\nprotected property interest in her right to be reinstated, and (2)\n\nthe appellees, acting under color of Commonwealth law, deprived her\n\nof   that   interest   without   providing   constitutionally   adequate\n\nprocedures.

Even\n\nassuming that Ramos-Mercado had a protected property interest in\n\nher right to be reinstated, it is evident from the face of the\n\ncomplaint and its attachments that the appellees provided her with\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f\"all the process that was due\" before they deprived her of that\n\ninterest.

Although the\n\nparties vigorously dispute the correctness of PREPA's decision as\n\na matter of Commonwealth law, that debate is not material to the\n\nconstitutional      question   of      what     process   was    due.       See\n\nTorres-Rosado v.

That   letter\n\ninformed    her    of   PREPA's      decision      not    to   reinstate    her    and\n\nadequately   described       the   basis     for   that    decision.        The   only\n\nquestion, then, is whether Ramos-Mercado was given a sufficient\n\nopportunity to contest PREPA's decision.                       See Chmielinski v.\n\nMassachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            In that regard, we note that Ramos-Mercado could have\n\nsought post-deprivation judicial review of PREPA's decision in the\n\nCommonwealth court system.            See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 2102,\n\n2171-2176; id. tit 4, § 24y(c).                 Although the availability of\n\ncomprehensive post-deprivation procedures of that sort does not\n\nnecessarily eliminate the need for a pre-deprivation check against\n\nmistaken decisions, it does affect the necessary scope of such pre-\n\ndeprivation procedures.        See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545-47 & n.12 (1985); Mard, 350 F.3d at 193.\n\n            PREPA argues that, under the facts of this case, the\n\nexchange    of    letters    between    Ramos-Mercado          and   Rodríguez-Ruiz\n\nprovided    Ramos-Mercado      with    a     constitutionally        adequate     pre-\n\ndeprivation opportunity to challenge PREPA's position.                     As we have\n\nindicated, Ramos-Mercado clearly articulated her legal argument in\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fopposition to PREPA's position in her April 20, 2007, letter.\n\nRodríguez-Ruiz then replied on June 11, 2007, indicating that PREPA\n\nhad considered and rejected her argument.\n\n          Only one fact was material to PREPA's decision: the fact\n\nthat the Puerto Rico Supreme Court removed Ramos-Mercado from her\n\njudicial office.    That \"independently verifiable\" fact has never\n\nbeen disputed.     Gilbert, 520 U.S. at 933 (citing Codd v. Velger,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109594\"><a href=\"/opinion/109594/codd-v-velger/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627-28 (1977) (per curiam)). Ramos-Mercado and PREPA\n\ndiffered only as to the proper interpretation and application of\n\nCommonwealth law and PREPA's personnel regulations.2\n\n          Given the purely legal character of the dispute, the\n\nnature of the interests involved, and the availability of post-\n\ndeprivation judicial review, we conclude that the opportunity for\n\nRamos-Mercado to present her legal argument in writing was all the\n\nprocess that was due prior to the deprivation in this case.     See\n\nGilbert, 520 U.S. at 933-34; Dixon v.

Ramos-Mercado has therefore failed to\n\n\n     2\n          Although Ramos-Mercado has never disputed the fact of her\nremoval from the judiciary, she suggested for the first time on\nappeal that there were other factual disputes between her and\nPREPA. We deem that argument waived. In any event, it is beside\nthe point because the supposedly disputed facts were not material\nto PREPA's decision, which turned solely on the fact that Ramos-\nMercado had been removed from office. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3,\n§ 1462g(1) (removal from public service renders individual\nineligible for public employment until habilitated); P.R.

Supplemental Claims\n\n           In addition to her due process claim, Ramos-Mercado\n\nasserted a supplemental Commonwealth law claim in her complaint.\n\nThe district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over that\n\nclaim, citing its dismissal of the federal claim.             See Ramos-\n\nMercado, 550 F. Supp. 2d at 293.        We hold that the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in so doing, as the motion to dismiss\n\nwas decided far in advance of trial and all claims over which the\n\ndistrict court had original jurisdiction were properly dismissed.\n\nSee McCloskey v.
