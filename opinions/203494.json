Altamore, on brief, for petitioner.\n     Gregory G. Katsas, Acting Attorney General, Civil\nDivision, Alison Marie Igoe, Senior Litigation Counsel, and\nAda E. Bosque, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\non brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                         September 24, 2008\n\n\n\n\n    *\n         Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f     BALDOCK,     Senior    Circuit        Judge.        The    Department            of\n\nHomeland Security charged Petitioner Chukri Rizkallah Gerges\n\nRabbat, a citizen of            Lebanon, with overstaying his non-\n\nimmigrant visa.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).                     Petitioner\n\nadmitted the charge’s factual allegations (contained in a\n\nNotice    to   Appear)    and    filed        an   application       for       asylum,\n\nwithholding     of   removal,      and    protection      under       the       United\n\nNations   Convention      Against       Torture      (CAT).       See      8    U.S.C.\n\n§§   1158(b),    1231(b)(3);        8     C.F.R.     §   1208.16.              In    his\n\napplication, Petitioner alleged a fear of persecution at the\n\nhands of Syrians based upon his Christian religion.\n\n     Following a hearing at which Petitioner testified at\n\nlength, the Immigration Judge (IJ) first found Petitioner’s\n\napplication for asylum untimely under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2).\n\nSubsection      (a)(2)(B)       provides       that,     absent      changed          or\n\nextraordinary circumstances, an alien is not eligible for\n\nasylum    “unless     the       alien     demonstrates         by     clear          and\n\nconvincing     evidence     that    the       application      has    been       filed\n\nwithin 1 year after the date of the alien’s arrival in the\n\nUnited    States.”         Based     on       blanket    findings,             the    IJ\n\nalternatively concluded that Petitioner was not eligible for\n\nasylum because his testimony was not credible.                          See id. §\n\n1158(b)(1)(B)(ii),(iii)            (establishing          a    framework             for\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fcredibility             determinations).                       The        IJ    explained            that\n\nPetitioner did not meet his burden of establishing he was a\n\n“refugee”         within          the    meaning         of    8     U.S.C.      §    1101(a)(42),\n\ni.e.,       one     having          a        well-founded            fear       of     persecution\n\nbased       on,     among           other          things,           religion.                 See    id.\n\n§   1158(b)(1)(B)(i)                    (requiring            applicant         for     asylum         to\n\nestablish          refugee          status).              The        IJ    further         concluded\n\nPetitioner         was        not       entitled         to     withholding            of       removal\n\nbecause he did not meet his burden of establishing his life\n\nor freedom would be threatened on account of religion if\n\nremoved to Lebanon.                     See id. § 1231(b)(3).                   Finally, the IJ\n\nconcluded Petitioner had not proven “more likely than not”\n\nthat    he       would       be    tortured         upon       returning         to    Lebanon         as\n\nrequired          for        protection            under           CAT.         See        8     C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(c)(2).                   The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n\nagreed with the IJ’s decision in all respects and dismissed\n\nPetitioner’s appeal.                     In doing so, the BIA explained that\n\nPetitioner’s application for asylum was time-barred, and the\n\nIJ’s    adverse          credibility               determination               was    not       clearly\n\nerroneous.          See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).\n\n       At    the    outset,             we   note    our       lack       of    jurisdiction           to\n\nreview Petitioner’s asylum claim.                                  Subsection (a)(3) of 8\n\nU.S.C.       §     1158       plainly          states          “[n]o       court       shall         have\n\njurisdiction            to    review         any    determination              of    the       Attorney\n\n\n                                                   -4-\n\fGeneral under paragraph (2),” relating to time limits for\n\nfiling     an    application      for     asylum.          See   Guillaume     v.\n\nGonzales, 504 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2007).                   Thus, we possess\n\njurisdiction only to review the BIA’s denial of relief based\n\non withholding of removal and CAT.                   In Jiang v. Gonzales,\n\n474 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2007) we set forth the standard of\n\nreview applicable to those claims:\n\n    This court reviews findings of fact in immigration\n    proceedings, including findings with respect to\n    credibility, to determine whether those findings\n    are supported by substantial evidence in the\n    record.      Under  that   standard,   an   adverse\n    credibility determination may stand if it is\n    supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n    evidence on the record considered as a whole.\n\n(internal       quotations       and    citation      omitted);     see      also\n\nSettenda    v.    Ashcroft,      377    F.3d   89,    93    (1st   Cir.   2004)\n\n(explaining the substantial evidence standard “applies both\n\nto the asylum and withholding claims as well as to claims\n\nbrought under CAT”).\n\n    Applying this standard, we need not repeat Petitioner’s\n\nstory here.       We have carefully reviewed the entire record\n\nand the parties’ briefs, and conclude the BIA reached the\n\ncorrect result under the applicable law.                   We have repeatedly\n\nopined   that     “‘when     a   lower    court      accurately     takes     the\n\nmeasure of a case and articulates a cogent rationale, it\n\nserves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at\n\nlength.’”       Metro.

Davis-Irish,\n\n300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing cases)).     Because\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA’s decision, we deny\n\nthe Petition for Review for substantially the reasons set\n\nforth in that decision.   See Lin v.
