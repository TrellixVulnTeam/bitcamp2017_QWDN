Héctor M. Laffitte, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                      Lipez, Selya and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond Rivera Esteves on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia\nRodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                         September 24, 2008\n\f              Per Curiam.   Enoc Alcántara-Méndez (\"Alcántara\") appeals\n\nfrom a district court judgment revoking his term of supervised\n\nrelease and imposing a prison term and new supervised release\n\nterm.1    Appointed appellate counsel has filed a merits brief, and\n\nwe have permitted Alcántara to file a supplemental pro se brief.\n\nWe affirm because Alcántara has not shown any abuse of discretion\n\nby the district court.       See United States v. McInnis, 429 F.3d 1,\n\n4 (1st Cir. 2005) (discussing the appellate review standard).\n\n              On appeal, Alcántara first raises a narrow challenge to\n\nthe district court's revocation decision. He appears to argue that\n\nthe district court erroneously determined that by not registering\n\nas a sex offender after his release from prison, Alcántara had\n\nviolated a statutorily mandated supervised release condition that\n\nthe   court    should   have,   but   did   not,   impose   in   its   criminal\n\njudgment.      In our view, his argument essentially misconstrues the\n\nrecord.       The district court actually found that Alcántara had\n\n\n      1\n      By the time the appeal was briefed, Alcántara had completed\nthe nine-month prison term that the court had imposed, but his\nappeal is not moot. After his revocation prison term expired, he\nwas immediately arrested and detained for a new offense, and so he\nstill faces the 12-month supervised release term imposed by the\ncourt. See United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, 57-58 (2000)\n(concluding that a supervised release term begins on the day on\nwhich an inmate is \"in fact freed from confinement\" to the\nsupervision of a probation officer which may not coincide with the\nexpiration date of the prison term) (analyzing the first two\nsentences of 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e)); United States v. DeLeon, 444\nF.3d 41, 55 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"It is well settled that a convict's\nclaim is not moot if he has finished his prison term but still\nfaces supervised release[.]\").\n\n                                      -2-\n\fviolated his supervised release conditions \"by engaging in new\n\ncriminal conduct, to wit: Failing to register as a sex offender as\n\nmandated by both Federal and local Government statute.\"                 Alcántara\n\nquotes this exact ruling in his counseled brief, but does not claim\n\nthat this ruling was erroneous.              Although the district court did\n\nnot specify the exact supervised release condition that had been\n\nviolated, there could have been no doubt which condition the court\n\nmeant.    The criminal judgment expressly stated that one supervised\n\nrelease condition was that Alcántara not commit \"another federal,\n\nstate or local crime.\"\n\n            In    his   pro    se   brief,    Alcántara     also   presses    Fifth\n\nAmendment objections to the district court's revocation decision.\n\nAs argued on appeal, however, his claims lack merit. The probation\n\nofficer was not obliged to warn Alcántara in advance that his\n\nstatements at the revocation hearing could be used against him.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(b)(2)(A) (requiring only that written\n\nnotice of \"the alleged violation\" be given).                  Nor has Alcántara\n\nexplained why his seemingly voluntary statements at the hearing\n\nwere   involuntary      or    compelled,     so   as   to   implicate   the   Fifth\n\nAmendment.       See United States v. Jones, 299 F.3d 103, 110-11 (2d\n\nCir. 2002) (concluding that a person charged with a supervised\n\nrelease    violation     who     voluntarily      chooses     to   testify    at   a\n\nrevocation hearing cannot later claim that his testimony was\n\ncompelled); see also United States v. Meléndez, 228 F.3d 19, 22\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f(1st Cir. 2000) (rejecting a claim that Miranda warnings are\n\ngenerally required before a person is subjected to \"in-court\n\nquestioning\").    In    addition,    Alcántara   seeks      to   exclude   his\n\nstatements only on the ground that they implicated him in conduct\n\nfor which his supervised release term could be revoked.            He has not\n\nargued for exclusion on the ground that his statements implicated\n\nhim in new criminal conduct for which he might later be prosecuted.\n\nSee United States v. Roy, 438 F.3d 140, 144 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(rejecting a Fifth Amendment claim under similar circumstances).\n\n          Finally,     Alcántara    suggests   that,   in   its   revocation\n\nsentence, the district court could not impose a supervised release\n\ncondition on him that requires him to register as a sex offender.\n\nAlcántara waived this claim at the revocation hearing by expressly\n\ntelling the court--twice--that he would obey its direct order\n\ninstructing him to register as a sex offender and by failing to\n\nobject when the court later imposed the condition on him.                  The\n\nsupervised release condition he now objects to is essentially a\n\ndirect order that will become effective when Alcántara's supervised\n\nrelease term begins.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
