On    November   5,    2004,   we    affirmed    the\n\nconviction of defendant-appellant Ronald A. X. Stokes for being a\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), as well as\n\nhis sentence of 30-years imprisonment.                 See United States v.\n\nStokes,    388    F.3d   21   (1st   Cir.    2004).      Stokes     subsequently\n\npetitioned for certiorari, during which time the Supreme Court\n\ndecided United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).                        In a\n\nroutine order, the Supreme Court granted Stokes' petition for\n\ncertiorari pro forma, vacated our judgment, and remanded for\n\nfurther consideration in light of Booker.               See Stokes v. United\n\nStates, 125 S. Ct. 1678 (2005).              After review of the parties'\n\nsupplemental briefs, we again uphold the length of Stokes' sentence\n\nand reinstate the judgment, but remand as to whether the district\n\ncourt would run the federal sentence concurrently with any parole\n\nsentence that the state might eventually impose from Stokes' prior\n\nconviction.\n\n            The facts surrounding this case have been thoroughly\n\nexplained elsewhere.          See    Stokes, 388 F.3d at 23-25;           United\n\nStates v. Stokes, 124 F.3d 39, 41-42 (1st Cir. 1997);                     United\n\nStates v. Stokes, 947 F. Supp. 546, 548-50 (D. Mass. 1996);\n\nCommonwealth v. Stokes, 653 N.E.2d 180, 181-84 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1995),    rev. denied, 655 N.E.2d 1277 (Mass. 1995).               In a nutshell,\n\nStokes was convicted on one count of being a felon in possession of\n\na firearm -- an AK-47 -- for a shooting which killed one person and\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fwounded two other individuals.1           The sentencing court found Stokes\n\nto be an Armed Career Criminal pursuant to the Armed Career\n\nCriminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), with a criminal history\n\ncategory of VI.    The court then determined Stokes' total offense\n\nlevel to be 34 -- placing his Guidelines sentencing range from 262\n\nto 327 months' imprisonment -- due to the \"overwhelming\" evidence\n\nthat he had used an AK-47 during a crime of violence.                         United\n\nStates v. Stokes, No. CRIM 95-10379-RGS, 2000 WL 246478, at *4 (D.\n\nMass. Feb. 28, 2000). Upon the government's motion, the court also\n\ndeparted upward one level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5K2.6, because of\n\n\"the extraordinarily dangerous nature of this particular weapon and\n\nammunition involved in this offense.\"                 The court then rejected\n\nStokes' argument for a downward departure.                    With a resulting\n\nGuidelines   sentencing      range   of    292   to    365   months,    the   court\n\nsentenced Stokes to 360 months, stating that \"Mr. Stokes' history\n\nof violent crimes and recidivist propensity justifies a sentence at\n\nthe upper end of the applicable sentencing range.\"\n\n          The    court    ordered    Stokes'      federal     sentence    to    run\n\nconcurrently    with   the   state    sentence        stemming   from   the    same\n\nincident, but held that under U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3, it did not have the\n\nauthority to run the federal sentence concurrently with any parole\n\n\n1\n    In connection with this same incident, Stokes was also\npreviously convicted and sentenced in state court on one count of\nillegally carrying a firearm and two counts of assault and battery\nwith a dangerous weapon; he was acquitted, however, of the first-\ndegree murder charge. See Stokes, 653 N.E.2d at 180, n.1.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fsentence    that     the   state     might    eventually     impose    for    a    prior\n\nconviction.         In relevant part, the court stated: \"I would be\n\nwilling to hear further by way of subsequent filings on this issue,\n\nbut . . . [t]he problem is that the Guidelines have an explicit\n\nprohibition . . . . [I]f that's wrong, then I might consider it in\n\nthe sentencing order.\"\n\n            Stokes now argues that the district court erred in\n\nsentencing him under the mandatory guidelines, and that under an\n\nadvisory    system,     the   district       court   might    (1)    impose    a    more\n\nfavorable sentence, and (2) reconsider its denial of Stokes'\n\nrequest that his federal sentence run concurrently with any future\n\nstate parole sentence.\n\n            While it is clear that sentencing under the mandatory\n\nguidelines was in error, Stokes has not preserved this claim of\n\nerror below, and thus, our review is for plain error.                    See United\n\nStates v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).                         Under\n\nthis standard, Stokes must demonstrate a \"reasonable probability\"\n\nthat the sentencing court would have imposed a lower sentence under\n\nan advisory guidelines regime.                Id.; see also United States v.\n\nHeldeman,     402    F.3d     220,    224    (1st    Cir.    2005)    (requiring      a\n\n\"reasonable indication that the district judge might well have\n\nreached a different result under advisory guidelines\").                            When,\n\nhowever, \"under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court\n\nhas elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fbottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court,\n\nif   acting    under   an   advisory   guidelines   regime,   would    in   all\n\nlikelihood have imposed the same sentence.\"              United States v.\n\nGonzález-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 304 (1st Cir. 2005);                  see also\n\nUnited States v. Brennick, 405 F.3d 96, 101-02 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Carpenter, 403 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              Here, the court sentenced Stokes \"substantially above the\n\nbottom of the range\" -- 360 months from a sentencing range of 292\n\nto 365 months -- based on \"Stokes' history of violent crimes and\n\nrecidivist propensity.\" Moreover, in so doing, the court exercised\n\nits discretion to depart upward, and \"[b]y moving up, the judge\n\nevinces not only a belief that discretion exists but also a\n\ndisposition to exercise it adversely to the accused.\"                   United\n\nStates v. Lee, 399 F.3d 864, 867 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that an\n\nupward departure may be one indication that errors from treating\n\nthe guidelines as mandatory do not affect defendant's substantial\n\nrights). Under these circumstances, we find that Stokes has failed\n\nto show a reasonable probability that the district court would have\n\nimposed a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines system.\n\n              We find, however, that the district court might have\n\nruled differently on the concurrency issue.             As this court has\n\nstated, proof of reasonable probability that the district judge\n\nmight have reached a different result under advisory guidelines is\n\nnot \"overly demanding.\"       Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224.      In the instant\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcase, the fact that the sentencing judge indicated that he was\n\nwilling to consider the concurrency issue but for the mandatory\n\nguidelines is sufficient for a Booker remand. See United States v.\n\nBurhoe,   409   F.3d   5,   11   (1st    Cir.   2005)   (finding   reasonable\n\nprobability when the district judge stated \"I don't believe the\n\nlanguage of the guidelines permit me to tailor this\").\n\n           Thus, we again affirm Stokes' conviction and sentence,\n\nand order our earlier judgment reinstated, but remand to the\n\ndistrict court as to whether, under an advisory guidelines system,\n\nit would order Stokes' federal sentence to run concurrently with\n\nany future state parole sentence.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f",

Under these circumstances, we find that Stokes has failed\n\nto show a reasonable probability that the district court would have\n\nimposed a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines system.\n\n              We find, however, that the district court might have\n\nruled differently on the concurrency issue.             As this court has\n\nstated, proof of reasonable probability that the district judge\n\nmight have reached a different result under advisory guidelines is\n\nnot \"overly demanding.\"       Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224.      In the instant\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcase, the fact that the sentencing judge indicated that he was\n\nwilling to consider the concurrency issue but for the mandatory\n\nguidelines is sufficient for a Booker remand.
