UPHOFF FIGUEROA,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n         HECTOR ALEJANDRO; and NITZA VAZQUEZ RODRIGUEZ,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n         ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raul Barrera Morales for the appellant.\n\n     Marie L. Cortes Cortes for the appellees.\n\n\n\n                          March 4, 2010\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.    A judge and a jury, between them,\n\nrejected all of the multitude of employment claims John Uphoff\n\nFigueroa, an environmental attorney, brought against his employer,\n\nthe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and at least seven\n\nPREPA officials. His basic theory, dressed in many garbs, was that\n\nthe new Popular Democratic Party (PDP) regime discriminated against\n\nhim by denying him a permanent appointment as the administrator of\n\nPREPA's environmental law office and by creating hostile working\n\nconditions because he was a member of the New Progressive Party\n\n(NPP). He alleges the NPP regime then retaliated against him after\n\nhe filed a federal lawsuit in 2003.      We find no merit to his claims\n\nand affirm.\n\n            We hold as a matter of law under Branti v. Finkel, 445\n\nU.S. 507 (1980), and its progeny that the position of administrator\n\nis not within First Amendment protection because it is a policy\n\nposition.     PREPA   officials    could    have   considered   political\n\naffiliation when deciding whether to give Uphoff the permanent\n\nposition.      Once   again   we   remind   litigants   that    political\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation claims under the First Amendment\n\ncannot be restated as claims under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nAnd we hold that Uphoff did not state a claim under the Fair Labor\n\nStandards Act (FLSA) because he did not allege he was involved in\n\nFLSA-protected activity.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f                                        I.\n\n             Uphoff's    suit,    as    amended    in   2004,     brought    First\n\nAmendment and equal protection political discrimination claims;\n\nFirst Amendment retaliation claims; FLSA retaliation claims, 27\n\nU.S.C.   §   215(a)(3);       Title   VII    retaliation   claims,    42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-3(a); civil rights conspiracy claims, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3);1\n\nand state constitutional and statutory claims.2             He sued PREPA; two\n\nof his supervisors, Hector Alejandro Navarez and Nitza Vazquez\n\nRodriguez; and other PREPA officials.3\n\n             The trial court dismissed on the pleadings Uphoff's First\n\nAmendment discrimination claim that he was denied the position of\n\nadministrator     of    the    environmental      law   office,    holding    that\n\npolitical affiliation was a legitimate qualification for the job.\n\nUphoff-Figueroa v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth. (Uphoff-Figueroa I), No.\n\n03-1509, 2005 WL 3095517, at *6-11 (D.P.R. Nov. 18, 2005).                    The\n\ncourt dismissed his political discrimination and retaliation claims\n\n\n     1\n          Uphoff also sued under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process\nClause and the Ninth Amendment. He does not appeal the district\ncourt's dismissal of these claims. See Uphoff-Figueroa I, 2005 WL\n3095517, at *12.\n     2\n          Those claims were under Puerto Rico Law 100, P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 29, §§ 146 et seq., and Puerto Rico Law 115, P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 29, § 194a; articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico\nCode, P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 5141-42; and Article II, sections 1, 4, 6,\n7, 8, and 16, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto\nRico.\n     3\n          Those officials were Maria Mendez Rivera, Maria Torrales\nHernandez, Ana Blanes Rodriguez, Hector Rosario, Ramon Rodriguez\nMelendez, and several John Does.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fagainst all defendants except Vazquez and Alejandro.               See id. at\n\n*12-14.    It dismissed his Title VII and civil rights conspiracy\n\nagainst all defendants, id. at *14-16, and his FLSA claim against\n\nPREPA, dismissing PREPA from the case, Uphoff-Figueroa v. P.R.\n\nElec. Power Auth. (Uphoff-Figueroa II), No. 09-1509, 2006 WL\n\n1663537 (D.P.R. Jun. 7, 2006). The court allowed Uphoff's FLSA and\n\nstate law claims against all individual defendants to proceed to\n\ntrial, and it allowed his political discrimination and retaliation\n\nclaims against Alejandro and Vazquez to proceed to trial as well.\n\n           After trial, the court granted judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw (JMOL), Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), in favor of all defendants,\n\nincluding Alejandro and Vazquez, on Uphoff's FLSA claims and on one\n\nof his state law claims, under Puerto Rico Law 115 (Law 115).\n\nUphoff-Figueroa v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth. (Uphoff-Figueroa III),\n\nNo. 09-1509, slip op. at 4-10 (D.P.R. Jun. 2, 2008).              It also held\n\nUphoff had not presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find the\n\nindividual defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez liable on any of\n\nthe remaining (state law) claims, and it dismissed those defendants\n\nfrom the case.    Id. at 10-11.\n\n           Only   Alejandro   and   Vazquez   were   left    in     the   case.\n\nUphoff's    remaining    claims     against     them,       for     political\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation and for violations of state law,\n\nwent to a jury.    A jury rejected all of Uphoff's claims against\n\nAlejandro and Vazquez. The trial court denied his new trial motion\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ffor purported errors in the jury instructions and verdict form and\n\nhis motion to amend the verdict.\n\n            Uphoff appeals the court's dismissal of his claims on the\n\npleadings, its grants of judgment as a matter of law, the jury\n\ninstructions and verdict form, and the court's denial of his motion\n\nfor a new trial or to amend the verdict.           We affirm.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            In   1996,    Uphoff    started   as   principal     environmental\n\nattorney    at   PREPA,    a    position    just   below   the    position   of\n\nadministrator of the environmental office. He handled the office's\n\nmore complex cases.            Just before the 2000 elections, he was\n\ntemporarily appointed the administrator of the office.\n\n            After the PDP took power in the 2000 elections, two PDP\n\nmembers, defendants Hector Alejandro and Nitza Vazquez, became\n\nUphoff's supervisors.          The environmental law office was moved to\n\nAlejandro's directorate in September 2001. In June 2002, Alejandro\n\nappointed Vazquez as administrator without allowing Uphoff to apply\n\nfor the permanent position; Uphoff returned to being the principal\n\nattorney.    Alejandro was promoted in September 2003 and no longer\n\nsupervised Uphoff or Vazquez.\n\n            Uphoff apparently claimed that Alejandro and Vazquez\n\nbegan a campaign to mistreat him because he was an NPP member.4              He\n\n\n     4\n          The briefs and trial transcript do not clearly explain\nhow all of Uphoff's factual allegations supported his legal\ntheories.   We briefly recite his core factual claims as we\n\n                                      -5-\n\ftestified that they excluded him from meetings, blocked him from\n\nattending    professional    seminars,   reduced    his   workload   and\n\nresponsibilities, and maligned him to other employees, destroying\n\nhis relationships with his colleagues.\n\n            Before   he   became   Uphoff's    supervisor,   Alejandro's\n\ndirectorate often consulted the environmental law office, and\n\nAlejandro and Uphoff worked together.         In early 2001, Uphoff and\n\nAlejandro already began disagreeing over how to handle several\n\ncases.    Alejandro testified that Uphoff did not obtain approval\n\nbefore improperly awarding a $3.4 million contract, failed to\n\ntimely negotiate a contract, and failed to send documents to\n\nfederal authorities upon request.\n\n            Uphoff, in turn, asserted that Alejandro and Vazquez\n\nlimited his autonomy at work.      They ordered him to arrive promptly\n\nat the start of business, 7:30 a.m.           Uphoff sometimes credited\n\nhours he worked late to morning hours on his time sheet without\n\nobtaining prior permission to do so, as PREPA regulations required.\n\nAlejandro and Vazquez ordered him to accurately report his arrival\n\ntime.    Once Alejandro refused to sign a time sheet, after Uphoff\n\nmissed a 10:00 a.m. conference call about a federal regulatory\n\nmatter but reported on his sheet that he had arrived at 7:30 a.m.\n\n            Uphoff also testified that Alejandro and Vazquez denied\n\nhim vacation leave. Vazquez and Alejandro testified, however, that\n\n\nunderstand them.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fin   2002    PREPA    began    requiring        all   executive   and   managerial\n\npersonnel to accept payment for vacation time in excess of 450\n\nhours and that Uphoff refused to comply.\n\n             Uphoff    claimed    that    his     immediate   supervisor,     Nitza\n\nVazquez, tried to isolate him.              In late 2003 Vazquez prevented\n\nUphoff's secretary from using a computer to edit Uphoff's work.\n\nVazquez also changed the locks to the environmental law office\n\n(then on the sixth floor) for security reasons.               Uphoff claimed he\n\nwas the only attorney not given a key; Vazquez, Alejandro, and\n\nother employees, however, testified that no attorneys were given\n\nkeys.       When the office later moved to the seventh floor, all\n\nattorneys, including Uphoff, were given keys.\n\n             Uphoff testified that his position as principal attorney\n\neroded in 2004 and 2005.             As principal attorney, Uphoff was\n\naccustomed to having a larger office than the other lawyers.                   When\n\nthe environmental law office moved floors in 2004, Uphoff tried to\n\nclaim the second-largest office but was told it would become a\n\nconference room. He was left to choose among five identical, small\n\noffices designated for attorneys.\n\n             In 2005 PREPA instituted an agency-wide reclassification\n\nplan, based on recommendations by an outside consultant, which made\n\nUphoff   and    all   the     attorneys    \"senior     attorneys.\"      The   other\n\nattorneys received raises to match Uphoff's salary; Uphoff received\n\nno raise.       Several of his colleagues received promotions even\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fbefore    the     reclassification           plan;     the     defendants    offered\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for those promotions.\n\n            Uphoff attempted to tie all these incidents to political\n\nanimus.   He showed that Alejandro, Vazquez, and a few of the other\n\nindividual defendants were PDP members but had little evidence they\n\nfelt animosity toward NPP members.               His secretary testified that\n\nAlejandro had told her the executive director of the agency was\n\npressuring      him   to   oust      Uphoff.     Uphoff       also   testified   that\n\nAlejandro     had     said     he,     Alejandro,      had     experienced      \"real\"\n\ndiscrimination when the NPP was in power.\n\n            The defendants denied that Uphoff was mistreated and that\n\nhis political affiliation made any difference.                   Vazquez testified\n\nthat she gave Uphoff many complex cases and that she and Alejandro\n\nlet Uphoff attend appropriate meetings and seminars. She explained\n\nthat she only stripped him of cases after he failed to execute\n\nassignments.        Alejandro admitted telling Uphoff and others that\n\nUphoff was \"Machiavellic,\" after a particular incident in which he\n\ndisapproved     of    what    Uphoff    had    done.         Otherwise,   Alejandro,\n\nVazquez, and other employees denied that Uphoff's supervisors\n\nundermined his work relationships.\n\n            Alejandro        and   Vazquez     testified      that   tensions    arose\n\nbecause Uphoff was insubordinate, displayed a bad attitude, and\n\noften lost his temper.               They also testified that Uphoff never\n\nrespected Nitza Vazquez's authority over him as the administrator,\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fand Uphoff did not properly complete assignments that Vazquez\n\nassigned him.   Alejandro testified that Uphoff did not work well\n\nwith supervisors, colleagues, or state and federal agencies.\n\n                                   III.\n\nA.        The District Court Properly Dismissed Several of Uphoff's\n          Claims under Rule 12(b)(6)\n\n          Uphoff appeals the district court's dismissal under Rule\n\n12(b)(6) of his First Amendment discrimination claim based on his\n\nremoval as administrator; his FLSA, Title VII, and civil rights\n\nconspiracy   claims;   and   his   First   Amendment   retaliation   claim\n\nagainst all defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez.5\n\n          We review a district court's decision dismissing claims\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, \"accepting as true all well-pleaded\n\nfacts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the\n\nplaintiff['s] favor.\"    Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist, 584 F.3d 314,\n\n325 (1st Cir. 2009).         \"[A] complaint must contain sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that\n\nis plausible on its face.\"     Id. (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.\n\nCt. 1937, 1949 (2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted).           \"[W]e\n\nmay affirm on any basis apparent in the record.\"         Id.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n           Uphoff does not challenge the district court's dismissal\nof his Fourteenth Amendment political discrimination claims against\nall defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez or its ruling that res\njudicata barred several claims.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f1.         Uphoff Stated No First Amendment Political Discrimination\n           Claim as to the Position of Administrator\n\n           When a position is one for which political affiliation\n\nmay be considered is a question of law for the courts.                         Flynn v.\n\nCity of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir. 1998).                       Whether or not\n\nAlejandro considered political affiliation when he replaced Uphoff\n\nwith   Vazquez     as    administrator,           political     affiliation      was    a\n\npermissible consideration for that position.\n\n           The First Amendment does not bar public employers from\n\nconsidering      political         affiliation      for   positions      for     \"which\n\npolitical affiliation is an 'appropriate requirement for . . .\n\neffective performance.'\" Galloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting Branti, 445 U.S. at 518). The Supreme Court crafted\n\nthis   \"policymaking\"         or    \"position-of-trust\"          exception      because\n\npolitical officials must be able to hire staff who will help them\n\nexecute their policy goals--and so effectuate voters' wishes.                          Id.\n\n           Uphoff       was   not    dismissed       from,    but   rather     was     not\n\nappointed to, the permanent administrator's position.                          We have\n\nregularly upheld even \"the dismissal on political grounds of mid-\n\nor   upper-level    officials         or   employees      who    are    significantly\n\nconnected to policy-making,\" either as policymakers or by working\n\nclosely with policymakers.             Flynn, 140 F.3d at 45.            The official\n\nmay be a subordinate and need not be \"the ultimate decisionmaker in\n\nthe agency;\" \"it is enough that the official [is] involved in\n\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fpolicy, even if only as an adviser, implementer, or spokesperson.\"\n\nId. at 46 (internal citation omitted).6\n\n           \"Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, and an\n\nofficial description of job functions is a presumptively reliable\n\nbasis for determining those functions.\"          Olmeda v. Ortíz-Quiñónez,\n\n434 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal citation omitted).7\n\n           The job description says the duty of the administrator of\n\nthe environmental law office is to develop and formulate PREPA's\n\nlegal strategy for all environmental law issues and cases and\n\nadvise   the   legal   advisor's   office   about   that   strategy.    The\n\nadministrator implements PREPA's policies by directing how the\n\nagency   litigates     and   resolves   cases.      Candidates   must   have\n\n\"[e]xtensive knowledge of the general policy of the Authority.\"\n\n\n     6\n          \"Thus, we have upheld political discharges of the\nregional director of an administrative agency, the municipal\nsecretary in a mayor's office, an officer in charge of human\nresources, a director of public relations, a superintendent of\npublic works, a director of a city's federal programs office, and\na director of a satellite office of the Massachusetts Secretary of\nState.\" Flynn, 140 F.3d at 45; see also, e.g., Ruiz-Cassillas, 415\nF.3d at 132-33 (holding the second-ranking officer in a\nmunicipality's Federal Programs Division was a policymaker);\nGalloza, 389 F.3d at 30-32 (holding the regional administrator for\nthe state's municipal tax collection agency was a policymaker).\n     7\n          Puerto Rico law classifies government positions as either\n\"career\" or \"trust.\" Costa-Urena v. Segarra, 590 F.3d 18, 22 (1st\nCir. 2009). \"Trust\" employees participate in policymaking and can\nbe hired and fired on political grounds. Id. \"Career\" employees\nmust be selected and terminated based on merit, not politics. Id.\nHow Puerto Rico law classifies a position is not dispositive on\nwhether the position is a policymaking one under the First\nAmendment. See Ruiz-Casillas v. Coamacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127,\n133 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                   -11-\n\f           Also telling is that the administrator is subject only to\n\n\"general supervision\" and must exercise \"a high degree of . . .\n\nindependent judgment.\"          The administrator meets with other PREPA\n\nofficers   and   state    and     federal    agencies,    serves   on   relevant\n\ncommittees, and coordinates with other departments. And candidates\n\nmust have a law degree, a license to practice, and experience\n\npracticing environmental law.\n\n           In short, PREPA relies on the administrator to develop,\n\nunderstand, and execute its environmental-policy goals.                   Those\n\npolicy   goals   may     change    with     different    administrations,   and\n\npolitical affiliation is a relevant consideration.8\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          The mistreatment claims that proceeded to trial against\nAlejandro and Vazquez were improperly classified under the rubric\nof the Equal Protection Clause rather than the First Amendment. An\nequal protection claim alleging political discrimination merely\nrestates a First Amendment political discrimination claim and, as\nwe have said repeatedly, should have been considered under the\nFirst Amendment. See, e.g., Morales-Santiago v. Hernández-Pérez,\n488 F.3d 465, 471 (1st Cir. 2007); Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16,\n36 (1st Cir. 2006). We discuss the disposition of those claims\nlater.\n     The Supreme Court has held that plaintiffs can bring political\ndiscrimination claims based on employment action beyond hiring and\nfiring, but it has not precisely articulated what actions qualify.\nSee Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 64-65 (1990).\nIt is unclear under current law whether many incidents of\nmistreatment Uphoff has alleged qualify. See id. But we need not\nreach that question; Uphoff does not appeal the district court's\nruling that he failed to plead sufficient facts supporting\npolitical discrimination claims against the defendants except\nAlejandro and Vazquez, and the jury rejected his claims against\nAlejandro and Vazquez.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f2.          Uphoff Stated No FLSA Retaliation Claim against the\n            Defendants\n\n            The FLSA regulates certain adult employees' minimum wages\n\nand maximum hours.     See 29 U.S.C. §§ 206-07.        Uphoff's amended\n\ncomplaint purported to sue under § 215(a)(3), which prohibits\n\nemployers   from   retaliating   against   employees   who   \"filed   any\n\ncomplaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding\n\nunder or related to\" the FLSA.    Plaintiffs must prove (1) that they\n\n\"engaged in statutorily protected activity\" and (2) that their\n\nemployers afterward took \"adverse employment action\" against them\n\n(3) \"as a reprisal for having engaged in the protected activity.\"\n\nClaudio-Gotay v. Becton Dickinson Caribe, Ltd., 375 F.3d 99, 102\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Uphoff pled no facts supporting an FLSA retaliation claim\n\nbecause he did not allege that he engaged in protected activity.9\n\nThat suffices to affirm the district court's dismissal of Uphoff's\n\nFLSA claims against PREPA under Rule 12(b)(6). Uphoff-Figueroa II,\n\n2006 WL 1663537, at *1.10        For that reason, the dismissal of\n\n\n     9\n          His original federal court complaint did not set forth a\ncause of action under the FLSA, and his amended complaint did not\nerase that problem by purporting to add a retaliation claim.\n     In any event, as we explain below, the district court properly\nheld that Uphoff presented no evidence showing the individual\ndefendants except Alejandro and Vazquez were liable on any claim.\nAnd the jury found, in a special verdict in favor of Alejandro and\nVazquez, that Uphoff did not suffer retaliation.\n     10\n          Once the FLSA claim was dismissed, the district court\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining\nstate law claims against PREPA.     Uphoff-Figueroa II, 2006 WL\n\n                                  -13-\n\fUphoff's FLSA claims against all other defendants under Rule 50(a)\n\nwas also appropriate.     Uphoff-Figueroa III, slip op. at 3-7.         Not\n\nonly did Uphoff not plead such a claim, but he had no claim under\n\nthe FLSA's wage and hours provisions.           He pled he was lawyer for\n\nPREPA, and all of the jobs he held were within the \"learned\n\nprofessional\" exemption to the FLSA.11          See 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1).\n\n3.        The Title VII Retaliation Claims Were Properly Dismissed\n\n          Uphoff appeals the district court's dismissal of his\n\nTitle VII retaliation claims against all defendants.                Because\n\nplaintiffs   may   not   bring   Title    VII   suits   against   individual\n\nemployees, Fantini v. Salem State Coll., 557 F.3d 22, 28-31 (1st\n\nCir. 2009), the dismissal against all individual defendants was\n\nproper.\n\n\n1663537, at *3. Uphoff asserts the district court erred by doing\nso, but he has waived this argument by failing to develop it any\nfurther in his brief. Regardless, a district court has discretion\nto decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction after dismissing\n\"all claims over which it ha[d] original jurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1367(c)(3); see also Alvarez-Torres v. Ryder Mem. Hosp., Inc.,\n582 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 2009).\n     11\n          The FLSA exempts from its wage and hours requirements,\ninter alia, \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive,\nadministrative, or professional capacity.\" 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1).\nFederal regulations define \"professional\" to include \"learned\nprofessionals\" and establish a three-part test to determine whether\nemployees are \"learned professionals.\" See 29 C.F.R. § 541.301(a).\nEmployees must \"perform work requiring advanced knowledge.\" Id.\n§ 541.301(a), (b). That advanced knowledge \"must be in a field of\nscience or learning,\" which \"includes the traditional professions\nof law, medicine, theology,\" and the like. Id. § 541.301(a), (c).\nAnd it \"must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of\nspecialized intellectual instruction,\" generally an academic\ndegree. Id. § 541.301(a), (d).\n\n                                   -14-\n\f           The dismissal of Uphoff's claim against PREPA was also\n\nproper. Uphoff was required to exhaust his administrative remedies\n\nbefore suing in federal court, including by filing a complaint with\n\nthe Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC).     Frederique-\n\nAlexandre v. Dep't of Natural & Envtl. Res., 478 F.3d 433, 440 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); Jorge v. Rumsfeld, 404 F.3d 556, 564-65 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    Nothing in Uphoff's complaint or the record shows Uphoff\n\never filed any complaint with the EEOC, let alone any claim of\n\nretaliation.\n\n4.         The Civil Rights Conspiracy Claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1985\n           Were Properly Dismissed\n\n           A plaintiff suing under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) must allege\n\n(1) a conspiracy existed, (2) the defendants had \"a conspiratorial\n\npurpose to deprive the plaintiff of the equal protection of the\n\nlaws,\" (3) the defendants committed an \"overt act in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy,\" and (4) the plaintiff suffered \"injury to person\n\nor property, or a deprivation of a constitutionally protected\n\nright.\"   Perez-Sanchez v. Pub. Bldg. Auth., 531 F.3d 104, 107 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).    Uphoff's complaint set forth no facts alleging a\n\nconspiracy. And he only alleged political discrimination, which is\n\nnot actionable under § 1985(3).   Id. at 109.\n\n5.         The Dismissal of Uphoff's First Amendment Retaliation\n           Claims against All Defendants Save Alejandro and Vazquez\n           Was Proper\n\n           The dismissal of Uphoff's claims against all defendants\n\nexcept Alejandro and Vazquez that he suffered retaliatory adverse\n\n                                -15-\n\femployment action for exercising his First Amendment right to file\n\nsuit was proper.   (And as for Alejandro and Vazquez, the jury found\n\nthem not liable.)    Plaintiffs may sue under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if\n\nthey suffered adverse employment action after exercising their\n\nFirst Amendment rights.    Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 16-17\n\n(1st Cir. 2004); see Rosado-Quiñones v. Toledo, 528 F.3d 1, 5-7\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (discussing the scope of public employees' right to\n\npetition).   Plaintiffs must show they \"engaged in constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor in the alleged adverse employment decision.\"\n\nWelch v. Ciampa, 542 F.3d 927, 936 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Assuming arguendo that Uphoff's filing his 2003 federal\n\ncourt complaint was protected activity, see Rosado-Quiñones, 528\n\nF.3d at 5-7, the 2004 amended complaint's factual allegations\n\nagainst the other defendants failed to connect them to his filing\n\nof the 2003 complaint.\n\nB.         The District Court Properly Granted Judgment as a Matter\n           of Law for All Defendants on Uphoff's Law 115 Claims and\n           for All Remaining State Law Claims against the Defendants\n           Save Alejandro and Vazquez\n\n           The court granted JMOL on Uphoff's Law 115 claims against\n\nall the defendants and dismissed the other state law claims against\n\nall defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez.   Uphoff-Figueroa III,\n\nat 4-9.\n\n           We review de novo a district court's decision granting\n\nJMOL.   Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernandez, 447 F.3d 115, 121 (1st\n\n                                -16-\n\fCir. 2006).   Taking all inferences in favor of Uphoff, we review\n\nthe evidence at trial and ask whether a reasonable jury could have\n\nfound these defendants liable.       Id.; see also Jennings v. Jones,\n\n587 F.3d 430, 435-39 (1st Cir. 2009).            We may affirm the district\n\ncourt \"on any independently sufficient ground\" in the record.\n\nInvest Almaz v. Temple-Inland Forest Prods. Corp., 243 F.3d 57, 75\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d\n\n151, 172 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n1.         JMOL Was Properly Granted on State Law 115 Claims and\n           Dismissal against Alejandro and Vazquez Was Otherwise\n           Warranted\n\n           Puerto    Rico     Law   115      prohibits     employers   from\n\ndiscriminating against employees for \"offer[ing] or attempt[ing] to\n\noffer,   verbally   or   in   writing,     any   testimony,   expression   or\n\ninformation before a legislative, administrative or judicial forum\n\nin Puerto Rico.\"    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29 § 194a(a).         Employees must\n\nestablish they engaged in activity protected under Law 115 and then\n\nsuffered discrimination at work.         Velez v. Janssen Ortho, LLC, 467\n\nF.3d 802, 809 (1st Cir. 2006); MVM, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 568 F. Supp.\n\n2d 158, 176-77 (D.P.R. 2008).\n\n           Assuming arguendo that Law 115 applies to the filing of\n\na federal court complaint in Puerto Rico, Uphoff presented no\n\nevidence, other than his evidence against Alejandro and Vazquez,\n\nthat any of the individual defendants retaliated against him for\n\nfiling the 2003 complaint.\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f             There is a different reason to affirm the ultimate\n\ndismissal of the Law 115 claims against Alejandro and Vazquez.            An\n\nidentical retaliation claim went to the jury under federal law, and\n\nthe jury rejected Uphoff's claim of retaliation against Alejandro\n\nand Vazquez.      In the special verdict asking whether Uphoff had\n\nsuffered any retaliation after filing his 2003 complaint, the jury\n\nfound he had not met his burden.        Thus, even if there was error in\n\nentering JMOL on the Law 115 claims, it was harmless.           See Molloy\n\nv. Blanchard, 115 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that any\n\nerror the district court committed in granting JMOL was harmless\n\nbecause it did not affect the plaintiff's damages); see also, e.g.,\n\nGrazier ex rel. White v. City of Philadelphia, 328 F.3d 120, 124\n\n(3d Cir. 2003) (holding that any error in dismissing a claim on\n\nJMOL   was   harmless   because   the   jury   rejected   a   legal   theory\n\nnecessary to the claim); Snyder v. Ag Trucking, Inc., 57 F.3d 484,\n\n491 (6th Cir. 1995) (same); 11 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 2888, at 479, 485 (2d ed. 1995).\n\n2.           JMOL Was Properly Granted on Other State Law Claims\n             against Defendants Rosario, Rodriguez, Mendez, Blanes,\n             and Hernandez\n\n             The only claims remaining against the defendants Rosario,\n\nRodriguez, Blanes, Mendez, and Hernandez were state law claims\n\nunder Law 100, articles 1802 and 1803, and Article II of the Puerto\n\nRican constitution.     We affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nthese claims.     Uphoff did not present sufficient evidence for a\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\freasonable jury to find these defendants liable for discriminating\n\nor retaliating against him.12\n\n             Uphoff   presented    no   evidence    that   Rosario,   PREPA's\n\nexecutive director, was involved in any activity Uphoff alleged was\n\nimproper or even that Rosario knew Uphoff's political affiliation.\n\nThe   only    evidence   against    Rosario   was    Uphoff's   secretary's\n\ntestimony that Alejandro told her the executive director was\n\npressuring him to remove Uphoff.        Even if true, without more, that\n\nevidence is insufficient to show retaliation or discrimination.\n\n             As for the remaining four defendants, Uphoff offered no\n\nevidence against any of them except Blanes, the human resources\n\ndirector.     Uphoff merely showed that Blanes supported the PDP and\n\nadministered the agency-wide reclassification plan; he presented no\n\nevidence that she made decisions about Uphoff's reclassification.\n\nC.           The Jury Instructions and Special Verdict Form Were Not\n             an Abuse of Discretion and Uphoff Waived Any Challenge to\n             the Jury Verdict\n\n             Uphoff's case at trial, in the end, came down to First\n\nAmendment political discrimination (styled as equal protection)\n\n\n\n\n      12\n          Law 100 prohibits employment discrimination, including\nbecause of political affiliation. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146;\nBaralt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 251 F.3d 10, 15 n.6 (1st Cir.\n2001).   Uphoff sued under several Puerto Rican constitutional\nprovisions that also bar employment discrimination and retaliation.\nSee P.R. Const. art. II, §§ 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 16. Articles 1802 and\n1803 are derivative tort statutes that depend on \"the viability of\nthe underlying employment discrimination claim.\" Costa-Urena, 590\nF.3d at 30; see also P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141-42.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fclaims and retaliation claims against Alejandro and Vazquez.13     At\n\nthe charge conference, Uphoff offered a list of eleven incidents of\n\nwhat he alleged were discrimination and retaliation he had suffered\n\nat their hands.14    He primarily appeals the district court's\n\ndecision not to include that list in the jury instructions and\n\nspecial verdict form.\n\n1.        Jury Instructions\n\n          To   the   extent   Uphoff   is   challenging   the    jury\n\ninstructions, his argument fails.      We review de novo preserved\n\nclaims of legal error in jury instructions, but we review for abuse\n\nof discretion claimed errors in instructions' form or wording.\n\nGoodman v. Bowdoin Coll., 380 F.3d 33, 47 (1st Cir. 2004).      We ask\n\n\"whether the charge in its entirety--and in the context of the\n\nevidence--presented the relevant issues to the jury fairly and\n\nadequately.\"   Id.\n\n\n\n     13\n          The jury also rejected the remaining state law claims\nagainst Alejandro and Vazquez.\n     14\n          The parties dispute whether Uphoff preserved his\nobjections.     Uphoff preserved his objection to the jury\ninstructions on political retaliation; he asked the district court\nto use his list of eleven incidents in that instruction.\n     Uphoff arguably waived his objection to how the verdict form\npresented his political discrimination claims. He asked the court\nto include his list in question 7 but argues on appeal the court\nshould have included his list in question 6. Because question 6\ncontained materially identical language to question 7, we will\nassume arguendo that Uphoff preserved an objection to question 6.\n     Uphoff agrees he did not preserve his objection that the\nverdict form prevented the jury from reaching question 7 and\naccepts we must review it for plain error.\n\n                               -20-\n\f             The court did not abuse its discretion here.               Uphoff\n\nargues that the court erred when instructing the jury on his\n\nretaliation claim by including only three of the eleven items on\n\nhis list: that he was not assigned duties, that work assigned to\n\nhim was not complex, and that he was not invited to staff meetings.\n\nIt was not necessary for the court to instruct as to the minutiae\n\nof Uphoff's case, which might well have confused the jury or overly\n\nemphasized Uphoff's version of events. Uphoff's counsel had a full\n\nopportunity to argue every detail of his mistreatment claims.             The\n\ncourt's instructions accurately captured the law that plaintiffs\n\nmust show that working conditions were \"unreasonably inferior to\n\nthe norm for the position.\"        Bergeron v. Cabral, 560 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Estrada v. Rhode Island, No. 09-1149, 2010 WL 376978\n\n(1st Cir. Feb. 4, 2010), and Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).\n\n2.           Jury Special Verdict Form\n\n             We review preserved objections to special verdict forms\n\nfor abuse of discretion and objections not raised in the district\n\ncourt for plain error.          Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp.,\n\n147   F.3d    47,   53   (1st     Cir.     1998).   District   courts    have\n\n\"considerable discretion about the formulation, nature, and scope\n\nof the issues\" on a special verdict form.             9B Wright, Miller &\n\nKane, supra § 2506, at 119.        The form must \"present the case fairly\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fand accurately,\" id., and \"address all factual issues essential to\n\njudgment,\" Santos v. Posadas de P.R. Assocs., Inc., 452 F.3d 59, 65\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).       \"[W]e examine the court's instructions and the\n\nwording of the verdict form as a whole.\" Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-\n\nPujols, 375 F.3d 121, 134 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Uphoff objects to questions 6 and 7 of the form.               After\n\nquestion   5   asked   if   Uphoff   suffered    discriminatory      treatment\n\nbecause of his political views, question 6 asked whether\n\n           the removal of the keys to the main door of\n           the 6th floor, the moving and change of the\n           office to the 7th floor, and the instructions\n           to liquidate excess vacation leave were\n           nondiscriminatory        and     reasonable\n           administrative decisions based on [PREPA's]\n           needs to conduct its operations?\n\nThe verdict form then said that only if the jury answered \"no\"\n\ncould it consider, in question 7, whether PREPA's nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons were pretextual.\n\n           Question 6, Uphoff argues, (1) did not reflect his real\n\npoint, that these actions were discriminatory as they were applied\n\nto him; (2) should not have grouped all allegations together\n\nbecause the jury needed to consider each allegation separately; and\n\n(3) was incomplete and should have included his eleven points. The\n\ndistrict   court   correctly    instructed      the   jury   that   it   had   to\n\nconsider whether the defendants had a valid reason other than\n\nUphoff's political affiliation for their actions, and the court did\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fnot abuse its discretion by concluding that question 6 fairly\n\npresented this issue.\n\n          As   to   the   first    objection,   after     hearing   all    the\n\nevidence, the jury would have understood Uphoff's interpretation of\n\nthe events question 6 listed.        Second, the court did not need to\n\nseparately list each factual allegation for the jury to consider\n\nthe core legal issue. Third, given the many instances of purported\n\ndiscrimination   Uphoff   offered    at    trial,   the   jury   could    have\n\nunderstood this list was representative and was asking the larger,\n\nimportant question--whether the defendants had nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons for their conduct.\n\n          Uphoff did not preserve his objection that the verdict\n\nform prevented the jury from considering whether these reasons were\n\npretextual in question 7.         The jury may well have done this in\n\nquestion 6 after the court's instruction to consider whether the\n\ndefendants' justifications were pretextual. Uphoff cannot meet his\n\nburden to show plain error.15\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          Uphoff also argues the jury's discrimination verdict was\ninconsistent because it found he was treated differently because of\nhis political affiliation (in some undefined way) but found the\ndefendants' actions described were nondiscriminatory. Parties must\nobject that a jury verdict was inconsistent before the jury is\ndismissed to preserve that objection. E.g., Wennik v. Polygram\nGroup Distrib., Inc., 304 F.3d 123, 130 (1st Cir. 2002). Uphoff\ndoes not dispute that he did not object before the jury was\ndischarged, and this claim is waived.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fD.        The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by\n          Refusing to Grant a New Trial or Set Aside the Verdict\n\n          We review denials of motions for a new trial and motions\n\nto set aside a verdict for abuse of discretion and \"rarely\" reverse\n\ndistrict courts.     Jennings, 587 F.3d at 436-37 & n.7 (new trial);\n\nCigna Ins. Co. v. Oy Saunatec, Ltd., 241 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(set aside verdict). The trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n          Uphoff     argues    that    the     district   court    abused     its\n\ndiscretion    by   not   recognizing    that    errors    at   trial   with   the\n\ninstructions, verdict form, and verdict entitled him to a new\n\ntrial.   As we explained, the instructions and verdict form fairly\n\npresented the core issues.      The verdict was certainly not against\n\nthe weight of the evidence.      See Jennings, 587 F.3d at 436.\n\n          We affirm the district court's entry of judgment for all\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\f",

Cortes Cortes for the appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and STAHL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>A judge and a jury, between them, rejected all of the multitude of employment claims John Uphoff Figueroa, an environmental attorney, brought against his employer, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and at least seven PREPA officials. His basic theory, dressed in many garbs, was that the new Popular Democratic Party (PDP) regime discriminated against him by denying him a permanent appointment as the administrator of PREPA's environmental law office and by creating hostile working conditions because he was a member of the New Progressive Party (NPP). He alleges the NPP regime then retaliated against him after he filed a federal lawsuit in 2003. We find no merit to his claims and affirm.</p>\n<p>We hold as a matter of law under <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), and its progeny that the position of administrator is not within First Amendment protection because it is a policy position. PREPA officials could have considered political affiliation when deciding whether to give Uphoff the permanent position. Once again we remind litigants that political discrimination and retaliation claims under the First Amendment cannot be restated as claims under the Equal Protection Clause. And we hold that Uphoff did not state a claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) because he did not allege he was involved in FLSA-protected activity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Uphoff's suit, as amended in 2004, brought First Amendment and equal protection political discrimination claims; First Amendment retaliation claims; FLSA retaliation claims, 27 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3); Title VII retaliation claims, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a); civil rights conspiracy claims, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3);<sup>[1]</sup> and state constitutional and statutory claims.<sup>[2]</sup> He sued PREPA; two of his supervisors, Hector Alejandro Navarez and Nitza Vazquez Rodriguez; and other PREPA officials.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The trial court dismissed on the pleadings Uphoff's First Amendment discrimination claim that he was denied the position of administrator of the environmental law office, holding that political affiliation was a legitimate qualification for the job. <i>Uphoff-Figueroa v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.</i> (<i>Uphoff-Figueroa I</i>), No. 03-1509, 2005 WL 3095517, at *6-11 (D.P.R. Nov. 18, 2005). The court dismissed his political discrimination and retaliation claims against all defendants except Vazquez and Alejandro. <i>See id.</i> at *12-14. It dismissed his Title VII and civil rights conspiracy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*427</span> claims against all defendants, <i>id.</i> at *14-16, and his FLSA claim against PREPA, dismissing PREPA from the case, <i>Uphoff-Figueroa v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.</i> (<i>Uphoff-Figueroa II</i>), No. 09-1509, 2006 WL 1663537 (D.P.R. June 7, 2006). The court allowed Uphoff's FLSA and state law claims against all individual defendants to proceed to trial, and it allowed his political discrimination and retaliation claims against Alejandro and Vazquez to proceed to trial as well.</p>\n<p>After trial, the court granted judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), in favor of all defendants, including Alejandro and Vazquez, on Uphoff's FLSA claims and on one of his state law claims, under Puerto Rico Law 115 (Law 115). <i>Uphoff-Figueroa v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.</i> (<i>Uphoff-Figueroa III</i>), No. 09-1509, slip op. at 4-10 (D.P.R. Jun. 2, 2008). It also held Uphoff had not presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find the individual defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez liable on any of the remaining (state law) claims, and it dismissed those defendants from the case. <i>Id.</i> at 10-11.</p>\n<p>Only Alejandro and Vazquez were left in the case. Uphoff's remaining claims against them, for political discrimination and retaliation and for violations of state law, went to a jury. A jury rejected all of Uphoff's claims against Alejandro and Vazquez. The trial court denied his new trial motion for purported errors in the jury instructions and verdict form and his motion to amend the verdict.</p>\n<p>Uphoff appeals the court's dismissal of his claims on the pleadings, its grants of judgment as a matter of law, the jury instructions and verdict form, and the court's denial of his motion for a new trial or to amend the verdict. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In 1996, Uphoff started as principal environmental attorney at PREPA, a position just below the position of administrator of the environmental office. He handled the office's more complex cases. Just before the 2000 elections, he was temporarily appointed the administrator of the office.</p>\n<p>After the PDP took power in the 2000 elections, two PDP members, defendants Hector Alejandro and Nitza Vazquez, became Uphoff's supervisors. The environmental law office was moved to Alejandro's directorate in September 2001. In June 2002, Alejandro appointed Vazquez as administrator without allowing Uphoff to apply for the permanent position; Uphoff returned to being the principal attorney. Alejandro was promoted in September 2003 and no longer supervised Uphoff or Vazquez.</p>\n<p>Uphoff apparently claimed that Alejandro and Vazquez began a campaign to mistreat him because he was an NPP member.<sup>[4]</sup> He testified that they excluded him from meetings, blocked him from attending professional seminars, reduced his workload and responsibilities, and maligned him to other employees, destroying his relationships with his colleagues.</p>\n<p>Before he became Uphoff's supervisor, Alejandro's directorate often consulted the environmental law office, and Alejandro and Uphoff worked together. In early 2001, Uphoff and Alejandro already began disagreeing over how to handle several cases. Alejandro testified that Uphoff did not obtain approval before improperly awarding a $3.4 million contract, failed to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*428</span> timely negotiate a contract, and failed to send documents to federal authorities upon request.</p>\n<p>Uphoff, in turn, asserted that Alejandro and Vazquez limited his autonomy at work. They ordered him to arrive promptly at the start of business, 7:30 a.m. Uphoff sometimes credited hours he worked late to morning hours on his time sheet without obtaining prior permission to do so, as PREPA regulations required. Alejandro and Vazquez ordered him to accurately report his arrival time. Once Alejandro refused to sign a time sheet, after Uphoff missed a 10:00 a.m. conference call about a federal regulatory matter but reported on his sheet that he had arrived at 7:30 a.m.</p>\n<p>Uphoff also testified that Alejandro and Vazquez denied him vacation leave. Vazquez and Alejandro testified, however, that in 2002 PREPA began requiring all executive and managerial personnel to accept payment for vacation time in excess of 450 hours and that Uphoff refused to comply.</p>\n<p>Uphoff claimed that his immediate supervisor, Nitza Vazquez, tried to isolate him. In late 2003 Vazquez prevented Uphoff's secretary from using a computer to edit Uphoff's work. Vazquez also changed the locks to the environmental law office (then on the sixth floor) for security reasons. Uphoff claimed he was the only attorney not given a key; Vazquez, Alejandro, and other employees, however, testified that no attorneys were given keys. When the office later moved to the seventh floor, all attorneys, including Uphoff, were given keys.</p>\n<p>Uphoff testified that his position as principal attorney eroded in 2004 and 2005. As principal attorney, Uphoff was accustomed to having a larger office than the other lawyers. When the environmental law office moved floors in 2004, Uphoff tried to claim the second-largest office but was told it would become a conference room. He was left to choose among five identical, small offices designated for attorneys.</p>\n<p>In 2005 PREPA instituted an agency-wide reclassification plan, based on recommendations by an outside consultant, which made Uphoff and all the attorneys \"senior attorneys.\" The other attorneys received raises to match Uphoff's salary; Uphoff received no raise. Several of his colleagues received promotions even before the reclassification plan; the defendants offered nondiscriminatory reasons for those promotions.</p>\n<p>Uphoff attempted to tie all these incidents to political animus. He showed that Alejandro, Vazquez, and a few of the other individual defendants were PDP members but had little evidence they felt animosity toward NPP members. His secretary testified that Alejandro had told her the executive director of the agency was pressuring him to oust Uphoff. Uphoff also testified that Alejandro had said he, Alejandro, had experienced \"real\" discrimination when the NPP was in power.</p>\n<p>The defendants denied that Uphoff was mistreated and that his political affiliation made any difference. Vazquez testified that she gave Uphoff many complex cases and that she and Alejandro let Uphoff attend appropriate meetings and seminars. She explained that she only stripped him of cases after he failed to execute assignments. Alejandro admitted telling Uphoff and others that Uphoff was \"Machiavellic,\" after a particular incident in which he disapproved of what Uphoff had done. Otherwise, Alejandro, Vazquez, and other employees denied that Uphoff's supervisors undermined his work relationships.</p>\n<p>Alejandro and Vazquez testified that tensions arose because Uphoff was insubordinate, displayed a bad attitude, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*429</span> often lost his temper. They also testified that Uphoff never respected Nitza Vazquez's authority over him as the administrator, and Uphoff did not properly complete assignments that Vazquez assigned him. Alejandro testified that Uphoff did not work well with supervisors, colleagues, or state and federal agencies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The District Court Properly Dismissed Several of Uphoff's Claims under Rule 12(b)(6)</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Uphoff appeals the district court's dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of his First Amendment discrimination claim based on his removal as administrator; his FLSA, Title VII, and civil rights conspiracy claims; and his First Amendment retaliation claim against all defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We review a district court's decision dismissing claims under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, \"accepting as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff['s] favor.\" <i>Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist,</i> 584 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir.2009). \"[A] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[W]e may affirm on any basis apparent in the record.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Uphoff Stated No First Amendment Political Discrimination Claim as to the Position of Administrator</h2>\n<p>When a position is one for which political affiliation may be considered is a question of law for the courts. <i>Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> 140 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir. 1998). Whether or not Alejandro considered political affiliation when he replaced Uphoff with Vazquez as administrator, political affiliation was a permissible consideration for that position.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment does not bar public employers from considering political affiliation for positions for \"which political affiliation is an `appropriate requirement for ... effective performance.'\" <i>Galloza v. Foy,</i> 389 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287). The Supreme Court crafted this \"policymaking\" or \"position-of-trust\" exception because political officials must be able to hire staff who will help them execute their policy goalsand so effectuate voters' wishes. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Uphoff was not dismissed from, but rather was not appointed to, the permanent administrator's position. We have regularly upheld even \"the dismissal on political grounds of mid-or upper-level officials or employees who are significantly connected to policy-making,\" either as policymakers or by working closely with policymakers. <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 45. The official may be a subordinate and need not be \"the ultimate decisionmaker in the agency;\" \"it is enough that the official [is] <i>involved</i> in policy, even if only as an adviser, implementer, or spokesperson.\" <i>Id.</i> at 46 (internal citation omitted).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*430</span> \"Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions.\" <i>Olmeda v. Ortíz-Quiñónez,</i> 434 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.2006) (internal citation omitted).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The job description says the duty of the administrator of the environmental law office is to develop and formulate PREPA's legal strategy for all environmental law issues and cases and advise the legal advisor's office about that strategy. The administrator implements PREPA's policies by directing how the agency litigates and resolves cases. Candidates must have \"[e]xtensive knowledge of the general policy of the Authority.\"</p>\n<p>Also telling is that the administrator is subject only to \"general supervision\" and must exercise \"a high degree of ... independent judgment.\" The administrator meets with other PREPA officers and state and federal agencies, serves on relevant committees, and coordinates with other departments. And candidates must have a law degree, a license to practice, and experience practicing environmental law.</p>\n<p>In short, PREPA relies on the administrator to develop, understand, and execute its environmental-policy goals. Those policy goals may change with different administrations, and political affiliation is a relevant consideration.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Uphoff Stated No FLSA Retaliation Claim against the Defendants</h2>\n<p>The FLSA regulates certain adult employees' minimum wages and maximum hours. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. §§ 206-07. Uphoff's amended complaint purported to sue under § 215(a)(3), which prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who \"filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to\" the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*431</span> FLSA. Plaintiffs must prove (1) that they \"engaged in statutorily protected activity\" and (2) that their employers afterward took \"adverse employment action\" against them (3) \"as a reprisal for having engaged in the protected activity.\" <i>Claudio-Gotay v. Becton Dickinson Caribe, Ltd.,</i> 375 F.3d 99, 102 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Uphoff pled no facts supporting an FLSA retaliation claim because he did not allege that he engaged in protected activity.<sup>[9]</sup> That suffices to affirm the district court's dismissal of Uphoff's FLSA claims against PREPA under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Uphoff-Figueroa II,</i> 2006 WL 1663537, at *1.<sup>[10]</sup> For that reason, the dismissal of Uphoff's FLSA claims against all other defendants under Rule 50(a) was also appropriate. <i>Uphoff-Figueroa III,</i> slip op. at 3-7. Not only did Uphoff not plead such a claim, but he had no claim under the FLSA's wage and hours provisions. He pled he was lawyer for PREPA, and all of the jobs he held were within the \"learned professional\" exemption to the FLSA.<sup>[11]</sup><i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Title VII Retaliation Claims Were Properly Dismissed</h2>\n<p>Uphoff appeals the district court's dismissal of his Title VII retaliation claims against all defendants. Because plaintiffs may not bring Title VII suits against individual employees, <i>Fantini v. Salem State Coll.,</i> 557 F.3d 22, 28-31 (1st Cir.2009), the dismissal against all individual defendants was proper.</p>\n<p>The dismissal of Uphoff's claim against PREPA was also proper. Uphoff was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before suing in federal court, including by filing a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC). <i>Frederique-Alexandre v. Dep't of Natural &amp; Envtl. Res.,</i> 478 F.3d 433, 440 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Jorge v. Rumsfeld,</i> 404 F.3d 556, 564-65 (1st Cir.2005). Nothing in Uphoff's complaint or the record shows Uphoff ever filed any complaint with the EEOC, let alone any claim of retaliation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*432</span> 4. The Civil Rights Conspiracy Claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1985 Were Properly Dismissed</h2>\n<p>A plaintiff suing under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) must allege (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) the defendants had \"a conspiratorial purpose to deprive the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws,\" (3) the defendants committed an \"overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy,\" and (4) the plaintiff suffered \"injury to person or property, or a deprivation of a constitutionally protected right.\" <i>Perez-Sanchez v. Pub. Bldg. Auth.,</i> 531 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir.2008). Uphoff's complaint set forth no facts alleging a conspiracy. And he only alleged political discrimination, which is not actionable under § 1985(3). <i>Id.</i> at 109.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. The Dismissal of Uphoff's First Amendment Retaliation Claims against All Defendants Save Alejandro and Vazquez Was Proper</h2>\n<p>The dismissal of Uphoff's claims against all defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez that he suffered retaliatory adverse employment action for exercising his First Amendment right to file suit was proper. (And as for Alejandro and Vazquez, the jury found them not liable.) Plaintiffs may sue under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if they suffered adverse employment action after exercising their First Amendment rights. <i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see </i><i>Rosado-Quiñónes v. Toledo,</i> 528 F.3d 1, 5-7 (1st Cir.2008) (discussing the scope of public employees' right to petition). Plaintiffs must show they \"engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged adverse employment decision.\" <i>Welch v. Ciampa,</i> 542 F.3d 927, 936 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Assuming arguendo that Uphoff's filing his 2003 federal court complaint was protected activity, <i>see Rosado-Quinones,</i> 528 F.3d at 5-7, the 2004 amended complaint's factual allegations against the other defendants failed to connect them to his filing of the 2003 complaint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The District Court Properly Granted Judgment as a Matter of Law for All Defendants on Uphoff's Law 115 Claims and for All Remaining State Law Claims against the Defendants Save Alejandro and Vazquez</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The court granted JMOL on Uphoff's Law 115 claims against all the defendants and dismissed the other state law claims against all defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez. <i>Uphoff-Figueroa III,</i> at 4-9.</p>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's decision granting JMOL. <i>Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernandez,</i> 447 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.2006). Taking all inferences in favor of Uphoff, we review the evidence at trial and ask whether a reasonable jury could have found these defendants liable. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> 587 F.3d 430, 435-39 (1st Cir.2009). We may affirm the district court \"on any independently sufficient ground\" in the record. <i>Invest Almaz v. Temple-Inland Forest Prods. Corp.,</i> 243 F.3d 57, 75 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 172 (1st Cir. 1998)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. JMOL Was Properly Granted on State Law 115 Claims and Dismissal against Alejandro and Vazquez Was Otherwise Warranted</h2>\n<p>Puerto Rico Law 115 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees for \"offer[ing] or attempt[ing] to offer, verbally or in writing, any testimony, expression or information before a legislative, administrative or judicial forum in Puerto Rico.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*433</span> § 194a(a). Employees must establish they engaged in activity protected under Law 115 and then suffered discrimination at work. <i>Velez v. Janssen Ortho, LLC,</i> 467 F.3d 802, 809 (1st Cir.2006); <i>MVM, Inc. v. Rodriguez,</i> 568 F.Supp.2d 158, 176-77 (D.P.R.2008).</p>\n<p>Assuming arguendo that Law 115 applies to the filing of a federal court complaint in Puerto Rico, Uphoff presented no evidence, other than his evidence against Alejandro and Vazquez, that any of the individual defendants retaliated against him for filing the 2003 complaint.</p>\n<p>There is a different reason to affirm the ultimate dismissal of the Law 115 claims against Alejandro and Vazquez. An identical retaliation claim went to the jury under federal law, and the jury rejected Uphoff's claim of retaliation against Alejandro and Vazquez. In the special verdict asking whether Uphoff had suffered any retaliation after filing his 2003 complaint, the jury found he had not met his burden. Thus, even if there was error in entering JMOL on the Law 115 claims, it was harmless. <i>See </i><i>Molloy v. Blanchard,</i> 115 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir.1997) (holding that any error the district court committed in granting JMOL was harmless because it did not affect the plaintiff's damages); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Grazier ex rel. White v. City of Philadelphia,</i> 328 F.3d 120, 124 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding that any error in dismissing a claim on JMOL was harmless because the jury rejected a legal theory necessary to the claim); <i>Snyder v. Ag Trucking, Inc.,</i> 57 F.3d 484, 491 (6th Cir.1995) (same); 11 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 2888, at 479, 485 (2d ed.1995).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. JMOL Was Properly Granted on Other State Law Claims against Defendants Rosario, Rodriguez, Mendez, Blanes, and Hernandez</h2>\n<p>The only claims remaining against the defendants Rosario, Rodriguez, Blanes, Mendez, and Hernandez were state law claims under Law 100, articles 1802 and 1803, and Article II of the Puerto Rican constitution. We affirm the district court's dismissal of these claims. Uphoff did not present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find these defendants liable for discriminating or retaliating against him.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Uphoff presented no evidence that Rosario, PREPA's executive director, was involved in any activity Uphoff alleged was improper or even that Rosario knew Uphoff's political affiliation. The only evidence against Rosario was Uphoff's secretary's testimony that Alejandro told her the executive director was pressuring him to remove Uphoff. Even if true, without more, that evidence is insufficient to show retaliation or discrimination.</p>\n<p>As for the remaining four defendants, Uphoff offered no evidence against any of them except Blanes, the human resources director. Uphoff merely showed that Blanes supported the PDP and administered the agency-wide reclassification plan; he presented no evidence that she made decisions about Uphoff's reclassification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*434</span> C. <i>The Jury Instructions and Special Verdict Form Were Not an Abuse of Discretion and Uphoff Waived Any Challenge to the Jury Verdict</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Uphoff's case at trial, in the end, came down to First Amendment political discrimination (styled as equal protection) claims and retaliation claims against Alejandro and Vazquez.<sup>[13]</sup> At the charge conference, Uphoff offered a list of eleven incidents of what he alleged were discrimination and retaliation he had suffered at their hands.<sup>[14]</sup> He primarily appeals the district court's decision not to include that list in the jury instructions and special verdict form.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Jury Instructions</h2>\n<p>To the extent Uphoff is challenging the jury instructions, his argument fails. We review de novo preserved claims of legal error in jury instructions, but we review for abuse of discretion claimed errors in instructions' form or wording. <i>Goodman v. Bowdoin Coll.,</i> 380 F.3d 33, 47 (1st Cir.2004). We ask \"whether the charge in its entiretyand in the context of the evidencepresented the relevant issues to the jury fairly and adequately.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The court did not abuse its discretion here. Uphoff argues that the court erred when instructing the jury on his retaliation claim by including only three of the eleven items on his list: that he was not assigned duties, that work assigned to him was not complex, and that he was not invited to staff meetings. It was not necessary for the court to instruct as to the minutiae of Uphoff's case, which might well have confused the jury or overly emphasized Uphoff's version of events. Uphoff's counsel had a full opportunity to argue every detail of his mistreatment claims. The court's instructions accurately captured the law that plaintiffs must show that working conditions were \"unreasonably inferior to the norm for the position.\" <i>Bergeron v. Cabral,</i> 560 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Estrada v. Rhode Island,</i> 594 F.3d 56 (1st Cir.2010), <i>and </i><i>Maldonado v. Fontanes,</i> 568 F.3d 263 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Jury Special Verdict Form</h2>\n<p>We review preserved objections to special verdict forms for abuse of discretion and objections not raised in the district court for plain error. <i>Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp.,</i> 147 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.1998). District courts have \"considerable discretion about the formulation, nature, and scope of the issues\" on a special verdict form. 9B Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> § 2506, at 119. The form must \"present the case fairly and accurately,\" <i>id.,</i> and \"address all factual issues essential to judgment,\" <i>Santos v. Posadas De P.R. Assocs., Inc.,</i> 452 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.2006). \"[W]e examine the court's instructions and the wording of the verdict form as a whole.\" <i>Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 134 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*435</span> Uphoff objects to questions 6 and 7 of the form. After question 5 asked if Uphoff suffered discriminatory treatment because of his political views, question 6 asked whether</p>\n<blockquote>the removal of the keys to the main door of the 6th floor, the moving and change of the office to the 7th floor, and the instructions to liquidate excess vacation leave were nondiscriminatory and reasonable administrative decisions based on [PREPA's] needs to conduct its operations?</blockquote>\n<p>The verdict form then said that only if the jury answered \"no\" could it consider, in question 7, whether PREPA's nondiscriminatory reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p>Question 6, Uphoff argues, (1) did not reflect his real point, that these actions were discriminatory as they were applied to him; (2) should not have grouped all allegations together because the jury needed to consider each allegation separately; and (3) was incomplete and should have included his eleven points. The district court correctly instructed the jury that it had to consider whether the defendants had a valid reason other than Uphoff's political affiliation for their actions, and the court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that question 6 fairly presented this issue.</p>\n<p>As to the first objection, after hearing all the evidence, the jury would have understood Uphoff's interpretation of the events question 6 listed. Second, the court did not need to separately list each factual allegation for the jury to consider the core legal issue. Third, given the many instances of purported discrimination Uphoff offered at trial, the jury could have understood this list was representative and was asking the larger, important question whether the defendants had nondiscriminatory reasons for their conduct.</p>\n<p>Uphoff did not preserve his objection that the verdict form prevented the jury from considering whether these reasons were pretextual in question 7. The jury may well have done this in question 6 after the court's instruction to consider whether the defendants' justifications were pretextual. Uphoff cannot meet his burden to show plain error.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Refusing to Grant a New Trial or Set Aside the Verdict</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review denials of motions for a new trial and motions to set aside a verdict for abuse of discretion and \"rarely\" reverse district courts. <i>Jennings,</i> 587 F.3d at 436-37 &amp; n. 7 (new trial); <i>Cigna Ins. Co. v. Oy Saunatec, Ltd.,</i> 241 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2001) (set aside verdict). The trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p>Uphoff argues that the district court abused its discretion by not recognizing that errors at trial with the instructions, verdict form, and verdict entitled him to a new trial. As we explained, the instructions and verdict form fairly presented the core issues. The verdict was certainly not against the weight of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>Jennings,</i> 587 F.3d at 436.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the district court's entry of judgment for all defendants.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Uphoff also sued under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Ninth Amendment. He does not appeal the district court's dismissal of these claims. <i>See Uphoff-Figueroa v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth. (Uphoff-Figueroa I),</i> No. 03-1509, 2005 WL 3095517, at *12 (D.P.R. Nov. 18, 2005).</p>\n<p>[2]  Those claims were under Puerto Rico Law 100, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §§ 146 et seq., and Puerto Rico Law 115, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 194a; articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Code, P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 5141-42; and Article II, sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 16, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>[3]  Those officials were Maria Mendez Rivera, Maria Torrales Hernandez, Ana Blanes Rodriguez, Hector Rosario, Ramon Rodriguez Melendez, and several John Does.</p>\n<p>[4]  The briefs and trial transcript do not clearly explain how all of Uphoff's factual allegations supported his legal theories. We briefly recite his core factual claims as we understand them.</p>\n<p>[5]  Uphoff does not challenge the district court's dismissal of his Fourteenth Amendment political discrimination claims against all defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez or its ruling that res judicata barred several claims.</p>\n<p>[6]  \"Thus, we have upheld political discharges of the regional director of an administrative agency, the municipal secretary in a mayor's office, an officer in charge of human resources, a director of public relations, a superintendent of public works, a director of a city's federal programs office, and a director of a satellite office of the Massachusetts Secretary of State.\" <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 45; <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Ruiz-Casillas,</i> 415 F.3d at 132-33 (holding the second-ranking officer in a municipality's Federal Programs Division was a policymaker); <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 30-32 (holding the regional administrator for the state's municipal tax collection agency was a policymaker).</p>\n<p>[7]  Puerto Rico law classifies government positions as either \"career\" or \"trust.\" <i>Costa-Urena v. Segarra,</i> 590 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2009). \"Trust\" employees participate in policymaking and can be hired and fired on political grounds. <i>Id.</i> \"Career\" employees must be selected and terminated based on merit, not politics. <i>Id.</i> How Puerto Rico law classifies a position is not dispositive on whether the position is a policymaking one under the First Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho Morales,</i> 415 F.3d 127, 133 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>[8]  The mistreatment claims that proceeded to trial against Alejandro and Vazquez were improperly classified under the rubric of the Equal Protection Clause rather than the First Amendment. An equal protection claim alleging political discrimination merely restates a First Amendment political discrimination claim and, as we have said repeatedly, should have been considered under the First Amendment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Morales-Santiago v. Hernández-Pérez,</i> 488 F.3d 465, 471 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Pagán v. Calderon,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 36 (1st Cir. 2006). We discuss the disposition of those claims later.\n</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has held that plaintiffs can bring political discrimination claims based on employment action beyond hiring and firing, but it has not precisely articulated what actions qualify. <i>See </i><i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 64-65, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990). It is unclear under current law whether many incidents of mistreatment Uphoff has alleged qualify. <i>See id.</i> But we need not reach that question; Uphoff does not appeal the district court's ruling that he failed to plead sufficient facts supporting political discrimination claims against the defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez, and the jury rejected his claims against Alejandro and Vazquez.</p>\n<p>[9]  His original federal court complaint did not set forth a cause of action under the FLSA, and his amended complaint did not erase that problem by purporting to add a retaliation claim.\n</p>\n<p>In any event, as we explain below, the district court properly held that Uphoff presented no evidence showing the individual defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez were liable on any claim. And the jury found, in a special verdict in favor of Alejandro and Vazquez, that Uphoff did not suffer retaliation.</p>\n<p>[10]  Once the FLSA claim was dismissed, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims against PREPA. <i>Uphoff-Figueroa II,</i> 2006 WL 1663537, at *3. Uphoff asserts the district court erred by doing so, but he has waived this argument by failing to develop it any further in his brief. Regardless, a district court has discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction after dismissing \"all claims over which it ha[d] original jurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); <i>see also </i><i>Alvarez-Torres v. Ryder Mem. Hosp., Inc.,</i> 582 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[11]  The FLSA exempts from its wage and hours requirements, inter alia, \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity.\" 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1). Federal regulations define \"professional\" to include \"learned professionals\" and establish a three-part test to determine whether employees are \"learned professionals.\" <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 541.301(a). Employees must \"perform work requiring advanced knowledge.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.301(a), (b). That advanced knowledge \"must be in a field of science or learning,\" which \"includes the traditional professions of law, medicine, theology,\" and the like. <i>Id.</i> § 541.301(a), (c). And it \"must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction,\" generally an academic degree. <i>Id.</i> § 541.301(a), (d).</p>\n<p>[12]  Law 100 prohibits employment discrimination, including because of political affiliation. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146; <i>Baralt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 251 F.3d 10, 15 n. 6 (1st Cir.2001). Uphoff sued under several Puerto Rican constitutional provisions that also bar employment discrimination and retaliation. <i>See</i> P.R. Const. art. II, §§ 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 16. Articles 1802 and 1803 are derivative tort statutes that depend on \"the viability of the underlying employment discrimination claim.\" <i>Costa-Urena,</i> 590 F.3d at 30; <i>see also</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141-42.</p>\n<p>[13]  The jury also rejected the remaining state law claims against Alejandro and Vazquez.</p>\n<p>[14]  The parties dispute whether Uphoff preserved his objections. Uphoff preserved his objection to the jury instructions on political retaliation; he asked the district court to use his list of eleven incidents in that instruction.\n</p>\n<p>Uphoff arguably waived his objection to how the verdict form presented his political discrimination claims. He asked the court to include his list in question 7 but argues on appeal the court should have included his list in question 6. Because question 6 contained materially identical language to question 7, we will assume arguendo that Uphoff preserved an objection to question 6.</p>\n<p>Uphoff agrees he did not preserve his objection that the verdict form prevented the jury from reaching question 7 and accepts we must review it for plain error.</p>\n<p>[15]  Uphoff also argues the jury's discrimination verdict was inconsistent because it found he was treated differently because of his political affiliation (in some undefined way) but found the defendants' actions described were nondiscriminatory. Parties <i>must</i> object that a jury verdict was inconsistent before the jury is dismissed to preserve that objection. <i>E.g., </i><i>Wennik v. Polygram Group Distrib., Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 123, 130 (1st Cir.2002). Uphoff does not dispute that he did not object before the jury was discharged, and this claim is waived.</p>\n\n</div>",

His basic theory, dressed in many garbs, was that the new Popular Democratic Party (PDP) regime discriminated against him by denying him a permanent appointment as the administrator of PREPA's environmental law office and by creating hostile working conditions because he was a member of the New Progressive Party (NPP). He alleges the NPP regime then retaliated against him after he filed a federal lawsuit in 2003. We find no merit to his claims and affirm.</p>\n<p>We hold as a matter of law under <i>Branti v.

PREPA officials could have considered political affiliation when deciding whether to give Uphoff the permanent position. Once again we remind litigants that political discrimination and retaliation claims under the First Amendment cannot be restated as claims under the Equal Protection Clause. And we hold that Uphoff did not state a claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) because he did not allege he was involved in FLSA-protected activity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Uphoff's suit, as amended in 2004, brought First Amendment and equal protection political discrimination claims; First Amendment retaliation claims; FLSA retaliation claims, 27 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3); Title VII retaliation claims, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a); civil rights conspiracy claims, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3);<sup>[1]</sup> and state constitutional and statutory claims.<sup>[2]</sup> He sued PREPA; two of his supervisors, Hector Alejandro Navarez and Nitza Vazquez Rodriguez; and other PREPA officials.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The trial court dismissed on the pleadings Uphoff's First Amendment discrimination claim that he was denied the position of administrator of the environmental law office, holding that political affiliation was a legitimate qualification for the job. <i>Uphoff-Figueroa v.

Nov. 18, 2005). The court dismissed his political discrimination and retaliation claims against all defendants except Vazquez and Alejandro. <i>See id.</i> at *12-14. It dismissed his Title VII and civil rights conspiracy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*427</span> claims against all defendants, <i>id.</i> at *14-16, and his FLSA claim against PREPA, dismissing PREPA from the case, <i>Uphoff-Figueroa v.

The court allowed Uphoff's FLSA and state law claims against all individual defendants to proceed to trial, and it allowed his political discrimination and retaliation claims against Alejandro and Vazquez to proceed to trial as well.</p>\n<p>After trial, the court granted judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), in favor of all defendants, including Alejandro and Vazquez, on Uphoff's FLSA claims and on one of his state law claims, under Puerto Rico Law 115 (Law 115). <i>Uphoff-Figueroa v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.</i> (<i>Uphoff-Figueroa III</i>), No. 09-1509, slip op. at 4-10 (D.P.R. Jun. 2, 2008). It also held Uphoff had not presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find the individual defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez liable on any of the remaining (state law) claims, and it dismissed those defendants from the case. <i>Id.</i> at 10-11.</p>\n<p>Only Alejandro and Vazquez were left in the case. Uphoff's remaining claims against them, for political discrimination and retaliation and for violations of state law, went to a jury. A jury rejected all of Uphoff's claims against Alejandro and Vazquez. The trial court denied his new trial motion for purported errors in the jury instructions and verdict form and his motion to amend the verdict.</p>\n<p>Uphoff appeals the court's dismissal of his claims on the pleadings, its grants of judgment as a matter of law, the jury instructions and verdict form, and the court's denial of his motion for a new trial or to amend the verdict. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In 1996, Uphoff started as principal environmental attorney at PREPA, a position just below the position of administrator of the environmental office. He handled the office's more complex cases. Just before the 2000 elections, he was temporarily appointed the administrator of the office.</p>\n<p>After the PDP took power in the 2000 elections, two PDP members, defendants Hector Alejandro and Nitza Vazquez, became Uphoff's supervisors. The environmental law office was moved to Alejandro's directorate in September 2001. In June 2002, Alejandro appointed Vazquez as administrator without allowing Uphoff to apply for the permanent position; Uphoff returned to being the principal attorney. Alejandro was promoted in September 2003 and no longer supervised Uphoff or Vazquez.</p>\n<p>Uphoff apparently claimed that Alejandro and Vazquez began a campaign to mistreat him because he was an NPP member.<sup>[4]</sup> He testified that they excluded him from meetings, blocked him from attending professional seminars, reduced his workload and responsibilities, and maligned him to other employees, destroying his relationships with his colleagues.</p>\n<p>Before he became Uphoff's supervisor, Alejandro's directorate often consulted the environmental law office, and Alejandro and Uphoff worked together. In early 2001, Uphoff and Alejandro already began disagreeing over how to handle several cases. Alejandro testified that Uphoff did not obtain approval before improperly awarding a $3.4 million contract, failed to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*428</span> timely negotiate a contract, and failed to send documents to federal authorities upon request.</p>\n<p>Uphoff, in turn, asserted that Alejandro and Vazquez limited his autonomy at work. They ordered him to arrive promptly at the start of business, 7:30 a.m. Uphoff sometimes credited hours he worked late to morning hours on his time sheet without obtaining prior permission to do so, as PREPA regulations required. Alejandro and Vazquez ordered him to accurately report his arrival time. Once Alejandro refused to sign a time sheet, after Uphoff missed a 10:00 a.m. conference call about a federal regulatory matter but reported on his sheet that he had arrived at 7:30 a.m.</p>\n<p>Uphoff also testified that Alejandro and Vazquez denied him vacation leave. Vazquez and Alejandro testified, however, that in 2002 PREPA began requiring all executive and managerial personnel to accept payment for vacation time in excess of 450 hours and that Uphoff refused to comply.</p>\n<p>Uphoff claimed that his immediate supervisor, Nitza Vazquez, tried to isolate him. In late 2003 Vazquez prevented Uphoff's secretary from using a computer to edit Uphoff's work. Vazquez also changed the locks to the environmental law office (then on the sixth floor) for security reasons. Uphoff claimed he was the only attorney not given a key; Vazquez, Alejandro, and other employees, however, testified that no attorneys were given keys. When the office later moved to the seventh floor, all attorneys, including Uphoff, were given keys.</p>\n<p>Uphoff testified that his position as principal attorney eroded in 2004 and 2005. As principal attorney, Uphoff was accustomed to having a larger office than the other lawyers. When the environmental law office moved floors in 2004, Uphoff tried to claim the second-largest office but was told it would become a conference room. He was left to choose among five identical, small offices designated for attorneys.</p>\n<p>In 2005 PREPA instituted an agency-wide reclassification plan, based on recommendations by an outside consultant, which made Uphoff and all the attorneys \"senior attorneys.\" The other attorneys received raises to match Uphoff's salary; Uphoff received no raise. Several of his colleagues received promotions even before the reclassification plan; the defendants offered nondiscriminatory reasons for those promotions.</p>\n<p>Uphoff attempted to tie all these incidents to political animus. He showed that Alejandro, Vazquez, and a few of the other individual defendants were PDP members but had little evidence they felt animosity toward NPP members. His secretary testified that Alejandro had told her the executive director of the agency was pressuring him to oust Uphoff. Uphoff also testified that Alejandro had said he, Alejandro, had experienced \"real\" discrimination when the NPP was in power.</p>\n<p>The defendants denied that Uphoff was mistreated and that his political affiliation made any difference. Vazquez testified that she gave Uphoff many complex cases and that she and Alejandro let Uphoff attend appropriate meetings and seminars. She explained that she only stripped him of cases after he failed to execute assignments. Alejandro admitted telling Uphoff and others that Uphoff was \"Machiavellic,\" after a particular incident in which he disapproved of what Uphoff had done. Otherwise, Alejandro, Vazquez, and other employees denied that Uphoff's supervisors undermined his work relationships.</p>\n<p>Alejandro and Vazquez testified that tensions arose because Uphoff was insubordinate, displayed a bad attitude, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*429</span> often lost his temper. They also testified that Uphoff never respected Nitza Vazquez's authority over him as the administrator, and Uphoff did not properly complete assignments that Vazquez assigned him. Alejandro testified that Uphoff did not work well with supervisors, colleagues, or state and federal agencies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The District Court Properly Dismissed Several of Uphoff's Claims under Rule 12(b)(6)</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Uphoff appeals the district court's dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of his First Amendment discrimination claim based on his removal as administrator; his FLSA, Title VII, and civil rights conspiracy claims; and his First Amendment retaliation claim against all defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We review a district court's decision dismissing claims under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, \"accepting as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff['s] favor.\" <i>Sutliffe v.

Uphoff Stated No First Amendment Political Discrimination Claim as to the Position of Administrator</h2>\n<p>When a position is one for which political affiliation may be considered is a question of law for the courts. <i>Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197945\"><a href=\"/opinion/197945/flynn-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir. 1998). Whether or not Alejandro considered political affiliation when he replaced Uphoff with Vazquez as administrator, political affiliation was a permissible consideration for that position.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment does not bar public employers from considering political affiliation for positions for \"which political affiliation is an `appropriate requirement for ... effective performance.'\" <i>Galloza v. Foy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201328\"><a href=\"/opinion/201328/galloza-gonzalez-v-foy/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 518, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></a></span>). The Supreme Court crafted this \"policymaking\" or \"position-of-trust\" exception because political officials must be able to hire staff who will help them execute their policy goalsand so effectuate voters' wishes. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Uphoff was not dismissed from, but rather was not appointed to, the permanent administrator's position. We have regularly upheld even \"the dismissal on political grounds of mid-or upper-level officials or employees who are significantly connected to policy-making,\" either as policymakers or by working closely with policymakers. <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 45. The official may be a subordinate and need not be \"the ultimate decisionmaker in the agency;\" \"it is enough that the official [is] <i>involved</i> in policy, even if only as an adviser, implementer, or spokesperson.\" <i>Id.</i> at 46 (internal citation omitted).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*430</span> \"Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions.\" <i>Olmeda v.

The administrator implements PREPA's policies by directing how the agency litigates and resolves cases. Candidates must have \"[e]xtensive knowledge of the general policy of the Authority.\"</p>\n<p>Also telling is that the administrator is subject only to \"general supervision\" and must exercise \"a high degree of ... independent judgment.\" The administrator meets with other PREPA officers and state and federal agencies, serves on relevant committees, and coordinates with other departments. And candidates must have a law degree, a license to practice, and experience practicing environmental law.</p>\n<p>In short, PREPA relies on the administrator to develop, understand, and execute its environmental-policy goals. Those policy goals may change with different administrations, and political affiliation is a relevant consideration.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Uphoff Stated No FLSA Retaliation Claim against the Defendants</h2>\n<p>The FLSA regulates certain adult employees' minimum wages and maximum hours. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. §§ 206-07. Uphoff's amended complaint purported to sue under § 215(a)(3), which prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who \"filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to\" the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*431</span> FLSA. Plaintiffs must prove (1) that they \"engaged in statutorily protected activity\" and (2) that their employers afterward took \"adverse employment action\" against them (3) \"as a reprisal for having engaged in the protected activity.\" <i>Claudio-Gotay v. Becton Dickinson Caribe, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201121\"><a href=\"/opinion/201121/claudio-gotay-v-beckton-dickinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Uphoff pled no facts supporting an FLSA retaliation claim because he did not allege that he engaged in protected activity.<sup>[9]</sup> That suffices to affirm the district court's dismissal of Uphoff's FLSA claims against PREPA under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Uphoff-Figueroa II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1663537</span></span>, at *1.<sup>[10]</sup> For that reason, the dismissal of Uphoff's FLSA claims against all other defendants under Rule 50(a) was also appropriate. <i>Uphoff-Figueroa III,</i> slip op. at 3-7. Not only did Uphoff not plead such a claim, but he had no claim under the FLSA's wage and hours provisions. He pled he was lawyer for PREPA, and all of the jobs he held were within the \"learned professional\" exemption to the FLSA.<sup>[11]</sup><i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Title VII Retaliation Claims Were Properly Dismissed</h2>\n<p>Uphoff appeals the district court's dismissal of his Title VII retaliation claims against all defendants. Because plaintiffs may not bring Title VII suits against individual employees, <i>Fantini v. Salem State Coll.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433879\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433879/fantini-v-salem-state-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 28-31 (1st Cir.2009), the dismissal against all individual defendants was proper.</p>\n<p>The dismissal of Uphoff's claim against PREPA was also proper.

An identical retaliation claim went to the jury under federal law, and the jury rejected Uphoff's claim of retaliation against Alejandro and Vazquez. In the special verdict asking whether Uphoff had suffered any retaliation after filing his 2003 complaint, the jury found he had not met his burden. Thus, even if there was error in entering JMOL on the Law 115 claims, it was harmless. <i>See </i><i>Molloy v.

JMOL Was Properly Granted on Other State Law Claims against Defendants Rosario, Rodriguez, Mendez, Blanes, and Hernandez</h2>\n<p>The only claims remaining against the defendants Rosario, Rodriguez, Blanes, Mendez, and Hernandez were state law claims under Law 100, articles 1802 and 1803, and Article II of the Puerto Rican constitution. We affirm the district court's dismissal of these claims. Uphoff did not present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find these defendants liable for discriminating or retaliating against him.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Uphoff presented no evidence that Rosario, PREPA's executive director, was involved in any activity Uphoff alleged was improper or even that Rosario knew Uphoff's political affiliation. The only evidence against Rosario was Uphoff's secretary's testimony that Alejandro told her the executive director was pressuring him to remove Uphoff. Even if true, without more, that evidence is insufficient to show retaliation or discrimination.</p>\n<p>As for the remaining four defendants, Uphoff offered no evidence against any of them except Blanes, the human resources director. Uphoff merely showed that Blanes supported the PDP and administered the agency-wide reclassification plan; he presented no evidence that she made decisions about Uphoff's reclassification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*434</span> C. <i>The Jury Instructions and Special Verdict Form Were Not an Abuse of Discretion and Uphoff Waived Any Challenge to the Jury Verdict</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Uphoff's case at trial, in the end, came down to First Amendment political discrimination (styled as equal protection) claims and retaliation claims against Alejandro and Vazquez.<sup>[13]</sup> At the charge conference, Uphoff offered a list of eleven incidents of what he alleged were discrimination and retaliation he had suffered at their hands.<sup>[14]</sup> He primarily appeals the district court's decision not to include that list in the jury instructions and special verdict form.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Jury Instructions</h2>\n<p>To the extent Uphoff is challenging the jury instructions, his argument fails. We review de novo preserved claims of legal error in jury instructions, but we review for abuse of discretion claimed errors in instructions' form or wording. <i>Goodman v. Bowdoin Coll.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201198\"><a href=\"/opinion/201198/goodman-v-bowdoin-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2004). We ask \"whether the charge in its entiretyand in the context of the evidencepresented the relevant issues to the jury fairly and adequately.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The court did not abuse its discretion here. Uphoff argues that the court erred when instructing the jury on his retaliation claim by including only three of the eleven items on his list: that he was not assigned duties, that work assigned to him was not complex, and that he was not invited to staff meetings. It was not necessary for the court to instruct as to the minutiae of Uphoff's case, which might well have confused the jury or overly emphasized Uphoff's version of events. Uphoff's counsel had a full opportunity to argue every detail of his mistreatment claims. The court's instructions accurately captured the law that plaintiffs must show that working conditions were \"unreasonably inferior to the norm for the position.\" <i>Bergeron v. Cabral,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203715\"><a href=\"/opinion/203715/bergeron-v-cabral/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Estrada v.

Jury Special Verdict Form</h2>\n<p>We review preserved objections to special verdict forms for abuse of discretion and objections not raised in the district court for plain error. <i>Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198029\"><a href=\"/opinion/198029/little-inc-v-dooyang/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.1998). District courts have \"considerable discretion about the formulation, nature, and scope of the issues\" on a special verdict form. 9B Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> § 2506, at 119. The form must \"present the case fairly and accurately,\" <i>id.,</i> and \"address all factual issues essential to judgment,\" <i>Santos v. Posadas De P.R. Assocs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202293\"><a href=\"/opinion/202293/santos-v-wyndham-condado/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2006). \"[W]e examine the court's instructions and the wording of the verdict form as a whole.\" <i>Sanchez-Lopez v.

After question 5 asked if Uphoff suffered discriminatory treatment because of his political views, question 6 asked whether</p>\n<blockquote>the removal of the keys to the main door of the 6th floor, the moving and change of the office to the 7th floor, and the instructions to liquidate excess vacation leave were nondiscriminatory and reasonable administrative decisions based on [PREPA's] needs to conduct its operations?</blockquote>\n<p>The verdict form then said that only if the jury answered \"no\" could it consider, in question 7, whether PREPA's nondiscriminatory reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p>Question 6, Uphoff argues, (1) did not reflect his real point, that these actions were discriminatory as they were applied to him; (2) should not have grouped all allegations together because the jury needed to consider each allegation separately; and (3) was incomplete and should have included his eleven points. The district court correctly instructed the jury that it had to consider whether the defendants had a valid reason other than Uphoff's political affiliation for their actions, and the court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that question 6 fairly presented this issue.</p>\n<p>As to the first objection, after hearing all the evidence, the jury would have understood Uphoff's interpretation of the events question 6 listed. Second, the court did not need to separately list each factual allegation for the jury to consider the core legal issue. Third, given the many instances of purported discrimination Uphoff offered at trial, the jury could have understood this list was representative and was asking the larger, important question whether the defendants had nondiscriminatory reasons for their conduct.</p>\n<p>Uphoff did not preserve his objection that the verdict form prevented the jury from considering whether these reasons were pretextual in question 7. The jury may well have done this in question 6 after the court's instruction to consider whether the defendants' justifications were pretextual. Uphoff cannot meet his burden to show plain error.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Refusing to Grant a New Trial or Set Aside the Verdict</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review denials of motions for a new trial and motions to set aside a verdict for abuse of discretion and \"rarely\" reverse district courts. <i>Jennings,</i> 587 F.3d at 436-37 &amp; n. 7 (new trial); <i>Cigna Ins.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p>Uphoff argues that the district court abused its discretion by not recognizing that errors at trial with the instructions, verdict form, and verdict entitled him to a new trial. As we explained, the instructions and verdict form fairly presented the core issues. The verdict was certainly not against the weight of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>Jennings,</i> 587 F.3d at 436.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the district court's entry of judgment for all defendants.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Uphoff also sued under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Ninth Amendment. He does not appeal the district court's dismissal of these claims. <i>See Uphoff-Figueroa v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.

Nov. 18, 2005).</p>\n<p>[2]  Those claims were under Puerto Rico Law 100, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §§ 146 et seq., and Puerto Rico Law 115, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 194a; articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Code, P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 5141-42; and Article II, sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 16, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>[3]  Those officials were Maria Mendez Rivera, Maria Torrales Hernandez, Ana Blanes Rodriguez, Hector Rosario, Ramon Rodriguez Melendez, and several John Does.</p>\n<p>[4]  The briefs and trial transcript do not clearly explain how all of Uphoff's factual allegations supported his legal theories. We briefly recite his core factual claims as we understand them.</p>\n<p>[5]  Uphoff does not challenge the district court's dismissal of his Fourteenth Amendment political discrimination claims against all defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez or its ruling that res judicata barred several claims.</p>\n<p>[6]  \"Thus, we have upheld political discharges of the regional director of an administrative agency, the municipal secretary in a mayor's office, an officer in charge of human resources, a director of public relations, a superintendent of public works, a director of a city's federal programs office, and a director of a satellite office of the Massachusetts Secretary of State.\" <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 45; <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Ruiz-Casillas,</i> 415 F.3d at 132-33 (holding the second-ranking officer in a municipality's Federal Programs Division was a policymaker); <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 30-32 (holding the regional administrator for the state's municipal tax collection agency was a policymaker).</p>\n<p>[7]  Puerto Rico law classifies government positions as either \"career\" or \"trust.\" <i>Costa-Urena v. Segarra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204113\"><a href=\"/opinion/204113/costa-urena-v-segarra/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 2009). \"Trust\" employees participate in policymaking and can be hired and fired on political grounds. <i>Id.</i> \"Career\" employees must be selected and terminated based on merit, not politics. <i>Id.</i> How Puerto Rico law classifies a position is not dispositive on whether the position is a policymaking one under the First Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho Morales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201665\"><a href=\"/opinion/201665/ruiz-casillas-v-camacho-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 133 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>[8]  The mistreatment claims that proceeded to trial against Alejandro and Vazquez were improperly classified under the rubric of the Equal Protection Clause rather than the First Amendment. An equal protection claim alleging political discrimination merely restates a First Amendment political discrimination claim and, as we have said repeatedly, should have been considered under the First Amendment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Morales-Santiago v. Hernández-Pérez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202752\"><a href=\"/opinion/202752/morales-santiago-v-hernandez-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 471 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Pagán v.

We discuss the disposition of those claims later.\n</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has held that plaintiffs can bring political discrimination claims based on employment action beyond hiring and firing, but it has not precisely articulated what actions qualify. <i>See </i><i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 64-65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span> (1990). It is unclear under current law whether many incidents of mistreatment Uphoff has alleged qualify. <i>See id.</i> But we need not reach that question; Uphoff does not appeal the district court's ruling that he failed to plead sufficient facts supporting political discrimination claims against the defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez, and the jury rejected his claims against Alejandro and Vazquez.</p>\n<p>[9]  His original federal court complaint did not set forth a cause of action under the FLSA, and his amended complaint did not erase that problem by purporting to add a retaliation claim.\n</p>\n<p>In any event, as we explain below, the district court properly held that Uphoff presented no evidence showing the individual defendants except Alejandro and Vazquez were liable on any claim. And the jury found, in a special verdict in favor of Alejandro and Vazquez, that Uphoff did not suffer retaliation.</p>\n<p>[10]  Once the FLSA claim was dismissed, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims against PREPA. <i>Uphoff-Figueroa II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1663537</span></span>, at *3. Uphoff asserts the district court erred by doing so, but he has waived this argument by failing to develop it any further in his brief. Regardless, a district court has discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction after dismissing \"all claims over which it ha[d] original jurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); <i>see also </i><i>Alvarez-Torres v.

Federal regulations define \"professional\" to include \"learned professionals\" and establish a three-part test to determine whether employees are \"learned professionals.\" <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 541.301(a). Employees must \"perform work requiring advanced knowledge.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.301(a), (b). That advanced knowledge \"must be in a field of science or learning,\" which \"includes the traditional professions of law, medicine, theology,\" and the like. <i>Id.</i> § 541.301(a), (c). And it \"must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction,\" generally an academic degree. <i>Id.</i> § 541.301(a), (d).</p>\n<p>[12]  Law 100 prohibits employment discrimination, including because of political affiliation.

Uphoff preserved his objection to the jury instructions on political retaliation; he asked the district court to use his list of eleven incidents in that instruction.\n</p>\n<p>Uphoff arguably waived his objection to how the verdict form presented his political discrimination claims. He asked the court to include his list in question 7 but argues on appeal the court should have included his list in question 6. Because question 6 contained materially identical language to question 7, we will assume arguendo that Uphoff preserved an objection to question 6.</p>\n<p>Uphoff agrees he did not preserve his objection that the verdict form prevented the jury from reaching question 7 and accepts we must review it for plain error.</p>\n<p>[15]  Uphoff also argues the jury's discrimination verdict was inconsistent because it found he was treated differently because of his political affiliation (in some undefined way) but found the defendants' actions described were nondiscriminatory. Parties <i>must</i> object that a jury verdict was inconsistent before the jury is dismissed to preserve that objection. <i>E.g., </i><i>Wennik v. Polygram Group Distrib., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200122\"><a href=\"/opinion/200122/wennik-v-polygram-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2002). Uphoff does not dispute that he did not object before the jury was discharged, and this claim is waived.</p>\n\n</div>",
