ALLI,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n             APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n             [Hon. Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n          Kevin J. Fitzgerald, Assistant Federal Defender, for\nappellant.\n          Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Zechariah Chafee, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nRobert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                            April 7, 2006\n\f           STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.   Oladimeji Alli, a former\n\nemployee of the United States Postal Service, pleaded guilty to\n\nmail theft after he was caught stealing letters containing credit\n\ncards.    Alli admitted that he had intended to send the cards to a\n\ncontact in the Netherlands in exchange for money. He was sentenced\n\nto 21 months in prison.      In this appeal, Alli raises several\n\nchallenges to the way his sentence was calculated.    After careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm the sentence.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           In December 2003, Alli was a temporary employee at a\n\nbranch of the United States Post Office in Providence, Rhode\n\nIsland.    His duties included sorting bulk mail.   On December 30,\n\n2003, Alli dropped off a package, addressed to a destination in the\n\nNetherlands, at a United Parcel Service (UPS) facility in Warwick,\n\nRhode Island.   Finding the package suspicious, UPS workers opened\n\nit, discovered nine credit cards in nine different names, and then\n\ncalled the state police.     The police, in turn, called the post\n\noffice where Alli worked to inquire about Alli, whose return\n\naddress was on the Netherlands-bound package.        Postal Service\n\ninspectors began watching Alli at work, and in January 2004 they\n\nsaw him take letters from a mail tray and hide them.       Two days\n\nlater, an inspector placed about 25 letters containing credit cards\n\nonto Alli's mail tray.    While the inspectors watched and a video\n\ncamera recorded, Alli pocketed two letters containing credit cards.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fMoments later, an inspector confronted Alli and escorted him to a\n\nconference room where police officers were waiting.\n\n           After receiving Miranda warnings, Alli admitted stealing\n\nthe two letters with the intention to take credit cards from them.\n\nHe also admitted that he had stolen the nine credit cards found in\n\nthe UPS package by removing them from letters he had taken from\n\nmail trays with the intention of sending the purloined cards to\n\ncontacts in the Netherlands, who had promised to pay him for the\n\ncards.1   In a later search of Alli's apartment, the police found\n\nstill another credit card, which Alli also admitted to having\n\nstolen.   In April 2004, Alli was charged with postal theft in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1709.   He pleaded guilty and was sentenced\n\nin April 20052 to 21 months in prison.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The parties dispute whether Alli was to receive $150 for each\ncredit card he passed along to his contacts, or whether he would\nget a single $150 payment for all the cards. Alli maintains, and\nthe prosecution version of the facts in the Pre-Sentence\nInvestigation Report implies, that Alli was to receive $150 for all\nof the cards. However, at Alli's sentencing hearing, the district\ncourt noted twice, without objection, that Alli was expecting $150\nper card. For reasons discussed later in this opinion, we conclude\nthat it makes no difference whether Alli would have received\nupwards of $1000 or only $150 for the credit cards he stole.\n     2\n      The sentencing had originally been scheduled for October\n2004, but the district court postponed the hearing until December\nin the hope that the Supreme Court would decide the pending case of\nUnited States v. Booker. In December, the judge allowed Alli to\nwithdraw his guilty plea for reasons not bearing on this appeal.\nAlli subsequently pleaded guilty again to the same charge and was\nultimately sentenced in April 2005. Booker had been decided on\nJanuary 12, 2005.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            The   district   judge     presiding    over    Alli's      sentencing\n\nhearing    understood   that    he    was     operating    under   an     advisory\n\nGuidelines system.3      To calculate the sentence, he began with a\n\nbase offense level of six,4 to which he added an eight-level\n\nenhancement pursuant to USSG § 2B1.1(b)(1)(E) because the loss\n\noccasioned by Alli's offense was more than $70,000 but less than\n\n$120,000.     The judge then added a separate two-level enhancement\n\nafter concluding that Alli's offense involved \"the production or\n\ntrafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access\n\ndevice.\"    § 2B1.1(b)(9)(B).         On appeal, Alli contests the eight-\n\nlevel enhancement, arguing that the district court improperly\n\ncalculated the amount of financial loss caused by his offense.                    He\n\nalso challenges the two-level enhancement on the ground that §\n\n2B1.1(b)(9)(B) does not simply require \"trafficking\" in a general\n\nsense, but rather the violation of a specific federal statute\n\ncriminalizing     the   trafficking      of    credit     cards,   18    U.S.C.    §\n\n1029(e)(5).       Finally,     Alli     contends    that     his   sentence       is\n\nunreasonable and therefore must be vacated under the post-Booker\n\n\"reasonableness\" standard of review.\n\n\n     3\n      The judge stated, \"[A]s in all sentences since Booker, it's\na two-step process.    The first step is to determine what the\nsentence would be under the guidelines, and since Booker makes it\nclear that the guidelines are now advisory, the second step is to\ndetermine what a reasonable sentence would be under the statute,\nunder [§] 3553(a), I believe it is.\"\n     4\n      Both the probation office and the district court relied on\nthe November 2003 version of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f                                           II.\n\n                We    review     a    district    court's       interpretation      and\n\napplication of the federal Sentencing Guidelines de novo, United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2005), but review the\n\ncourt's related factual findings, including its calculation of loss\n\namount, for clear error.              See United States v. Flores-Seda, 423\n\nF.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nA. Amount of Loss\n\n                Section 2B1.1(b)(1) calls for a sentencing court to\n\nincrease an offender's offense level in larceny and theft cases\n\naccording to the amount of loss resulting from the offense.                          An\n\napplication note to that guideline states that \"loss is the greater\n\nof actual loss or intended loss.\"            § 2B1.1, cmt. n.3(A).          All agree\n\nthat       no   actual    loss   occurred   as    a    result      of   Alli's   theft.\n\nTherefore, the district court calculated intended loss and did so\n\nby adding together the credit limits of the stolen credit cards,\n\narriving        at   a   total   of   $88,500.5       This   was    the   same   amount\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      It appears that of the twelve credit cards Alli stole (nine\nin the UPS package, two at the post office, and one found in his\napartment), the credit limits of only eight or nine cards were used\nto calculate the intended loss. The record does not reveal why\nthis is so.\n     It is also worth noting that Alli was only charged with, and\nonly pled guilty to, theft of the two credit cards with which he\nwas caught by investigators at the post office. Counsel for Alli\nargued below that it was only appropriate to count the credit\nlimits of those two cards when assessing loss, but the district\ncourt disagreed and Alli does not press the question on appeal.\n\n                                           -5-\n\frecommended by the probation officer who prepared Alli's Pre-\n\nSentence Investigation Report (PSR).\n\n          Alli timely objected to the loss calculation in the PSR\n\nand renewed his objection at his sentencing hearing.   The crux of\n\nhis objection is that because there is no evidence that he himself\n\nclearly intended to use the card, the amount of loss should be\n\nlimited to $500 per card pursuant to Application Note 3(F) to\n\nGuideline 2B1.1.    That note states, \"In a case involving any\n\ncounterfeit access device or unauthorized access device, loss\n\nincludes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit access\n\ndevice or unauthorized access device and shall not be less than\n\n$500 per access device.\"   § 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(F)(i).\n\n          The district court, however, found it of no importance\n\nthat Alli did not intend to use the cards to their full limit or\n\nindeed at all.   Rather, the court found that Alli sold the cards\n\nknowing they would be used for unlawful gain and concluded that\n\nAlli therefore had a reasonable expectation, if not knowledge, that\n\nthe cards would be used to the fullest extent possible.   This was\n\nenough, the court determined, to demonstrate intended loss.6    We\n\nmust therefore decide whether a loss that an offender knows will\n\noccur, or should reasonably expect to occur, as a direct result of\n\n\n\n     6\n      At the sentencing hearing, the government agreed with Alli\nthat there was no intended loss. The district court thus \"[found]\nitself in the unusual position of coming up with a conclusion that\nis different from the one that both counsel agree to.\"\n\n                                -6-\n\fhis offense counts as an \"intended loss\" for purposes of an\n\nenhancement under § 2B1.1.\n\n          The Guidelines define intended loss as \"the pecuniary\n\nharm that was intended to result from the offense, [including]\n\nintended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely\n\nto occur.\"   § 2B1.1, cmt. n.3(A)(ii).   The government bears the\n\nburden of proving intended loss by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nalthough \"a reasonable estimate of loss will suffice.\"      United\n\nStates v. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425, 428-49 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing\n\nUSSG § 2F1.1 cmt. n.8).7   This circuit has not previously decided\n\nwhether reasonably foreseeable loss qualifies as intended loss, and\n\nthe approaches taken by other circuits vary. Compare United States\n\nv. Staples, 410 F.3d 484, 490 (8th Cir. 2005) (\"Absent other\n\nevidence of the defendant's intent, the size of the maximum loss\n\nthat a fraud could have caused is circumstantial evidence of the\n\nintended loss which satisfies the preponderance of the evidence\n\nstandard.\") with United States v. Sanders, 343 F.3d 511, 527 (5th\n\nCir. 2003) (\"[O]ur case law requires the government prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant had the subjective\n\nintent to cause the loss.\"); United States v. Morrow, 177 F.3d 272,\n\n301 (5th Cir. 1999) (\"[W]e look to actual, not constructive,\n\nintent.\").\n\n\n     7\n      Section 2F1.1 was subsequently deleted from the Guidelines\nManual and consolidated with § 2B1.1. See United States v. Burdi,\n414 F.3d 216, 218 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                -7-\n\f           For our part, we think it sensible in this context to\n\nfollow the common-law rule that a person is presumed to have\n\ngenerally intended the natural and probable consequences of his or\n\nher actions.      See, e.g., United States v. Jacobs, 117 F.3d 82, 95\n\n(2d Cir. 1997); cf. United States v. Fortier, 242 F.3d 1224, 1232-\n\n33 (10th Cir. 2001) (endorsing an increased sentence under the\n\nGuidelines for harms that were a reasonably foreseeable consequence\n\nof, although not directly caused by, a defendant's conduct). Thus,\n\nin cases like the present one where the defendant's criminal role\n\nwas to convey stolen credit cards to someone else, \"intended loss\"\n\nincludes \"losses that might naturally and probably flow from\" his\n\nunlawful conduct.        Jacobs, 117 F.3d at 95.         Although Alli never\n\nintended to be the ultimate user of the stolen cards and thus\n\nlacked   intent    to    run   up   charges   on   the   cards   himself,   he\n\nspecifically intended to sell the cards to someone who was quite\n\nlikely to do so.        As the district court stated,\n\n           [I]t's pretty clear that Mr. Alli was a\n           participant in this scheme, he was well aware,\n           obviously, of the fact that these individuals\n           were using the card[s] for unlawful purposes\n           and he was selling them the card[s], that was\n           a further clue that these individuals were\n           going to use the cards to the maximum extent\n           permissible.\n\nAlli was aware of the unlawful aims harbored by his customers in\n\nthe Netherlands, was a knowing participant in their larger scheme,\n\nand specifically intended to sell them the stolen cards.              It was\n\nnaturally and probably to be expected as a result of Alli's actions\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthat those contacts would charge as much as possible on the cards.\n\nAccordingly, we find that the district court's attribution to Alli\n\nof intended loss totaling the stolen cards' aggregate credit limit\n\nof $88,500 was not clearly erroneous.\n\nB. Trafficking\n\n             The district court, again following the recommendation of\n\nthe   PSR,   increased   Alli's   offense   level   by   two   points   after\n\ndetermining that his offense involved \"trafficking\" of credit\n\ncards.   The relevant guideline states: \"If the offense involved .\n\n. . the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device\n\nor counterfeit access device . . . increase by 2 levels.\"                  §\n\n2B1.1(b)(9)(B).     Alli contends that, in order to qualify as having\n\nengaged in \"trafficking\" within the meaning of this guideline, an\n\noffender must have violated the federal trafficking law, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1029(a).      Alli was not charged with violating that statute.\n\nFurthermore, the statute requires that a defendant have obtained at\n\nleast $1000 in value from his trafficking, see § 1029(a)(2); Alli\n\ncontends that he has not met this threshold because he stood to\n\ngain only $150 for all the credit cards he planned to send to his\n\ncontacts in the Netherlands.       The government counters that, first\n\nof all, violation of § 1029(a) is not a prerequisite to the two-\n\nstep enhancement, and, second of all, even if it were, Alli's\n\nconduct did violate that statute because he stood to gain more than\n\n$1000 in payments from the Netherlands-based purchasers.                   We\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fconclude that § 2B1.1(b)(9)(B) applies to offenders whose offense\n\ninvolves credit card trafficking whether or not that offense would\n\nalso qualify as a violation of § 1029(a).         Therefore, we find the\n\nenhancement proper without having to decide how much Alli was to be\n\npaid for sending the stolen credit cards to the Netherlands.\n\n           Nothing   in   §   2B1.1(b)(9)(B)    requires     the    underlying\n\noffense to also be a violation of § 1029(a).           The drafters of the\n\nguideline were clearly aware of the existence and relevance of §\n\n1029(a),   since   the    guideline's   application     notes      incorporate\n\ncertain specific definitions used in the statute. See § 2B1.1 cmt.\n\nn.8(A)   (stating,   e.g.,    that   for    purposes   of   §     2B1.1(b)(9),\n\n\"counterfeit access device\" has the meaning given that term in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1029(e)(2) and \"unauthorized access device\" has the\n\nmeaning given that term in § 1029(e)(3)).              We agree with the\n\ndistrict   court   that    \"trafficking\"     sufficient     to    satisfy   the\n\nguideline does not require a violation of the statute.               Moreover,\n\nboth the generally accepted definition of trafficking8 and the\n\nstatutory definition9 are clearly satisfied here.                Alli obtained\n\ncontrol of stolen credit cards and attempted to sell them to his\n\ncontacts in the Netherlands.      Accordingly, he met the requirements\n\n\n     8\n      One dictionary defines \"traffic\" as \"the activity of\nexchanging commodities by bartering or buying and selling.\"\nWebster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (1986).\n     9\n      18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(5) defines \"trafficking\" as to \"transfer,\nor otherwise dispose of, to another, or obtain control of with\nintent to transfer or dispose of.\"\n\n                                     -10-\n\ffor the two-level increase and the district judge was correct to\n\nimpose it.\n\nC. Reasonableness\n\n           Finally, Alli challenges his sentence as unreasonable.\n\nSentences imposed under the advisory guidelines scheme in place\n\nafter the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker are\n\nsubject to appellate review for reasonableness.    Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220, 261 (2005); United States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2005). A sentence is reviewable for reasonableness whether it\n\nfalls inside or outside the now-advisory guidelines range.   United\n\nStates v. Jimenez-Beltre, 2006 WL 562154 at *2 (1st Cir. Mar. 9,\n\n2006) (en banc).    In selecting a sentence, a district court will\n\nordinarily calculate the applicable Guidelines range and then\n\ndetermine \"whether other factors identified by either side warrant\n\nan ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\"    Id. at\n\n*3.   The court is also bound to consider the sentencing factors set\n\nout in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).10   Robinson, 433 F.3d at 35.   Finally,\n\n\n      10\n      These factors are:\n     (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant;\n     (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of\nthe offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just\npunishment; to afford adequate deterrence; to protect the public;\nand to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational\ntraining or medical care;\n     (3) the kinds of sentences available;\n     (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established\nby the Guidelines;\n     (5) any pertinent policy statement;\n     (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among\n\n                                -11-\n\fthe court must, in most circumstances, explain its reasons for\n\nchoosing the sentence it does.       Jimenez-Beltre, 2006 WL 562154 at\n\n*3.\n\n            Here, the PSR proposed a guidelines sentencing range of\n\n18 to 24 months.        The district judge explained that he believed\n\nAlli's crime was not a crime of opportunity and that that fact\n\npointed him toward the high end of the range, but because the\n\ngovernment recommended a sentence at the low end of the range, he\n\ncompromised by sentencing Alli to a mid-range sentence of 21\n\nmonths.\n\n            Alli gives four reasons why the 21-month sentence is\n\nunreasonable.     First, he cites the district court's allegedly\n\nfaulty    calculation    of   intended   loss.   Second,    he   claims   the\n\ndistrict court failed to adequately take into account Alli's\n\npersonal characteristics and family situation.             Third, he notes\n\nthat the district court did not address the fact that Alli will\n\nlikely be deported and separated from his wife and child. Finally,\n\nhe argues that the 21-month period of incarceration is greater than\n\nnecessary to achieve the statutory goals of punishment.               See §\n\n3553(a).\n\n\n\n\ndefendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\nsimilar conduct; and\n     (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the\noffense.\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           The first claimed indicator of unreasonableness is easily\n\ndisposed of: because we conclude that the district court did not\n\nclearly err in calculating the intended loss, we accordingly also\n\nconclude that relying on that calculation in choosing a sentence\n\nwas not unreasonable.       The second and third claimed indicators\n\namount to a claim that the district court did not adequately\n\nconsider, or perhaps did not adequately explain its consideration\n\nof, factors the defense viewed as mitigating.            When reviewing a\n\ndistrict   court's   consideration      of   a   particular   factor,   \"our\n\nemphasis . . . will be on the provision of a reasoned explanation,\n\na plausible outcome and — where these criteria are met — some\n\ndeference to different judgments by the district judges on the\n\nscene.\"    Jimenez-Beltre, 2006 WL 562154 at *3.              In this case,\n\nhowever,   neither   Alli   nor   his    lawyer    brought    the   personal\n\ncircumstances invoked in this appeal — the illness of Alli's\n\nparents, his cooperation with law enforcement after his arrest, and\n\nthe likelihood that he will be deported — to the attention of the\n\njudge at the sentencing hearing.        Rather, when Alli was given the\n\nopportunity to speak at the hearing, he said simply, \"I know I did\n\nsomething wrong, I'm sorry for what I did,\" and his counsel argued\n\nonly the guidelines calculation objections discussed earlier.\n\n           The district judge's explanation of why the sentence he\n\nchose met the requirements of § 3553(a) was admittedly terse.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fExcept for the guidelines range, he discussed none of the § 3553(a)\n\nfactors individually; instead, he simply stated,\n\n           [T]his is one of those cases . . . where I\n           think the guidelines produce a sentence that\n           is reasonable and perfectly consistent with\n           the factors enumerated in the statute,\n           3553(a).

Alli admitted that he had intended to send the cards to a contact in the Netherlands in exchange for money. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison. In this appeal, Alli raises several challenges to the way his sentence was calculated. After careful consideration, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2003, Alli was a temporary employee at a branch of the United States Post Office in Providence, Rhode Island. His duties included sorting bulk mail. On December 30, 2003, Alli dropped off a package, addressed to a destination in the Netherlands, at a United Parcel Service (UPS) facility in Warwick, Rhode Island. Finding the package suspicious, UPS workers opened it, discovered nine credit cards in nine different names, and then called the state police. The police, in turn, called the post office where Alli worked to inquire about Alli, whose return address was on the Netherlands-bound package. Postal Service inspectors began watching Alli at work, and in January 2004 they saw him take letters from a mail tray and hide them. Two days later, an inspector placed about 25 letters containing credit cards onto Alli's mail tray. While the inspectors watched and a video camera recorded, Alli pocketed two letters containing credit cards. Moments later, an inspector confronted Alli and escorted him to a conference room where police officers were waiting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving <i>Miranda</i> warnings, Alli admitted stealing the two letters with the intention to take credit cards from them. He also admitted that he had stolen the nine credit cards found in the UPS package by removing them from letters he had taken from mail trays with the intention of sending the purloined cards to contacts in the Netherlands, who had promised to pay him for the cards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In a later search of Alli's apartment, the police found still another credit card, which Alli also admitted to having stolen. In April 2004, Alli was charged with postal theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1709. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in April 2005<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to 21 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge presiding over Alli's sentencing hearing understood that he was operating under an advisory Guidelines system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> To calculate the sentence, he began with a base offense level of six,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> to which he added an eight-level enhancement pursuant to USSG &#167; 2B1.1(b)(1)(E) because the loss occasioned by Alli's offense was more than $70,000 but less than $120,000. The judge then added a separate two-level enhancement after concluding that Alli's offense involved \"the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device.\" &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B). On appeal, Alli contests the eight-level enhancement, arguing that the district court improperly calculated the amount of financial loss caused by his offense. He also challenges the two-level enhancement on the ground that &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B) does not simply require \"trafficking\" in a general sense, but rather the violation of a specific federal statute criminalizing the trafficking of credit cards, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(5). Finally, Alli contends that his sentence is unreasonable and therefore must be vacated under the post-<i>Booker</i> \"reasonableness\" standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's interpretation and application of the federal Sentencing Guidelines <i>de novo, United States v. Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.2005), but review the court's related factual findings, including its calculation of loss amount, for clear error. <i>See United States v. Flores-Seda,</i> 423 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Amount of Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2B1.1(b)(1) calls for a sentencing court to increase an offender's offense level in larceny and theft cases according to the amount of loss resulting from the offense. An application note to that guideline states that \"loss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\" &#167; 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A). All agree that no actual loss occurred as a result of Alli's theft. Therefore, the district court calculated intended loss and did so by adding together the credit limits of the stolen credit cards, arriving at a total of $88,500.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This was the same amount recommended by the probation officer who prepared Alli's Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSR).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alli timely objected to the loss calculation in the PSR and renewed his objection at his sentencing hearing. The crux of his objection is that because there is no evidence that he himself clearly intended to use the card, the amount of loss should be limited to $500 per card pursuant to Application Note 3(F) to Guideline 2B1.1. That note states, \"In a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device, loss includes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device and shall not be less than $500 per access device.\" &#167; 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(F)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, found it of no importance that Alli did not intend to use the cards to their full limit or indeed at all. Rather, the court found that Alli sold the cards knowing they would be used for unlawful gain and concluded that Alli therefore had a reasonable expectation, if not knowledge, that the cards would be used to the fullest extent possible. This was enough, the court determined, to demonstrate intended loss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We must therefore decide whether a loss that an offender knows will occur, or should reasonably expect to occur, as a direct result of his offense counts as an \"intended loss\" for purposes of an enhancement under &#167; 2B1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines define intended loss as \"the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense, [including] intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\" &#167; 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A)(ii). The government bears the burden of proving intended loss by a preponderance of the evidence, although \"a reasonable estimate of loss will suffice.\" <i>United States v. Egemonye,</i> 62 F.3d 425, 428-29 (1st Cir.1995) (citing USSG &#167; 2F1.1 cmt. n. 8).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> This circuit has not previously decided whether reasonably foreseeable loss qualifies as intended loss, and the approaches taken by other circuits vary. <i>Compare United States v. Staples,</i> 410 F.3d 484, 490 (8th Cir.2005) (\"Absent other evidence of the defendant's intent, the size of the maximum loss that a fraud could have caused is circumstantial evidence of the intended loss which satisfies the preponderance of the evidence standard.\") <i>with United States v. Sanders,</i> 343 F.3d 511, 527 (5th Cir.2003) (\"[O]ur case law requires the government prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had the subjective intent to cause the loss.\"); <i>United States v. Morrow,</i> 177 F.3d 272, 301 (5th Cir.1999) (\"[W]e look to actual, not constructive, intent.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For our part, we think it sensible in this context to follow the common-law rule that a person is presumed to have generally intended the natural and probable consequences of his or her actions. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Jacobs,</i> 117 F.3d 82, 95 (2d Cir.1997); <i>cf. United States v. Fortier,</i> 242 F.3d 1224, 1232-33 (10th Cir.2001) (endorsing an increased sentence under the Guidelines for harms that were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of, although not directly caused by, a defendant's conduct). Thus, in cases like the present one where the defendant's criminal role was to convey stolen credit cards to someone else, \"intended loss\" includes \"losses that might naturally and probably flow from\" his unlawful conduct. <i>Jacobs,</i> 117 F.3d at 95. Although Alli never intended to be the ultimate user of the stolen cards and thus lacked intent to run up charges on the cards himself, he specifically intended to sell the cards to someone who was quite likely to do so. As the district court stated, [I]t's pretty clear that Mr. Alli was a participant in this scheme, he was well aware, obviously, of the fact that these individuals were using the card[s] for unlawful purposes and he was selling them the card[s], that was a further clue that these individuals were going to use the cards to the maximum extent permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alli was aware of the unlawful aims harbored by his customers in the Netherlands, was a knowing participant in their larger scheme, and specifically intended to sell them the stolen cards. It was naturally and probably to be expected as a result of Alli's actions that those contacts would charge as much as possible on the cards. Accordingly, we find that the district court's attribution to Alli of intended loss totaling the stolen cards' aggregate credit limit of $88,500 was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Trafficking</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, again following the recommendation of the PSR, imposed a two-level upward adjustment to Alli's offense level after determining that his crime involved \"trafficking\" of credit cards. The relevant guideline states: \"If the offense involved ... the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device ... increase by 2 levels.\" &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B). Alli contends that, in order to qualify as having engaged in \"trafficking\" within the meaning of this guideline, an offender must have violated the federal trafficking law, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a). Alli was not charged with violating that statute. Furthermore, the statute requires that a defendant have obtained at least $1000 in value from his trafficking, <i>see</i> &#167; 1029(a)(2); Alli contends that he has not met this threshold because he stood to gain only $150 for all the credit cards he planned to send to his contacts in the Netherlands. The government counters that, first of all, violation of &#167; 1029(a) is not a prerequisite to the two-step enhancement, and, second of all, even if it were, Alli's conduct did violate that statute because he stood to gain more than $1000 in payments from the Netherlands-based purchasers. We conclude that &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B) applies to offenders whose offense involves credit card trafficking whether or not that offense would also qualify as a violation of &#167; 1029(a). Therefore, we find the enhancement proper without having to decide how much Alli was to be paid for sending the stolen credit cards to the Netherlands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B) requires the underlying offense to also be a violation of &#167; 1029(a). The drafters of the guideline were clearly aware of the existence and relevance of &#167; 1029(a), since the guideline's application notes incorporate certain specific definitions used in the statute. <i>See</i> &#167; 2B1.1 cmt. n. 8(A) (stating, e.g., that for purposes of &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9), \"counterfeit access device\" has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(2) and \"unauthorized access device\" has the meaning given that term in &#167; 1029(e)(3)). We agree with the district court that \"trafficking\" sufficient to satisfy the guideline does not require a violation of the statute. Moreover, both the generally accepted definition of trafficking<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and the statutory definition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> are clearly satisfied here. Alli obtained control of stolen credit cards and attempted to sell them to his contacts in the Netherlands. Accordingly, he met the requirements for the two-level increase and the district judge was correct to impose it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Reasonableness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Alli challenges his sentence as unreasonable. Sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines scheme in place after the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker</i> are subject to appellate review for reasonableness. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.2005). A sentence is reviewable for reasonableness whether it falls inside or outside the now-advisory guidelines range. <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 517 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). In selecting a sentence, a district court will ordinarily calculate the applicable Guidelines range and then determine \"whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\" <i>Id.</i> at 519. The court is also bound to consider the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d at 35. Finally, the court must, in most circumstances, explain its reasons for choosing the sentence it does. <i>Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the PSR proposed a guidelines sentencing range of 18 to 24 months. The district judge explained that he believed Alli's crime was not a crime of opportunity and that that fact pointed him toward the high end of the range, but because the government recommended a sentence at the low end of the range, he compromised by sentencing Alli to a mid-range sentence of 21 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alli gives four reasons why the 21-month sentence is unreasonable. First, he cites the district court's allegedly faulty calculation of intended loss. Second, he claims the district court failed to adequately take into account Alli's personal characteristics and family situation. Third, he notes that the district court did not address the fact that Alli will likely be deported and separated from his wife and child. Finally, he argues that the 21-month period of incarceration is greater than necessary to achieve the statutory goals of punishment. <i>See</i> &#167; 3553(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first claimed indicator of unreasonableness is easily disposed of: because we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in calculating the intended loss, we accordingly also conclude that relying on that calculation in choosing a sentence was not unreasonable. The second and third claimed indicators amount to a claim that the district court did not adequately consider, or perhaps did not adequately explain its consideration of, factors the defense viewed as mitigating. When reviewing a district court's consideration of a particular factor, \"our emphasis ... will be on the provision of a reasoned explanation, a plausible outcome and &#8212; where these criteria are met &#8212; some deference to different judgments by the district judges on the scene.\" <i>Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519. In this case, however, neither Alli nor his lawyer brought the personal circumstances invoked in this appeal &#8212; the illness of Alli's parents, his cooperation with law enforcement after his arrest, and the likelihood that he will be deported &#8212; to the attention of the judge at the sentencing hearing. Rather, when Alli was given the opportunity to speak at the hearing, he said simply, \"I know I did something wrong, I'm sorry for what I did,\" and his counsel argued only the guidelines calculation objections discussed earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's explanation of why the sentence he chose met the requirements of &#167; 3553(a) was admittedly terse. Except for the guidelines range, he discussed none of the &#167; 3553(a) factors individually; instead, he simply stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his is one of those cases ... where I think the guidelines produce a sentence that is reasonable and perfectly consistent with the factors enumerated in the statute, 3553(a). I think all of those factors have been adequately taken into account by the guidelines, and the guideline range, as I say, produces a reasonable sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This language treads close to an assumption that the guideline sentence is automatically reasonable, an assumption that is no longer viable, <i>see Jimenez-Beltre</i> at 519, but we think that under the circumstances the district court acted reasonably in imposing the sentence it did. At the sentencing hearing Alli identified no factors (other than the challenges to the judge's guideline calculations already discussed) that would arguably militate in favor of a sentence below the guideline range of 18 to 24 months. Nor did the government raise any factors in support of an above-range sentence. In this situation, we do not fault the judge for not speaking further about the &#167; 3553(a) factors, given that none were raised for his consideration and, in his independent judgment, none were worthy of further discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final contention on appeal is that Alli's sentence is unreasonable because it is longer than necessary to effectuate the statutory goals of criminal punishment. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a). The district judge did not discuss this statutory requirement. Again, however, we find the absence of particularized discussion unproblematic given that the issue was not raised for the judge's consideration at the hearing. In that context, the judge's general conclusion that the guidelines sentence was a reasonable punishment for Alli's crime suffices as a conclusion that the sentence was not longer than necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the defendant's sentence is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties dispute whether Alli was to receive $150 for each credit card he passed along to his contacts, or whether he would get a single $150 payment for all the cards. Alli maintains, and the prosecution version of the facts in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report implies, that Alli was to receive $150 for all of the cards. However, at Alli's sentencing hearing, the district court noted twice, without objection, that Alli was expecting $150 per card. For reasons discussed later in this opinion, we conclude that it makes no difference whether Alli would have received upwards of $1000 or only $150 for the credit cards he stole</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The sentencing had originally been scheduled for October 2004, but the district court postponed the hearing until December in the hope that the Supreme Court would decide the pending case of<i>United States v. Booker.</i> In December, the judge allowed Alli to withdraw his guilty plea for reasons not bearing on this appeal. Alli subsequently pleaded guilty again to the same charge and was ultimately sentenced in April 2005. <i>Booker</i> had been decided on January 12, 2005.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The judge stated, \"[A]s in all sentences since<i>Booker,</i> it's a two-step process. The first step is to determine what the sentence would be under the guidelines, and since <i>Booker</i> makes it clear that the guidelines are now advisory, the second step is to determine what a reasonable sentence would be under the statute, under [&#167;] 3553(a), I believe it is.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Both the probation office and the district court relied on the November 2003 version of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> It appears that of the twelve credit cards Alli stole (nine in the UPS package, two at the post office, and one found in his apartment), the credit limits of only eight or nine cards were used to calculate the intended loss.

Alli admitted that he had intended to send the cards to a contact in the Netherlands in exchange for money. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison. In this appeal, Alli raises several challenges to the way his sentence was calculated. After careful consideration, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2003, Alli was a temporary employee at a branch of the United States Post Office in Providence, Rhode Island. His duties included sorting bulk mail. On December 30, 2003, Alli dropped off a package, addressed to a destination in the Netherlands, at a United Parcel Service (UPS) facility in Warwick, Rhode Island. Finding the package suspicious, UPS workers opened it, discovered nine credit cards in nine different names, and then called the state police. The police, in turn, called the post office where Alli worked to inquire about Alli, whose return address was on the Netherlands-bound package. Postal Service inspectors began watching Alli at work, and in January 2004 they saw him take letters from a mail tray and hide them. Two days later, an inspector placed about 25 letters containing credit cards onto Alli's mail tray. While the inspectors watched and a video camera recorded, Alli pocketed two letters containing credit cards. Moments later, an inspector confronted Alli and escorted him to a conference room where police officers were waiting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving <i>Miranda</i> warnings, Alli admitted stealing the two letters with the intention to take credit cards from them. He also admitted that he had stolen the nine credit cards found in the UPS package by removing them from letters he had taken from mail trays with the intention of sending the purloined cards to contacts in the Netherlands, who had promised to pay him for the cards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In a later search of Alli's apartment, the police found still another credit card, which Alli also admitted to having stolen. In April 2004, Alli was charged with postal theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1709. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in April 2005<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to 21 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge presiding over Alli's sentencing hearing understood that he was operating under an advisory Guidelines system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> To calculate the sentence, he began with a base offense level of six,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> to which he added an eight-level enhancement pursuant to USSG &#167; 2B1.1(b)(1)(E) because the loss occasioned by Alli's offense was more than $70,000 but less than $120,000. The judge then added a separate two-level enhancement after concluding that Alli's offense involved \"the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device.\" &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B). On appeal, Alli contests the eight-level enhancement, arguing that the district court improperly calculated the amount of financial loss caused by his offense. He also challenges the two-level enhancement on the ground that &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B) does not simply require \"trafficking\" in a general sense, but rather the violation of a specific federal statute criminalizing the trafficking of credit cards, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(5). Finally, Alli contends that his sentence is unreasonable and therefore must be vacated under the post-<i>Booker</i> \"reasonableness\" standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's interpretation and application of the federal Sentencing Guidelines <i>de novo, United States v.

Amount of Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2B1.1(b)(1) calls for a sentencing court to increase an offender's offense level in larceny and theft cases according to the amount of loss resulting from the offense. An application note to that guideline states that \"loss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\" &#167; 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A). All agree that no actual loss occurred as a result of Alli's theft. Therefore, the district court calculated intended loss and did so by adding together the credit limits of the stolen credit cards, arriving at a total of $88,500.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This was the same amount recommended by the probation officer who prepared Alli's Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSR).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alli timely objected to the loss calculation in the PSR and renewed his objection at his sentencing hearing. The crux of his objection is that because there is no evidence that he himself clearly intended to use the card, the amount of loss should be limited to $500 per card pursuant to Application Note 3(F) to Guideline 2B1.1. That note states, \"In a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device, loss includes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device and shall not be less than $500 per access device.\" &#167; 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(F)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, found it of no importance that Alli did not intend to use the cards to their full limit or indeed at all. Rather, the court found that Alli sold the cards knowing they would be used for unlawful gain and concluded that Alli therefore had a reasonable expectation, if not knowledge, that the cards would be used to the fullest extent possible. This was enough, the court determined, to demonstrate intended loss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We must therefore decide whether a loss that an offender knows will occur, or should reasonably expect to occur, as a direct result of his offense counts as an \"intended loss\" for purposes of an enhancement under &#167; 2B1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines define intended loss as \"the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense, [including] intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\" &#167; 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A)(ii).

Jacobs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743011\"><a href=\"/opinion/743011/united-states-v-donald-e-jacobs/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 95 (2d Cir.1997); <i>cf.

Thus, in cases like the present one where the defendant's criminal role was to convey stolen credit cards to someone else, \"intended loss\" includes \"losses that might naturally and probably flow from\" his unlawful conduct. <i>Jacobs,</i> 117 F.3d at 95. Although Alli never intended to be the ultimate user of the stolen cards and thus lacked intent to run up charges on the cards himself, he specifically intended to sell the cards to someone who was quite likely to do so. As the district court stated, [I]t's pretty clear that Mr. Alli was a participant in this scheme, he was well aware, obviously, of the fact that these individuals were using the card[s] for unlawful purposes and he was selling them the card[s], that was a further clue that these individuals were going to use the cards to the maximum extent permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alli was aware of the unlawful aims harbored by his customers in the Netherlands, was a knowing participant in their larger scheme, and specifically intended to sell them the stolen cards. It was naturally and probably to be expected as a result of Alli's actions that those contacts would charge as much as possible on the cards. Accordingly, we find that the district court's attribution to Alli of intended loss totaling the stolen cards' aggregate credit limit of $88,500 was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Trafficking</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, again following the recommendation of the PSR, imposed a two-level upward adjustment to Alli's offense level after determining that his crime involved \"trafficking\" of credit cards. The relevant guideline states: \"If the offense involved ... the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device ... increase by 2 levels.\" &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B). Alli contends that, in order to qualify as having engaged in \"trafficking\" within the meaning of this guideline, an offender must have violated the federal trafficking law, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a). Alli was not charged with violating that statute. Furthermore, the statute requires that a defendant have obtained at least $1000 in value from his trafficking, <i>see</i> &#167; 1029(a)(2); Alli contends that he has not met this threshold because he stood to gain only $150 for all the credit cards he planned to send to his contacts in the Netherlands. The government counters that, first of all, violation of &#167; 1029(a) is not a prerequisite to the two-step enhancement, and, second of all, even if it were, Alli's conduct did violate that statute because he stood to gain more than $1000 in payments from the Netherlands-based purchasers. We conclude that &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B) applies to offenders whose offense involves credit card trafficking whether or not that offense would also qualify as a violation of &#167; 1029(a). Therefore, we find the enhancement proper without having to decide how much Alli was to be paid for sending the stolen credit cards to the Netherlands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9)(B) requires the underlying offense to also be a violation of &#167; 1029(a). The drafters of the guideline were clearly aware of the existence and relevance of &#167; 1029(a), since the guideline's application notes incorporate certain specific definitions used in the statute. <i>See</i> &#167; 2B1.1 cmt. n. 8(A) (stating, e.g., that for purposes of &#167; 2B1.1(b)(9), \"counterfeit access device\" has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(2) and \"unauthorized access device\" has the meaning given that term in &#167; 1029(e)(3)). We agree with the district court that \"trafficking\" sufficient to satisfy the guideline does not require a violation of the statute. Moreover, both the generally accepted definition of trafficking<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and the statutory definition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> are clearly satisfied here. Alli obtained control of stolen credit cards and attempted to sell them to his contacts in the Netherlands. Accordingly, he met the requirements for the two-level increase and the district judge was correct to impose it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Reasonableness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Alli challenges his sentence as unreasonable. Sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines scheme in place after the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker</i> are subject to appellate review for reasonableness. <i>Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 261, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005); <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201981\"><a href=\"/opinion/201981/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2005). A sentence is reviewable for reasonableness whether it falls inside or outside the now-advisory guidelines range. <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 517 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). In selecting a sentence, a district court will ordinarily calculate the applicable Guidelines range and then determine \"whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\" <i>Id.</i> at 519. The court is also bound to consider the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d at 35. Finally, the court must, in most circumstances, explain its reasons for choosing the sentence it does. <i>Jimenez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the PSR proposed a guidelines sentencing range of 18 to 24 months. The district judge explained that he believed Alli's crime was not a crime of opportunity and that that fact pointed him toward the high end of the range, but because the government recommended a sentence at the low end of the range, he compromised by sentencing Alli to a mid-range sentence of 21 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alli gives four reasons why the 21-month sentence is unreasonable. First, he cites the district court's allegedly faulty calculation of intended loss. Second, he claims the district court failed to adequately take into account Alli's personal characteristics and family situation. Third, he notes that the district court did not address the fact that Alli will likely be deported and separated from his wife and child. Finally, he argues that the 21-month period of incarceration is greater than necessary to achieve the statutory goals of punishment. <i>See</i> &#167; 3553(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first claimed indicator of unreasonableness is easily disposed of: because we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in calculating the intended loss, we accordingly also conclude that relying on that calculation in choosing a sentence was not unreasonable. The second and third claimed indicators amount to a claim that the district court did not adequately consider, or perhaps did not adequately explain its consideration of, factors the defense viewed as mitigating. When reviewing a district court's consideration of a particular factor, \"our emphasis ... will be on the provision of a reasoned explanation, a plausible outcome and &#8212; where these criteria are met &#8212; some deference to different judgments by the district judges on the scene.\" <i>Jimenez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 519. In this case, however, neither Alli nor his lawyer brought the personal circumstances invoked in this appeal &#8212; the illness of Alli's parents, his cooperation with law enforcement after his arrest, and the likelihood that he will be deported &#8212; to the attention of the judge at the sentencing hearing. Rather, when Alli was given the opportunity to speak at the hearing, he said simply, \"I know I did something wrong, I'm sorry for what I did,\" and his counsel argued only the guidelines calculation objections discussed earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's explanation of why the sentence he chose met the requirements of &#167; 3553(a) was admittedly terse. Except for the guidelines range, he discussed none of the &#167; 3553(a) factors individually; instead, he simply stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his is one of those cases ... where I think the guidelines produce a sentence that is reasonable and perfectly consistent with the factors enumerated in the statute, 3553(a). I think all of those factors have been adequately taken into account by the guidelines, and the guideline range, as I say, produces a reasonable sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This language treads close to an assumption that the guideline sentence is automatically reasonable, an assumption that is no longer viable, <i>see Jimenez-Beltre</i> at 519, but we think that under the circumstances the district court acted reasonably in imposing the sentence it did. At the sentencing hearing Alli identified no factors (other than the challenges to the judge's guideline calculations already discussed) that would arguably militate in favor of a sentence below the guideline range of 18 to 24 months. Nor did the government raise any factors in support of an above-range sentence. In this situation, we do not fault the judge for not speaking further about the &#167; 3553(a) factors, given that none were raised for his consideration and, in his independent judgment, none were worthy of further discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final contention on appeal is that Alli's sentence is unreasonable because it is longer than necessary to effectuate the statutory goals of criminal punishment. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a). The district judge did not discuss this statutory requirement. Again, however, we find the absence of particularized discussion unproblematic given that the issue was not raised for the judge's consideration at the hearing. In that context, the judge's general conclusion that the guidelines sentence was a reasonable punishment for Alli's crime suffices as a conclusion that the sentence was not longer than necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the defendant's sentence is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties dispute whether Alli was to receive $150 for each credit card he passed along to his contacts, or whether he would get a single $150 payment for all the cards. Alli maintains, and the prosecution version of the facts in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report implies, that Alli was to receive $150 for all of the cards. However, at Alli's sentencing hearing, the district court noted twice, without objection, that Alli was expecting $150 per card. For reasons discussed later in this opinion, we conclude that it makes no difference whether Alli would have received upwards of $1000 or only $150 for the credit cards he stole</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The sentencing had originally been scheduled for October 2004, but the district court postponed the hearing until December in the hope that the Supreme Court would decide the pending case of<i>United States v. Booker.</i> In December, the judge allowed Alli to withdraw his guilty plea for reasons not bearing on this appeal. Alli subsequently pleaded guilty again to the same charge and was ultimately sentenced in April 2005. <i>Booker</i> had been decided on January 12, 2005.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The judge stated, \"[A]s in all sentences since<i>Booker,</i> it's a two-step process. The first step is to determine what the sentence would be under the guidelines, and since <i>Booker</i> makes it clear that the guidelines are now advisory, the second step is to determine what a reasonable sentence would be under the statute, under [&#167;] 3553(a), I believe it is.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Both the probation office and the district court relied on the November 2003 version of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> It appears that of the twelve credit cards Alli stole (nine in the UPS package, two at the post office, and one found in his apartment), the credit limits of only eight or nine cards were used to calculate the intended loss. The record does not reveal why this is so</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It is also worth noting that Alli was only charged with, and only pled guilty to, theft of the two credit cards with which he was caught by investigators at the post office. Counsel for Alli argued below that it was only appropriate to count the credit limits of those two cards when assessing loss, but the district court disagreed and Alli does not press the question on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> At the sentencing hearing, the government agreed with Alli that there was no intended loss.
