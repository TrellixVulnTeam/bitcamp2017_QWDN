Jack  Biyaga  pled guilty  in the\n                       \n\nUnited   States   District  Court   for   the  District   of\n\nMassachusetts to one count of bank robbery brought under  18\n\nU.S.C.   2113(a).  On February 24, 1993, he was sentenced to\n\n41  months of incarceration to be  followed by a conditional\n\nperiod  of  supervised   release.    Before  sentencing,   a\n\nprobation   officer   interviewed   Biyaga  to   prepare   a\n\npresentence report.   Biyaga told  the officer that  (1) his\n\nname  was Jacques  Bonato Biyaga,  (2)  he was  born in  St.\n\nThomas,  U.S. Virgin  Islands, and  (3)  he was  an American\n\ncitizen.   He had previously  averred the same facts  to the\n\nmagistrate judge during his bail hearing.  Unable to  verify\n\nBiyaga's  information,  the   probation  officer  confronted\n\ndefendant in the presence of counsel.  Biyaga  then admitted\n\nthat  (1) his real name  was Jacques Bonaventure Biyaga, (2)\n\nhe was born in Mbanga,  Cameroun, and (3) he was  an illegal\n\nalien.     Because   of  Biyaga's   false   statements,  the\n\npresentence  report enhanced his offense level by two points\n\nfor obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G.   3C1.1.1\n\n                    \n\n1U.S.S.G.    3C1.1 (1992)  directs the  sentencing judge  to\nincrease  the  Guidelines  offense level  by  two  \"[i]f the\ndefendant willfully  impeded or obstructed,  or attempted to\nimpede or obstruct, the administration of justice during the\ninvestigation,  prosecution, or  sentencing  of the  instant\noffense.\"\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nAt  his sentencing hearing, Biyaga objected to the two-point\n\nenhancement.   The district court acknowledged that Biyaga's\n\nfalsity was not relevant to the elements of the bank robbery\n\noffense with  which Biyaga  was charged,  but held  that the\n\nenhancement  was  warranted \"because  the  misrepresentation\n\nthat the defendant is an American citizen born in the Virgin\n\nIslands  is  material  to the  sentencing  decision  in this\n\ncase.\"   On appeal  Biyaga argues  that  the district  court\n\nerred  in imposing  the two-point increase  because Biyaga's\n\nmisrepresentation  did not relate  to the count  on which he\n\nwas charged, and therefore was not material under U.S.S.G.  \n\n3C1.1.   On  review, we  conclude that  the judgment  of the\n\ndistrict court should be affirmed.\n\n                        Discussion  \n                                  \n\n          As a threshold matter, we find that under U.S.S.G\n\n  3C1.1 false information need not relate to the underlying\n\ncharge to be material.  As amended in 1992,   3C1.1 states\n\nthat a judge shall increase the offense level by two \"if the\n\ndefendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to\n\nobstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the\n\ninvestigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant\n                                         \n\noffense.\"  (Emphasis added.)  The guideline thus clearly\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nallows sentencing judges to enhance penalties for material\n\nfalsehoods relevant to sentencing.\n\n          We further find that sentencing judges have broad\n\ndiscretion in deciding whether a falsehood is material. \n\nMateriality is a determination by the sentencing judge that\n\nwe review only for clear error.  United States v. Pineda,\n                                                        \n\n981 F.2d 569, 572 (1st Cir. 1992) (clear error standard\n\napplies whether district court's finding based on factual\n\ndetermination or application of sentencing guidelines).  In\n\nthis case the question of materiality is framed by\n\napplication note 3 of U.S.S.G. 3C1.1, which provides a non-\n\nexhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which\n\nthe obstruction of justice enhancement applies.  Example\n\n3(h) is \"providing materially false information to a\n\nprobation officer in respect to a presentence or other\n\ninvestigation for the court\".  We have held that \"the test\n\nof materiality for purposes of Application Note 3(h) is not\n\na stringent one.\"  United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698,\n                                           \n\n705 (1st Cir. 1992).  Appellant therefore bears a heavy\n\nburden in trying to show that the district judge erred in\n\napplying   3C1.1.\n\n          Biyaga tries to meet this burden by citing two\n\ncases in which courts of appeal have found\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nmisrepresentations not to be material under the guidelines:\n\nUnited States v. Tabares, 951 F.2d 405, 411 (1st Cir. 1991)\n                        \n\n(fake social security number not material), and United\n                                                      \n\nStates v. Belletiere, 971 F.2d 961, 968 (3rd Cir. 1992)\n                    \n\n(lying about prior drug use not material).  Yet each of\n\nthose cases made clear that materiality is a case-by-case\n\nissue, and that identical falsehoods could be material\n\nelsewhere.  Belletiere, 971 F.2d at 968 (\"misstatement was\n                      \n\nnot material to the probation officer's investigation in\n                                                        \n\nthis particular case) (emphasis added); Tabares, 951 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n411 (\"however material [the false statement] might have been\n\nin some other case, it does not seem 'material' in this\n\none\").  Thus, the question to be addressed is whether, in\n\nthe case at bar, the defendant's statements could have\n\ninterfered with the district judge's proper carrying out of\n\nthe sentencing function had the falsity of those statements\n\nnot been discovered.\n\n          The district judge explained that in this case the\n\nfalse statements were material because it was his practice\n\nwhen sentencing an illegal alien to suspend supervised\n\nrelease from the time the defendant is deported until, and\n\nif, he returns to the United States.  The judge explained\n\nthat when a defendant is deported there is (1) no way for\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nthe defendant to comply with his release requirements, and\n\n(2) no way for the supervisor to supervise.  \n\n          On appeal Biyaga contends that the court can have\n\nno reasonable concern about supervising someone not on\n\nAmerican soil, so a falsehood affecting whether a period of\n\nsupervised release is suspended cannot be considered\n\nmaterial.  Biyaga's argument falls short.  The judge stated\n\na connection between citizenship and the discretionary\n\nsentencing decision of whether to suspend supervised\n\nrelease.  By definition, then, Biyaga's falsehood involved\n\ninformation material to sentencing.  Biyaga is also\n\nincorrect that the district judge's sentencing practice is\n\nirrational.  The judge's explanation indicates a reasonable\n\nconcern that, in the event a defendant returns to the United\n\nStates after deportation, he then be subject to the full\n\nperiod of supervised release.  It was clearly within the\n\ndistrict court's discretion to find appellant's\n\nmisrepresentation as to citizenship to be material in this\n\ncase.2  \n\n                    \n\n2We  note that Biyaga's sentence is supportable elsewhere in\nthe record.   Biyaga lied about his citizenship  not only to\nthe  probation officer,  but also  to  the magistrate  judge\nduring his bail hearing.   Application note 3(f) to U.S.S.G.\n   3C1.1 suggests  the two-point  enhancement for  providing\nmaterially  false information to a judge  or magistrate.  As\ncitizenship  is  material  to the  issue  of  bail, Biyaga's\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                    \n\nmisrepresentation   to  the   magistrate   judge  fits   the\ndefinition  of obstruction of  justice under  section 3C1.1.\nAlthough  the district  judge never  reached  this issue  in\noverruling  Biyaga's objection  to  the enhancement,  we may\naffirm  on any  grounds supported  by the  record.

Sec. 2113(a).  On February 24, 1993, he was sentenced to 41 months of incarceration to be followed by a conditional period of supervised release.  Before sentencing, a probation officer interviewed Biyaga to prepare a presentence report.  Biyaga told the officer that (1) his name was Jacques Bonato Biyaga, (2) he was born in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and (3) he was an American citizen.  He had previously averred the same facts to the magistrate judge during his bail hearing.  Unable to verify Biyaga's information, the probation officer confronted defendant in the presence of counsel.  Biyaga then admitted that (1) his real name was Jacques Bonaventure Biyaga, (2) he was born in Mbanga, Cameroun, and (3) he was an illegal alien.  Because of Biyaga's false statements, the presentence report enhanced his offense level by two points for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.<sup>1</sup>  At his sentencing hearing, Biyaga objected to the two-point enhancement.  The district court acknowledged that Biyaga's falsity was not relevant to the elements of the bank robbery offense with which Biyaga was charged, but held that the enhancement was warranted \"because the misrepresentation that the defendant is an American citizen born in the Virgin Islands is material to the sentencing decision in this case.\"   On appeal Biyaga argues that the district court erred in imposing the two-point increase because Biyaga's misrepresentation did not relate to the count on which he was charged, and therefore was not material under U.S.S.G.

In this case the question of materiality is framed by application note 3 of U.S.S.G. 3C1.1, which provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which the obstruction of justice enhancement applies.  Example 3(h) is \"providing materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court\".  We have held that \"the test of materiality for purposes of Application Note 3(h) is not a stringent one.\"  United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 705 (1st Cir.1992).

Yet each of those cases made clear that materiality is a case-by-case issue, and that identical falsehoods could be material elsewhere.

POLLAK, Senior District Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jack Biyaga pled guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to one count of bank robbery brought under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2113(a).  On February 24, 1993, he was sentenced to 41 months of incarceration to be followed by a conditional period of supervised release.  Before sentencing, a probation officer interviewed Biyaga to prepare a presentence report.  Biyaga told the officer that (1) his name was Jacques Bonato Biyaga, (2) he was born in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and (3) he was an American citizen.  He had previously averred the same facts to the magistrate judge during his bail hearing.  Unable to verify Biyaga's information, the probation officer confronted defendant in the presence of counsel.  Biyaga then admitted that (1) his real name was Jacques Bonaventure Biyaga, (2) he was born in Mbanga, Cameroun, and (3) he was an illegal alien.  Because of Biyaga's false statements, the presentence report enhanced his offense level by two points for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.<sup>1</sup>  At his sentencing hearing, Biyaga objected to the two-point enhancement.  The district court acknowledged that Biyaga's falsity was not relevant to the elements of the bank robbery offense with which Biyaga was charged, but held that the enhancement was warranted \"because the misrepresentation that the defendant is an American citizen born in the Virgin Islands is material to the sentencing decision in this case.\"   On appeal Biyaga argues that the district court erred in imposing the two-point increase because Biyaga's misrepresentation did not relate to the count on which he was charged, and therefore was not material under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  On review, we conclude that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, we find that under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 false information need not relate to the underlying charge to be material.  As amended in 1992, Sec. 3C1.1 states that a judge shall increase the offense level by two \"if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"  (Emphasis added.)   The guideline thus clearly allows sentencing judges to enhance penalties for material falsehoods relevant to sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further find that sentencing judges have broad discretion in deciding whether a falsehood is material.  Materiality is a determination by the sentencing judge that we review only for clear error.  United States v. Pineda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596482\"><a href=\"/opinion/596482/united-states-v-ramon-pineda/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.1992) (clear error standard applies whether district court's finding based on factual determination or application of sentencing guidelines).  In this case the question of materiality is framed by application note 3 of U.S.S.G. 3C1.1, which provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which the obstruction of justice enhancement applies.  Example 3(h) is \"providing materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court\".  We have held that \"the test of materiality for purposes of Application Note 3(h) is not a stringent one.\"  United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 705 (1st Cir.1992).  Appellant therefore bears a heavy burden in trying to show that the district judge erred in applying Sec. 3C1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biyaga tries to meet this burden by citing two cases in which courts of appeal have found misrepresentations not to be material under the guidelines:  United States v. Tabares, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573870\"><a href=\"/opinion/573870/united-states-v-martha-tabares-united-states-v-ramiro-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 411 (1st Cir.1991) (fake social security number not material), and United States v. Belletiere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588119\"><a href=\"/opinion/588119/united-states-v-ronald-belletiere/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span>, 968 (3rd Cir.1992) (lying about prior drug use not material).  Yet each of those cases made clear that materiality is a case-by-case issue, and that identical falsehoods could be material elsewhere.  Belletiere, 971 F.2d at 968 (\"misstatement was not material to the probation officer's investigation in this particular case\" ) (emphasis added);  Tabares, 951 F.2d at 411 (\"however material [the false statement] might have been in some other case, it does not seem 'material' in this one\").  Thus, the question to be addressed is whether, in the case at bar, the defendant's statements could have interfered with the district judge's proper carrying out of the sentencing function had the falsity of those statements not been discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge explained that in this case the false statements were material because it was his practice when sentencing an illegal alien to suspend supervised release from the time the defendant is deported until, and if, he returns to the United States.  The judge explained that when a defendant is deported there is (1) no way for the defendant to comply with his release requirements, and (2) no way for the supervisor to supervise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Biyaga contends that the court can have no reasonable concern about supervising someone not on American soil, so a falsehood affecting whether a period of supervised release is suspended cannot be considered material.  Biyaga's argument falls short.  The judge stated a connection between citizenship and the discretionary sentencing decision of whether to suspend supervised release.  By definition, then, Biyaga's falsehood involved information material to sentencing.  Biyaga is also incorrect that the district judge's sentencing practice is irrational.  The judge's explanation indicates a reasonable concern that, in the event a defendant returns to the United States after deportation, he then be subject to the full period of supervised release.  It was clearly within the district court's discretion to find appellant's misrepresentation as to citizenship to be material in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n        <p>1 U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 (1992) directs the sentencing judge to increase the Guidelines offense level by two \"[i]f the defendant willfully impeded or obstructed, or attempted to impede or obstruct, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that Biyaga's sentence is supportable elsewhere in the record.  Biyaga lied about his citizenship not only to the probation officer, but also to the magistrate judge during his bail hearing.  Application note 3(f) to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 suggests the two-point enhancement for providing materially false information to a judge or magistrate.  As citizenship is material to the issue of bail, Biyaga's misrepresentation to the magistrate judge fits the definition of obstruction of justice under section 3C1.1.  Although the district judge never reached this issue in overruling Biyaga's objection to the enhancement, we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record.  U.S. v.
