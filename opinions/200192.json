Betty B. Fletcher,      of   the   Ninth   Circuit,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.             This is an appeal from an\n\norder of the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts,      entered   on   February         13,   2002,   denying   Donald\n\nCreighton's petition for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.\n\nAfter a Massachusetts Superior Court judge declared a mistrial,\n\nCreighton was retried by a newly impaneled jury and convicted of\n\nrape, kidnapping, and assault and battery.                  He asserts that the\n\nsecond trial and the resulting convictions violated his federal\n\nconstitutional right against double jeopardy.                     Both the state\n\nSuperior and Appellate Courts held that the second trial and\n\nultimate convictions were not barred by the double jeopardy clause.\n\nApplying the highly deferential standard of review prescribed by\n\nAEDPA, we affirm.\n\n                                          I\n\n            On October 15, 1992, a grand jury indicted Creighton for\n\nrape, kidnapping, and assault and battery.                Creighton's jury trial\n\nbegan on January 27, 1993.           On direct examination, the victim\n\ntestified    that   Creighton      held       her   against   her   will    in   his\n\napartment, beat her with his fists, slapped her repeatedly, and\n\nthen raped her.       On cross-examination, after the victim denied\n\nbeing under the influence of any substance on the day in question,\n\nthe court sustained an objection to defense counsel's question\n\nregarding the last time she had been under the influence of a\n\nsubstance.   The victim also testified that the medical examination\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fperformed on her the night of her alleged rape indicated that the\n\nphysician had found no bruises.\n\n          Creighton testified in his own defense.                    On direct\n\nexamination, he testified that he and the victim had engaged in\n\nconsensual intercourse, after which she demanded $300.               He denied\n\never holding the victim against her will or abusing her in any way.\n\nHe also testified that after he refused to pay her, she threatened\n\nto accuse him of rape and to return with a male friend presumably\n\nto obtain the money. Approximately twenty minutes after the victim\n\ndeparted, Creighton left his apartment.\n\n          On       cross-examination,      after     the   prosecutor    asked\n\nCreighton about why he left his apartment after the incident, the\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\nProsecutor:          Were you afraid these people were going to come\n                     back and get you, is that why you left?\nCreighton:           I had mixed feelings. You know, I felt very much\n                     -- I felt that I was in the dark. You know, I\n                     felt that I was deceived.\nProsecutor:          Yes?\nCreighton:           You know I didn't know what her motives were.\nProsecutor:          Sure?\nCreighton:           I didn't know, at this time, that she used drugs.\n                     She shot heroin and stuff.1\nProsecutor:          You didn't know that, no?\nCreighton:           No.\n\n             The   prosecutor   returned    to     her   initial   question   of\n\nwhether Creighton had left because he was afraid of something.\n\n\n\n     1\n      At the probable cause hearing, the victim acknowledged using\nheroin roughly three times a week but denied using heroin on the\nday of the alleged incident.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fAfter Creighton's response, the court sua sponte provided the\n\nfollowing curative instruction: \"Let me just tell the Jury, on that\n\nreference, to the use of drugs.               There's absolutely no evidence\n\nthat the alleged victim in this case, used or uses drugs, and you\n\nare to disregard that, and you're not to mention that in your\n\ndeliberations.       Go ahead.\"\n\n          The following colloquy then occurred:\n\nProsecutor:           Thank you.\nCreighton:            There's testimony --\nThe Court:            Hold on. Wait a minute, Mr. Creighton.\nCreighton:            -- there's testimony of probable cause --\nThe Court:            Mr. Creighton, stop it. Stop it!\nCreighton:            -- that she used drugs.\nThe Court:            Okay. Bring him out right now and the jury may\n                      be excused.\nCreighton:            You just don't want the jury to know --\nThe Court:            Mistrial.\nCreighton:            -- like she was.\n\n             The transcript quoted above fails to fully depict what\n\noccurred in the courtroom.        An audiotape of the proceedings, which\n\nis part of the record, reveals that as Creighton continued to speak\n\nover the court's instructions not to do so, the trial judge's voice\n\nbecame progressively louder, and, at one point, she banged her fist\n\non the bench.    Her last \"Stop it\" was considerably louder than her\n\nprevious declarations and voiced in a high-pitched, excited tone.\n\n             After   ordering     the   mistrial     and    as   she   headed    for\n\nchambers, she held Creighton in contempt of court.                     Two minutes\n\nafter   departing      the   courtroom,       the   judge    returned     and,   in\n\nCreighton's but not the jury's presence, stated: \"Okay, I said the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fword mistrial, but I don't think the Jury knows what I meant by\n\nthat. I'd just as soon continue with this case and with this Jury,\n\nunless there's an objection and somebody moves for a mistrial.\"\n\nAfter conferring with Creighton, defense counsel moved for a\n\nmistrial, explaining that although he \"underst[ood] that [the\n\ndeclaration of mistrial] was as the result of the conduct of [his]\n\nclient,\" he believed that the declaration coupled with Creighton\n\nbeing held in contempt of court in front of the jury prejudiced the\n\njury   against   Creighton    and   no   instruction    would      remove    that\n\nprejudice.    The trial judge agreed and granted Creighton's request\n\nfor a mistrial and admonished Creighton not to let it happen again.\n\nCreighton    attempted   to   respond,    but   this   time   he    heeded   her\n\ndirective to stop.       She then called back the jury and discharged\n\nthem from the case.\n\n             The following Monday, Creighton moved to dismiss the\n\nindictments against him on the ground that a retrial would be\n\nbarred by the double jeopardy clause, and moved to recuse the judge\n\nfrom presiding over the second trial.              The court denied both\n\nmotions.\n\n             Seeking review of his motion to dismiss, Creighton moved\n\nto stay the second trial and filed a petition, under Mass. Gen. Law\n\nch. 211, ยง 3, along with the audiotape of the relevant portion of\n\nthe trial proceedings, to the single justice of the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\").            After a hearing, the single\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fjustice denied the petition.        No appeal was taken to the full\n\ncourt.    Commonwealth v. Creighton, 666 N.E.2d 1298, 1298 (Mass.\n\n1996).\n\n            Creighton was subsequently retried by a newly impaneled\n\njury, with the same Superior Court judge presiding, and convicted\n\nof rape, kidnapping, and assault and battery.\n\n                                    II\n\nA.          Reconsideration of First Petition to Dismiss\n\n            On June 16, 1995, Creighton filed a second petition to\n\nthe single justice of the SJC, seeking reconsideration of the\n\ndenial of his first petition.        The single justice again denied\n\nrelief.     The SJC affirmed that decision on the procedural ground\n\nthat Creighton had failed to appeal the denial of his initial\n\npetition.    In January 1997, Creighton filed a motion for release\n\nfrom illegal incarceration, pursuant to Mass. Crim. Pro. R. 30[a],\n\narguing that the second trial was barred by double jeopardy. After\n\na hearing the Superior Court denied this motion.\n\nB.          Direct Appeal\n\n            Creighton   appealed   his   convictions   and   the   Superior\n\nCourt's denial of his motion for release from illegal incarceration\n\nto the Massachusetts Appeals Court. The Appeals Court affirmed the\n\nunderlying convictions and the denial of his motion for a new\n\ntrial.    See Commonwealth v. Creighton, No. 96-P-1898 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. Aug. 6, 1998) (unpublished opinion). It held that the manifest\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fnecessity      test    did    not    apply     in    these    circumstances      because\n\nalthough      the     trial     judge       first    said     \"mistrial,\"    Creighton\n\neffectively \"pulled the plug\" on the first trial by requesting the\n\nmistrial.      Id. at 1-2.2         The court rejected Creighton's claim that\n\nthe   manifest      necessity        test    should    apply    because     he   had   no\n\nopportunity to consent to the trial court's sua sponte declaration\n\nof mistrial before she \"'rushed from the bench,'\" reasoning that\n\nthe trial judge was entitled to \"cool off,\" and, in any case, the\n\njudge returned and gave Creighton a full opportunity to be heard.\n\nId. at 2-3.      Finally, finding that the trial judge's \"conduct did\n\nnot   evidence      any   bad    faith,\"       the    court    rejected     Creighton's\n\ncontention that the record demonstrated that the trial judge had\n\n\"'lied'\" to the jury or acted in such a way as to bar a retrial.\n\nId. at 1 (citing United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 611\n\n\n\n      2\n          The court explained:\n\n              When the judge returned to the bench--having\n              stifled [Creighton]'s attempt inappropriately\n              to   sully   the   victim's   reputation--her\n              inclination to continue the trial with the\n              same jury was ill-advised. However, although\n              it was the judge who first uttered the word\n              \"mistrial,\" it was defense counsel who pulled\n              the plug and urged the declaration of a\n              mistrial. In these circumstances, we need not\n              apply the manifest necessity test. Where the\n              defendant originates the request for a\n              mistrial or expresses agreement with the idea,\n              ordinarily double jeopardy will not prevent a\n              retrial.\n\nId. at 2 (citations omitted).\n\n                                             -7-\n\f(1976)). Finally, the Appeals Court rejected Creighton's challenge\n\nto the trial judge's sua sponte instruction to the jury regarding\n\nthe victim's alleged drug use, explaining that these \"inappropriate\n\nremarks    were    made   on   cross-examination      and      that    his   answers\n\ncontained information which the judge considered both nonresponsive\n\nand inadmissible.\"        Id. at 3 (citations omitted).          His application\n\nfor further appellate review to the SJC was denied on October 27,\n\n1998.\n\nC.             District Court's Memorandum of Decision\n\n               After exhausting his state remedies, Creighton timely\n\nfiled a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n2254,    asserting     that    his   convictions    after      the    second   trial\n\nviolated his federal constitutional right against double jeopardy.\n\nCreighton v. Hall, No. Civ.A. 99-12215, 2002 WL 745843 (D. Mass.\n\nFebruary 12, 2002). In dismissing the petition, the district court\n\nheld that the state court's denial of Creighton's double jeopardy\n\nclaim    was    not   contrary   to,    or   a   result   of    an    unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent.                     The\n\ncourt agreed that Creighton had \"pulled the plug\" on the first\n\ntrial by requesting the mistrial and, thus, the manifest necessity\n\ntest did not apply.       The court also held that Creighton had failed\n\nto rebut by clear and convincing evidence the state court's factual\n\ndetermination that the trial judge's conduct did not evidence bad\n\nfaith.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            Creighton filed a timely notice of appeal on February 26,\n\n2002.\n\n                                       III\n\n            We review the federal district court's denial of a writ\n\nof habeas corpus de novo.        See Almanzar v. Maloney, 281 F.3d 300,\n\n303 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            The   Anti-terrorism    and      Effective   Death   Penalty       Act\n\n(\"AEDPA\") significantly limits the scope of federal habeas review.\n\nAEDPA precludes the granting of habeas relief to a state prisoner,\n\nunless the state court decision was \"contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"                 28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 2254(d)(1).     A decision is \"contrary to\" federal law if the state\n\ncourt applies a legal principle different from the governing\n\nprincipal set forth in Supreme Court cases, or if the state court\n\ndecides   the     case   differently     from   a   Supreme    Court    case    on\n\nmaterially indistinguishable facts.           Bell v. Cone, 122 S.Ct. 1843,\n\n1850, ___ U.S. ___ (2002) (citing            Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.\n\n362, 405 (2000)).\n\n            To hold that a state court's decision is an \"unreasonable\n\napplication\" of clearly established federal law, the federal habeas\n\ncourt must find that \"the state court correctly identifie[d] the\n\ngoverning   legal    principle    from    [Supreme    Court]    decisions      but\n\nunreasonably applie[d] it to the facts of the particular case.\"\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fBell, 122 S.Ct. at 1850.         In making this determination, a federal\n\nhabeas court \"should ask whether the state court's application of\n\nclearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.\"\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 409.        We are mindful that in order to grant\n\nhabeas   relief    the   state    court    decision    must   be   objectively\n\nunreasonable as opposed to merely incorrect. Williams, 529 U.S. at\n\n411 (\"A federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because\n\nthe court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant\n\nstate-court   decision     applied       clearly   established     federal   law\n\nerroneously or incorrectly.        Rather, that application must also be\n\nunreasonable.\").     Finally, our focus \"is not how well reasoned the\n\nstate court decision is, but whether the outcome is reasonable.\"\n\nHurtado v. Tucker, 245 F.3d 7, 20 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied,\n\n122 S.Ct. 282 (2001).\n\n           AEDPA also provides habeas relief when the state court\n\ndecision was based on \"an unreasonable determination of the facts\n\nin light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(2).      However, the federal habeas court shall\n\npresume that the state court's determination of factual issues is\n\ncorrect and petitioner has \"the burden of rebutting the presumption\n\nof   correctness    by   clear     and    convincing   evidence.\"       Id.   ยง\n\n2254(e)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f                                     IV\n\n          With this framework in mind, we turn now to Creighton's\n\nclaims. Creighton maintains that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred\n\nhis retrial because the court declared the mistrial sua sponte\n\nabsent manifest necessity and, alternatively, the trial judge's\n\nconduct was intended to provoke Creighton to request a mistrial.\n\nA.        Clearly Established Federal Law\n\n          The    Double   Jeopardy    Clause   of   the   Fifth   Amendment\n\nprotects a criminal defendant against \"repeated prosecutions for\n\nthe same offense\" and affords the defendant the right \"'to have his\n\ntrial completed by a particular tribunal.'\"               United States v.\n\nDinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 606 (1976) (quoting Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S.\n\n684, 689 (1949)); see also Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 671\n\n(1982).   The Supreme Court has directly addressed the double\n\njeopardy implications of a trial court's sua sponte declaration of\n\na mistrial.     If a judge declares a mistrial over the objection of\n\nthe defendant, a retrial will be barred unless the mistrial was\n\njustified by manifest necessity. Kennedy, 456 U.S. at 672; Dinitz,\n\n424 U.S. at 606-607.      If, on the other hand, a defendant requests\n\nor consents to a mistrial, the \"manifest necessity\" standard does\n\nnot apply and the Double Jeopardy Clause ordinarily will not bar\n\nretrial, even when the request or consent to a mistrial is in\n\nresponse to prosecutorial or judicial error.         Kennedy, 456 U.S. at\n\n672-73; Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 607-10.       The Supreme Court, in Dinitz,\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fmade clear that \"[t]he important consideration, for purposes of the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary\n\ncontrol over the course to be followed in the event of such\n\n[judicial or prosecutorial] error.\" 424 U.S. at 609. However, the\n\nSupreme Court has recognized a narrow exception to this rule: A\n\nretrial will be barred where the defendant's request or consent to\n\na mistrial is necessitated by judicial or prosecutorial conduct\n\n\"intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\"\n\nKennedy, 456 U.S. at 679.\n\n              With these principles in mind, we look to the state\n\ncourt's decision and ask whether the decision was contrary to, or\n\nan objectively unreasonable application of, the above-mentioned\n\nSupreme Court precedents.\n\nB.            Contrary To Clearly Established Federal Law\n\n              We can easily dispose of the \"contrary to\" prong as we\n\nfind   that    the   Appeals   Court    correctly   identified   the   legal\n\nprinciples set forth in Dinitz and its progeny as governing the\n\nmerits of Creighton's double jeopardy claim.         Although the Appeals\n\nCourt relied heavily on state court decisions, those decisions\n\nrelied directly upon Supreme Court precedent, including Dinitz, for\n\nthe legal principles outlined above.          See, e.g., Commonwealth v.\n\nAndrews, 530 N.E.2d 1222, 1225-26 (1988) (citing Dinitz, 424 U.S.\n\n600); Jones v. Commonwealth, 397 N.E.2d 1187, 1192 (1979) (rev'd on\n\nother grounds, 400 N.E.2d 242 (Mass. 1980)). Moreover, the Appeals\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fCourt      itself   cited    to   Dinitz   in    the    portion    of    its    opinion\n\naddressing the applicability of the bad faith exception.                       Finally,\n\nwe   have     found   no    Supreme    Court     case    with    facts    \"materially\n\nindistinguishable\" from those in the case before us.                           We hold,\n\ntherefore, that the state court's decision was not \"contrary to\"\n\nclearly established federal law.\n\nC.             Unreasonable Application of Clearly Established Federal\n               Law\n\n               We also conclude that the state court's decision did not\n\nresult from an objectively unreasonable application of clearly\n\nestablished Supreme Court precedent.3                  We reiterate that the key\n\nissue for double jeopardy purposes \"is that the defendant retain\n\nprimary control over the course to be followed in the event of\"\n\njudicial error that necessitates a mistrial.                    Dinitz, 424 U.S. at\n\n609.       Here, two minutes after sua sponte declaring a mistrial and\n\nleaving the courtroom, but before discharging the jury, the trial\n\njudge returned to the courtroom and stated her desire to continue\n\nwith the first trial unless either party objected to continuing or\n\nrequested       a   mistrial.         After     conferring      with     his    client,\n\nCreighton's trial counsel availed himself of this opportunity and\n\nrequested a mistrial. Thus for double jeopardy purposes, Creighton\n\n\n       3\n      Although it appears that the Appeals Court might have held,\nin the alternative, that there was manifest necessity to declare a\nmistrial, we need not reach that question because we find that the\nstate court reasonably concluded that Creighton requested the\nmistrial and found that the trial judge's conduct did not evidence\nbad faith.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fhad a choice \"over the course to be followed\" in his prosecution.\n\nHe could either have taken his chances with the first trial, the\n\npossibility of a reversal on appeal if convicted, and a subsequent\n\nretrial, or he could, as he did, have ended the first trial.                      The\n\nchoice was his to make.            Because the trial judge returned to the\n\nbench and provided Creighton with an opportunity to be heard before\n\nthe jury was discharged, we cannot say that the Appeals Court\n\ndecision resulted from an objectively unreasonable application of\n\nDinitz and its progeny.\n\n              In response, Creighton raises two arguments, neither of\n\nwhich we find persuasive.           First he argues that because he had no\n\nmeaningful opportunity to object or consent to a mistrial before\n\nthe   trial    judge     \"rushed    from     the   bench,\"     the    Appeals   Court\n\nunreasonably held that the manifest necessity test did not apply.\n\nAccording to Creighton, the mistrial was a fait accompli the moment\n\nthe trial judge left the courtroom and, accordingly, his request\n\nfor a mistrial after she returned is without legal significance.\n\n              We disagree. Not only does Creighton fail to cite to any\n\nSupreme Court cases, and we have found none, supporting this\n\nproposition,        he   also   fails   to   explain    why    the    trial    judge's\n\ndeparture is dispositive.           Insofar as he contends that the court's\n\nutterance      is    somehow     talismanic        or   that    the    court    lacks\n\njurisdiction or discretion to reconsider her order of mistrial once\n\nshe left the courtroom, existing federal case law supports the\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fopposite conclusion.4 See, e.g., United States v. Segura-Gallegos,\n\n41 F.3d 1266, 1271 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding that no error occurred\n\nwhere the trial court reconsidered and reversed its order of\n\nmistrial because \"[u]ntil the jury is excused, the court may\n\nreconsider its intention to declare a mistrial\") (citing United\n\nStates v. Smith 621 F.2d 350, 352 n.2 (9th Cir. 1980), cert.\n\ndenied, 449 U.S. 1087 (1981)); Cambden v. Circuit Ct. of 2nd\n\nJudicial Cir., 892 F.2d 610, 617 n.7 (7th Cir. 1989) (\"While the\n\nmistrial declaration alone was not a talismanic utterance, the\n\ndischarge and dispersal of the jury rendered the mistrial a fait\n\naccompli.\"), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 921 (1990)); c.f. United States\n\nv. DiPietro, 936 F.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1991) (in holding that mere\n\nsilence constitutes tacit consent to a mistrial where the defendant\n\nfailed to object to a sua sponte declaration of mistrial, the court\n\nexplained that, even though the jury had been dismissed when the\n\nmistrial was declared, \"the court could have asked the jury to\n\nremain while reconsidering its decision.\").              The federal cases\n\nrelied   upon   by   Creighton   do   not    hold   otherwise   and   are   all\n\nfactually distinguishable as the defendants in those cases were not\n\n\n\n     4\n      Although the \"Supreme Court has made clear . . . that AEDPA\nprecludes federal courts from disturbing state court judgments by\nrelying on precedents created by federal courts of appeals,\"\nAlmanzar, 281 F.3d at 304 n.3, reference to factually similar cases\nfrom inferior federal courts is appropriate in assessing the\nreasonableness of a state court's application \"when the relevant\nSupreme Court rule is broad and applies to a kaleidoscopic array of\nfact patterns.\" Rashad v. Walsh, 300 F.3d 27, 35 (2002).\n\n                                      -15-\n\fprovided with an opportunity to object or consent to a mistrial.\n\nLovinger, 845 F.2d 739; Brady v. Samah, 667 F.2d 224 (1st Cir.\n\n1981).   Given that the trial judge had not discharged the jury and\n\nthat she returned and provided Creighton with an opportunity to\n\nrequest a mistrial, we do not see how the fact that the trial judge\n\nleft the courtroom for a short recess affects the issue here:\n\nWhether Creighton \"retained primary control over the course to be\n\nfollowed\" in his case.   In any case, we cannot say that it was an\n\nobjectively unreasonable application of Dinitz and its progeny for\n\nthe Appeals Court to conclude that the trial judge could take a\n\nrecess to \"cool off\" and return, at which time she could reconsider\n\nher motion and provide defendant with an opportunity to be heard.\n\n           In the alternative, Creighton secondly contends that he\n\ndid not voluntarily request a mistrial because the trial judge's\n\nconduct forced him to a \"Hobson's choice,\" and, therefore, his\n\nrequest for a mistrial has no legal significance.        This very\n\nargument was raised and rejected in Dinitz and thus we find that\n\nCreighton's argument is without merit.   424 U.S. at 609-10.\n\n           In sum, the Appeals Court reasonably concluded that\n\nbecause Creighton had an opportunity to request a mistrial and did\n\nso, the manifest necessity test did not apply and retrial was not\n\nbarred absent a finding of judicial conduct intended to provoke\n\nCreighton into requesting a mistrial.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fD.         Unreasonable Determination of the Facts\n\n           Finally, Creighton challenges the Appeals Court's factual\n\ndetermination that the trial judge's conduct did not evidence bad\n\nfaith. We reiterate that Creighton must clear a high hurdle before\n\nwe will set aside the Appeals Court's factual determination: He\n\nmust rebut the presumption of correctness of the Appeals Court's\n\nfactual determination by clear and convincing evidence.         28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 2254(e)(1).     After    reviewing     the    record thoroughly and\n\nlistening to the audiotape, the most that we can say is that the\n\ntrial judge became excited only after Creighton failed to stop\n\nspeaking over the court's repeated instructions not to do so.\n\n           Even were we to accept Creighton's view that the court's\n\ninstruction to the jury to disregard his testimony regarding the\n\nvictim's alleged drug use was improper, which we doubt, it is pure\n\nspeculation that the court gave the instruction with the intent to\n\nprovoke the mistrial.      Creighton contends that throughout the\n\ntrial, the trial court had aligned itself with the prosecution to\n\nconvict   him.   He   claimed   this   was   evidenced   by   the   court's\n\nprejudiced evidentiary rulings and its attack on his credibility\n\nthrough its sua sponte jury instruction, all brought about by the\n\ncourt's realization that the Commonwealth would lose its case due\n\nto the victim's inconsistent testimony.        There is no support for\n\nthis in the record; in fact, the opposite appears to be true.           To\n\nsupport his theory, Creighton claims that the trial court deprived\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fhim of the use of the victim's medical examination, which would\n\nhave shown that he did not ejaculate during intercourse and that he\n\ndid not beat or slap her.           However, Creighton himself testified\n\nthat he did, in fact, ejaculate during intercourse with the victim,\n\nand the victim herself testified that her medical examination\n\nindicated   that     no   bruises    were    found.       Even    more    damning,\n\nCreighton's defense counsel rejected the Commonwealth's offer to\n\nadmit the victim's medical examination.                 And when asked by the\n\ncourt whether he planned on introducing the victim's medical\n\nexamination, the defense counsel said \"no.\"\n\n            Moreover, Creighton's allegations of judicial bias are\n\nbelied by the court's numerous evidentiary rulings made in his\n\nfavor over the Commonwealth's objections.                 For example, on the\n\nmorning of the mistrial, the court ruled, over the Commonwealth's\n\nrepeated objections, that defense counsel would be permitted to\n\ncall Dr. DeFazio, the doctor who examined the victim after the\n\nalleged rape, to testify regarding the results of the Johnson Rape\n\nKit and to impeach the victim's testimony that she did not have\n\nintercourse that day.       The court also ruled that the victim could\n\nbe   recalled   to    the   stand    to     be   impeached   with      her     prior\n\nprostitution charge.        In addition, the record reflects that the\n\njudge had permitted defense counsel, on cross examination, to\n\nimpeach the     victim's    credibility      with   a    number   of     her   prior\n\nconvictions.\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f            In sum, Creighton has pointed to no evidence in the\n\nrecord that compels us to conclude that the trial judge acted in\n\nbad faith with intent to provoke him to request a mistrial.\n\n                                  V\n\n            We are not without concern about the circumstances of\n\nthis case.   Creighton had little choice but to request a mistrial\n\nafter his sparring match with the court that took place in front of\n\nthe jury.      However, under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254, it is immaterial\n\nwhether we would have, in the first instance, decided the case\n\ndifferently.     See Williams, 529 U.S. at 411.    We only need to\n\nconclude, as we do, that the Appeals Court applied the principles\n\nidentified in Dinitz to the facts of this case in an objectively\n\nreasonable manner.    Finding that the state court decision was not\n\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nSupreme Court precedent, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

After a Massachusetts Superior Court judge declared a mistrial, Creighton was retried by a newly impaneled jury and convicted of rape, kidnapping, and assault and battery. He asserts that the second trial and the resulting convictions violated his federal constitutional right against double jeopardy. Both the state Superior and Appellate Courts held that the second trial and ultimate convictions were not barred by the double jeopardy clause. Applying the highly deferential standard of review prescribed by AEDPA, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* On October 15, 1992, a grand jury indicted Creighton for rape, kidnapping, and assault and battery. Creighton's jury trial began on January 27, 1993. On direct examination, the victim testified that Creighton held her against her will in his apartment, beat her with his fists, slapped her repeatedly, and then raped her. On cross-examination, after the victim denied being under the influence of any substance on the day in question, the court sustained an objection to defense counsel's question regarding the last time she had been under the influence of a substance. The victim also testified that the medical examination performed on her the night of her alleged rape indicated that the physician had found no bruises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Creighton testified in his own defense. On direct examination, he testified that he and the victim had engaged in consensual intercourse, after which she demanded $300. He denied ever holding the victim against her will or abusing her in any way. He also testified that after he refused to pay her, she threatened to accuse him of rape and to return with a male friend presumably to obtain the money. Approximately twenty minutes after the victim departed, Creighton left his apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, after the prosecutor asked Creighton about why he left his apartment after the incident, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prosecutor: Were you afraid these people were going to come back and get you, is that why you left?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Creighton: I had mixed feelings.

After Creighton's response, the court <i>sua sponte</i> provided the following curative instruction: \"Let me just tell the Jury, on that reference, to the use of drugs. There's absolutely no evidence that the alleged victim in this case, used or uses drugs, and you are to disregard that, and you're not to mention that in your deliberations. Go ahead.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prosecutor: Thank you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Creighton: There's testimony &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Hold on.

An audiotape of the proceedings, which is part of the record, reveals that as Creighton continued to speak over the court's instructions not to do so, the trial judge's voice became progressively louder, and, at one point, she banged her fist on the bench. Her last \"Stop it\" was considerably louder than her previous declarations and voiced in a high-pitched, excited tone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After ordering the mistrial and as she headed for chambers, she held Creighton in contempt of court. Two minutes after departing the courtroom, the judge returned and, in Creighton's but not the jury's presence, stated: \"Okay, I said the word mistrial, but I don't think the Jury knows what I meant by that. I'd just as soon continue with this case and with this Jury, unless there's an objection and somebody moves for a mistrial.\" After conferring with Creighton, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, explaining that although he \"underst[ood] that [the declaration of mistrial] was as the result of the conduct of [his] client,\" he believed that the declaration coupled with Creighton being held in contempt of court in front of the jury prejudiced the jury against Creighton and no instruction would remove that prejudice. The trial judge agreed and granted Creighton's request for a mistrial and admonished Creighton not to let it happen again. Creighton attempted to respond, but this time he heeded her directive to stop. She then called back the jury and discharged them from the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following Monday, Creighton moved to dismiss the indictments against him on the ground that a retrial would be barred by the double jeopardy clause, and moved to recuse the judge from presiding over the second trial. The court denied both motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking review of his motion to dismiss, Creighton moved to stay the second trial and filed a petition, under Mass. Gen. Law ch. 211, &#167; 3, along with the audiotape of the relevant portion of the trial proceedings, to the single justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\"). After a hearing, the single justice denied the petition. No appeal was taken to the full court. <i>Creighton v.

The single justice again denied relief. The SJC affirmed that decision on the procedural ground that Creighton had failed to appeal the denial of his initial petition. In January 1997, Creighton filed a motion for release from illegal incarceration, pursuant to Mass.Crim. Pro. R. 30[a], arguing that the second trial was barred by double jeopardy. After a hearing the Superior Court denied this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Direct Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Creighton appealed his convictions and the Superior Court's denial of his motion for release from illegal incarceration to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. The Appeals Court affirmed the underlying convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial. <i>See Commonwealth v. Creighton,</i> 700 N.E.2d 1201, 45 Mass.App.Ct. 1112 (1998) (unpublished opinion).

Hall,</i> No. Civ.A. 99-12215, 2002 WL 745843 (D.Mass.2002). In dismissing the petition, the district court held that the state court's denial of Creighton's double jeopardy claim was not contrary to, or a result of an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. The court agreed that Creighton had \"pulled the plug\" on the first trial by requesting the mistrial and, thus, the manifest necessity test did not apply. The court also held that Creighton had failed to rebut by clear and convincing evidence the state court's factual determination that the trial judge's conduct did not evidence bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Creighton filed a timely notice of appeal on February 26, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the federal district court's denial of a writ of habeas corpus <i>de novo.

Creighton maintains that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred his retrial because the court declared the mistrial <i>sua sponte</i> absent manifest necessity and, alternatively, the trial judge's conduct was intended to provoke Creighton to request a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Dinitz,</i> 424 U.S. 600, 606, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976) (quoting <i>Wade v. Hunter,</i> 336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949)); <i>see also Oregon v. Kennedy,</i> 456 U.S. 667, 671, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). The Supreme Court has directly addressed the double jeopardy implications of a trial court's <i>sua sponte</i> declaration of a mistrial. If a judge declares a mistrial over the objection of the defendant, a retrial will be barred unless the mistrial was justified by manifest necessity. <i>Kennedy,</i> 456 U.S. at 672, 102 S.Ct. 2083; <i>Dinitz,</i> 424 U.S. at 606-607, 96 S.Ct. 1075. If, on the other hand, a defendant requests or consents to a mistrial, the \"manifest necessity\" standard does not apply and the Double Jeopardy Clause ordinarily will not bar retrial, even when the request or consent to a mistrial is in response to prosecutorial or judicial error. <i>Kennedy,</i> 456 U.S. at 672-73, 102 S.Ct. 2083; <i>Dinitz,</i> 424 U.S. at 607-10, 96 S.Ct. 1075. The Supreme Court, in <i>Dinitz,</i> made clear that \"[t]he important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of such [judicial or prosecutorial] error.\" 424 U.S. at 609, 96 S.Ct. 1075. However, the Supreme Court has recognized a narrow exception to this rule: A retrial will be barred where the defendant's request or consent to a mistrial is necessitated by judicial or prosecutorial conduct \"intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\" <i>Kennedy,</i> 456 U.S. at 679, 102 S.Ct. 2083.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in mind, we look to the state court's decision and ask whether the decision was contrary to, or an objectively unreasonable application of, the above-mentioned Supreme Court precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Although the Appeals Court relied heavily on state court decisions, those decisions relied directly upon Supreme Court precedent, including <i>Dinitz,</i> for the legal principles outlined above. <i>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Andrews,</i> 403 Mass. 441, 530 N.E.2d 1222, 1225-26 (1988) (citing <i>Dinitz,</i> 424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267); <i>Jones v.

Moreover, the Appeals Court itself cited to <i>Dinitz</i> in the portion of its opinion addressing the applicability of the bad faith exception. Finally, we have found no Supreme Court case with facts \"materially indistinguishable\" from those in the case before us. We hold, therefore, that the state court's decision was not \"contrary to\" clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Here, two minutes after <i>sua sponte</i> declaring a mistrial and leaving the courtroom, but before discharging the jury, the trial judge returned to the courtroom and stated her desire to continue with the first trial unless either party objected to continuing or requested a mistrial. After conferring with his client, Creighton's trial counsel availed himself of this opportunity and requested a mistrial. Thus for double jeopardy purposes, Creighton had a choice \"over the course to be followed\" in his prosecution. He could either have taken his chances with the first trial, the possibility of a reversal on appeal if convicted, and a subsequent retrial, or he could, as he did, have ended the first trial. The choice was his to make. Because the trial judge returned to the bench and provided Creighton with an opportunity to be heard before the jury was discharged, we cannot say that the Appeals Court decision resulted from an objectively unreasonable application of <i>Dinitz</i> and its progeny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Creighton raises two arguments, neither of which we find persuasive. First he argues that because he had no meaningful opportunity to object or consent to a mistrial <i>before</i> the trial judge \"rushed from the bench,\" the Appeals Court unreasonably held that the manifest necessity test did not apply. According to Creighton, the mistrial was a <i>fait accompli</i> the moment the trial judge left the courtroom and, accordingly, his request for a mistrial after she returned is without legal significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. Not only does Creighton fail to cite to any Supreme Court cases, and we have found none, supporting this proposition, he also fails to explain why the trial judge's departure is dispositive. Insofar as he contends that the court's utterance is somehow talismanic or that the court lacks jurisdiction or discretion to reconsider her order of mistrial once she left the courtroom, existing federal case law supports the opposite conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See, e.g., United States v. Segura-Gallegos,</i> 41 F.3d 1266, 1271 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that no error occurred where the trial court reconsidered and reversed its order of mistrial because \"[u]ntil the jury is excused, the court may reconsider its intention to declare a mistrial\") (citing <i>United States v. Smith</i> 621 F.2d 350, 352 n. 2 (9th Cir.1980), <i>cert. denied,</i> 449 U.S. 1087, 101 S.Ct. 877, 66 L.Ed.2d 813 (1981)); <i>Camden v. Circuit Ct. of 2nd Judicial Cir.,</i> 892 F.2d 610, 617 n. 7 (7th Cir.1989) (\"While the mistrial declaration alone was not a talismanic utterance, the discharge and dispersal of the jury rendered the mistrial a <i>fait accompli.</i>\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 495 U.S. 921, 110 S.Ct. 1954, 109 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990); <i>cf. United States v. DiPietro,</i> 936 F.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir.1991) (in holding that mere silence constitutes tacit consent to a mistrial where the defendant failed to object to a <i>sua sponte</i> declaration of mistrial, the court explained that, even though the jury had been dismissed when the mistrial was declared, \"the court could have asked the jury to remain while reconsidering its decision.\"). The federal cases relied upon by Creighton do not hold otherwise and are all factually distinguishable as the defendants in those cases were not provided with an opportunity to object or consent to a mistrial. <i>Lovinger v. Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Ill.,</i> 845 F.2d 739; <i>Brady v. Samaha,</i> 667 F.2d 224 (1st Cir.1981). Given that the trial judge had not discharged the jury and that she returned and provided Creighton with an opportunity to request a mistrial, we do not see how the fact that the trial judge left the courtroom for a short recess affects the issue here: Whether Creighton \"retained primary control over the course to be followed\" in his case. In any case, we cannot say that it was an objectively unreasonable application of <i>Dinitz</i> and its progeny for the Appeals Court to conclude that the trial judge could take a recess to \"cool off\" and return, at which time she could reconsider her motion and provide defendant with an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Creighton secondly contends that he did not voluntarily request a mistrial because the trial judge's conduct forced him to a \"Hobson's choice,\" and, therefore, his request for a mistrial has no legal significance. This very argument was raised and rejected in <i>Dinitz</i> and thus we find that Creighton's argument is without merit. 424 U.S. at 609-10, 96 S.Ct. 1075.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Appeals Court reasonably concluded that because Creighton had an opportunity to request a mistrial and did so, the manifest necessity test did not apply and retrial was not barred absent a finding of judicial conduct intended to provoke Creighton into requesting a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Unreasonable Determination of the Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Creighton challenges the Appeals Court's factual determination that the trial judge's conduct did not evidence bad faith. We reiterate that Creighton must clear a high hurdle before we will set aside the Appeals Court's factual determination: He must rebut the presumption of correctness of the Appeals Court's factual determination by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1). After reviewing the record thoroughly and listening to the audiotape, the most that we can say is that the trial judge became excited only <i>after</i> Creighton failed to stop speaking over the court's repeated instructions not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to accept Creighton's view that the court's instruction to the jury to disregard his testimony regarding the victim's alleged drug use was improper, which we doubt, it is pure speculation that the court gave the instruction with the intent to provoke the mistrial. Creighton contends that throughout the trial, the trial court had aligned itself with the prosecution to convict him. He claimed this was evidenced by the court's prejudiced evidentiary rulings and its attack on his credibility through its <i>sua sponte</i> jury instruction, all brought about by the court's realization that the Commonwealth would lose its case due to the victim's inconsistent testimony. There is no support for this in the record; in fact, the opposite appears to be true. To support his theory, Creighton claims that the trial court deprived him of the use of the victim's medical examination, which would have shown that he did not ejaculate during intercourse and that he did not beat or slap her. However, Creighton himself testified that he did, in fact, ejaculate during intercourse with the victim, and the victim herself testified that her medical examination indicated that no bruises were found. Even more damning, Creighton's defense counsel rejected the Commonwealth's offer to admit the victim's medical examination. And when asked by the court whether he planned on introducing the victim's medical examination, the defense counsel said \"no.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Creighton's allegations of judicial bias are belied by the court's numerous evidentiary rulings made in his favor over the Commonwealth's objections. For example, on the morning of the mistrial, the court ruled, over the Commonwealth's repeated objections, that defense counsel would be permitted to call Dr. DeFazio, the doctor who examined the victim after the alleged rape, to testify regarding the results of the Johnson Rape Kit and to impeach the victim's testimony that she did not have intercourse that day. The court also ruled that the victim could be recalled to the stand to be impeached with her prior prostitution charge. In addition, the record reflects that the judge had permitted defense counsel, on cross examination, to impeach the victim's credibility with a number of her prior convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Creighton has pointed to no evidence in the record that compels us to conclude that the trial judge acted in bad faith with intent to provoke him to request a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not without concern about the circumstances of this case. Creighton had little choice but to request a mistrial after his sparring match with the court that took place in front of the jury. However, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, it is immaterial whether we would have, in the first instance, decided the case differently. <i>See Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495. We only need to conclude, as we do, that the Appeals Court applied the principles identified in <i>Dinitz</i> to the facts of this case in an objectively reasonable manner. Finding that the state court decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

After a Massachusetts Superior Court judge declared a mistrial, Creighton was retried by a newly impaneled jury and convicted of rape, kidnapping, and assault and battery. He asserts that the second trial and the resulting convictions violated his federal constitutional right against double jeopardy. Both the state Superior and Appellate Courts held that the second trial and ultimate convictions were not barred by the double jeopardy clause. Applying the highly deferential standard of review prescribed by AEDPA, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* On October 15, 1992, a grand jury indicted Creighton for rape, kidnapping, and assault and battery. Creighton's jury trial began on January 27, 1993. On direct examination, the victim testified that Creighton held her against her will in his apartment, beat her with his fists, slapped her repeatedly, and then raped her. On cross-examination, after the victim denied being under the influence of any substance on the day in question, the court sustained an objection to defense counsel's question regarding the last time she had been under the influence of a substance. The victim also testified that the medical examination performed on her the night of her alleged rape indicated that the physician had found no bruises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Creighton testified in his own defense. On direct examination, he testified that he and the victim had engaged in consensual intercourse, after which she demanded $300. He denied ever holding the victim against her will or abusing her in any way. He also testified that after he refused to pay her, she threatened to accuse him of rape and to return with a male friend presumably to obtain the money.

I'd just as soon continue with this case and with this Jury, unless there's an objection and somebody moves for a mistrial.\" After conferring with Creighton, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, explaining that although he \"underst[ood] that [the declaration of mistrial] was as the result of the conduct of [his] client,\" he believed that the declaration coupled with Creighton being held in contempt of court in front of the jury prejudiced the jury against Creighton and no instruction would remove that prejudice. The trial judge agreed and granted Creighton's request for a mistrial and admonished Creighton not to let it happen again. Creighton attempted to respond, but this time he heeded her directive to stop. She then called back the jury and discharged them from the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following Monday, Creighton moved to dismiss the indictments against him on the ground that a retrial would be barred by the double jeopardy clause, and moved to recuse the judge from presiding over the second trial.

In January 1997, Creighton filed a motion for release from illegal incarceration, pursuant to Mass.Crim. Pro. R. 30[a], arguing that the second trial was barred by double jeopardy.

Moreover, the Appeals Court itself cited to <i>Dinitz</i> in the portion of its opinion addressing the applicability of the bad faith exception. Finally, we have found no Supreme Court case with facts \"materially indistinguishable\" from those in the case before us. We hold, therefore, that the state court's decision was not \"contrary to\" clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span>. Here, two minutes after <i>sua sponte</i> declaring a mistrial and leaving the courtroom, but before discharging the jury, the trial judge returned to the courtroom and stated her desire to continue with the first trial unless either party objected to continuing or requested a mistrial. After conferring with his client, Creighton's trial counsel availed himself of this opportunity and requested a mistrial. Thus for double jeopardy purposes, Creighton had a choice \"over the course to be followed\" in his prosecution. He could either have taken his chances with the first trial, the possibility of a reversal on appeal if convicted, and a subsequent retrial, or he could, as he did, have ended the first trial. The choice was his to make. Because the trial judge returned to the bench and provided Creighton with an opportunity to be heard before the jury was discharged, we cannot say that the Appeals Court decision resulted from an objectively unreasonable application of <i>Dinitz</i> and its progeny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Creighton raises two arguments, neither of which we find persuasive. First he argues that because he had no meaningful opportunity to object or consent to a mistrial <i>before</i> the trial judge \"rushed from the bench,\" the Appeals Court unreasonably held that the manifest necessity test did not apply. According to Creighton, the mistrial was a <i>fait accompli</i> the moment the trial judge left the courtroom and, accordingly, his request for a mistrial after she returned is without legal significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. Not only does Creighton fail to cite to any Supreme Court cases, and we have found none, supporting this proposition, he also fails to explain why the trial judge's departure is dispositive. Insofar as he contends that the court's utterance is somehow talismanic or that the court lacks jurisdiction or discretion to reconsider her order of mistrial once she left the courtroom, existing federal case law supports the opposite conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The federal cases relied upon by Creighton do not hold otherwise and are all factually distinguishable as the defendants in those cases were not provided with an opportunity to object or consent to a mistrial. <i>Lovinger v. Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Ill.,</i> 845 F.2d 739; <i>Brady v. Samaha,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398206\"><a href=\"/opinion/398206/eileen-m-brady-martha-brickett-robert-r-cushing-jr-kristie-conrad/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1981). Given that the trial judge had not discharged the jury and that she returned and provided Creighton with an opportunity to request a mistrial, we do not see how the fact that the trial judge left the courtroom for a short recess affects the issue here: Whether Creighton \"retained primary control over the course to be followed\" in his case. In any case, we cannot say that it was an objectively unreasonable application of <i>Dinitz</i> and its progeny for the Appeals Court to conclude that the trial judge could take a recess to \"cool off\" and return, at which time she could reconsider her motion and provide defendant with an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Creighton secondly contends that he did not voluntarily request a mistrial because the trial judge's conduct forced him to a \"Hobson's choice,\" and, therefore, his request for a mistrial has no legal significance. This very argument was raised and rejected in <i>Dinitz</i> and thus we find that Creighton's argument is without merit. 424 U.S. at 609-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109395\"><a href=\"/opinion/109395/united-states-v-dinitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Appeals Court reasonably concluded that because Creighton had an opportunity to request a mistrial and did so, the manifest necessity test did not apply and retrial was not barred absent a finding of judicial conduct intended to provoke Creighton into requesting a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Unreasonable Determination of the Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Creighton challenges the Appeals Court's factual determination that the trial judge's conduct did not evidence bad faith. We reiterate that Creighton must clear a high hurdle before we will set aside the Appeals Court's factual determination: He must rebut the presumption of correctness of the Appeals Court's factual determination by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1). After reviewing the record thoroughly and listening to the audiotape, the most that we can say is that the trial judge became excited only <i>after</i> Creighton failed to stop speaking over the court's repeated instructions not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to accept Creighton's view that the court's instruction to the jury to disregard his testimony regarding the victim's alleged drug use was improper, which we doubt, it is pure speculation that the court gave the instruction with the intent to provoke the mistrial. Creighton contends that throughout the trial, the trial court had aligned itself with the prosecution to convict him. He claimed this was evidenced by the court's prejudiced evidentiary rulings and its attack on his credibility through its <i>sua sponte</i> jury instruction, all brought about by the court's realization that the Commonwealth would lose its case due to the victim's inconsistent testimony. There is no support for this in the record; in fact, the opposite appears to be true. To support his theory, Creighton claims that the trial court deprived him of the use of the victim's medical examination, which would have shown that he did not ejaculate during intercourse and that he did not beat or slap her. However, Creighton himself testified that he did, in fact, ejaculate during intercourse with the victim, and the victim herself testified that her medical examination indicated that no bruises were found. Even more damning, Creighton's defense counsel rejected the Commonwealth's offer to admit the victim's medical examination. And when asked by the court whether he planned on introducing the victim's medical examination, the defense counsel said \"no.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Creighton's allegations of judicial bias are belied by the court's numerous evidentiary rulings made in his favor over the Commonwealth's objections. For example, on the morning of the mistrial, the court ruled, over the Commonwealth's repeated objections, that defense counsel would be permitted to call Dr. DeFazio, the doctor who examined the victim after the alleged rape, to testify regarding the results of the Johnson Rape Kit and to impeach the victim's testimony that she did not have intercourse that day. The court also ruled that the victim could be recalled to the stand to be impeached with her prior prostitution charge. In addition, the record reflects that the judge had permitted defense counsel, on cross examination, to impeach the victim's credibility with a number of her prior convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Creighton has pointed to no evidence in the record that compels us to conclude that the trial judge acted in bad faith with intent to provoke him to request a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not without concern about the circumstances of this case. Creighton had little choice but to request a mistrial after his sparring match with the court that took place in front of the jury. However, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, it is immaterial whether we would have, in the first instance, decided the case differently. <i>See Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 411, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span>. We only need to conclude, as we do, that the Appeals Court applied the principles identified in <i>Dinitz</i> to the facts of this case in an objectively reasonable manner. Finding that the state court decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

However, although it was the judge who first uttered the word \"mistrial,\" it was defense counsel who pulled the plug and urged the declaration of a mistrial. In these circumstances, we need not apply the manifest necessity test.
