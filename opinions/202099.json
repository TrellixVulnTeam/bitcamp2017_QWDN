José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                       and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Alexander Zeno for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom H. S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 14, 2006\n\f              STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.           In 2002, a jury convicted\n\nJuan Manuel Cruzado-Laureano, the former mayor of Vega Alta, Puerto\n\nRico, on a broad slate of corruption-related charges.                   Through a\n\nvariety      of   schemes,   Cruzado     extorted     funds    from    government\n\ncontractors and embezzled funds that belonged in the city coffers.\n\nAlthough we sustained his convictions in an earlier appeal, we\n\nvacated his sentence because it was imposed under the wrong version\n\nof the United States Sentencing Guidelines.                After resentencing,\n\nCruzado      is   back   before    us   in    this   appeal,    contesting    the\n\napplicability of particular provisions of the Guidelines to the\n\nfacts of his case.           In large part, the district court acted\n\nproperly in imposing Cruzado's sentence. However, we find that the\n\ndistrict court impermissibly increased Cruzado's sentence on the\n\nbasis of two provisions that dealt with his abuse of his elected\n\noffice. We therefore vacate the sentence and once again remand for\n\nre-sentencing.\n\n                                  I. Background\n\n              This case comes to us on appeal for the second time.            The\n\nfacts of the case are laid out extensively in our prior opinion,\n\nsee United States v. Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d 470, 473-80 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), and we need not rehearse them here in any great detail.\n\nBriefly put, Juan Manuel \"Manny\" Cruzado-Laureano has had a varied\n\ncareer. A high-school mathematics teacher for seven years early on\n\nin   life,    Cruzado    later    worked     16   years   in   the    construction\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\findustry, four as an administrator in his wife's dental practice,\n\nand five as the owner and manager of a check-cashing business.                     In\n\nNovember    2000,    Cruzado      was   elected       mayor   of   Vega   Alta,    a\n\nmunicipality in Puerto Rico.             Almost immediately after taking\n\noffice, Cruzado began extorting and laundering money by, among\n\nother   things,     demanding     kickbacks     on    municipal    contracts      and\n\nredirecting funds intended for the government into his own pocket.\n\nCruzado    would    clear   the   extorted     money     through   his    own   bank\n\naccount, through his old check-cashing business (now owned by his\n\nson), or through the accounts at his wife's dental practice.                    The\n\nFederal    Bureau    of   Investigation       began    investigating      Cruzado's\n\nconduct in 2001, and an initial indictment was issued in October of\n\nthat year.     During the course of the investigation and after the\n\ninitial indictment was handed down, Cruzado compounded his legal\n\ntroubles by attempting to tamper with three potential witnesses\n\nagainst him.\n\n            A 14-count superseding indictment was returned on January\n\n25, 2002.      The indictment charged Cruzado with one count of\n\nembezzlement under 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(A)(ii)\n\n(2000); six counts of extortion under § 1951(a); six counts of\n\nmoney laundering under § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (a)(1)(B)(ii); and\n\none count of tampering with a witness under § 1512(b)(1) and\n\n(b)(2).    After the close of evidence, the court dismissed one of\n\nthe money-laundering charges, and the jury eventually returned a\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fverdict of not guilty on one of the extortion charges.             Cruzado was\n\nconvicted by the jury on each of the remaining twelve charges.\n\n            The district court imposed a 63-month sentence.1            In his\n\nearlier appeal, Cruzado unsuccessfully challenged his conviction on\n\na number of grounds not relevant here. Cruzado prevailed, however,\n\non his claim that the district court applied the wrong version of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.         The court had sentenced Cruzado under\n\nthe 2000 edition of the Guidelines.         We held that it ought to have\n\nrelied on the 2002 Guidelines, and so vacated the sentence and\n\nremanded the case for resentencing. On remand, the court performed\n\nthe sentencing calculation anew under the 2002 Guidelines.2\n\n            Section   2C1.1   of    the   Guidelines   provides     sentencing\n\nguidance for \"Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe;\n\nExtortion   Under     Color   of   Official   Right,\"    and   §    2S1.1   for\n\n\"Laundering    of     Monetary     Instruments;   Engaging     in     Monetary\n\nTransactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity.\"               Money\n\nlaundering is, generally speaking, a derivative offense: money\n\nneeds to be laundered because it was illegally derived.                     In\n\nrecommending a sentence for money laundering under § 2S1.1, the\n\n\n\n     1\n      The court also imposed a one-year sentence for the\nwitness-tampering charge, to run concurrently with the 63-month\nsentence imposed for the rest of the charges.\n     2\n      The court imposed the new sentence after the Supreme Court's\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), which\nrendered the Guidelines advisory.        It nevertheless imposed\nsentence based on the Guidelines recommendation.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fGuidelines take as the base offense level the full computed offense\n\nlevel relevant to the underlying offense. In making its sentencing\n\ncalculation, the district court proceeded by:\n\n1)        turning from the money laundering provision, § 2S1.1,3 to\n\n          the provision for the underlying offense, § 2C1.1;4\n\n2)        determining the base offense level for extortion offenses\n\n          under § 2C1.1(a);\n\n3)        adjusting that level upward according to the rules for\n\n          specific offense characteristics applicable under the\n\n          extortion guideline, § 2C1.1(b);\n\n4)        taking the resulting final offense level for extortion as\n\n          the base offense level for money laundering under §\n\n          2S1.1(a);\n\n5)        applying additional enhancements specified by the money\n\n          laundering guideline under § 2S1.1(b);\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      In the 2002 Guidelines Manual, § 2S1.1 read in relevant part:\n\"Base Offense Level: . . . The offense level for the underlying\noffense from which the laundered funds were derived . . . ,\" §\n2S1.1(a)(1); \"If the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. §\n1956, increase by 2 levels,\" § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B).\n     4\n      In 2002, § 2C1.1 read in relevant part: \"Base Offense Level:\n10,\" § 2C1.1(a); \"If the offense involved more than one bribe or\nextortion, increase by 2 levels,\" § 2C1.1(b)(1); \"If the offense\ninvolved a payment for the purpose of influencing an elected\nofficial or any official holding a high-level decision-making or\nsensitive position, increase by 8 levels,\" § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B).\n\n                               -5-\n\f6)          applying additional enhancements under relevant general\n\n            adjustment provisions laid out in Chapter Three of the\n\n            Guidelines Manual.\n\n            Thus, the district court started with a base offense\n\nlevel of 10, specified         by § 2C1.1(a) as the base offense level for\n\nextortion.   It applied a two-level enhancement under § 2C1.1(b)(1)\n\nbecause the offense involved more than one incident of extortion,\n\nand an eight-level enhancement under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B) because the\n\nextortion involved a payment for the purpose of influencing an\n\nelected decision-making official.            The final offense level under §\n\n2C1.1 was thus 20.        Under § 2S1.1(a), level 20 became the base\n\noffense level for the money laundering, to which the court applied\n\nan additional two-level enhancement under § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B) because\n\nthe offense involved a conviction under the money laundering\n\nstatute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956.\n\n            The court then turned to the general-purpose adjustment\n\nprovisions of Chapter Three, and found two applicable.            The court\n\napplied a two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of public\n\ntrust    under   §   3B1.3,5    and   another   two-level   enhancement   for\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      In 2002, § 3B1.3 read in relevant part: \"If the defendant\nabused a position of public or private trust, or used a special\nskill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or\nconcealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels. This adjustment\nmay not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in\nthe base offense level or specific offense characteristic.\"       §\n3B1.3.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fobstruction of justice under § 3C1.1.6     Cruzado's final offense\n\nlevel under these calculations was 26, and the court determined\n\nthat he fell into criminal history category I. Taken together, the\n\noffense level and criminal history category produced a recommended\n\nsentence of 63-78 months.   See USSG Ch.5, Pt.A (Sentencing Table).\n\nThis recommended sentence was no shorter and potentially longer\n\nthan the 63 months to which Cruzado had originally been sentenced.\n\nThe court decided that Cruzado ought not to suffer for having\n\nexercised his right of appeal, and imposed a sentence identical to\n\nthe one earlier imposed.    Cruzado timely brought this appeal,\n\nchallenging the district court's application of several provisions\n\nof the Guidelines.7\n\n                      II. Legal Challenges\n\n          On a challenge to a sentence imposed on the basis of a\n\nGuidelines recommendation, we \"determine the legal meaning of\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      In 2002, § 3C1.1 read: \"If (A) the defendant willfully\nobstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the\nadministration of justice during the course of the investigation,\nprosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,\nand (B) the obstructive conduct related to (I) the defendant's\noffense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely\nrelated offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.\" § 3C1.1.\n     7\n      Cruzado also challenges the court's order requiring payment\nof restitution and a fine, and ordering supervised release, but in\ntoo perfunctory a manner to permit us to evaluate the merits of\nthose aspects of his punishment.      \"[I]ssues adverted to in a\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\" United States v. Zannino, 895\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                -7-\n\fGuidelines provisions de novo.\"      United States v. Robinson, 433\n\nF.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nA. Extortion by an Elected Official\n\n          The district court increased Cruzado's offense level by\n\neight points under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B), which states: \"If the offense\n\ninvolved a payment for the purpose of influencing an elected\n\nofficial or any official holding a high-level decision-making or\n\nsensitive position, increase by 8 levels.\"    Cruzado was convicted\n\nfor being on the receiving end of various corrupt pay-offs, and he\n\nargues that this provision only applies when a defendant has made,\n\nrather than received, the payment.    Nothing in the quoted language\n\nsuggests that this is so.   The provision reflects the Sentencing\n\nCommission's determination that the abuse of a position of great\n\npublic trust, or the effort to corrupt a person holding such a\n\nposition, is more dangerous than the corruption of, for example, a\n\nhousing inspector or tax assessor.      The eight-level increase is\n\nmandated for a defendant precisely like the defendant here, an\n\nelected official who abuses his position.      Extortion \"involves\"\n\npayments intended to influence the behavior of the extortioner just\n\nas clearly as bribery \"involves\" payments intended to influence the\n\nbribe-taker.8   See United States v. Bynum, 327 F.3d 986, 993-94\n\n(9th Cir. 2003); United States v. Villafranca, 260 F.3d 374, 381-82\n\n\n\n     8\n      Nor is the rule of lenity applicable, as Cruzado claims:\nthere is nothing at all ambiguous in § 2C1.1.\n\n                               -8-\n\f(5th Cir. 2001).    The district court correctly applied an eight-\n\nlevel enhancement under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B).\n\nB.   Incorporation of a Referenced Guideline\n\n           Section 2S1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which applies\n\nto money laundering, directs the sentencing court to take as the\n\nbase offense level for purposes of § 2S1.1 the full calculated\n\noffense level that applies to the offense which produced the\n\nlaundered funds.    See § 2S1.1(a) (\"Base Offense Level\" for money\n\nlaundering is \"[t]he offense level for the underlying offense from\n\nwhich the laundered funds were derived\").       Here, this instruction\n\nmeant   that,   before   considering    what   money-laundering-related\n\nadjustments to apply to Cruzado's sentence, the court first had to\n\ncalculate the sentence as it would have applied to the extortion\n\ncounts standing alone, making reference to § 2C1.1.        It was only\n\nthen required to return to § 2S1.1 (and specifically to § 2S1.1(b))\n\nto determine if further adjustments were necessary under that\n\nprovision. In this case, having calculated the final offense level\n\nfor the extortion offenses under § 2C1.1 and applied it as the base\n\noffense level for money laundering under § 2S1.1, the district\n\ncourt went on to find that a further two-level enhancement was\n\nwarranted under § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), because Cruzado was convicted of\n\nmoney laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956.\n\n           Cruzado contends that, having once turned from § 2S1.1 to\n\n§ 2C1.1 under the direction of § 2S1.1(a), the district court\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fshould not have turned back to a consideration of the special\n\noffense characteristics under § 2S1.1(b), but this is flatly\n\nincorrect.    As is generally the case among the offense guidelines\n\nspecified    in   Chapter    Two   of    the   Guidelines   Manual,   §   2S1.1\n\ncontemplates      that      the    adjustments      for     special   offense\n\ncharacteristics specified in its part (b) will be applied after the\n\nbase offense level specified in its part (a) has been calculated,\n\nwhether or not that base offense level is calculated by reference\n\nto another provision of the Guidelines.9                  The district court\n\nrightly applied the special offense characteristic provisions of §\n\n2S1.1(b) after finishing its § 2C1.1 calculations.\n\nC. Abuse of Trust\n\n            The district court applied a two-level abuse-of-trust\n\nenhancement under § 3B1.3. That section calls for such an increase\n\n\"[i]f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust .\n\n. . in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or\n\n\n\n     9\n      Section 1B1.5 provides instructions for reading a guideline\nthat refers to another guideline. That section directs that \"[a]n\ninstruction to use the offense level from another offense guideline\nrefers to the offense level from the entire offense guideline.\" §\n1B1.5(b)(1).   This provision meant here that, where § 2S1.1(a)\nincorporated the offense level for extortion as the base offense\nlevel for money laundering, it incorporated the final calculated\noffense level for the extortion, which was 20, and not merely the\nunadjusted base offense level for extortion, which would have been\n10.   Cruzado argues that the instruction under § 1B1.5 that §\n2S1.1(a) be read to incorporate the \"entire offense guideline\"\nspecified at § 2C1.1 precluded making further adjustments under the\nremainder of § 2S1.1, but this reading of § 1B1.5 is simply\nimplausible.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fconcealment of the offense.\"    § 3B1.3.   It cautions, however, that\n\n\"[t]his adjustment may not be employed if an abuse of trust or\n\nskill is included in the base offense level or specific offense\n\ncharacteristic.\"   Id.   This second provision bars application of a\n\n§ 3B1.3 abuse-of-trust enhancement to a case in which any provision\n\nthat increases a sentence for an offender who holds high public\n\noffice already applies.    This is such a case.\n\n          The district court here evidently found the § 3B1.3\n\nabuse-of-trust provision applicable because Cruzado had used the\n\npower of his high office in extorting and embezzling funds.10 Abuse\n\nof high office was the same concern, however, that justified the\n\napplication of an eight-level enhancement under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B).\n\nSection 3B1.3 and § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B) both increase a defendant's\n\nsentence for abusing a position of trust, and by the terms of §\n\n3B1.3 cannot both be applied to increase the same defendant's\n\nsentence.11\n\n\n     10\n      While the court did not explain in detail its reasons for\nimposing the § 3B1.1 abuse-of-trust enhancement, it is evident that\nit did so because it considered Cruzado's use of his high office to\nfacilitate his wrongdoing to trigger the guideline provision, and\nthis is indeed a typical understanding of the provision.       See,\ne.g., United States v. Sarault, 975 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting\nthat former mayor had been determined to have merited, and had not\nchallenged, § 3B1.3 abuse-of-trust enhancement for role in\ncorruption scheme).\n     11\n      The Sentencing Commission itself appears to recognize that\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(B) and § 3B1.3 are redundant, for in the application\nnotes to § 2C1.1, the Commission directs that when sentencing under\nthe provisions of § 2C1.1, a sentencing court should \"not apply §\n3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\" §\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           In arguing in favor of the § 3B1.3 enhancement, the\n\nGovernment   relies      primarily    on     an   application     note   to   the\n\nlaundering guideline, which says that in cases where the offense\n\nlevel is determined by reference to the guideline for another\n\noffense, \"application of any Chapter Three adjustment shall be\n\ndetermined based on the offense covered by this guideline (i.e.,\n\nthe   laundering    of   criminally      derived   funds)   and    not   on   the\n\nunderlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived.\"\n\n§ 2S1.1 cmt. n.2(C).          At first blush, one might read this to\n\nsuggest that in this case the calculation under the extortion\n\nguideline, including its abuse-of-trust enhancement, should simply\n\nbe ignored when it comes to considering the § 3B1.3 adjustment, and\n\ninstead one should simply ask the mechanical question whether in\n\nhis money laundering activities a defendant abused a position of\n\ntrust.   In answer to that question, the district court apparently\n\nfound that Cruzado's official position facilitated not only his\n\nextortion but also his money laundering.                Cruzado attacks the\n\nlatter conclusion, but it seems plausible enough to us.\n\n           The     weakness   of   the     Government's     larger    argument,\n\nhowever, is that the § 3B1.3 abuse-of-trust enhancement, as we have\n\nnoted, \"may not be employed if an abuse of trust . . . is included\n\nin the base offense level or specific offense characteristic.\"                 §\n\n\n\n2C1.1 cmt. n.3. We do not rely on the application note in reaching\nour decision, however, but on the plain language of § 3B1.3.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f3B1.3.         While   application     note    2(C)    to   the     money-laundering\n\nguideline       provides    that    Chapter    Three       adjustments     should    be\n\ndetermined with reference to the money-laundering offense and not\n\nto   the   underlying      offense,    the    fact    remains       that   the   money-\n\nlaundering offense level was itself determined pursuant to a cross-\n\nreference that already required an upward adjustment based on abuse\n\nof   trust--thereby        literally    triggering      the    prohibition       (\"This\n\nadjustment may not be employed . . .\") which we have just quoted.\n\n               Although      double-counting          is      not      automatically\n\nimpermissible under the Guidelines (and is sometimes intentionally\n\ndirected), we can see no particular reason why one would want\n\ndouble-counting in this situation.             For these reasons, we conclude\n\nthat   the      district   court    erred     in   applying     an    abuse-of-trust\n\nenhancement under § 3B3.1.\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n               Having determined that the court's interpretation of the\n\nGuidelines was legally erroneous, see Robinson, 433 F.3d at 35, we\n\nmust again send the case back to the district court.                       See United\n\nStates v. Plaza-Garcia, 914 F.2d 345, 347 (1st Cir. 1990); 18\n\nU.S.C.     §    3742(f)(1)     (requiring      that     incorrectly        calculated\n\nsentences be remanded).         In remanding the case, we do not intend to\n\nintimate that the length of the sentence should necessarily be\n\nchanged; what matters is that the premise as to the Guideline range\n\nmust be correct.\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f          The sentence imposed by the district court is vacated and\n\nthe case is remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f",

In 2002, a jury convicted\n\nJuan Manuel Cruzado-Laureano, the former mayor of Vega Alta, Puerto\n\nRico, on a broad slate of corruption-related charges.                   Through a\n\nvariety      of   schemes,   Cruzado     extorted     funds    from    government\n\ncontractors and embezzled funds that belonged in the city coffers.\n\nAlthough we sustained his convictions in an earlier appeal, we\n\nvacated his sentence because it was imposed under the wrong version\n\nof the United States Sentencing Guidelines.                After resentencing,\n\nCruzado      is   back   before    us   in    this   appeal,    contesting    the\n\napplicability of particular provisions of the Guidelines to the\n\nfacts of his case.           In large part, the district court acted\n\nproperly in imposing Cruzado's sentence. However, we find that the\n\ndistrict court impermissibly increased Cruzado's sentence on the\n\nbasis of two provisions that dealt with his abuse of his elected\n\noffice.

Background\n\n              This case comes to us on appeal for the second time.            The\n\nfacts of the case are laid out extensively in our prior opinion,\n\nsee United States v. Cruzado-Laureano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201519\"><a href=\"/opinion/201519/united-states-v-cruzado-laureano/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 473-80 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), and we need not rehearse them here in any great detail.\n\nBriefly put, Juan Manuel \"Manny\" Cruzado-Laureano has had a varied\n\ncareer. A high-school mathematics teacher for seven years early on\n\nin   life,    Cruzado    later    worked     16   years   in   the    construction\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\findustry, four as an administrator in his wife's dental practice,\n\nand five as the owner and manager of a check-cashing business.                     In\n\nNovember    2000,    Cruzado      was   elected       mayor   of   Vega   Alta,    a\n\nmunicipality in Puerto Rico.             Almost immediately after taking\n\noffice, Cruzado began extorting and laundering money by, among\n\nother   things,     demanding     kickbacks     on    municipal    contracts      and\n\nredirecting funds intended for the government into his own pocket.\n\nCruzado    would    clear   the   extorted     money     through   his    own   bank\n\naccount, through his old check-cashing business (now owned by his\n\nson), or through the accounts at his wife's dental practice.                    The\n\nFederal    Bureau    of   Investigation       began    investigating      Cruzado's\n\nconduct in 2001, and an initial indictment was issued in October of\n\nthat year.     During the course of the investigation and after the\n\ninitial indictment was handed down, Cruzado compounded his legal\n\ntroubles by attempting to tamper with three potential witnesses\n\nagainst him.\n\n            A 14-count superseding indictment was returned on January\n\n25, 2002.      The indictment charged Cruzado with one count of\n\nembezzlement under 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(A)(ii)\n\n(2000); six counts of extortion under § 1951(a); six counts of\n\nmoney laundering under § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (a)(1)(B)(ii); and\n\none count of tampering with a witness under § 1512(b)(1) and\n\n(b)(2).    After the close of evidence, the court dismissed one of\n\nthe money-laundering charges, and the jury eventually returned a\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fverdict of not guilty on one of the extortion charges.             Cruzado was\n\nconvicted by the jury on each of the remaining twelve charges.\n\n            The district court imposed a 63-month sentence.1            In his\n\nearlier appeal, Cruzado unsuccessfully challenged his conviction on\n\na number of grounds not relevant here. Cruzado prevailed, however,\n\non his claim that the district court applied the wrong version of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.         The court had sentenced Cruzado under\n\nthe 2000 edition of the Guidelines.         We held that it ought to have\n\nrelied on the 2002 Guidelines, and so vacated the sentence and\n\nremanded the case for resentencing. On remand, the court performed\n\nthe sentencing calculation anew under the 2002 Guidelines.2\n\n            Section   2C1.1   of    the   Guidelines   provides     sentencing\n\nguidance for \"Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe;\n\nExtortion   Under     Color   of   Official   Right,\"    and   §    2S1.1   for\n\n\"Laundering    of     Monetary     Instruments;   Engaging     in     Monetary\n\nTransactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity.\"               Money\n\nlaundering is, generally speaking, a derivative offense: money\n\nneeds to be laundered because it was illegally derived.                     In\n\nrecommending a sentence for money laundering under § 2S1.1, the\n\n\n\n     1\n      The court also imposed a one-year sentence for the\nwitness-tampering charge, to run concurrently with the 63-month\nsentence imposed for the rest of the charges.\n     2\n      The court imposed the new sentence after the Supreme Court's\ndecision in United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), which\nrendered the Guidelines advisory.        It nevertheless imposed\nsentence based on the Guidelines recommendation.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fGuidelines take as the base offense level the full computed offense\n\nlevel relevant to the underlying offense. In making its sentencing\n\ncalculation, the district court proceeded by:\n\n1)        turning from the money laundering provision, § 2S1.1,3 to\n\n          the provision for the underlying offense, § 2C1.1;4\n\n2)        determining the base offense level for extortion offenses\n\n          under § 2C1.1(a);\n\n3)        adjusting that level upward according to the rules for\n\n          specific offense characteristics applicable under the\n\n          extortion guideline, § 2C1.1(b);\n\n4)        taking the resulting final offense level for extortion as\n\n          the base offense level for money laundering under §\n\n          2S1.1(a);\n\n5)        applying additional enhancements specified by the money\n\n          laundering guideline under § 2S1.1(b);\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      In the 2002 Guidelines Manual, § 2S1.1 read in relevant part:\n\"Base Offense Level: . . . The offense level for the underlying\noffense from which the laundered funds were derived . . . ,\" §\n2S1.1(a)(1); \"If the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. §\n1956, increase by 2 levels,\" § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B).\n     4\n      In 2002, § 2C1.1 read in relevant part: \"Base Offense Level:\n10,\" § 2C1.1(a); \"If the offense involved more than one bribe or\nextortion, increase by 2 levels,\" § 2C1.1(b)(1); \"If the offense\ninvolved a payment for the purpose of influencing an elected\nofficial or any official holding a high-level decision-making or\nsensitive position, increase by 8 levels,\" § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B).\n\n                               -5-\n\f6)          applying additional enhancements under relevant general\n\n            adjustment provisions laid out in Chapter Three of the\n\n            Guidelines Manual.\n\n            Thus, the district court started with a base offense\n\nlevel of 10, specified         by § 2C1.1(a) as the base offense level for\n\nextortion.   It applied a two-level enhancement under § 2C1.1(b)(1)\n\nbecause the offense involved more than one incident of extortion,\n\nand an eight-level enhancement under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B) because the\n\nextortion involved a payment for the purpose of influencing an\n\nelected decision-making official.            The final offense level under §\n\n2C1.1 was thus 20.        Under § 2S1.1(a), level 20 became the base\n\noffense level for the money laundering, to which the court applied\n\nan additional two-level enhancement under § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B) because\n\nthe offense involved a conviction under the money laundering\n\nstatute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956.\n\n            The court then turned to the general-purpose adjustment\n\nprovisions of Chapter Three, and found two applicable.            The court\n\napplied a two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of public\n\ntrust    under   §   3B1.3,5    and   another   two-level   enhancement   for\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      In 2002, § 3B1.3 read in relevant part: \"If the defendant\nabused a position of public or private trust, or used a special\nskill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or\nconcealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels. This adjustment\nmay not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in\nthe base offense level or specific offense characteristic.\"       §\n3B1.3.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fobstruction of justice under § 3C1.1.6     Cruzado's final offense\n\nlevel under these calculations was 26, and the court determined\n\nthat he fell into criminal history category I. Taken together, the\n\noffense level and criminal history category produced a recommended\n\nsentence of 63-78 months.   See USSG Ch.5, Pt.A (Sentencing Table).\n\nThis recommended sentence was no shorter and potentially longer\n\nthan the 63 months to which Cruzado had originally been sentenced.\n\nThe court decided that Cruzado ought not to suffer for having\n\nexercised his right of appeal, and imposed a sentence identical to\n\nthe one earlier imposed.    Cruzado timely brought this appeal,\n\nchallenging the district court's application of several provisions\n\nof the Guidelines.7\n\n                      II. Legal Challenges\n\n          On a challenge to a sentence imposed on the basis of a\n\nGuidelines recommendation, we \"determine the legal meaning of\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      In 2002, § 3C1.1 read: \"If (A) the defendant willfully\nobstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the\nadministration of justice during the course of the investigation,\nprosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,\nand (B) the obstructive conduct related to (I) the defendant's\noffense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely\nrelated offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.\" § 3C1.1.\n     7\n      Cruzado also challenges the court's order requiring payment\nof restitution and a fine, and ordering supervised release, but in\ntoo perfunctory a manner to permit us to evaluate the merits of\nthose aspects of his punishment.      \"[I]ssues adverted to in a\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\" United States v.

Extortion by an Elected Official\n\n          The district court increased Cruzado's offense level by\n\neight points under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B), which states: \"If the offense\n\ninvolved a payment for the purpose of influencing an elected\n\nofficial or any official holding a high-level decision-making or\n\nsensitive position, increase by 8 levels.\"    Cruzado was convicted\n\nfor being on the receiving end of various corrupt pay-offs, and he\n\nargues that this provision only applies when a defendant has made,\n\nrather than received, the payment.    Nothing in the quoted language\n\nsuggests that this is so.   The provision reflects the Sentencing\n\nCommission's determination that the abuse of a position of great\n\npublic trust, or the effort to corrupt a person holding such a\n\nposition, is more dangerous than the corruption of, for example, a\n\nhousing inspector or tax assessor.      The eight-level increase is\n\nmandated for a defendant precisely like the defendant here, an\n\nelected official who abuses his position.      Extortion \"involves\"\n\npayments intended to influence the behavior of the extortioner just\n\nas clearly as bribery \"involves\" payments intended to influence the\n\nbribe-taker.8   See United States v.

The district court correctly applied an eight-\n\nlevel enhancement under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B).\n\nB.   Incorporation of a Referenced Guideline\n\n           Section 2S1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which applies\n\nto money laundering, directs the sentencing court to take as the\n\nbase offense level for purposes of § 2S1.1 the full calculated\n\noffense level that applies to the offense which produced the\n\nlaundered funds.    See § 2S1.1(a) (\"Base Offense Level\" for money\n\nlaundering is \"[t]he offense level for the underlying offense from\n\nwhich the laundered funds were derived\").       Here, this instruction\n\nmeant   that,   before   considering    what   money-laundering-related\n\nadjustments to apply to Cruzado's sentence, the court first had to\n\ncalculate the sentence as it would have applied to the extortion\n\ncounts standing alone, making reference to § 2C1.1.        It was only\n\nthen required to return to § 2S1.1 (and specifically to § 2S1.1(b))\n\nto determine if further adjustments were necessary under that\n\nprovision. In this case, having calculated the final offense level\n\nfor the extortion offenses under § 2C1.1 and applied it as the base\n\noffense level for money laundering under § 2S1.1, the district\n\ncourt went on to find that a further two-level enhancement was\n\nwarranted under § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), because Cruzado was convicted of\n\nmoney laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956.\n\n           Cruzado contends that, having once turned from § 2S1.1 to\n\n§ 2C1.1 under the direction of § 2S1.1(a), the district court\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fshould not have turned back to a consideration of the special\n\noffense characteristics under § 2S1.1(b), but this is flatly\n\nincorrect.    As is generally the case among the offense guidelines\n\nspecified    in   Chapter    Two   of    the   Guidelines   Manual,   §   2S1.1\n\ncontemplates      that      the    adjustments      for     special   offense\n\ncharacteristics specified in its part (b) will be applied after the\n\nbase offense level specified in its part (a) has been calculated,\n\nwhether or not that base offense level is calculated by reference\n\nto another provision of the Guidelines.9                  The district court\n\nrightly applied the special offense characteristic provisions of §\n\n2S1.1(b) after finishing its § 2C1.1 calculations.\n\nC. Abuse of Trust\n\n            The district court applied a two-level abuse-of-trust\n\nenhancement under § 3B1.3. That section calls for such an increase\n\n\"[i]f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust .\n\n. . in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or\n\n\n\n     9\n      Section 1B1.5 provides instructions for reading a guideline\nthat refers to another guideline. That section directs that \"[a]n\ninstruction to use the offense level from another offense guideline\nrefers to the offense level from the entire offense guideline.\" §\n1B1.5(b)(1).   This provision meant here that, where § 2S1.1(a)\nincorporated the offense level for extortion as the base offense\nlevel for money laundering, it incorporated the final calculated\noffense level for the extortion, which was 20, and not merely the\nunadjusted base offense level for extortion, which would have been\n10.   Cruzado argues that the instruction under § 1B1.5 that §\n2S1.1(a) be read to incorporate the \"entire offense guideline\"\nspecified at § 2C1.1 precluded making further adjustments under the\nremainder of § 2S1.1, but this reading of § 1B1.5 is simply\nimplausible.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fconcealment of the offense.\"    § 3B1.3.   It cautions, however, that\n\n\"[t]his adjustment may not be employed if an abuse of trust or\n\nskill is included in the base offense level or specific offense\n\ncharacteristic.\"   Id.   This second provision bars application of a\n\n§ 3B1.3 abuse-of-trust enhancement to a case in which any provision\n\nthat increases a sentence for an offender who holds high public\n\noffice already applies.    This is such a case.\n\n          The district court here evidently found the § 3B1.3\n\nabuse-of-trust provision applicable because Cruzado had used the\n\npower of his high office in extorting and embezzling funds.10 Abuse\n\nof high office was the same concern, however, that justified the\n\napplication of an eight-level enhancement under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B).\n\nSection 3B1.3 and § 2C1.1(b)(2)(B) both increase a defendant's\n\nsentence for abusing a position of trust, and by the terms of §\n\n3B1.3 cannot both be applied to increase the same defendant's\n\nsentence.11\n\n\n     10\n      While the court did not explain in detail its reasons for\nimposing the § 3B1.1 abuse-of-trust enhancement, it is evident that\nit did so because it considered Cruzado's use of his high office to\nfacilitate his wrongdoing to trigger the guideline provision, and\nthis is indeed a typical understanding of the provision.       See,\ne.g., United States v. Sarault, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590894\"><a href=\"/opinion/590894/united-states-v-brian-j-sarault/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1992) (noting\nthat former mayor had been determined to have merited, and had not\nchallenged, § 3B1.3 abuse-of-trust enhancement for role in\ncorruption scheme).\n     11\n      The Sentencing Commission itself appears to recognize that\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(B) and § 3B1.3 are redundant, for in the application\nnotes to § 2C1.1, the Commission directs that when sentencing under\nthe provisions of § 2C1.1, a sentencing court should \"not apply §\n3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\" §\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           In arguing in favor of the § 3B1.3 enhancement, the\n\nGovernment   relies      primarily    on     an   application     note   to   the\n\nlaundering guideline, which says that in cases where the offense\n\nlevel is determined by reference to the guideline for another\n\noffense, \"application of any Chapter Three adjustment shall be\n\ndetermined based on the offense covered by this guideline (i.e.,\n\nthe   laundering    of   criminally      derived   funds)   and    not   on   the\n\nunderlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived.\"\n\n§ 2S1.1 cmt. n.2(C).          At first blush, one might read this to\n\nsuggest that in this case the calculation under the extortion\n\nguideline, including its abuse-of-trust enhancement, should simply\n\nbe ignored when it comes to considering the § 3B1.3 adjustment, and\n\ninstead one should simply ask the mechanical question whether in\n\nhis money laundering activities a defendant abused a position of\n\ntrust.   In answer to that question, the district court apparently\n\nfound that Cruzado's official position facilitated not only his\n\nextortion but also his money laundering.                Cruzado attacks the\n\nlatter conclusion, but it seems plausible enough to us.\n\n           The     weakness   of   the     Government's     larger    argument,\n\nhowever, is that the § 3B1.3 abuse-of-trust enhancement, as we have\n\nnoted, \"may not be employed if an abuse of trust . . . is included\n\nin the base offense level or specific offense characteristic.\"                 §\n\n\n\n2C1.1 cmt. n.3. We do not rely on the application note in reaching\nour decision, however, but on the plain language of § 3B1.3.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f3B1.3.         While   application     note    2(C)    to   the     money-laundering\n\nguideline       provides    that    Chapter    Three       adjustments     should    be\n\ndetermined with reference to the money-laundering offense and not\n\nto   the   underlying      offense,    the    fact    remains       that   the   money-\n\nlaundering offense level was itself determined pursuant to a cross-\n\nreference that already required an upward adjustment based on abuse\n\nof   trust--thereby        literally    triggering      the    prohibition       (\"This\n\nadjustment may not be employed . . .\") which we have just quoted.\n\n               Although      double-counting          is      not      automatically\n\nimpermissible under the Guidelines (and is sometimes intentionally\n\ndirected), we can see no particular reason why one would want\n\ndouble-counting in this situation.             For these reasons, we conclude\n\nthat   the      district   court    erred     in   applying     an    abuse-of-trust\n\nenhancement under § 3B3.1.\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n               Having determined that the court's interpretation of the\n\nGuidelines was legally erroneous, see Robinson, 433 F.3d at 35, we\n\nmust again send the case back to the district court.
