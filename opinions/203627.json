LEAVITT, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n        [Hon. John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Boudin, Selya, and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael A.

Katsas, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nPaula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Mark B. Stern,\nAttorney, Appellate Staff, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          January 14, 2009\n\f               SELYA,      Circuit    Judge.       This   appeal     requires    us    to\n\nconstrue the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in a\n\nprovision of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA), a\n\nstatute that directs hospitals and other health care entities to\n\nreport    to    the       Secretary    of   Health    and    Human    Services    (the\n\nSecretary) in the event that a physician surrenders his clinical\n\nprivileges while he is \"under an investigation\" for suspected\n\nincompetence         or    improper   professional        conduct.      42   U.S.C.     §\n\n11133(a)(1)(B)(i).           The question is one of first impression at the\n\nfederal appellate level.\n\n               In    the     underlying      administrative        proceeding,        the\n\nSecretary concluded that an investigation is ongoing for purposes\n\nof the HCQIA until the hospital's decisionmaking process runs its\n\ncourse and the hospital either takes a final action or formally\n\ncloses the probe.             The appellant, a physician reported to the\n\nSecretary       under       section     11133(a)(1)(B)(i),           challenged       the\n\nSecretary's         interpretation     of    the   word     \"investigation.\"          The\n\ndistrict court rejected this challenge and upheld the Secretary's\n\naction.    After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n               Generally speaking, information gathered pursuant to the\n\nreporting provisions of the HCQIA is confidential.                           See id. §\n\n11137(b)(1).         But the statute expressly provides that information\n\npresented \"in a form that does not permit the identification of any\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fparticular   health   care   entity,    physician,   other   health   care\n\npractitioner, or patient shall not be considered confidential.\"\n\nId.   In the case at hand, the protagonists' identities and the\n\nspecific details of the alleged misconduct are easily separated\n\nfrom the central legal question.          Accordingly, we sketch the\n\nbackground of the case with the aid of pseudonyms and generalities.\n\nThat course allows us to balance two important but sometimes\n\nconflicting interests: on the one hand, safeguarding the privacy of\n\nphysicians and other health care professionals; on the other hand,\n\nproviding public access to judicial decisions.\n\n          On July 26, 2005, an operating room nurse at the XYZ\n\nHospital (the name is fictitious) filed a written complaint against\n\nthe appellant (a physician whom we refer to by the alias \"Dr.\n\nDoe\"). The complaint charged that the appellant had threatened the\n\nnurse.\n\n          The following day, the medical staff executive committee\n\ntemporarily suspended Dr. Doe's privileges and appointed an ad hoc\n\ninvestigating committee (the AHC) to inquire into the nurse's\n\nallegations.   On August 2, 2005, the AHC reported to the executive\n\ncommittee that the nurse reasonably perceived Dr. Doe's actions as\n\nthreatening.\n\n          Three days later, the executive committee met to discuss\n\nboth the report and Dr. Doe's status.       Following that discussion,\n\nthe executive committee proposed that Dr. Doe be allowed to return\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fto work so long as he agreed to certain contractual modifications,\n\nincluding   provisions     for   regular    proctoring      and   psychological\n\nevaluations.     On August 11, Dr. Doe rejected this proposal and\n\nvoluntarily relinquished his clinical privileges.                     The Hospital\n\naccepted his resignation on August 19.\n\n            Believing that Dr. Doe had resigned while \"under an\n\ninvestigation,\"    the    Hospital   reported      his    resignation      to    the\n\nNational    Practitioner     Data    Bank    (the    NPDB),       a    data     bank\n\nestablished by the Secretary as a repository for reports filed\n\npursuant to the HCQIA.      See 45 C.F.R. § 60.1.\n\n            On September 19, Dr. Doe requested administrative review\n\nof the Hospital's filing.        See id. § 60.14.        He contended that the\n\nHospital's investigation had ended when the AHC presented its\n\nreport to the executive committee and, therefore, that he had not\n\nresigned while under an investigation.               An exchange of views\n\nfollowed.\n\n            On May 25, 2007, the Secretary issued a written decision\n\nin which he ruled that the Hospital appropriately had reported the\n\nappellant to the NPDB.       The Secretary premised this ruling on a\n\nstatement that \"[a]n investigation is . . . considered ongoing\n\nuntil the health care entity's decision making authority takes a\n\nfinal action or formally closes the investigation.\"                    Because the\n\nexecutive committee had neither taken a final disciplinary action\n\nnor   formally   closed    its   inquiry    when    Dr.    Doe    resigned,     the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fSecretary found that Dr. Doe was still \"under an investigation\" at\n\nthat moment.       Consequently, the Hospital had a duty to report the\n\nresignation under 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i).\n\n             The appellant challenged this ruling in a suit brought\n\nagainst the Secretary under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\n\nU.S.C. §§ 701-706.         The parties cross-moved for judgment on the\n\nadministrative record.           The district court, in a sealed opinion,\n\nruled in the Secretary's favor.              This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n             We review the district court's decision de novo, applying\n\nthe   same   standards     to    the   Secretary's        final    action   that   the\n\ndistrict court was bound to apply.                  See Mass. ex rel. Div. of\n\nMarine Fisheries v. Daley, 170 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 1999); Assoc'd\n\nFisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nWe    will   reverse      only   if    the    Secretary's       determination      was\n\n\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n\naccordance with law.\"        5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).          We are not married to\n\nthe lower court's reasoning but may uphold its decision on any\n\nground made manifest by the record.                 See InterGen N.V. v. Grina,\n\n344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             The   sole    issue      on   appeal    is   the     propriety   of   the\n\nSecretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation\" as that word\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fis used in the HCQIA reporting provision, quoted in the margin.1\n\nThe Secretary has determined that an investigation is ongoing (and,\n\ntherefore, a matter is under investigation) until a health care\n\nentity makes a final decision or formally closes the probe, even if\n\nthe entity is no longer gathering facts but is merely deliberating\n\nabout what course of action it should follow.\n\n           The appellant argues that the Secretary has cast too wide\n\na net.   He maintains that the word \"investigation,\" as used in the\n\nstatute, refers only to the fact-gathering phase of the inquiry.\n\n           In   dealing    with    these    dueling      interpretations,       a\n\nthreshold question looms: What level of deference, if any, is due\n\nto the Secretary's interpretation?          We tackle that question first\n\nand then proceed to the merits.\n\n                     A.    The Deference Question.\n\n           It   cannot    be   gainsaid    that   the   Secretary     possesses\n\nauthority to promulgate regulations implementing the HCQIA.                  See,\n\ne.g., 42 U.S.C. § 11136.       Withal, the Secretary has not exercised\n\nthis rulemaking authority to set forth his interpretation of the\n\n\n     1\n       In pertinent part, the provision                 imposes   a   reporting\nobligation on any health care entity that\n\n     accepts the surrender of clinical privileges of                     a\n     physician —\n          (i)   while   the  physician   is   under   an\n          investigation by the entity relating to\n          possible incompetence or improper professional\n          conduct . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B).\n\n                                    -6-\n\fword \"investigation.\" Instead, the Secretary's interpretation must\n\nbe gleaned from (i) an agency manual, the NPDB Guidebook (the\n\nGuidebook), issued in September of 2001, and (ii) the Secretary's\n\ndecision     in   this   case.     The   appellant   contends   that   these\n\n\"informal\" interpretations do not warrant deference under the\n\nfamiliar rubric of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.\n\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984), but must be evaluated\n\nunder the more neutral framework limned in Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n\n323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).          The Secretary counters that Chevron\n\noffers the appropriate frame of reference.             The district court\n\nnimbly sidestepped this question, vouchsafing that the Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of the word was unimpugnable regardless of what\n\nlevel of deference attached.\n\n             In the aftermath of the Court's opinion in United States\n\nv. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001), the level of deference\n\nowing   to    informal    agency   interpretations    is   freighted   with\n\nuncertainty.       See Lisa Schultz Bressman, How Mead Has Muddled\n\nJudicial Review of Agency Action, 58 Vand. L. Rev. 1443, 1457-69\n\n(2005) (reviewing divergent applications of Mead by various courts\n\nof appeals).        The Mead Court seems to have contemplated the\n\napplication of Chevron deference to most statutory interpretations\n\nthat are the fruit of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal\n\nadjudications.      See Mead, 533 U.S. at 229-31; but cf. Nat'l Cable\n\n& Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Serv., 545 U.S. 967, 1004\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f(2005) (Breyer, J., concurring) (stating that \"the existence of a\n\nformal rulemaking proceeding\" is not \"a sufficient condition for\n\naccording Chevron deference to an agency's interpretation of a\n\nstatute\"). In some ways, however, Mead is unhelpful: for instance,\n\nthe decision does not clarify the circumstances in which Congress\n\nshould be deemed to have intended an informal agency interpretation\n\nto carry the force of law and, thus, attract Chevron deference.\n\nSee Mead, 533 U.S. at 231.          Mead indicates, however, that even if\n\nan informal agency interpretation is deemed not to warrant Chevron\n\ndeference, it may nonetheless lay claim to a lesser degree of\n\ndeference under the Skidmore banner.          Id. at 234.\n\n           The    case   at   hand   falls   into   this   gray   area.   The\n\nGuidebook is an agency manual.         It is not a product of notice-and-\n\ncomment rulemaking, nor was it ever published in the Federal\n\nRegister, which makes only a glancing reference to it, see Notice\n\nAnnouncing Opening Date of NPDB, 55 Fed. Reg. 31,239-01 (Aug. 1,\n\n1990).   Given these facts, we do not believe that the Guidebook is\n\nentitled to Chevron deference.         See Christensen v. Harris County,\n\n529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000); Visiting Nurse Ass'n Gregoria Auffant,\n\nInc. v. Thompson, 447 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir. 2006); De La Mota v.\n\nU.S. Dep't of Educ., 412 F.3d 71, 79 (2d Cir. 2005); Pub. Citizen,\n\nInc. v. U.S. Dep't of HHS, 332 F.3d 654, 660 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\n           This    leaves     the     Secretary's    decision.       Congress\n\nexplicitly empowered the Secretary to establish dispute resolution\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fprocedures relative to HCQIA filings.           See 42 U.S.C. § 11136(2).\n\nIn   response,     the   Secretary      promulgated   a    regulation     that\n\nestablished an adjudicative process — a process that, among other\n\nthings, provides for secretarial review of written information\n\nsubmitted by both the reporting entity and the reported physician,\n\nas well as the issuance of a final administrative determination\n\nanent the accuracy of reported information. See 45 C.F.R. § 60.14.\n\nThe decision in this case was a creature of this adjudicative\n\nprocess. Although secretarial review is not governed by the trial-\n\nlike procedures characteristic of formal agency adjudications, see,\n\ne.g., 5 U.S.C. §§ 554, 556, 557, several courts have afforded\n\nChevron deference to agency adjudications similar in type and kind\n\nto the agency action at issue here, see, e.g., Am. Fed'n of Gov't\n\nEmployees, Local 446 v. Nicholson, 475 F.3d 341, 353-54 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007); Cleveland Nat'l Air Show, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Transp., 430\n\nF.3d 757, 763-64 (6th Cir. 2005); Davis v. EPA, 348 F.3d 772, 779\n\n& n.5 (9th Cir. 2003).       Other courts, however, have declined to\n\nafford   Chevron    deference     to    the   fruit   of   informal     agency\n\nadjudications.     See, e.g., Mead, 533 U.S. at 221; Am. Fed'n of\n\nGov't Employees, Local 2152 v. Principi, 464 F.3d 1049, 1057 (9th\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n          This is an interesting legal conundrum, but the task of\n\na federal appellate court is to resolve particular cases and\n\ncontroversies,     not   merely   to    satisfy   intellectual    curiosity\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f(whether its own curiosity or that of others).                    In the last\n\nanalysis, we agree with the district court that the level of\n\ndeference is not determinative here; whether viewed through the\n\nprism of Chevron or the less forgiving prism of Skidmore, the\n\nSecretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation\" withstands\n\nscrutiny.\n\n             Thus, we bypass the question of whether the Secretary's\n\ndecision     engenders   Chevron    deference.         Instead,   we   assume,\n\nfavorably to the appellant and in line with his argument, that the\n\nSecretary's interpretation should be evaluated under the Skidmore\n\nstandard.    We proceed on that assumption.\n\n                               B.   The Merits.\n\n             The nuances of the Skidmore standard are not cut-and-\n\ndried. See, e.g., Cathedral Candle Co. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n,\n\n400   F.3d   1352,   1365-66   (Fed.   Cir.    2005)    (discussing    varying\n\nformulations).       The Supreme Court has characterized Skidmore as\n\nrequiring courts to defer to agency interpretations of statutes\n\nwithin the agency's ken \"to the extent that those interpretations\n\nhave the 'power to persuade.'\"              Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587\n\n(quoting Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140).          If this is not an unabashed\n\ntautology, it must mean something more than that deference is due\n\nonly when an inquiring court is itself persuaded that the agency\n\ngot it right. Otherwise, Skidmore deference would not be deference\n\nat all.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           What the Skidmore standard entails is a sliding-scale\n\napproach under which the degree of deference accorded to an agency\n\ninterpretation       hinges   on    a   variety    of    factors,     such   as   \"the\n\nthoroughness evident in [the agency's] consideration, the validity\n\nof its reasoning, [and the] consistency [of its interpretation]\n\nwith earlier and later pronouncements.\" Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140.\n\nThat compendium is not exhaustive; other factors may weigh in the\n\nbalance.   See Kristin E. Hickman & Matthew D. Krueger, In Search of\n\nthe Modern Skidmore Standard, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 1235, 1259 (2007)\n\n(identifying \"thoroughness, formality, validity, consistency, and\n\nagency expertise\" as factors in an agency's power to persuade).\n\n           These factors are meant to test the seriousness of, and\n\ntherefore the respect due to, the process that underlies the\n\nagency's interpretation.           The mix of factors, once assayed, either\n\ncontributes     to    or   detracts      from     the    power   of    an    agency's\n\ninterpretation to persuade.             See Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140.             We\n\nturn,   then,    to     how    these     factors        impact   the    Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in\n\n42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i).\n\n           We start with formality and thoroughness.                     The record\n\nmakes manifest that the Secretary's decision was not the product of\n\na strictly formal adjudication.            Even so, not all informal agency\n\nadjudications stand on the same footing.                  Here, the adjudication\n\nprogressed    according       to   a    previously      established     panoply    of\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fstructured rules that allowed for written submissions by all\n\naffected parties.         See 45 C.F.R. § 60.14(c).             Greater weight\n\nordinarily is due to interpretations that result from a structured\n\ninterpretive      process    as     opposed     to     a    catch-as-catch-can\n\ninterpretive process.        See, e.g., High Sierra Hikers Ass'n v.\n\nBlackwell, 390 F.3d 630, 648 (9th Cir. 2004); Structural Indus.,\n\nInc. v. United States, 356 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n\n              The Secretary plainly understood the need for in-depth\n\nconsideration of the disputed issue.            He initially set forth his\n\nconstruction of the word \"investigation\" in the Guidebook, a\n\ncomprehensive manual of general applicability.               Normally, greater\n\ndeference is due to an interpretation that \"is not merely ad hoc .\n\n. . but is applicable to all cases.\"            Chauffeur's Training Sch.,\n\nInc. v. Spellings, 478 F.3d 117, 129 (2d Cir. 2007); accord Estate\n\nof Landers v. Leavitt, 545 F.3d 98, 110 (2d Cir. 2008).                 So it is\n\nhere.\n\n              The Secretary then reiterated his understanding of the\n\nword \"investigation\" in his decision in this case. Several aspects\n\nof the decision indicate that it was the product of thorough\n\nconsideration.      First, the decision was issued by the Secretary\n\nhimself — the highest-ranking official in the Department of Health\n\nand   Human    Services    (HHS).     Second,    the       procedures   employed\n\nencouraged the operation of the deliberative process.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f           In particular, there was a meaningful give-and-take.          In\n\na letter to the Hospital dated May 26, 2006, the agency's dispute\n\nresolution manager set out the agency's working definition of an\n\n\"investigation\" and requested further information.           The appellant\n\nreceived a copy of this letter.          On June 6, 2006, the appellant\n\nresponded, controverting the agency's working definition.              The\n\nissue was, therefore, precisely framed and the protagonists had the\n\nopportunity to confront each other's views.              This sort of open\n\nexchange is a badge of thoroughness.         See, e.g., Rubie's Costume\n\nCo. v. United States, 337 F.3d 1350, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n\n           Furthermore, the Secretary's decision fully engaged the\n\nappellant's proposed interpretation of section 11133(a)(1)(B)(i).\n\nThe Secretary found that interpretation deficient largely because\n\nit failed to square with the policies underlying the HCQIA.              In\n\nsupport, the Secretary highlighted relevant portions of both the\n\nstatutory scheme and its legislative history.               This detailed\n\nexegesis   makes    it   transparently    clear   that    the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation was a product of thorough consideration. See, e.g.,\n\nW. Union Tel. Co. v. FCC, 665 F.2d 1126, 1143 (D.C. Cir. 1981)\n\n(upholding, under Skidmore, an agency interpretation that was based\n\nupon thorough analysis of statute and legislative history).\n\n           Moving   to   other   factors,    expertise    and   consistency\n\ncounsel in favor of honoring the Secretary's interpretation. As to\n\nthe former, HHS, over which the Secretary presides, has broad\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\foversight of physician performance.            Given the huge federal stake\n\nin the funding of Medicare, Medicaid, and related programs, the\n\nSecretary has had a powerful incentive to develop a body of\n\nknowledge about problems affecting physician performance.                   See,\n\ne.g., Estate of Landers, 545 F.3d at 107 (noting high degree of\n\nexpert knowledge required to run programs such as Medicare and\n\nMedicaid).      Indeed, the Secretary is charged with determining\n\nwhether and when a physician's rights to participate in these\n\ncomplex programs should be suspended where, for example, the\n\nphysician surrenders his license to practice in a particular state\n\nwhile under investigation for misconduct or incompetence.                See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(4)(B).        Thus, the area in which the disputed\n\ninterpretation operates is within the heartland of the Secretary's\n\nexpertise.\n\n           As   to     consistency,    there    is   no   evidence   that   the\n\nSecretary has ever interpreted the word \"investigation,\" as used in\n\nthe HCQIA, in a manner inconsistent with the interpretation that he\n\nadvances     here.       The   Secretary     initially     articulated      this\n\ninterpretation in the Guidebook, which was published in 2001.                In\n\nadjudicating     the     appellant's     administrative       complaint,     he\n\nfaithfully applied that definition.            His final decision observed\n\nthat the challenged interpretation reflected \"long established\n\npolicy,\" and the appellant has not contested that observation. The\n\nconsistency of the Secretary's interpretation, over time, furnishes\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fsome degree of support for deferring to that interpretation.                         See\n\nN. Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 522 n.12 (1982);\n\nEstate of Landers, 545 F.3d at 107; see also Barnhart v. Walton,\n\n535 U.S. 212, 219 (2002).\n\n               We turn now to the most salient of the factors that\n\ninform    an    assessment       of    persuasiveness:       the   validity    of    the\n\nagency's       reasoning.           This   inquiry    does    not    focus     on    the\n\ninterpretation per se but, rather, on whether the agency has\n\nconsulted appropriate sources, employed sensible heuristic tools,\n\nand adequately substantiated its ultimate conclusion.                      See De La\n\nMota, 412 F.3d at 80.\n\n               Here,       the   Secretary     made    good    use    of     available\n\ninterpretive resources.               In particular, he construed the word\n\n\"investigation\" in light of the overall structure and evident\n\npurpose of the statutory scheme.                  Those were potentially fertile\n\ngrounds for assistance in carrying out the mission of statutory\n\nconstruction.          See Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 546 U.S. 481, 486\n\n(2006).\n\n               By    the     same     token,   the    Secretary      handled        these\n\ninterpretive resources in a logical and intellectually disciplined\n\nmanner.    He began by remarking a broad congressional purpose: \"to\n\nimprove the quality of health care by encouraging hospitals to\n\nidentify and discipline practitioners who engage in unprofessional\n\nbehavior.\"          This went hand in glove with the related goal of\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f\"restrict[ing] the ability of incompetent practitioners from moving\n\nState to State without disclosure or discovery of [a] previous\n\nadverse action . . . history.\"          The text of the statute bears out\n\nthis statement of the overarching congressional purpose.                     See,\n\ne.g., 42 U.S.C. § 11101(2).            The Secretary's reasoning also is\n\nbuttressed by the statute's legislative history, which evinces\n\nCongress's concern that \"hospitals too often accept 'voluntary'\n\nresignations of incompetent doctors in return for the hospital's\n\n[sic] silence about the reasons for the resignations.\"                 H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 99-903, at 3 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6385;\n\nsee   H.R.   Rep.    No.   99-903,   at   15   (1986),     reprinted    in   1986\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6397 (commenting that hospitals too readily\n\n\"resort to 'plea bargains' in which a physician agrees to [a\n\nsurrender of privileges] in return for the health care entity's\n\npromise   not   to    inform   other    health     care   entities   about    the\n\ncircumstances of the physician's surrender of privileges\").\n\n             Reasoning from this overarching congressional purpose,\n\nthe Secretary concluded that Congress did not intend to construct\n\nan easily accessible escape hatch that would permit beleaguered\n\nphysicians to elude the reach of the HCQIA's reporting requirement.\n\nHe noted that the HCQIA contemplates reporting both when a hospital\n\ntakes   certain      actions   implicating     a   physician,   42     U.S.C.   §\n\n11133(a)(1)(A), and when a physician resigns during the currency of\n\nan investigation, id. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i).            A grudging view of the\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fduration   of   an   investigation,   such   as   that   proposed   by    the\n\nappellant, would create a gap between the completion of fact-\n\ngathering and the taking of a final disciplinary action.            During\n\nthis \"gap period,\" a physician could resign with impunity.               That\n\neasy escape would operate at cross-purposes with the goal of the\n\nreporting requirement.\n\n           Conversely, interpreting the word \"investigation\" more\n\nexpansively affords seamless coverage of the period from the start\n\nof an inquiry until the taking of a final disciplinary action.\n\nThat prevents the creation of a gap.         At the same time, it serves\n\nCongress's evident purpose.\n\n           This is sound reasoning. In light of it, the Secretary's\n\nensuing interpretation of the word \"investigation,\" while not\n\ninevitable, is eminently sensible.\n\n           In the face of this interpretation, the appellant looses\n\na barrage of counter-arguments aimed at derailing any claim to\n\nSkidmore deference.     His initial attack centers on plain meaning.\n\nHis thesis is that the plain meaning of the word \"investigation\" is\n\nlimited to fact-gathering.\n\n           The appellant's premise is undeniably correct: the plain\n\nmeaning of words in the text of a statute constitutes the proper\n\nstarting point for interpreting that statute.        Hughes Aircraft Co.\n\nv. Jacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999); Aguilar v. U.S. Immig. &\n\nCustoms Enf., 510 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007).         But \"[i]n the last\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fanalysis, words are like chameleons; they frequently have different\n\nshades of meaning depending upon the circumstances.\" United States\n\nv.   Romain,    393    F.3d   63,   74   (1st   Cir.    2004).      The     word\n\n\"investigation\" exemplifies this truism.\n\n            That word commonly is used to refer to the process of\n\ngathering facts. See, e.g., Random House Dictionary of the English\n\nLanguage 1004 (2d ed. 1987).        However, it also is commonly used in\n\na broader sense to refer to a \"detailed examination\" or \"searching\n\ninquiry.\"      Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary of the English\n\nLanguage 1189 (1993).         Congress itself has used the word in that\n\nbroader sense, see, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(4)(D)(ii) (defining\n\n\"national security investigation\"), as have the courts, see, e.g.,\n\nUnited Eng'g & Forging v. United States, 779 F. Supp. 1375, 1393\n\n(C.I.T.     1991)     (concluding   that    imports     were     \"subject     to\n\ninvestigation\" because they remained \"under consideration\"). Given\n\nthe range of meanings associated with the word \"investigation,\" we\n\nthink that the Secretary was obliged in this instance to look\n\nbeyond raw language and to consider the larger context of the\n\nHCQIA.    That is exactly what the Secretary did.\n\n            Next,     the   appellant    contends   that   the    Secretary's\n\nunderstanding conflates \"investigation\" with two other terms that\n\nappear in the text of the HCQIA, namely, \"professional review\n\nactivity\" and \"professional review action.\"            This contention lacks\n\nforce.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f             We do not doubt that a legislative body usually means\n\ndifferent things when it uses varying terminology in a single\n\nstatute.      See, e.g., Ariz. Health Care Cost Containment Sys. v.\n\nMcClellan, 508 F.3d 1243, 1250 (9th Cir. 2007); Vonage Holdings\n\nCorp. v. FCC, 489 F.3d 1232, 1240 (D.C. Cir. 2007).                 Contrary to\n\nthe     appellant's        importunings,        however,     the    Secretary's\n\nunderstanding of the word \"investigation\" does not make the word\n\nsynonymous with either a \"professional review activity\" or a\n\n\"professional review action.\"\n\n             The HCQIA defines a \"professional review activity\" as an\n\nactivity designed to \"change or modify\" a physician's clinical\n\nprivileges. 42 U.S.C. § 11151(10)(C). The appellant suggests that\n\nthis term encompasses the entire process through which a hospital\n\nalters a physician's clinical privileges — that is, from the\n\ncommencement of fact-gathering through the final decision.\n\n             We reject this construction, instead agreeing with the\n\nSecretary that the term \"professional review activity\" refers, one\n\nby    one,   to    each   of   the   discrete   activities   that   a   hospital\n\nundertakes during the course of its investigation (e.g., accepting\n\na complaint, deciding to investigate, appointing an investigating\n\ncommittee, conducting fact-gathering, preparing a report, and so on\n\nand so forth, up to the point at which a professional review action\n\nis taken).        See Mathews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 87 F.3d 624, 634\n\n(3d Cir. 1996) (upholding district court's determination that\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f\"professional review activities\" are \"preliminary investigative\n\nmeasures    taken      in     'a   reasonable     effort     to   obtain     the   facts'\n\nrelevant to a possible change in a physician's privileges\"); Singh\n\nv. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 182 F. Supp. 2d 164,\n\n171 (D. Mass. 2001) (holding that \"professional review activities\"\n\nwere     \"steps   in     an    investigation          that   ultimately      led   to     an\n\n'action'\"), aff'd, 308 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2002).                            We need not\n\nitemize the inventory of professional review activities today. For\n\npresent     purposes,         it    suffices     to    say   that    the    Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of the term \"investigation\" is not coterminous with\n\nhis interpretation of the term \"professional review activity\"\n\nbecause the former encompasses a myriad of the latter.\n\n             So too the term \"professional review action.\"                    That term\n\ndenotes an adverse \"action or recommendation . . . taken or made in\n\nthe course of a professional review activity.\"                             42 U.S.C. §\n\n11151(9).          The      Secretary's         interpretation       holds     that       an\n\ninvestigation terminates when a final action is taken. That action\n\nis   a   \"professional        review      action\"     within   the   purview       of    the\n\nstatute.      Thus,         while    an   investigation        may   culminate      in     a\n\nprofessional review action, the Secretary's interpretation gives a\n\ndistinct meaning to each term.                 Consequently, he has not conflated\n\ntheir meanings.\n\n             In a related vein, the appellant suggests that the\n\nSecretary's       interpretation          of    \"investigation\"      makes    the       word\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fsynonymous with yet another statutory term: \"formal peer review\n\nprocess.\"   42 U.S.C. § 11151(4)(A).         Though the latter term is not\n\ndefined in the HCQIA, the Secretary's implementing regulations\n\nstate that the phrase \"formal peer review process\" refers to \"the\n\nconduct of professional review activities through formally adopted\n\nwritten   procedures     which   provide     for   adequate   notice      and   an\n\nopportunity to be heard.\"        45 C.F.R. § 60.3.       As such, the formal\n\npeer   review    process     refers   only    to   a    particular       type   of\n\ninvestigation.     The two terms, as used by the Secretary, do not\n\nduplicate each other.\n\n            In a further fusillade, the appellant maintains that the\n\nSecretary misperceived the core purpose of the HCQIA.                He argues,\n\nin   essence,   that   the   Secretary     erred   in   inferring    a    general\n\ncongressional intent to encourage reporting.            In support, he notes\n\nthat the HCQIA does not require reporting of all disciplinary\n\nmeasures imposed upon physicians but, rather, limits itself to\n\nprofessional review actions that adversely affect a physician's\n\nclinical privileges for longer than thirty days.              See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n11133(a)(1)(A).        Building on this foundation, he posits that\n\nCongress most likely contemplated piecemeal reporting under very\n\nspecific circumstances.\n\n            This is whistling past the graveyard.             We believe that\n\nthe Secretary supportably discerned a broad congressional purpose\n\nto improve the delivery of health care by mandating the reporting\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fof significant disciplinary measures taken against physicians and\n\ncurtailing the ability of physicians to abort inquiries into\n\npotential misconduct.         The legislative history, alluded to above,\n\nmakes this purpose abundantly clear.\n\n          At oral argument, the appellant added a new twist to this\n\ncontention.     He     theorized     that      Congress    must    have     intended\n\npiecemeal reporting as a means of allowing private parties maximum\n\nflexibility in adjusting the terms of employment relationships. We\n\ndemur.   The legislative history leaves little doubt but that\n\nCongress was concerned with putting an end to the sort of private\n\ndeals that the appellant claims the HCQIA is meant to foster.                    See,\n\ne.g., H.R. Rep. No. 99-903, at 3, 15 (1986), reprinted in 1986\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6385, 6397.\n\n          Finally,      the     appellant       claims     that    the     Secretary\n\nerroneously failed to consult the Hospital's bylaws.                     This charge\n\nis unfounded.\n\n          A   hospital's       bylaws    may    shed     light    on   whether    the\n\ninstitution has initiated an investigation within the purview of\n\nthe statute and, if so, whether that investigation is ongoing.\n\nSee, e.g., Simpkins v. Shalala, 999 F. Supp. 106, 115-16 (D.D.C.\n\n1998).   The Secretary, in the Guidebook, has recognized that a\n\nhospital's    bylaws    may    be   useful     in   such   ways.         See,   e.g.,\n\nGuidebook, at E-21.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\f           That is not to say, however, that the meaning of the word\n\n\"investigation,\" as that word is used in the statute, will vary\n\nfrom case to case depending on a particular hospital's bylaws. The\n\nfederal judiciary and the agency to which the interpretive task has\n\nbeen entrusted have independent responsibilities for fashioning a\n\nglobal definition, and a hospital cannot frustrate that definition\n\nthrough its bylaws.       If, say, a hospital's bylaws used the word\n\n\"investigation\" to describe a phenomenon that ended upon the\n\ncompletion of fact-gathering, the Secretary would not be compelled\n\nto interpret Congress's use of the word \"investigation\" in lockstep\n\nwith that idiosyncratic definition.\n\n           In   all    events,   the   bylaw   provisions   cited   by   the\n\nappellant are not inconsistent with the Secretary's interpretation.\n\nThey provide in substance that the AHC, once assembled, must submit\n\nits written report to the medical staff's executive committee\n\nwithin ten days.      It is simply too much of a stretch to say, as the\n\nappellant urges, that this means that the investigation is formally\n\nconcluded at that point.         After all, the same bylaws give the\n\nexecutive committee ten additional days to take action on the AHC's\n\nreport.2\n\n           To recapitulate, the Secretary has performed a careful,\n\nwell-reasoned analysis of the meaning of the word \"investigation\"\n\n\n     2\n       Notably, the appellant tendered his resignation during this\nsecond ten-day period, even though it was not accepted until after\nthat period had expired.\n\n                                   -23-\n\fas   that    word    is    used   in     the   HCQIA.             He   consulted      all    the\n\nconventional sources, relied upon appropriate considerations (such\n\nas the overall structure of the HCQIA, the congressional purpose\n\nbehind it, and the most efficacious means of effectuating that\n\npurpose),     and     reasoned     convincingly             to    a    conclusion.          That\n\nconclusion     flows       logically      from    the       materials          consulted     and\n\nreflects long-standing policy, consistently applied.                             Given these\n\nfactors and given the Secretary's expertise, Skidmore demands that\n\nwe   defer    to    his    persuasive      and    well-supported               view   that     an\n\n\"investigation\"           ends    only     when         a        health    care       entity's\n\ndecisionmaking authority either takes a final action or formally\n\ncloses the investigation.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n             Skidmore requires courts to walk a fine line, and we have\n\nendeavored to do so here.              For the reasons elucidated above, we\n\nfind   the     Secretary's        interpretation              deserving         of    Skidmore\n\ndeference.

Duddy, with whom Kelly, Remmel &amp; Zimmerman was on brief, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Eric Fleisig-Greene, Attorney, Appellate Staff, with whom Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Mark B. Stern, Attorney, Appellate Staff, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, SELYA, and STAHL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This appeal requires us to construe the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in a provision of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA), a statute that directs hospitals and other health care entities to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) in the event that a physician surrenders his clinical privileges while he is \"under an investigation\" for suspected incompetence or improper professional conduct. 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i). The question is one of first impression at the federal appellate level.</p>\n<p>In the underlying administrative proceeding, the Secretary concluded that an investigation is ongoing for purposes of the HCQIA until the hospital's decisionmaking process runs its course and the hospital either takes a final action or formally closes the probe. The appellant, a physician reported to the Secretary under section 11133(a)(1)(B)(i), challenged the Secretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation.\" The district court rejected this challenge and upheld the Secretary's action. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, information gathered pursuant to the reporting provisions of the HCQIA is confidential. <i>See id.</i> § 11137(b)(1). But the statute expressly provides that information presented \"in a form that does not permit the identification of any particular health care entity, physician, other health care practitioner, or patient shall not be considered confidential.\" <i>Id.</i> In the case at hand, the protagonists' identities and the specific details of the alleged misconduct are easily separated from the central legal question. Accordingly, we sketch the background of the case with the aid of pseudonyms and generalities. That course allows us to balance two important but sometimes conflicting interests: on the one hand, safeguarding the privacy of physicians and other health care professionals; on the other hand, providing public access to judicial decisions.</p>\n<p>On July 26, 2005, an operating room nurse at the XYZ Hospital (the name is fictitious) filed a written complaint against the appellant (a physician whom we refer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> to by the alias \"Dr. Doe\"). The complaint charged that the appellant had threatened the nurse.</p>\n<p>The following day, the medical staff executive committee temporarily suspended Dr. Doe's privileges and appointed an ad hoc investigating committee (the AHC) to inquire into the nurse's allegations. On August 2, 2005, the AHC reported to the executive committee that the nurse reasonably perceived Dr. Doe's actions as threatening.</p>\n<p>Three days later, the executive committee met to discuss both the report and Dr. Doe's status. Following that discussion, the executive committee proposed that Dr. Doe be allowed to return to work so long as he agreed to certain contractual modifications, including provisions for regular proctoring and psychological evaluations. On August 11, Dr. Doe rejected this proposal and voluntarily relinquished his clinical privileges. The Hospital accepted his resignation on August 19.</p>\n<p>Believing that Dr. Doe had resigned while \"under an investigation,\" the Hospital reported his resignation to the National Practitioner Data Bank (the NPDB), a data bank established by the Secretary as a repository for reports filed pursuant to the HCQIA. <i>See</i> 45 C.F.R. § 60.1.</p>\n<p>On September 19, Dr. Doe requested administrative review of the Hospital's filing. <i>See id.</i> § 60.14. He contended that the Hospital's investigation had ended when the AHC presented its report to the executive committee and, therefore, that he had not resigned while under an investigation. An exchange of views followed.</p>\n<p>On May 25, 2007, the Secretary issued a written decision in which he ruled that the Hospital appropriately had reported the appellant to the NPDB. The Secretary premised this ruling on a statement that \"[a]n investigation is ... considered ongoing until the health care entity's decision making authority takes a final action or formally closes the investigation.\" Because the executive committee had neither taken a final disciplinary action nor formally closed its inquiry when Dr. Doe resigned, the Secretary found that Dr. Doe was still \"under an investigation\" at that moment. Consequently, the Hospital had a duty to report the resignation under 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>The appellant challenged this ruling in a suit brought against the Secretary under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. The parties cross-moved for judgment on the administrative record. The district court, in a sealed opinion, ruled in the Secretary's favor. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's decision de novo, applying the same standards to the Secretary's final action that the district court was bound to apply. <i>See </i><i>Mass. ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries v. Daley,</i> 170 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Assoc'd Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley,</i> 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.1997). We will reverse only if the Secretary's determination was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). We are not married to the lower court's reasoning but may uphold its decision on any ground made manifest by the record. <i>See </i><i>InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>The sole issue on appeal is the propriety of the Secretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in the HCQIA reporting provision, quoted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> in the margin.<sup>[1]</sup> The Secretary has determined that an investigation is ongoing (and, therefore, a matter is under investigation) until a health care entity makes a final decision or formally closes the probe, even if the entity is no longer gathering facts but is merely deliberating about what course of action it should follow.</p>\n<p>The appellant argues that the Secretary has cast too wide a net. He maintains that the word \"investigation,\" as used in the statute, refers only to the fact-gathering phase of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>In dealing with these dueling interpretations, a threshold question looms: What level of deference, if any, is due to the Secretary's interpretation? We tackle that question first and then proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Deference Question.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>It cannot be gainsaid that the Secretary possesses authority to promulgate regulations implementing the HCQIA. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. § 11136. Withal, the Secretary has not exercised this rulemaking authority to set forth his interpretation of the word \"investigation.\" Instead, the Secretary's interpretation must be gleaned from (i) an agency manual, the NPDB Guidebook (the Guidebook), issued in September of 2001, and (ii) the Secretary's decision in this case. The appellant contends that these \"informal\" interpretations do not warrant deference under the familiar rubric of <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), but must be evaluated under the more neutral framework limned in <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). The Secretary counters that <i>Chevron</i> offers the appropriate frame of reference. The district court nimbly sidestepped this question, vouchsafing that the Secretary's interpretation of the word was unimpugnable regardless of what level of deference attached.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the Court's opinion in <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 226-27, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001), the level of deference owing to informal agency interpretations is freighted with uncertainty. <i>See</i> Lisa Schultz Bressman, <i>How Mead Has Muddled Judicial Review of Agency Action,</i> 58 Vand. L.Rev. 1443, 1457-69 (2005) (reviewing divergent applications of <i>Mead</i> by various courts of appeals). The <i>Mead</i> Court seems to have contemplated the application of <i>Chevron</i> deference to most statutory interpretations that are the fruit of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudications. <i>See </i><i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S. at 229-31, 121 S.Ct. 2164; <i>but cf. </i><i>Nat'l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Serv.,</i> 545 U.S. 967, 1004, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring) (stating that \"the existence of a formal rulemaking proceeding\" is not \"a sufficient condition for according <i>Chevron</i> deference to an agency's interpretation of a statute\"). In some ways, however, <i>Mead</i> is unhelpful: for instance, the decision does not clarify the circumstances in which Congress should be deemed to have intended an informal agency interpretation to carry the force of law and, thus, attract <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See </i><i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S. at 231, 121 S.Ct. 2164. <i>Mead</i> indicates, however, that even if an informal agency interpretation is deemed not to warrant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> <i>Chevron</i> deference, it may nonetheless lay claim to a lesser degree of deference under the <i>Skidmore</i> banner. <i>Id.</i> at 234, 121 S.Ct. 2164.</p>\n<p>The case at hand falls into this gray area. The Guidebook is an agency manual. It is not a product of notice-and-comment rulemaking, nor was it ever published in the Federal Register, which makes only a glancing reference to it, <i>see</i> Notice Announcing Opening Date of NPDB, 55 Fed.Reg. 31,239-01 (Aug. 1, 1990). Given these facts, we do not believe that the Guidebook is entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See </i><i>Christensen v. Harris County,</i> 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000); <i>Visiting Nurse Ass'n Gregoria Auffant, Inc. v. Thompson,</i> 447 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir.2006); <i>De La Mota v. U.S. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 412 F.3d 71, 79 (2d Cir.2005); <i>Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of HHS,</i> 332 F.3d 654, 660 (D.C.Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p>This leaves the Secretary's decision. Congress explicitly empowered the Secretary to establish dispute resolution procedures relative to HCQIA filings. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 11136(2). In response, the Secretary promulgated a regulation that established an adjudicative process  a process that, among other things, provides for secretarial review of written information submitted by both the reporting entity and the reported physician, as well as the issuance of a final administrative determination anent the accuracy of reported information. <i>See</i> 45 C.F.R. § 60.14. The decision in this case was a creature of this adjudicative process. Although secretarial review is not governed by the trial-like procedures characteristic of formal agency adjudications, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 5 U.S.C. §§ 554, 556, 557, several courts have afforded <i>Chevron</i> deference to agency adjudications similar in type and kind to the agency action at issue here, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 446 v. Nicholson,</i> 475 F.3d 341, 353-54 (D.C.Cir.2007); <i>Cleveland Nat'l Air Show, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Transp.,</i> 430 F.3d 757, 763-64 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Davis v. EPA,</i> 348 F.3d 772, 779 &amp; n. 5 (9th Cir.2003). Other courts, however, have declined to afford <i>Chevron</i> deference to the fruit of informal agency adjudications. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S. at 221, 121 S.Ct. 2164; <i>Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2152 v. Principi,</i> 464 F.3d 1049, 1057 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>This is an interesting legal conundrum, but the task of a federal appellate court is to resolve particular cases and controversies, not merely to satisfy intellectual curiosity (whether its own curiosity or that of others). In the last analysis, we agree with the district court that the level of deference is not determinative here; whether viewed through the prism of <i>Chevron</i> or the less forgiving prism of <i>Skidmore,</i> the Secretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation\" withstands scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Thus, we bypass the question of whether the Secretary's decision engenders <i>Chevron</i> deference. Instead, we assume, favorably to the appellant and in line with his argument, that the Secretary's interpretation should be evaluated under the <i>Skidmore</i> standard. We proceed on that assumption.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Merits.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The nuances of the <i>Skidmore</i> standard are not cut-and-dried. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cathedral Candle Co. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n,</i> 400 F.3d 1352, 1365-66 (Fed.Cir.2005) (discussing varying formulations). The Supreme Court has characterized <i>Skidmore</i> as requiring courts to defer to agency interpretations of statutes within the agency's ken \"to the extent that those interpretations have the `power to persuade.'\" <i>Christensen,</i> 529 U.S. at 587, 120 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> 1655 (quoting <i>Skidmore,</i> 323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161). If this is not an unabashed tautology, it must mean something more than that deference is due only when an inquiring court is itself persuaded that the agency got it right. Otherwise, <i>Skidmore</i> deference would not be deference at all.</p>\n<p>What the <i>Skidmore</i> standard entails is a sliding-scale approach under which the degree of deference accorded to an agency interpretation hinges on a variety of factors, such as \"the thoroughness evident in [the agency's] consideration, the validity of its reasoning, [and the] consistency [of its interpretation] with earlier and later pronouncements.\" <i>Skidmore,</i> 323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161. That compendium is not exhaustive; other factors may weigh in the balance. <i>See</i> Kristin E. Hickman &amp; Matthew D. Krueger, <i>In Search of the Modern Skidmore Standard,</i> 107 Colum. L.Rev. 1235, 1259 (2007) (identifying \"thoroughness, formality, validity, consistency, and agency expertise\" as factors in an agency's power to persuade).</p>\n<p>These factors are meant to test the seriousness of, and therefore the respect due to, the process that underlies the agency's interpretation. The mix of factors, once assayed, either contributes to or detracts from the power of an agency's interpretation to persuade. <i>See </i><i>Skidmore,</i> 323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161. We turn, then, to how these factors impact the Secretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>We start with formality and thoroughness. The record makes manifest that the Secretary's decision was not the product of a strictly formal adjudication. Even so, not all informal agency adjudications stand on the same footing. Here, the adjudication progressed according to a previously established panoply of structured rules that allowed for written submissions by all affected parties. <i>See</i> 45 C.F.R. § 60.14(c). Greater weight ordinarily is due to interpretations that result from a structured interpretive process as opposed to a catch-as-catch-can interpretive process. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>High Sierra Hikers Ass'n v. Blackwell,</i> 390 F.3d 630, 648 (9th Cir.2004); <i>Structural Indus., Inc. v. United States,</i> 356 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed.Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p>The Secretary plainly understood the need for in-depth consideration of the disputed issue. He initially set forth his construction of the word \"investigation\" in the Guidebook, a comprehensive manual of general applicability. Normally, greater deference is due to an interpretation that \"is not merely ad hoc ... but is applicable to all cases.\" <i>Chauffeur's Training Sch., Inc. v. Spellings,</i> 478 F.3d 117, 129 (2d Cir.2007); <i>accord </i><i>Estate of Landers v. Leavitt,</i> 545 F.3d 98, 110 (2d Cir.2008). So it is here.</p>\n<p>The Secretary then reiterated his understanding of the word \"investigation\" in his decision in this case. Several aspects of the decision indicate that it was the product of thorough consideration. First, the decision was issued by the Secretary himselfthe highest-ranking official in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Second, the procedures employed encouraged the operation of the deliberative process.</p>\n<p>In particular, there was a meaningful give-and-take. In a letter to the Hospital dated May 26, 2006, the agency's dispute resolution manager set out the agency's working definition of an \"investigation\" and requested further information. The appellant received a copy of this letter. On June 6, 2006, the appellant responded, controverting the agency's working definition. The issue was, therefore, precisely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> framed and the protagonists had the opportunity to confront each other's views. This sort of open exchange is a badge of thoroughness. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rubie's Costume Co. v. United States,</i> 337 F.3d 1350, 1356 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Secretary's decision fully engaged the appellant's proposed interpretation of section 11133(a)(1)(B)(i). The Secretary found that interpretation deficient largely because it failed to square with the policies underlying the HCQIA. In support, the Secretary highlighted relevant portions of both the statutory scheme and its legislative history. This detailed exegesis makes it transparently clear that the Secretary's interpretation was a product of thorough consideration. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>W. Union Tel. Co. v. FCC,</i> 665 F.2d 1126, 1143 (D.C.Cir.1981) (upholding, under <i>Skidmore,</i> an agency interpretation that was based upon thorough analysis of statute and legislative history).</p>\n<p>Moving to other factors, expertise and consistency counsel in favor of honoring the Secretary's interpretation. As to the former, HHS, over which the Secretary presides, has broad oversight of physician performance. Given the huge federal stake in the funding of Medicare, Medicaid, and related programs, the Secretary has had a powerful incentive to develop a body of knowledge about problems affecting physician performance. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Estate of Landers,</i> 545 F.3d at 107 (noting high degree of expert knowledge required to run programs such as Medicare and Medicaid). Indeed, the Secretary is charged with determining whether and when a physician's rights to participate in these complex programs should be suspended where, for example, the physician surrenders his license to practice in a particular state while under investigation for misconduct or incompetence. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(4)(B). Thus, the area in which the disputed interpretation operates is within the heartland of the Secretary's expertise.</p>\n<p>As to consistency, there is no evidence that the Secretary has ever interpreted the word \"investigation,\" as used in the HCQIA, in a manner inconsistent with the interpretation that he advances here. The Secretary initially articulated this interpretation in the Guidebook, which was published in 2001. In adjudicating the appellant's administrative complaint, he faithfully applied that definition. His final decision observed that the challenged interpretation reflected \"long established policy,\" and the appellant has not contested that observation. The consistency of the Secretary's interpretation, over time, furnishes some degree of support for deferring to that interpretation. <i>See </i><i>N. Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell,</i> 456 U.S. 512, 522 n. 12, 102 S.Ct. 1912, 72 L.Ed.2d 299 (1982); <i>Estate of Landers,</i> 545 F.3d at 107; <i>see also </i><i>Barnhart v. Walton,</i> 535 U.S. 212, 219, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002).</p>\n<p>We turn now to the most salient of the factors that inform an assessment of persuasiveness: the validity of the agency's reasoning. This inquiry does not focus on the interpretation per se but, rather, on whether the agency has consulted appropriate sources, employed sensible heuristic tools, and adequately substantiated its ultimate conclusion. <i>See </i><i>De La Mota,</i> 412 F.3d at 80.</p>\n<p>Here, the Secretary made good use of available interpretive resources. In particular, he construed the word \"investigation\" in light of the overall structure and evident purpose of the statutory scheme. Those were potentially fertile grounds for assistance in carrying out the mission of statutory construction. <i>See </i><i>Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> 546 U.S. 481, 486, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 163 L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> By the same token, the Secretary handled these interpretive resources in a logical and intellectually disciplined manner. He began by remarking a broad congressional purpose: \"to improve the quality of health care by encouraging hospitals to identify and discipline practitioners who engage in unprofessional behavior.\" This went hand in glove with the related goal of \"restrict[ing] the ability of incompetent practitioners from moving State to State without disclosure or discovery of [a] previous adverse action ... history.\" The text of the statute bears out this statement of the overarching congressional purpose. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. § 11101(2). The Secretary's reasoning also is buttressed by the statute's legislative history, which evinces Congress's concern that \"hospitals too often accept `voluntary' resignations of incompetent doctors in return for the hospital's [sic] silence about the reasons for the resignations.\" H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 3 (1986), <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6385; <i>see</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 15 (1986), <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6397 (commenting that hospitals too readily \"resort to `plea bargains' in which a physician agrees to [a surrender of privileges] in return for the health care entity's promise not to inform other health care entities about the circumstances of the physician's surrender of privileges\").</p>\n<p>Reasoning from this overarching congressional purpose, the Secretary concluded that Congress did not intend to construct an easily accessible escape hatch that would permit beleaguered physicians to elude the reach of the HCQIA's reporting requirement. He noted that the HCQIA contemplates reporting both when a hospital takes certain actions implicating a physician, 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(A), and when a physician resigns during the currency of an investigation, <i>id.</i> § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i). A grudging view of the duration of an investigation, such as that proposed by the appellant, would create a gap between the completion of fact-gathering and the taking of a final disciplinary action. During this \"gap period,\" a physician could resign with impunity. That easy escape would operate at cross-purposes with the goal of the reporting requirement.</p>\n<p>Conversely, interpreting the word \"investigation\" more expansively affords seamless coverage of the period from the start of an inquiry until the taking of a final disciplinary action. That prevents the creation of a gap. At the same time, it serves Congress's evident purpose.</p>\n<p>This is sound reasoning. In light of it, the Secretary's ensuing interpretation of the word \"investigation,\" while not inevitable, is eminently sensible.</p>\n<p>In the face of this interpretation, the appellant looses a barrage of counter-arguments aimed at derailing any claim to <i>Skidmore</i> deference. His initial attack centers on plain meaning. His thesis is that the plain meaning of the word \"investigation\" is limited to fact-gathering.</p>\n<p>The appellant's premise is undeniably correct: the plain meaning of words in the text of a statute constitutes the proper starting point for interpreting that statute. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson,</i> 525 U.S. 432, 438, 119 S.Ct. 755, 142 L.Ed.2d 881 (1999); <i>Aguilar v. U.S. Immig. &amp; Customs Enf.,</i> 510 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2007). But \"[i]n the last analysis, words are like chameleons; they frequently have different shades of meaning depending upon the circumstances.\" <i>United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 74 (1st Cir.2004). The word \"investigation\" exemplifies this truism.</p>\n<p>That word commonly is used to refer to the process of gathering facts. <i>See, e.g., Random House Dictionary of the English</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> <i>Language</i> 1004 (2d ed.1987). However, it also is commonly used in a broader sense to refer to a \"detailed examination\" or \"searching inquiry.\" <i>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary of the English Language</i> 1189 (1993). Congress itself has used the word in that broader sense, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(4)(D)(ii) (defining \"national security investigation\"), as have the courts, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United Eng'g &amp; Forging v. United States,</i> 779 F.Supp. 1375, 1393 (C.I.T.1991) (concluding that imports were \"subject to investigation\" because they remained \"under consideration\"). Given the range of meanings associated with the word \"investigation,\" we think that the Secretary was obliged in this instance to look beyond raw language and to consider the larger context of the HCQIA. That is exactly what the Secretary did.</p>\n<p>Next, the appellant contends that the Secretary's understanding conflates \"investigation\" with two other terms that appear in the text of the HCQIA, namely, \"professional review activity\" and \"professional review action.\" This contention lacks force.</p>\n<p>We do not doubt that a legislative body usually means different things when it uses varying terminology in a single statute. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ariz. Health Care Cost Containment Sys. v. McClellan,</i> 508 F.3d 1243, 1250 (9th Cir.2007); <i>Vonage Holdings Corp. v. FCC,</i> 489 F.3d 1232, 1240 (D.C.Cir.2007). Contrary to the appellant's importunings, however, the Secretary's understanding of the word \"investigation\" does not make the word synonymous with either a \"professional review activity\" or a \"professional review action.\"</p>\n<p>The HCQIA defines a \"professional review activity\" as an activity designed to \"change or modify\" a physician's clinical privileges. 42 U.S.C. § 11151(10)(C). The appellant suggests that this term encompasses the entire process through which a hospital alters a physician's clinical privileges that is, from the commencement of fact-gathering through the final decision.</p>\n<p>We reject this construction, instead agreeing with the Secretary that the term \"professional review activity\" refers, one by one, to each of the discrete activities that a hospital undertakes during the course of its investigation (<i>e.g.,</i> accepting a complaint, deciding to investigate, appointing an investigating committee, conducting fact-gathering, preparing a report, and so on and so forth, up to the point at which a professional review action is taken). <i>See </i><i>Mathews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp.,</i> 87 F.3d 624, 634 (3d Cir.1996) (upholding district court's determination that \"professional review activities\" are \"preliminary investigative measures taken in `a reasonable effort to obtain the facts' relevant to a possible change in a physician's privileges\"); <i>Singh v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,</i> 182 F.Supp.2d 164, 171 (D.Mass.2001) (holding that \"professional review activities\" were \"steps in an investigation that ultimately led to an `action'\"), <i>aff'd,</i> 308 F.3d 25 (1st Cir.2002). We need not itemize the inventory of professional review activities today. For present purposes, it suffices to say that the Secretary's interpretation of the term \"investigation\" is not coterminous with his interpretation of the term \"professional review activity\" because the former encompasses a myriad of the latter.</p>\n<p>So too the term \"professional review action.\" That term denotes an adverse \"action or recommendation ... taken or made in the course of a professional review activity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 11151(9). The Secretary's interpretation holds that an investigation terminates when a final action is taken. That action is a \"professional review action\" within the purview of the statute. Thus, while an investigation may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> culminate in a professional review action, the Secretary's interpretation gives a distinct meaning to each term. Consequently, he has not conflated their meanings.</p>\n<p>In a related vein, the appellant suggests that the Secretary's interpretation of \"investigation\" makes the word synonymous with yet another statutory term: \"formal peer review process.\" 42 U.S.C. § 11151(4)(A). Though the latter term is not defined in the HCQIA, the Secretary's implementing regulations state that the phrase \"formal peer review process\" refers to \"the conduct of professional review activities through formally adopted written procedures which provide for adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard.\" 45 C.F.R. § 60.3. As such, the formal peer review process refers only to a particular type of investigation. The two terms, as used by the Secretary, do not duplicate each other.</p>\n<p>In a further fusillade, the appellant maintains that the Secretary misperceived the core purpose of the HCQIA. He argues, in essence, that the Secretary erred in inferring a general congressional intent to encourage reporting. In support, he notes that the HCQIA does not require reporting of all disciplinary measures imposed upon physicians but, rather, limits itself to professional review actions that adversely affect a physician's clinical privileges for longer than thirty days. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(A). Building on this foundation, he posits that Congress most likely contemplated piecemeal reporting under very specific circumstances.</p>\n<p>This is whistling past the graveyard. We believe that the Secretary supportably discerned a broad congressional purpose to improve the delivery of health care by mandating the reporting of significant disciplinary measures taken against physicians and curtailing the ability of physicians to abort inquiries into potential misconduct. The legislative history, alluded to above, makes this purpose abundantly clear.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, the appellant added a new twist to this contention. He theorized that Congress must have intended piecemeal reporting as a means of allowing private parties maximum flexibility in adjusting the terms of employment relationships. We demur. The legislative history leaves little doubt but that Congress was concerned with putting an end to the sort of private deals that the appellant claims the HCQIA is meant to foster. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 3, 15 (1986), <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6385, 6397.</p>\n<p>Finally, the appellant claims that the Secretary erroneously failed to consult the Hospital's bylaws. This charge is unfounded.</p>\n<p>A hospital's bylaws may shed light on whether the institution has initiated an investigation within the purview of the statute and, if so, whether that investigation is ongoing. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Simpkins v. Shalala,</i> 999 F.Supp. 106, 115-16 (D.D.C. 1998). The Secretary, in the Guidebook, has recognized that a hospital's bylaws may be useful in such ways. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Guidebook, at E-21.</p>\n<p>That is not to say, however, that the meaning of the word \"investigation,\" as that word is used in the statute, will vary from case to case depending on a particular hospital's bylaws. The federal judiciary and the agency to which the interpretive task has been entrusted have independent responsibilities for fashioning a global definition, and a hospital cannot frustrate that definition through its bylaws. If, say, a hospital's bylaws used the word \"investigation\" to describe a phenomenon that ended upon the completion of fact-gathering, the Secretary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> would not be compelled to interpret Congress's use of the word \"investigation\" in lockstep with that idiosyncratic definition.</p>\n<p>In all events, the bylaw provisions cited by the appellant are not inconsistent with the Secretary's interpretation. They provide in substance that the AHC, once assembled, must submit its written report to the medical staff's executive committee within ten days. It is simply too much of a stretch to say, as the appellant urges, that this means that the investigation is formally concluded at that point. After all, the same bylaws give the executive committee ten additional days to take action on the AHC's report.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>To recapitulate, the Secretary has performed a careful, well-reasoned analysis of the meaning of the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in the HCQIA. He consulted all the conventional sources, relied upon appropriate considerations (such as the overall structure of the HCQIA, the congressional purpose behind it, and the most efficacious means of effectuating that purpose), and reasoned convincingly to a conclusion. That conclusion flows logically from the materials consulted and reflects long-standing policy, consistently applied. Given these factors and given the Secretary's expertise, <i>Skidmore</i> demands that we defer to his persuasive and well-supported view that an \"investigation\" ends only when a health care entity's decisionmaking authority either takes a final action or formally closes the investigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>Skidmore</i> requires courts to walk a fine line, and we have endeavored to do so here. For the reasons elucidated above, we find the Secretary's interpretation deserving of <i>Skidmore</i> deference. Thus, we agree that the Hospital duly reported the appellant's resignation to the NPDB pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i). We need go no further. We hold that the lower court did not err in rejecting the appellant's attempt to reverse the Secretary's action.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In pertinent part, the provision imposes a reporting obligation on any health care entity that\n</p>\n<p>accepts the surrender of clinical privileges of a physician </p>\n<p>(i) while the physician is under an investigation by the entity relating to possible incompetence or improper professional conduct....</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>[2]  Notably, the appellant tendered his resignation during this second ten-day period, even though it was not accepted until after that period had expired.</p>\n\n</div>",

Katsas, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Mark B. Stern, Attorney, Appellate Staff, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, SELYA, and STAHL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This appeal requires us to construe the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in a provision of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA), a statute that directs hospitals and other health care entities to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) in the event that a physician surrenders his clinical privileges while he is \"under an investigation\" for suspected incompetence or improper professional conduct. 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i). The question is one of first impression at the federal appellate level.</p>\n<p>In the underlying administrative proceeding, the Secretary concluded that an investigation is ongoing for purposes of the HCQIA until the hospital's decisionmaking process runs its course and the hospital either takes a final action or formally closes the probe. The appellant, a physician reported to the Secretary under section 11133(a)(1)(B)(i), challenged the Secretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation.\" The district court rejected this challenge and upheld the Secretary's action. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, information gathered pursuant to the reporting provisions of the HCQIA is confidential. <i>See id.</i> § 11137(b)(1). But the statute expressly provides that information presented \"in a form that does not permit the identification of any particular health care entity, physician, other health care practitioner, or patient shall not be considered confidential.\" <i>Id.</i> In the case at hand, the protagonists' identities and the specific details of the alleged misconduct are easily separated from the central legal question. Accordingly, we sketch the background of the case with the aid of pseudonyms and generalities. That course allows us to balance two important but sometimes conflicting interests: on the one hand, safeguarding the privacy of physicians and other health care professionals; on the other hand, providing public access to judicial decisions.</p>\n<p>On July 26, 2005, an operating room nurse at the XYZ Hospital (the name is fictitious) filed a written complaint against the appellant (a physician whom we refer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> to by the alias \"Dr. Doe\"). The complaint charged that the appellant had threatened the nurse.</p>\n<p>The following day, the medical staff executive committee temporarily suspended Dr. Doe's privileges and appointed an ad hoc investigating committee (the AHC) to inquire into the nurse's allegations. On August 2, 2005, the AHC reported to the executive committee that the nurse reasonably perceived Dr. Doe's actions as threatening.</p>\n<p>Three days later, the executive committee met to discuss both the report and Dr. Doe's status. Following that discussion, the executive committee proposed that Dr. Doe be allowed to return to work so long as he agreed to certain contractual modifications, including provisions for regular proctoring and psychological evaluations. On August 11, Dr. Doe rejected this proposal and voluntarily relinquished his clinical privileges. The Hospital accepted his resignation on August 19.</p>\n<p>Believing that Dr. Doe had resigned while \"under an investigation,\" the Hospital reported his resignation to the National Practitioner Data Bank (the NPDB), a data bank established by the Secretary as a repository for reports filed pursuant to the HCQIA. <i>See</i> 45 C.F.R. § 60.1.</p>\n<p>On September 19, Dr. Doe requested administrative review of the Hospital's filing. <i>See id.</i> § 60.14. He contended that the Hospital's investigation had ended when the AHC presented its report to the executive committee and, therefore, that he had not resigned while under an investigation. An exchange of views followed.</p>\n<p>On May 25, 2007, the Secretary issued a written decision in which he ruled that the Hospital appropriately had reported the appellant to the NPDB. The Secretary premised this ruling on a statement that \"[a]n investigation is ... considered ongoing until the health care entity's decision making authority takes a final action or formally closes the investigation.\" Because the executive committee had neither taken a final disciplinary action nor formally closed its inquiry when Dr. Doe resigned, the Secretary found that Dr. Doe was still \"under an investigation\" at that moment. Consequently, the Hospital had a duty to report the resignation under 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>The appellant challenged this ruling in a suit brought against the Secretary under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. The parties cross-moved for judgment on the administrative record. The district court, in a sealed opinion, ruled in the Secretary's favor. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's decision de novo, applying the same standards to the Secretary's final action that the district court was bound to apply. <i>See </i><i>Mass. ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries v. Daley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198334\"><a href=\"/opinion/198334/commonwealth-v-daley-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Assoc'd Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197563\"><a href=\"/opinion/197563/associated-fisheries-v-us-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1997). We will reverse only if the Secretary's determination was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). We are not married to the lower court's reasoning but may uphold its decision on any ground made manifest by the record. <i>See </i><i>InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200660\"><a href=\"/opinion/200660/intergen-n-v-v-grina/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 141 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>The sole issue on appeal is the propriety of the Secretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in the HCQIA reporting provision, quoted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> in the margin.<sup>[1]</sup> The Secretary has determined that an investigation is ongoing (and, therefore, a matter is under investigation) until a health care entity makes a final decision or formally closes the probe, even if the entity is no longer gathering facts but is merely deliberating about what course of action it should follow.</p>\n<p>The appellant argues that the Secretary has cast too wide a net. He maintains that the word \"investigation,\" as used in the statute, refers only to the fact-gathering phase of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>In dealing with these dueling interpretations, a threshold question looms: What level of deference, if any, is due to the Secretary's interpretation? We tackle that question first and then proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Deference Question.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>It cannot be gainsaid that the Secretary possesses authority to promulgate regulations implementing the HCQIA. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. § 11136. Withal, the Secretary has not exercised this rulemaking authority to set forth his interpretation of the word \"investigation.\" Instead, the Secretary's interpretation must be gleaned from (i) an agency manual, the NPDB Guidebook (the Guidebook), issued in September of 2001, and (ii) the Secretary's decision in this case. The appellant contends that these \"informal\" interpretations do not warrant deference under the familiar rubric of <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984), but must be evaluated under the more neutral framework limned in <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 140, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span> (1944). The Secretary counters that <i>Chevron</i> offers the appropriate frame of reference. The district court nimbly sidestepped this question, vouchsafing that the Secretary's interpretation of the word was unimpugnable regardless of what level of deference attached.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the Court's opinion in <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 226-27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

L.Rev. 1443, 1457-69 (2005) (reviewing divergent applications of <i>Mead</i> by various courts of appeals). The <i>Mead</i> Court seems to have contemplated the application of <i>Chevron</i> deference to most statutory interpretations that are the fruit of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudications. <i>See </i><i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S. at 229-31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In some ways, however, <i>Mead</i> is unhelpful: for instance, the decision does not clarify the circumstances in which Congress should be deemed to have intended an informal agency interpretation to carry the force of law and, thus, attract <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See </i><i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S. at 231, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2164</span></a></span>. <i>Mead</i> indicates, however, that even if an informal agency interpretation is deemed not to warrant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> <i>Chevron</i> deference, it may nonetheless lay claim to a lesser degree of deference under the <i>Skidmore</i> banner. <i>Id.</i> at 234, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2164</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The case at hand falls into this gray area. The Guidebook is an agency manual. It is not a product of notice-and-comment rulemaking, nor was it ever published in the Federal Register, which makes only a glancing reference to it, <i>see</i> Notice Announcing Opening Date of NPDB, 55 Fed.Reg. 31,239-01 (Aug. 1, 1990). Given these facts, we do not believe that the Guidebook is entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See </i><i>Christensen v.

Congress explicitly empowered the Secretary to establish dispute resolution procedures relative to HCQIA filings. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 11136(2). In response, the Secretary promulgated a regulation that established an adjudicative process  a process that, among other things, provides for secretarial review of written information submitted by both the reporting entity and the reported physician, as well as the issuance of a final administrative determination anent the accuracy of reported information. <i>See</i> 45 C.F.R. § 60.14. The decision in this case was a creature of this adjudicative process. Although secretarial review is not governed by the trial-like procedures characteristic of formal agency adjudications, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 5 U.S.C. §§ 554, 556, 557, several courts have afforded <i>Chevron</i> deference to agency adjudications similar in type and kind to the agency action at issue here, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Am.

In the last analysis, we agree with the district court that the level of deference is not determinative here; whether viewed through the prism of <i>Chevron</i> or the less forgiving prism of <i>Skidmore,</i> the Secretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation\" withstands scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Thus, we bypass the question of whether the Secretary's decision engenders <i>Chevron</i> deference. Instead, we assume, favorably to the appellant and in line with his argument, that the Secretary's interpretation should be evaluated under the <i>Skidmore</i> standard. We proceed on that assumption.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Merits.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The nuances of the <i>Skidmore</i> standard are not cut-and-dried. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cathedral Candle Co. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"212030\"><a href=\"/opinion/212030/cathedral-candle-company-v-us-international-trade-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1352</span></a></span>, 1365-66 (Fed.Cir.2005) (discussing varying formulations). The Supreme Court has characterized <i>Skidmore</i> as requiring courts to defer to agency interpretations of statutes within the agency's ken \"to the extent that those interpretations have the `power to persuade.'\" <i>Christensen,</i> 529 U.S. at 587, 120 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> 1655 (quoting <i>Skidmore,</i> 323 U.S. at 140, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span>). If this is not an unabashed tautology, it must mean something more than that deference is due only when an inquiring court is itself persuaded that the agency got it right. Otherwise, <i>Skidmore</i> deference would not be deference at all.</p>\n<p>What the <i>Skidmore</i> standard entails is a sliding-scale approach under which the degree of deference accorded to an agency interpretation hinges on a variety of factors, such as \"the thoroughness evident in [the agency's] consideration, the validity of its reasoning, [and the] consistency [of its interpretation] with earlier and later pronouncements.\" <i>Skidmore,</i> 323 U.S. at 140, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span>. That compendium is not exhaustive; other factors may weigh in the balance. <i>See</i> Kristin E. Hickman &amp; Matthew D. Krueger, <i>In Search of the Modern Skidmore Standard,</i> 107 Colum. L.Rev. 1235, 1259 (2007) (identifying \"thoroughness, formality, validity, consistency, and agency expertise\" as factors in an agency's power to persuade).</p>\n<p>These factors are meant to test the seriousness of, and therefore the respect due to, the process that underlies the agency's interpretation. The mix of factors, once assayed, either contributes to or detracts from the power of an agency's interpretation to persuade. <i>See </i><i>Skidmore,</i> 323 U.S. at 140, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span>. We turn, then, to how these factors impact the Secretary's interpretation of the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>We start with formality and thoroughness. The record makes manifest that the Secretary's decision was not the product of a strictly formal adjudication. Even so, not all informal agency adjudications stand on the same footing. Here, the adjudication progressed according to a previously established panoply of structured rules that allowed for written submissions by all affected parties. <i>See</i> 45 C.F.R. § 60.14(c). Greater weight ordinarily is due to interpretations that result from a structured interpretive process as opposed to a catch-as-catch-can interpretive process. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>High Sierra Hikers Ass'n v. Blackwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788487\"><a href=\"/opinion/788487/high-sierra-hikers-association-v-blackwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span>, 648 (9th Cir.2004); <i>Structural Indus., Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784970\"><a href=\"/opinion/784970/structural-industries-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1366</span></a></span>, 1370 (Fed.Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p>The Secretary plainly understood the need for in-depth consideration of the disputed issue. He initially set forth his construction of the word \"investigation\" in the Guidebook, a comprehensive manual of general applicability. Normally, greater deference is due to an interpretation that \"is not merely ad hoc ... but is applicable to all cases.\" <i>Chauffeur's Training Sch., Inc. v. Spellings,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796951\"><a href=\"/opinion/796951/chauffeurs-training-school-inc-plaintiff-counter-defendant-appellant-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 129 (2d Cir.2007); <i>accord </i><i>Estate of Landers v. Leavitt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196351\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196351/estate-of-landers-v-leavitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 110 (2d Cir.2008). So it is here.</p>\n<p>The Secretary then reiterated his understanding of the word \"investigation\" in his decision in this case. Several aspects of the decision indicate that it was the product of thorough consideration. First, the decision was issued by the Secretary himselfthe highest-ranking official in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Second, the procedures employed encouraged the operation of the deliberative process.</p>\n<p>In particular, there was a meaningful give-and-take. In a letter to the Hospital dated May 26, 2006, the agency's dispute resolution manager set out the agency's working definition of an \"investigation\" and requested further information. The appellant received a copy of this letter. On June 6, 2006, the appellant responded, controverting the agency's working definition. The issue was, therefore, precisely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> framed and the protagonists had the opportunity to confront each other's views. This sort of open exchange is a badge of thoroughness. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rubie's Costume Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782929\"><a href=\"/opinion/782929/rubies-costume-company-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></a></span>, 1356 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Secretary's decision fully engaged the appellant's proposed interpretation of section 11133(a)(1)(B)(i). The Secretary found that interpretation deficient largely because it failed to square with the policies underlying the HCQIA. In support, the Secretary highlighted relevant portions of both the statutory scheme and its legislative history. This detailed exegesis makes it transparently clear that the Secretary's interpretation was a product of thorough consideration. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>W. Union Tel. Co. v. FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397829\"><a href=\"/opinion/397829/the-western-union-telegraph-company-v-federal-communications-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></a></span>, 1143 (D.C.Cir.1981) (upholding, under <i>Skidmore,</i> an agency interpretation that was based upon thorough analysis of statute and legislative history).</p>\n<p>Moving to other factors, expertise and consistency counsel in favor of honoring the Secretary's interpretation. As to the former, HHS, over which the Secretary presides, has broad oversight of physician performance. Given the huge federal stake in the funding of Medicare, Medicaid, and related programs, the Secretary has had a powerful incentive to develop a body of knowledge about problems affecting physician performance. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Estate of Landers,</i> 545 F.3d at 107 (noting high degree of expert knowledge required to run programs such as Medicare and Medicaid). Indeed, the Secretary is charged with determining whether and when a physician's rights to participate in these complex programs should be suspended where, for example, the physician surrenders his license to practice in a particular state while under investigation for misconduct or incompetence. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(4)(B). Thus, the area in which the disputed interpretation operates is within the heartland of the Secretary's expertise.</p>\n<p>As to consistency, there is no evidence that the Secretary has ever interpreted the word \"investigation,\" as used in the HCQIA, in a manner inconsistent with the interpretation that he advances here. The Secretary initially articulated this interpretation in the Guidebook, which was published in 2001. In adjudicating the appellant's administrative complaint, he faithfully applied that definition. His final decision observed that the challenged interpretation reflected \"long established policy,\" and the appellant has not contested that observation. The consistency of the Secretary's interpretation, over time, furnishes some degree of support for deferring to that interpretation. <i>See </i><i>N. Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110707\"><a href=\"/opinion/110707/north-haven-bd-of-ed-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span>, 522 n. 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110707\"><a href=\"/opinion/110707/north-haven-bd-of-ed-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span> (2002).</p>\n<p>We turn now to the most salient of the factors that inform an assessment of persuasiveness: the validity of the agency's reasoning. This inquiry does not focus on the interpretation per se but, rather, on whether the agency has consulted appropriate sources, employed sensible heuristic tools, and adequately substantiated its ultimate conclusion. <i>See </i><i>De La Mota,</i> 412 F.3d at 80.</p>\n<p>Here, the Secretary made good use of available interpretive resources. In particular, he construed the word \"investigation\" in light of the overall structure and evident purpose of the statutory scheme. Those were potentially fertile grounds for assistance in carrying out the mission of statutory construction. <i>See </i><i>Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145678\"><a href=\"/opinion/145678/dolan-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span>, 486, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145678\"><a href=\"/opinion/145678/dolan-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1252</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145678\"><a href=\"/opinion/145678/dolan-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span> (2006).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> By the same token, the Secretary handled these interpretive resources in a logical and intellectually disciplined manner. He began by remarking a broad congressional purpose: \"to improve the quality of health care by encouraging hospitals to identify and discipline practitioners who engage in unprofessional behavior.\" This went hand in glove with the related goal of \"restrict[ing] the ability of incompetent practitioners from moving State to State without disclosure or discovery of [a] previous adverse action ... history.\" The text of the statute bears out this statement of the overarching congressional purpose. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. § 11101(2). The Secretary's reasoning also is buttressed by the statute's legislative history, which evinces Congress's concern that \"hospitals too often accept `voluntary' resignations of incompetent doctors in return for the hospital's [sic] silence about the reasons for the resignations.\" H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 3 (1986), <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6385; <i>see</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 15 (1986), <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6397 (commenting that hospitals too readily \"resort to `plea bargains' in which a physician agrees to [a surrender of privileges] in return for the health care entity's promise not to inform other health care entities about the circumstances of the physician's surrender of privileges\").</p>\n<p>Reasoning from this overarching congressional purpose, the Secretary concluded that Congress did not intend to construct an easily accessible escape hatch that would permit beleaguered physicians to elude the reach of the HCQIA's reporting requirement. He noted that the HCQIA contemplates reporting both when a hospital takes certain actions implicating a physician, 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(A), and when a physician resigns during the currency of an investigation, <i>id.</i> § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i). A grudging view of the duration of an investigation, such as that proposed by the appellant, would create a gap between the completion of fact-gathering and the taking of a final disciplinary action. During this \"gap period,\" a physician could resign with impunity. That easy escape would operate at cross-purposes with the goal of the reporting requirement.</p>\n<p>Conversely, interpreting the word \"investigation\" more expansively affords seamless coverage of the period from the start of an inquiry until the taking of a final disciplinary action. That prevents the creation of a gap. At the same time, it serves Congress's evident purpose.</p>\n<p>This is sound reasoning. In light of it, the Secretary's ensuing interpretation of the word \"investigation,\" while not inevitable, is eminently sensible.</p>\n<p>In the face of this interpretation, the appellant looses a barrage of counter-arguments aimed at derailing any claim to <i>Skidmore</i> deference. His initial attack centers on plain meaning. His thesis is that the plain meaning of the word \"investigation\" is limited to fact-gathering.</p>\n<p>The appellant's premise is undeniably correct: the plain meaning of words in the text of a statute constitutes the proper starting point for interpreting that statute. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118261\"><a href=\"/opinion/118261/hughes-aircraft-co-v-jacobson/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 438, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118261\"><a href=\"/opinion/118261/hughes-aircraft-co-v-jacobson/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span> (1999); <i>Aguilar v. U.S. Immig. &amp; Customs Enf.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2007). But \"[i]n the last analysis, words are like chameleons; they frequently have different shades of meaning depending upon the circumstances.\" <i>United States v. Romain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201394\"><a href=\"/opinion/201394/united-states-v-romain/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2004). The word \"investigation\" exemplifies this truism.</p>\n<p>That word commonly is used to refer to the process of gathering facts. <i>See, e.g., Random House Dictionary of the English</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> <i>Language</i> 1004 (2d ed.1987). However, it also is commonly used in a broader sense to refer to a \"detailed examination\" or \"searching inquiry.\" <i>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary of the English Language</i> 1189 (1993). Congress itself has used the word in that broader sense, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(4)(D)(ii) (defining \"national security investigation\"), as have the courts, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United Eng'g &amp; Forging v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></span>, 1393 (C.I.T.1991) (concluding that imports were \"subject to investigation\" because they remained \"under consideration\"). Given the range of meanings associated with the word \"investigation,\" we think that the Secretary was obliged in this instance to look beyond raw language and to consider the larger context of the HCQIA. That is exactly what the Secretary did.</p>\n<p>Next, the appellant contends that the Secretary's understanding conflates \"investigation\" with two other terms that appear in the text of the HCQIA, namely, \"professional review activity\" and \"professional review action.\" This contention lacks force.</p>\n<p>We do not doubt that a legislative body usually means different things when it uses varying terminology in a single statute. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ariz. Health Care Cost Containment Sys. v. McClellan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1228642\"><a href=\"/opinion/1228642/arizona-health-care-cost-containment-system-v-mcclellan/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span>, 1250 (9th Cir.2007); <i>Vonage Holdings Corp. v. FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186969\"><a href=\"/opinion/186969/vonage-hold-corp-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1232</span></a></span>, 1240 (D.C.Cir.2007). Contrary to the appellant's importunings, however, the Secretary's understanding of the word \"investigation\" does not make the word synonymous with either a \"professional review activity\" or a \"professional review action.\"</p>\n<p>The HCQIA defines a \"professional review activity\" as an activity designed to \"change or modify\" a physician's clinical privileges. 42 U.S.C. § 11151(10)(C). The appellant suggests that this term encompasses the entire process through which a hospital alters a physician's clinical privileges that is, from the commencement of fact-gathering through the final decision.</p>\n<p>We reject this construction, instead agreeing with the Secretary that the term \"professional review activity\" refers, one by one, to each of the discrete activities that a hospital undertakes during the course of its investigation (<i>e.g.,</i> accepting a complaint, deciding to investigate, appointing an investigating committee, conducting fact-gathering, preparing a report, and so on and so forth, up to the point at which a professional review action is taken). <i>See </i><i>Mathews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720639\"><a href=\"/opinion/720639/robert-s-mathews-md-at-no-95-1391-v-lancaster-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 634 (3d Cir.1996) (upholding district court's determination that \"professional review activities\" are \"preliminary investigative measures taken in `a reasonable effort to obtain the facts' relevant to a possible change in a physician's privileges\"); <i>Singh v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576357\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576357/singh-v-blue-cross-and-blue-shield-of-mass/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 171 (D.Mass.2001) (holding that \"professional review activities\" were \"steps in an investigation that ultimately led to an `action'\"), <i>aff'd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200100\"><a href=\"/opinion/200100/singh-v-blue-cross/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002). We need not itemize the inventory of professional review activities today. For present purposes, it suffices to say that the Secretary's interpretation of the term \"investigation\" is not coterminous with his interpretation of the term \"professional review activity\" because the former encompasses a myriad of the latter.</p>\n<p>So too the term \"professional review action.\" That term denotes an adverse \"action or recommendation ... taken or made in the course of a professional review activity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 11151(9). The Secretary's interpretation holds that an investigation terminates when a final action is taken. That action is a \"professional review action\" within the purview of the statute. Thus, while an investigation may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> culminate in a professional review action, the Secretary's interpretation gives a distinct meaning to each term. Consequently, he has not conflated their meanings.</p>\n<p>In a related vein, the appellant suggests that the Secretary's interpretation of \"investigation\" makes the word synonymous with yet another statutory term: \"formal peer review process.\" 42 U.S.C. § 11151(4)(A). Though the latter term is not defined in the HCQIA, the Secretary's implementing regulations state that the phrase \"formal peer review process\" refers to \"the conduct of professional review activities through formally adopted written procedures which provide for adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard.\" 45 C.F.R. § 60.3. As such, the formal peer review process refers only to a particular type of investigation. The two terms, as used by the Secretary, do not duplicate each other.</p>\n<p>In a further fusillade, the appellant maintains that the Secretary misperceived the core purpose of the HCQIA. He argues, in essence, that the Secretary erred in inferring a general congressional intent to encourage reporting. In support, he notes that the HCQIA does not require reporting of all disciplinary measures imposed upon physicians but, rather, limits itself to professional review actions that adversely affect a physician's clinical privileges for longer than thirty days. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(A). Building on this foundation, he posits that Congress most likely contemplated piecemeal reporting under very specific circumstances.</p>\n<p>This is whistling past the graveyard. We believe that the Secretary supportably discerned a broad congressional purpose to improve the delivery of health care by mandating the reporting of significant disciplinary measures taken against physicians and curtailing the ability of physicians to abort inquiries into potential misconduct. The legislative history, alluded to above, makes this purpose abundantly clear.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, the appellant added a new twist to this contention. He theorized that Congress must have intended piecemeal reporting as a means of allowing private parties maximum flexibility in adjusting the terms of employment relationships. We demur. The legislative history leaves little doubt but that Congress was concerned with putting an end to the sort of private deals that the appellant claims the HCQIA is meant to foster. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 3, 15 (1986), <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6384, 6385, 6397.</p>\n<p>Finally, the appellant claims that the Secretary erroneously failed to consult the Hospital's bylaws. This charge is unfounded.</p>\n<p>A hospital's bylaws may shed light on whether the institution has initiated an investigation within the purview of the statute and, if so, whether that investigation is ongoing. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Simpkins v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2267240\"><a href=\"/opinion/2267240/simpkins-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 115-16 (D.D.C. 1998). The Secretary, in the Guidebook, has recognized that a hospital's bylaws may be useful in such ways. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Guidebook, at E-21.</p>\n<p>That is not to say, however, that the meaning of the word \"investigation,\" as that word is used in the statute, will vary from case to case depending on a particular hospital's bylaws. The federal judiciary and the agency to which the interpretive task has been entrusted have independent responsibilities for fashioning a global definition, and a hospital cannot frustrate that definition through its bylaws. If, say, a hospital's bylaws used the word \"investigation\" to describe a phenomenon that ended upon the completion of fact-gathering, the Secretary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> would not be compelled to interpret Congress's use of the word \"investigation\" in lockstep with that idiosyncratic definition.</p>\n<p>In all events, the bylaw provisions cited by the appellant are not inconsistent with the Secretary's interpretation. They provide in substance that the AHC, once assembled, must submit its written report to the medical staff's executive committee within ten days. It is simply too much of a stretch to say, as the appellant urges, that this means that the investigation is formally concluded at that point. After all, the same bylaws give the executive committee ten additional days to take action on the AHC's report.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>To recapitulate, the Secretary has performed a careful, well-reasoned analysis of the meaning of the word \"investigation\" as that word is used in the HCQIA. He consulted all the conventional sources, relied upon appropriate considerations (such as the overall structure of the HCQIA, the congressional purpose behind it, and the most efficacious means of effectuating that purpose), and reasoned convincingly to a conclusion. That conclusion flows logically from the materials consulted and reflects long-standing policy, consistently applied. Given these factors and given the Secretary's expertise, <i>Skidmore</i> demands that we defer to his persuasive and well-supported view that an \"investigation\" ends only when a health care entity's decisionmaking authority either takes a final action or formally closes the investigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>Skidmore</i> requires courts to walk a fine line, and we have endeavored to do so here. For the reasons elucidated above, we find the Secretary's interpretation deserving of <i>Skidmore</i> deference. Thus, we agree that the Hospital duly reported the appellant's resignation to the NPDB pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B)(i). We need go no further. We hold that the lower court did not err in rejecting the appellant's attempt to reverse the Secretary's action.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In pertinent part, the provision imposes a reporting obligation on any health care entity that\n</p>\n<p>accepts the surrender of clinical privileges of a physician </p>\n<p>(i) while the physician is under an investigation by the entity relating to possible incompetence or improper professional conduct....</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 11133(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>[2]  Notably, the appellant tendered his resignation during this second ten-day period, even though it was not accepted until after that period had expired.</p>\n\n</div>",
