Robert E. Taylor appeals\n\nhis conviction on one count of possession of a firearm by a\n\nconvicted felon, arguing that the district court erred in denying\n\nhis motion to suppress the firearm seized from him during a brief\n\ninvestigatory stop by members of the Providence, Rhode Island,\n\npolice force.     We find no error in the district court's denial of\n\nthe motion to suppress and therefore no grounds to vacate Taylor's\n\nconviction.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n            In the afternoon of March 19, 2005, three Providence\n\npolice officers were conducting a routine patrol in a high-crime\n\narea when they observed a group of people loitering in the rear\n\ncorner of a parking lot.     The officers noticed that one of the men\n\nin the crowd was Miriour Perkins, a suspected drug dealer with a\n\nprior   arrest    record.    Concerned      about   possible    drug-related\n\nactivity,   the   officers   pulled    into   the   parking    lot   with   the\n\nintention of dispersing the crowd.          They parked their unmarked car\n\nbehind a black SUV stopped in front of a building along the right\n\nedge of the lot and exited their vehicle, passing the SUV as they\n\nproceeded towards the crowd at the back of the lot.\n\n            One of the officers, Thomas Zincone, recognized Taylor,\n\nwhom he had encountered previously on five to seven occasions,\n\nsitting in the driver's seat of the black SUV.           According to the\n\ntestimony of Officer Zincone, which the district court credited,\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fTaylor appeared far more nervous than he had been during their\n\nprior encounters and began to make quick movements with the right\n\nside of his body, as if attempting to hide something from Zincone's\n\nview.   Zincone greeted Taylor and approached the driver's side\n\nwindow, at which point Taylor grabbed the steering wheel and leaned\n\nforward, moving so as to conceal his right side.      Taylor responded\n\nnervously to Zincone's greeting and, “his hand . . . shaking,\n\nfrantically pulled his ID from the window” and offered it to\n\nZincone, unasked.      Zincone then saw Taylor's right hand moving\n\naround on top of a beige towel, as though Taylor was endeavoring to\n\nconceal something beneath it.     His suspicions aroused by Taylor's\n\nuncharacteristically    nervous   demeanor   and   furtive   movements,\n\nZincone asked Taylor to exit the vehicle.     When Taylor stepped out\n\nof the vehicle, Zincone discerned the butt of a firearm protruding\n\nfrom underneath the beige towel.    Zincone reached into the vehicle\n\nand pushed back the towel to confirm that there was in fact a\n\nfirearm concealed beneath it. Just as Zincone leaned into the SUV,\n\nTaylor attempted to flee but was tackled by the officers.       At that\n\npoint, Taylor blurted out, \"That ain't my gun!\" and was then placed\n\nunder arrest.\n\n          On February 1, 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Taylor\n\non one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).     Taylor moved to suppress all\n\nevidence seized and statements taken from him during the March 19th\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fencounter with the police, arguing that the investigatory stop was\n\nunconstitutional because the police officers \"did not possess any\n\narticulable    facts    showing     [he]    was   engaged    in   any    criminal\n\nactivity.\"    The district court denied Taylor's motion to suppress,\n\nconsidering    the     high-crime    location,      the     officers'    initial\n\nsuspicions regarding the crowd amassed in the parking lot, the\n\npresence of known drug-dealer Miriour Perkins, Taylor's unusually\n\nnervous   behavior,     and   Taylor's      apparent   attempts     to   conceal\n\nsomething from Officer Zincone's view, and concluding that \"while\n\nnone of the factors . . . alone [was] sufficient to have supported\n\nthis stop and search, all of the factors considered together, when\n\nyou look at the totality of the circumstances, [were] sufficient.\"\n\n           Following a jury trial,1 Taylor was convicted on one\n\ncount of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and sentenced\n\nto fifty-seven months' incarceration.\n\n                              II.    Discussion\n\n           When reviewing a district court's determination whether\n\nto suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds, we review the\n\ndistrict court's fact-findings for clear error and its legal\n\nconclusions de novo.       United States v. Aitoro, 446 F.3d 246, 252\n\n(1st Cir. 2006)(citing United States v. McKoy, 428 F.3d 38, 39 (1st\n\nCir. 2005)).   We are mindful that an appellate court must \"exhibit\n\n\n\n     1\n      There were in fact two jury trials; the first ended with a\nhung jury, the second with Taylor's conviction.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fgreat respect for the presider's opportunity to hear the testimony,\n\nobserve the witnesses' demeanor, and evaluate the facts at first\n\nhand.\"   United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           “An officer may conduct a brief investigatory stop when\n\nhe or she has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal\n\nactivity is afoot.”         McKoy, 428 F.3d at 39 (citing Terry v. Ohio,\n\n392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968); United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 71\n\n(1st Cir. 2004)). \"The officer's initial actions must be justified\n\nat their inception and his subsequent actions must be ‘responsive\n\nto the emerging tableau—the circumstances originally warranting the\n\nstop, informed by what occurred, and what the officer learned, as\n\nthe stop progressed.'\"            United States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 100\n\n(1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1320 (2007)(quoting\n\nUnited States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001)).                              This\n\ncourt    evaluates    each        case     based     on    the    \"totality      of    the\n\ncircumstances   .     .    .    to    ascertain     whether      the   officer    had       a\n\nparticularized,       objectively          reasonable      basis       for   suspecting\n\nwrongdoing    (and,       thus,      for   making    the    initial     stop).\"       Id.\n\n           On appeal, Taylor first argues that the stop began when\n\nthe officers pulled into the parking lot and parked behind his SUV,\n\nmaintaining    that       the     stop     was    therefore      unjustified     at    its\n\ninception because the police had no reasonable grounds to suspect\n\nTaylor of criminal activity at that time. This argument is without\n\nmerit. As a preliminary matter, Taylor did not raise this argument\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fbefore the district court; in fact, it seems clear from the record\n\nbelow that Taylor's theory at the suppression hearing was quite to\n\nthe contrary.2   Absent extraordinary circumstances, \"[i]t is a\n\nbedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the\n\ndistrict court, [he] may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"\n\nUnited States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Even assuming arguendo that this issue is properly before\n\nus, we find Taylor's position unconvincing.    The district court\n\nheld that \"there was no Terry stop or anything resembling a Terry\n\nstop until the officers told Mr. Taylor to exit the vehicle.\"   This\n\nholding presents a mixed question of law and fact; accordingly, we\n\nreview the legal conclusion de novo and the underlying factual\n\nfindings, and any inferences drawn from those findings, for clear\n\nerror.   See United States v. Espinoza, 490 F.3d 41, 48 (1st. Cir.\n\n2007)(\"[O]ur function is not to decide whether we, if sitting as\n\narbiters of the facts, would have drawn the same inferences but,\n\nrather, to determine whether the district court's chosen inferences\n\nare plausible (and, thus, permissible) based on the raw facts as\n\nsupportably found.\").\n\n\n     2\n      At the suppression hearing, Taylor offered two theories\nregarding the commencement of the investigatory stop, neither of\nwhich comports with his theory on appeal. Counsel for Taylor at\nthat hearing stated, \"I think the first point that the Court could\nmake that determination is when the police are parked behind the\nSUV and Officer Zincone and Officer O'Brien are outside . . .\nhanging in the doorway of the SUV,\" but then conceded, \"I think\nthat the stronger argument for when Terry's invoked is when the\npolice open up the [SUV] door.\"\n\n                                -6-\n\f          The district court credited Officer Zincone's testimony\n\nthat the police pulled into the parking lot not because of Taylor,\n\nbut because of the crowd gathering in the far corner, and indeed\n\nwere unaware of Taylor's presence until Zincone exited the police\n\ncruiser and began to walk past the black SUV towards the crowd.3\n\nThis testimony was supported by that of the other officers on\n\npatrol with Zincone, and Taylor offered no plausible evidence to\n\nthe contrary.   Accordingly, we find no clear error in the district\n\ncourt's factual findings.\n\n          As    a   matter   of   law,   approaching   a   parked   car   and\n\nquestioning the occupant does not necessarily rise to the level of\n\na Terry stop, \"unless it was objectively reasonable for that person\n\nto believe that he was compelled to stay and answer the question.\"\n\nUnited States v. Smith, 423 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2005); see also\n\nUnited States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194, 200 (2002) (holding that\n\n\"[l]aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment .\n\n. . by approaching individuals on the street or in other public\n\n\n\n     3\n      There is some question as to whether there was truly a crowd\nof people gathered in the parking lot or whether Miriour Perkins\nwas alone. At the suppression hearing, Perkins admitted that he\nwas standing in the parking lot that day but maintained that he was\nstanding alone.   We agree with the district court that it is a\nquestion of little import; whether the officers' initial target was\nPerkins alone or Perkins amidst a crowd of people, Perkins's\ntestimony casts no aspersions on the officers' version of events\nonce their attention turned to Taylor.         The district court\nultimately accepted the officers' testimony that there was a crowd\ngathered in the lot and we see no clear error in that determination\nthat would compel us to find otherwise.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fplaces and putting questions to them if they are willing to\n\nlisten\"); Espinoza, 490 F.3d at 48 (finding that \"even without\n\nreasonable suspicion, [a police officer] had a right to approach\n\nthe parked vehicle and talk to its occupants if that interview was\n\npurely consensual\"); United States v. Douglas, 467 F.3d 621, 623-34\n\n(7th Cir. 2006) (concluding that no seizure occurred when police\n\nofficers parked in front of defendant's car, approached the car\n\nfrom two sides, and shined their flashlights into the car).\n\n          Here, the record refutes Taylor's claim that \"no one in\n\n[his] position could have reasonably believed he was free to leave\"\n\nfrom the moment the police car parked behind him.    As an initial\n\nmatter, the officers were driving an unmarked Crown Victoria; there\n\nis no evidence that Taylor knew that the car that had parked behind\n\nhim was a police car until the officers approached the SUV in which\n\nhe was sitting and Taylor and Zincone recognized each other.\n\nAdditionally, while Taylor maintains that, on the afternoon in\n\nquestion, the parking lot was \"flooded with cars\" and the police\n\ntherefore blocked his only egress by pulling in behind the black\n\nSUV, other evidence indicates that Taylor was not in fact hemmed in\n\nfrom all sides and could have driven forward and turned left to\n\nexit the parking lot.     See Smith, 423 F.3d at 30 (holding \"mere\n\nphysical limitations on an individual's movement, not created by\n\npolice, are insufficient to turn an encounter with police into a\n\nrestraint of liberty\").\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f          In the alternative, Taylor contends that, even if the\n\ninvestigative stop did not begin until Zincone ordered Taylor to\n\nexit the SUV, the stop and subsequent search of the vehicle that\n\nuncovered the firearm were impermissible.           Taylor argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred by premising a finding of reasonable suspicion\n\nlargely upon his nervous demeanor.            Taylor characterizes his\n\nincreased nervousness as a response to police \"harassment\" and\n\ncontends that the police officers could not properly use such\n\nnervousness as a basis for inferring that he was involved in\n\ncriminal activity.     See McKoy, 428 F.3d at 40-41 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(holding that a person's mere nervousness, after being pulled over\n\nfor committing a traffic violation in a high-crime area, does not\n\nestablish reasonable suspicion for a pat-and-frisk search).\n\n          Assessments of reasonable suspicion are highly fact-\n\nspecific and must be performed on a case-by-case basis.                    See\n\nEspinoza, 490 F.3d at 46.     After a careful review of the record, we\n\nfind this case sufficiently distinguishable from McKoy to support\n\na finding of reasonable suspicion.       Several factors differentiate\n\nthis case: 1) the officers, having pulled into the parking lot to\n\ninvestigate suspected drug activity, were already alert to the\n\npossibility   of   criminal   activity   in   the    lot;   2)   Zincone   had\n\ninteracted with Taylor on prior occasions and testified that Taylor\n\nhad not exhibited comparable nervousness on those occasions; and 3)\n\nunlike the driver in McKoy, Taylor did more than merely reach\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ftowards the center console but rather appeared to be actively\n\nattempting to conceal something from the officers' view.                       See\n\nMcKoy, 428 F.3d at 40-41.             The above factors combined provide\n\nsufficient reasonable suspicion to justify Zincone's decision to\n\norder Taylor to step out of the car.          Once Taylor exited the car,\n\nthe butt of the firearm was in plain view; thus it is fruitless to\n\nargue   (and,   indeed,   on    appeal   Taylor     does   not   appear   to   be\n\nattempting to argue) that Zincone's subsequent retrieval of the\n\nfirearm implicates any additional Fourth Amendment concerns.\n\n                               III.    Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's denial of Taylor's motion to suppress.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f",

Background</h2>\n<p>In the afternoon of March 19, 2005, three Providence police officers were conducting a routine patrol in a high-crime area when they observed a group of people loitering in the rear corner of a parking lot. The officers noticed that one of the men in the crowd was Miriour Perkins, a suspected drug dealer with a prior arrest record. Concerned about possible drug-related activity, the officers pulled into the parking lot with the intention of dispersing the crowd. They parked their unmarked car behind a black SUV stopped in front of a building along the right edge of the lot and exited their vehicle, passing the SUV as they proceeded towards the crowd at the back of the lot.</p>\n<p>One of the officers, Thomas Zincone, recognized Taylor, whom he had encountered previously on five to seven occasions, sitting in the driver's seat of the black SUV. According to the testimony of Officer Zincone, which the district court credited, Taylor appeared far more nervous than he had been during their prior encounters and began to make quick movements with the right side of his body, as if attempting to hide something from Zincone's view. Zincone greeted Taylor and approached the driver's side window, at which point Taylor grabbed the steering wheel and leaned forward, moving so as to conceal his right side. Taylor responded nervously to Zincone's greeting and, \"his hand . . . shaking, frantically pulled his ID from the window\" and offered it to Zincone, unasked. Zincone then saw Taylor's right hand moving around on top of a beige towel, as though Taylor was endeavoring to conceal something beneath it. His suspicions aroused by Taylor's uncharacteristically nervous demeanor and furtive movements, Zincone asked Taylor to exit the vehicle. When Taylor stepped out of the vehicle, Zincone discerned the butt of a firearm protruding from underneath the beige towel. Zincone reached into the vehicle and pushed back the towel to confirm that there was in fact a firearm concealed beneath it. Just as Zincone leaned into the SUV, Taylor attempted to flee but was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> tackled by the officers. At that point, Taylor blurted out, \"That ain't my gun!\" and was then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p>On February 1, 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Taylor on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Taylor moved to suppress all evidence seized and statements taken from him during the March 19th encounter with the police, arguing that the investigatory stop was unconstitutional because the police officers \"did not possess any articulable facts showing [he] was engaged in any criminal activity.\" The district court denied Taylor's motion to suppress, considering the high-crime location, the officers' initial suspicions regarding the crowd amassed in the parking lot, the presence of known drug-dealer Miriour Perkins, Taylor's unusually nervous behavior, and Taylor's apparent attempts to conceal something from Officer Zincone's view, and concluding that \"while none of the factors . . . alone [was] sufficient to have supported this stop and search, all of the factors considered together, when you look at the totality of the circumstances, [were] sufficient.\"</p>\n<p>Following a jury trial,<sup>[1]</sup> Taylor was convicted on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and sentenced to fifty-seven months' incarceration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.

Cir. 2007)(\"[O]ur function is not to decide whether we, if sitting as arbiters of the facts, would have drawn the same inferences but, rather, to determine whether the district court's chosen inferences are plausible (and, thus, permissible) based on the raw facts as supportably found.\").</p>\n<p>The district court credited Officer Zincone's testimony that the police pulled into the parking lot not because of Taylor, but because of the crowd gathering in the far corner, and indeed were unaware of Taylor's presence until Zincone exited the police cruiser and began to walk past the black SUV towards the crowd.<sup>[3]</sup> This testimony was supported by that of the other officers on patrol with Zincone, and Taylor offered no plausible evidence to the contrary. Accordingly, we find no clear error in the district court's factual findings.</p>\n<p>As a matter of law, approaching a parked car and questioning the occupant does not necessarily rise to the level of a <i>Terry</i> stop, \"unless it was objectively reasonable for that person to believe that he was compelled to stay and answer the question.\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 423 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. 194, 200, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002) (holding that \"[l]aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment . . . by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen\"); <i>Espinoza,</i> 490 F.3d at 48 (finding that \"even without reasonable suspicion, [a police officer] had a right to approach the parked vehicle and talk to its occupants if that interview was purely consensual\"); <i>United States v. Douglass,</i> 467 F.3d 621, 623-24 (7th Cir.2006) (concluding that no seizure occurred when police officers parked in front of defendant's car, approached <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> the car from two sides, and shined their flashlights into the car).</p>\n<p>Here, the record refutes Taylor's claim that \"no one in [his] position could have reasonably believed he was free to leave\" from the moment the police car parked behind him. As an initial matter, the officers were driving an unmarked Crown Victoria; there is no evidence that Taylor knew that the car that had parked behind him was a police car until the officers approached the SUV in which he was sitting and Taylor and Zincone recognized each other. Additionally, while Taylor maintains that, on the afternoon in question, the parking lot was \"flooded with cars\" and the police therefore blocked his only egress by pulling in behind the black SUV, other evidence indicates that Taylor was not in fact hemmed in from all sides and could have driven forward and turned left to exit the parking lot. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 30 (holding \"mere physical limitations on an individual's movement, not created by police, are insufficient to turn an encounter with police into a restraint of liberty\").</p>\n<p>In the alternative, Taylor contends that, even if the investigative stop did not begin until Zincone ordered Taylor to exit the SUV, the stop and subsequent search of the vehicle that uncovered the firearm were impermissible. Taylor argues that the district court erred by premising a finding of reasonable suspicion largely upon his nervous demeanor. Taylor characterizes his increased nervousness as a response to police \"harassment\" and contends that the police officers could not properly use such nervousness as a basis for inferring that he was involved in criminal activity. <i>See </i><i>McKoy,</i> 428 F.3d at 40-41 (1st Cir.2005) (holding that a person's mere nervousness, after being pulled over for committing a traffic violation in a high-crime area, does not establish reasonable suspicion for a pat-and-frisk search).</p>\n<p>Assessments of reasonable suspicion are highly fact-specific and must be performed on a case-by-case basis. <i>See </i><i>Espinoza,</i> 490 F.3d at 46. After a careful review of the record, we find this case sufficiently distinguishable from <i>McKoy</i> to support a finding of reasonable suspicion. Several factors differentiate this case: 1) the officers, having pulled into the parking lot to investigate suspected drug activity, were already alert to the possibility of criminal activity in the lot; 2) Zincone had interacted with Taylor on prior occasions and testified that Taylor had not exhibited comparable nervousness on those occasions; and 3) unlike the driver in <i>McKoy,</i> Taylor did more than merely reach towards the center console but rather appeared to be actively attempting to conceal something from the officers' view. <i>See </i><i>McKoy,</i> 428 F.3d at 40-41. The above factors combined provide sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify Zincone's decision to order Taylor to step out of the car. Once Taylor exited the car, the butt of the firearm was in plain view; thus it is fruitless to argue (and, indeed, on appeal Taylor does not appear to be attempting to argue) that Zincone's subsequent retrieval of the firearm implicates any additional Fourth Amendment concerns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

Counsel for Taylor at that hearing stated, \"I think the first point that the Court could make that determination is when the police are parked behind the SUV and Officer Zincone and Officer O'Brien are outside . . . hanging in the doorway of the SUV,\" but then conceded, \"I think that the stronger argument for when <i>Terry</i>'s invoked is when the police open up the [SUV] door.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  There is some question as to whether there was truly a crowd of people gathered in the parking lot or whether Miriour Perkins was alone. At the suppression hearing, Perkins admitted that he was standing in the parking lot that day but maintained that he was standing alone. We agree with the district court that it is a question of little import; whether the officers' initial target was Perkins alone or Perkins amidst a crowd of people, Perkins's testimony casts no aspersions on the officers' version of events once their attention turned to Taylor. The district court ultimately accepted the officers' testimony that there was a crowd gathered in the lot and we see no clear error in that determination that would compel us to find otherwise.</p>\n\n</div>",

Taylor appeals his conviction on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the firearm seized from him during a brief investigatory stop by members of the Providence, Rhode Island, police force. We find no error in the district court's denial of the motion to suppress and therefore no grounds to vacate Taylor's conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>In the afternoon of March 19, 2005, three Providence police officers were conducting a routine patrol in a high-crime area when they observed a group of people loitering in the rear corner of a parking lot. The officers noticed that one of the men in the crowd was Miriour Perkins, a suspected drug dealer with a prior arrest record. Concerned about possible drug-related activity, the officers pulled into the parking lot with the intention of dispersing the crowd. They parked their unmarked car behind a black SUV stopped in front of a building along the right edge of the lot and exited their vehicle, passing the SUV as they proceeded towards the crowd at the back of the lot.</p>\n<p>One of the officers, Thomas Zincone, recognized Taylor, whom he had encountered previously on five to seven occasions, sitting in the driver's seat of the black SUV. According to the testimony of Officer Zincone, which the district court credited, Taylor appeared far more nervous than he had been during their prior encounters and began to make quick movements with the right side of his body, as if attempting to hide something from Zincone's view. Zincone greeted Taylor and approached the driver's side window, at which point Taylor grabbed the steering wheel and leaned forward, moving so as to conceal his right side. Taylor responded nervously to Zincone's greeting and, \"his hand . . . shaking, frantically pulled his ID from the window\" and offered it to Zincone, unasked. Zincone then saw Taylor's right hand moving around on top of a beige towel, as though Taylor was endeavoring to conceal something beneath it. His suspicions aroused by Taylor's uncharacteristically nervous demeanor and furtive movements, Zincone asked Taylor to exit the vehicle. When Taylor stepped out of the vehicle, Zincone discerned the butt of a firearm protruding from underneath the beige towel. Zincone reached into the vehicle and pushed back the towel to confirm that there was in fact a firearm concealed beneath it. Just as Zincone leaned into the SUV, Taylor attempted to flee but was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> tackled by the officers. At that point, Taylor blurted out, \"That ain't my gun!\" and was then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p>On February 1, 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Taylor on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Taylor moved to suppress all evidence seized and statements taken from him during the March 19th encounter with the police, arguing that the investigatory stop was unconstitutional because the police officers \"did not possess any articulable facts showing [he] was engaged in any criminal activity.\" The district court denied Taylor's motion to suppress, considering the high-crime location, the officers' initial suspicions regarding the crowd amassed in the parking lot, the presence of known drug-dealer Miriour Perkins, Taylor's unusually nervous behavior, and Taylor's apparent attempts to conceal something from Officer Zincone's view, and concluding that \"while none of the factors . . . alone [was] sufficient to have supported this stop and search, all of the factors considered together, when you look at the totality of the circumstances, [were] sufficient.\"</p>\n<p>Following a jury trial,<sup>[1]</sup> Taylor was convicted on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and sentenced to fifty-seven months' incarceration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.

This court evaluates each case based on the \"totality of the circumstances . . . to ascertain whether the officer had a particularized, objectively reasonable basis for suspecting wrongdoing (and, thus, for making the initial stop).\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On appeal, Taylor first argues that the stop began when the officers pulled into the parking lot and parked behind his SUV, maintaining that the stop was therefore unjustified at its inception because the police had no reasonable grounds to suspect Taylor of criminal activity at that time. This argument is without merit. As a preliminary matter, Taylor did not raise this argument before the district court; in fact, it seems clear from the record below that Taylor's theory at the suppression <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> hearing was quite to the contrary.<sup>[2]</sup> Absent extraordinary circumstances, \"[i]t is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, [he] may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\" <i>United States v.

The district court held that \"there was no <i>Terry</i> stop or anything resembling a <i>Terry</i> stop until the officers told Mr. Taylor to exit the vehicle.\" This holding presents a mixed question of law and fact; accordingly, we review the legal conclusion de novo and the underlying factual findings, and any inferences drawn from those findings, for clear error. <i>See </i><i>United States v.
