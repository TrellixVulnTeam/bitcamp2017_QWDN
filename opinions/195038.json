Defendant United\n                                         \n\nStates Mineral Products Co. in 1968-69 supplied plaintiff New\n\nHampshire-Vermont Health Service Corp., d/b/a Blue  Cross and\n\nBlue  Shield of New  Hampshire, with a  spray-on fireproofing\n\nproduct known  as CAFCO.   This  was applied  to some  of the\n\nsteel beams and elsewhere in a six story building in Concord,\n\nNew Hampshire, that  plaintiff was erecting for  its offices.\n\nCAFCO  contains asbestos,  and  while  that  does  not  cause\n\natmospheric  pollution  when not  disturbed,  plaintiff found\n\nthat  any   reconstruction  and  even   building  maintenance\n\nactivities would result  in its doing so.   In 1987 plaintiff\n\nconsidered  various  choices with  respect  to the  building:\n\nrenovate, to meet its growing operational requirements; sell,\n\nand move to a more modern building; or do nothing.  Even this\n\nlast raised  future, if  not immediate,  fire code  problems.\n\nBefore deciding, having  spent some $330,000 in  testing, and\n\nin attempting asbestos solutions, plaintiff brought suit.  At\n\nthe time of trial it still had made no final decision.\n\n          After a 13  day trial and 12 hours  of deliberation\n\nthe jury  found for plaintiff in the  amount of $532,000.  On\n\nplaintiff's  motion,  the  court set  the  verdict  aside and\n\nordered a new trial, confined to damages.  The second verdict\n\nwas for $3,924,937, from which the court ordered a remittitur\n\n                             -2-\n\nof $886,872,1  which plaintiff accepted.   Defendant appeals,\n\ncomplaining that  there should  have been  no new  trial, but\n\nthat  if a  new trial  was  proper, it  should have  included\n\nliability.  We affirm.\n\n          With respect  to granting a  new trial  at all  the\n\ncourt  wrote a  thoughtful opinion,  giving  several reasons.\n\nIts main concern was the  inadequacy of the verdict.   One of\n\nits  special  reasons,  a  sua  culpa,  was  too  abbreviated\n                                     \n\ninstructions  on the  measure  of  damages.    Plaintiff  had\n\nsought, and  excepted to its  refusal, a spelling out  of the\n\nconcept  that if defendant  was liable (negligence  or strict\n\nliability),   plaintiff  was  entitled  to  future  costs  of\n\nreplacement  irrespective  of   what  remedial  procedure  it\n\nultimately adopted, or even if  it did nothing.  For this  it\n\nquite properly cited Wentworth Bus Lines, Inc. v. Sanborn, 99\n                                                         \n\nN.H. 5, 104 A.2d 392 (1954).  We agree with the court that in\n\nthis special situation,  where, even at trial,  plaintiff had\n\nmade no final decision, it  was important to remove doubts or\n\nconfusion  from the jurors'  minds that might  tend to reduce\n\nthe damages.\n\n          Second, the court agreed  with plaintiff that there\n\nhad been  error in  respect to  the testimony  of defendant's\n\nexpert Roger Morse.   Plaintiff's expert, one  Halliwell, had\n\n                    \n\n1.  The second jury  had been allowed to include  an item for\nwhich the court later concluded defendant was not chargeable.\n\n                             -3-\n\ngiven  seven figure  estimates of  the  cost of  removal, and\n\ndefendant sought to rebut this with Morse's proposed figure -\n\n- $600,000  - $700,000.   Plaintiff  objected, properly,  for\n\nlack of prior notice.  Freund v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc.,\n                                                            \n\n956  F.2d 354  (1st  Cir. 1992).   However,  over plaintiff's\n\nobjection,  the court said that  Morse could testify that, on\n\nhis  factual assumptions as  to the amount  of CAFCO present,\n\nHalliwell's figures would be \"substantially\" affected.  Morse\n\nimproved on  this:  he  testified that his estimate  would be\n\n\"substantially, substantially affected.\"\n\n          Defendant says, correctly to a point, that since in\n\nMorse's   already  expressed  opinion  there  was  much  less\n\nmaterial  in  the  building than  Halliwell  assumed,  it was\n\nobvious,  and  added  nothing,  for  Morse  to  say that  his\n\nestimate of the removal cost would be less.  Hence, defendant\n\nsays, there  was no  prejudice.  The  difficulty is  that the\n\nwitness's generality was open-ended, particularly so  in what\n\nwe can  only regard  as a theatrical  attempt to  produce the\n\neffect of  the specifics  that the court  had excluded.   The\n\ndifficulty was  compounded by plaintiff's inability to cross-\n\nexamine without burning  its fingers.   The court could  well\n\nfind,  in   light  of  the   verdict,  that  the   jury  took\n\n\"substantially,  substantially  affected\"   as  warranting  a\n\nfigure even smaller than the  excluded specifics.  No one had\n\n                             -4-\n\ngiven a dollar figure  that low.   The court was entitled  to\n\nfeel that the jury had been misled, and plaintiff prejudiced.\n\n          There were some other possible grounds for granting\n\na new trial on damages, but we need go no further.  The court\n\nacted well within its discretion.\n\n          Neither  need we go far with respect to defendant's\n\nsecond  complaint,  the  failure  to  include  the  issue  of\n\nliability (and  all other issues, whatever that means) in the\n\nnew trial.   This was advanced only  as a last minute thought\n\non  a  motion  for reconsideration.    It  was, nevertheless,\n\ncarefully  answered.    Defendant  repeatedly  tells  us that\n\ndamages and liability  were \"inextricably interwoven.\"   Phav\n                                                             \n\nv. Trueblood, Inc., 915 F.2d 764, 766 (1st Cir. 1990).  If it\n                  \n\nhad argued  this in terms  of its being a  compromise verdict\n\ndefendant  might conceivably have had a point.  It did not so\n\ncontend.  We can think  of no other possible intermingling of\n\nliability  and  damages;  nor  has  defendant suggested  any,\n\nexcept to  dwell on  plaintiff's differing  solutions of  its\n\nproblem.     As  none  of  these  solutions  raised  separate\n\nquestions of damage, the court acted appropriately.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -5-\n",
