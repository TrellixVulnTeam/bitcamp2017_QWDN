Klumper, Assistant United States    Attorney,\nwere on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                             June 6, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f              DICLERICO, District Judge.           A jury convicted José R.\n\nAndújar-Basco of conspiring and aiding and abetting the possession\n\nwith intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine.\n\nAndújar seeks a new trial, arguing that the district court erred by\n\nnot declaring a mistrial (1) after a government witness testified\n\nregarding Andújar’s election to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights\n\nto remain silent and to request an attorney, and (2) after the\n\ngovernment made unrelated improper remarks in closing arguments.\n\n                                       I.\n\n              Andújar was ensnared in a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)\n\nsting operation.      In September 2004, the DEA paid a confidential\n\ninformant to make purchases of controlled substances.                      At the\n\nbehest   of    DEA   Agents   Carlos   Galloza      and   Roberto    Bryan,   the\n\nconfidential      informant     contacted      Freddy     Cancel-Camacho,      an\n\nacquaintance he had known for twenty years, to inquire about the\n\npurchase of ten kilograms of cocaine.              Prior to the purchase, the\n\ninformant and Cancel met on multiple occasions and also had several\n\ntelephone      conversations.      The       DEA   recorded   many    of    these\n\nconversations and played them for the jury at trial.\n\n              On September 20, Cancel told the informant that the only\n\nperson he knew who could acquire ten kilograms of cocaine was\n\nAndújar.      The informant was also familiar with Andújar because\n\nCancel had introduced the two a few years earlier.              The next day,\n\nSeptember 21, the informant went to Cancel’s house to discuss the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ftransaction.   While the informant was present with a recording\n\ndevice, Cancel talked to Andújar on the phone.         Andújar confirmed\n\nthat he would sell cocaine to the informant, but he lowered the\n\nquantity from ten kilograms to five kilograms and set the purchase\n\nprice at $85,000.       The three agreed to meet the next day to\n\ncomplete the transaction.\n\n          The September 22 meeting did not go as planned.               When\n\nAndújar and Cancel did not arrive at the arranged meeting location\n\nat the appointed time, the informant left.       While driving home, he\n\nreceived a call from Cancel on his mobile phone.         At one point in\n\nthe conversation, Andújar took the phone from Cancel and told the\n\ninformant that he had the five kilograms and was ready to go\n\nforward with the deal.      It was subsequently agreed that Andújar\n\nwould give the cocaine to Cancel who would then give it to the\n\ninformant and that Cancel would thereafter bring the $85,000 from\n\nthe informant to Andújar.\n\n          On   the   morning   of   September   23,   Cancel   called    the\n\ninformant and told him that Andújar had given him the cocaine.\n\nCancel instructed the informant to come to his house to exchange\n\nthe money for the cocaine. The informant and Agent Galloza, posing\n\nundercover as the drug buyer financing the purchase, drove to\n\nCancel’s house.      The informant went inside Cancel’s house, took\n\npossession of the bag of cocaine, and lead Cancel out to his truck\n\nto retrieve the money.    After the informant put the cocaine in the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fback of the truck, local police and federal agents converged on the\n\nscene and arrested the informant, Cancel, and Agent Galloza.          A\n\nforensic chemist testified that the substance seized that day was\n\ncocaine weighing just over five kilograms.\n\n            Cancel subsequently agreed to call Andújar to arrange for\n\nAndújar’s payment.     Eddie Vidal, a Puerto Rico police officer\n\nassigned to the DEA, recorded and listened to Cancel’s three phone\n\nconversations   with   Andújar.   In    those   conversations,   Andújar\n\ninstructed Cancel to meet him at a shopping center parking lot.\n\nCancel, Galloza, Vidal, and other law enforcement personnel drove\n\nto the shopping center and waited. Andújar arrived driving a white\n\nBMW with two passengers.     After Andújar got out of the car and\n\napproached a fast food truck, Cancel identified him, and he was\n\narrested.    DEA agents also arrested the two other individuals in\n\nthe white BMW, and conducted a search of the car’s interior.      Under\n\nthe driver’s seat the agents found a white plastic bag containing\n\n110 individually wrapped clear plastic bags containing a white\n\npowdery substance.     A forensic chemist testified that the bags\n\ncontained approximately seventy grams of cocaine.\n\n            A grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging\n\nAndújar and Cancel with conspiring to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1) and 846, and aiding and abetting the possession with\n\nintent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, see 21\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.            Cancel pled guilty to both\n\ncharges before trial and was sentenced to seventy-eight months\n\nimprisonment.      A five-day jury trial ensued on the charges against\n\nAndújar    in    which    the   government    elicited    testimony     from   the\n\nconfidential      informant,     Officer     Vidal,    Agent   Bryan,    and   two\n\nforensic chemists.        The government also presented several recorded\n\nconversations, and testimony and documentary evidence concerning\n\nAndújar’s and Cancel’s phone records.                 The jury found Andújar\n\nguilty on both counts and the district court sentenced him to 121\n\nmonths in prison.         Andújar filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Andújar argues that two errors necessitate a new trial.\n\nFirst, he contends that the district court erred by not granting a\n\nmistrial    after    the    government     infringed     his   Fifth    Amendment\n\nprivilege       against    self-incrimination     by     eliciting      testimony\n\nconcerning his election to remain silent and to request an attorney\n\nwhile being questioned by DEA agents.             See U.S. Const. amend. V\n\n(“No person shall . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a\n\nwitness against himself . . .”); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436,\n\n468 n.37 (1966) (holding that a defendant’s exercise of his right\n\nto remain silent may not be used against him at trial).                   Andújar\n\nargues that this testimony resulted from “intentional government\n\nmisconduct which was geared to impressing on the [jury] that [he\n\nhad] refused to talk about the 5 kilo[grams] and wanted a lawyer\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbecause he was guilty.”   Second, he contends that his right to a\n\nfair trial was “further violated when the prosecutor made repeated,\n\nunprovoked[,] improper closing argument[s] to the jury.”    Andújar\n\nargues that the district court should have declared a mistrial\n\nafter the prosecutor impermissibly interjected his personal opinion\n\nand then compounded the error by telling the jurors that it was\n\ntheir “duty” to “uphold the law” and find Andújar guilty.\n\nA.   Improper Testimony\n\n           We begin with Andújar’s contention that the government\n\nelicited improper testimony regarding his election to remain silent\n\nand to request an attorney.    On the third day of the trial, the\n\ngovernment called Agent Bryan who testified about Andújar’s arrest\n\nand booking.    According to Bryan, Andújar was advised of his\n\nMiranda rights and indicated his understanding of those rights.\n\nBecause Andújar did not initially invoke his right to silence,\n\nBryan began questioning him. Bryan testified as follows concerning\n\nthat interrogation:\n\n           Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of\n           the jury what, if anything, the defendant told\n           you?\n\n           A. Basically we explained the seriousness of\n           the charge that he was looking at and advised\n           him that you know, we have evidence regarding\n           that, and trying to seek his cooperation\n           regarding the next level. . . . At that time\n           we tried to explain to Mr. Andújar the\n           seriousness of the charges, and explain to him\n           this was the particular time that was for him,\n           to be beneficial for him to get on board, what\n           we say, to go ahead and see if we could seek\n\n                                -6-\n\f          the person that he received the five kilograms\n          of cocaine from.\n\n          Q. Did he tell you any information pertaining\n          to any of the cocaine that you seized on that\n          day?\n\n          A.    Before we went straight to the five\n          kilograms, what I initially started with was\n          regarding the cocaine found in the vehicle.\n          At that time he admitted to the fact that he\n          said they, they had just purchased that\n          particular cocaine.\n\n          Q. When he said they, who did you take they\n          to be?\n\n          A. Himself and the other individuals in the\n          vehicle.\n\n          Q.   What happened after that?\n\n          A.   In addition, as I tried to ascertain\n          further information as far as who he actually\n          received the cocaine from, he then changed the\n          statement and said that it was his cocaine and\n          no one else had anything to do with it.\n\n          Q.   His cocaine being the five kilograms or\n          the 70 grams?\n\n          A. At the time we were specifically talking\n          about the cocaine in the vehicle.         When\n          attempting to go further or get further\n          details regarding the five kilograms, and also\n          where was the cocaine ascertained from, at\n          that time he didn’t want to speak any further,\n          he advised he wanted his lawyer and invoked\n          his Miranda warnings and we stopped.\n\n          Q.   Did you question him any further after\n          that?\n\n          A.   No, sir.\n\nDay Three Tr. at 100-03 (emphasis added).   Andújar did not object\n\nat any point during this line of questioning.\n\n                                -7-\n\f          On the fourth day of the trial, the government recalled\n\nAgent Bryan to testify about a phone call DEA agents had made using\n\nAndújar’s mobile phone the evening after he was arrested.      The\n\nfollowing colloquy took place:\n\n          Q.   Did Richard Andújar have his cellphone\n          with him at the time?\n\n          A.    No, sir, we had it with us, sir.\n\n          Q. Did you have occasion to use his cellphone\n          any time later in the night of September 23,\n          2004?\n\n          A.    Yes, I did.\n\n          Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of\n          the jury how you used his cellphone and for\n          what purpose?\n\n          A. Yes, sir, after Mr. Andújar was arrested\n          we were attempting to have Mr. Andújar\n          basically what we call get on board, and in\n          order to also keep the other cooperators cool\n          at that particular time–\n\nDay Four Tr. at 5 (emphasis added).        At that point, Andújar\n\nobjected to the testimony concerning “the other cooperators.”\n\nAndújar requested a mistrial, arguing that the government violated\n\nan earlier court order that government witnesses should refrain\n\nfrom suggesting that co-defendant Cancel had cooperated with law\n\nenforcement.1   The court offered to instruct the jury that Cancel\n\n\n     1\n      Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the court had ruled that\nany testimony referring to co-defendant Cancel’s “cooperation” with\nlaw enforcement was overly prejudicial and misleading because\nCancel ultimately chose not to cooperate and not to testify at\nAndújar’s trial.    The government was ordered to instruct its\nwitnesses not to characterize Cancel as a “cooperator.”\n\n                                 -8-\n\fdid not cooperate.     Andújar then argued that Bryan’s testimony\n\nconcerning the DEA’s attempt to get Andújar “on board” “seems like\n\n. . . he is making a comment on Mr. Andújar’s choice to remain\n\nsilent.”     The court did not “read that into this testimony” and\n\ndenied Andújar’s request for a mistrial.        The court nonetheless\n\nstruck the testimony from the record.\n\n           At the start of the fifth and final day of trial, Andújar\n\nagain moved, both orally and in a written submission, for a\n\nmistrial based on Bryan’s testimony that the DEA had attempted to\n\nget Andújar “on board.”       Andújar noted that, although he had\n\nobjected only once, Bryan had twice testified about the attempt to\n\nget Andújar “on board.”     Andújar did not refer or object to the\n\ntestimony describing Andújar’s termination of the interrogation.\n\nThe court denied the motion for a mistrial but offered to deliver\n\na curative instruction to the jury. Andújar objected to a specific\n\ninstruction, which he feared would draw attention to the stricken\n\ntestimony.    Therefore, with the assent of both parties, the court\n\nsimply delivered an instruction emphasizing that the jury could not\n\nconsider any testimony that had been stricken from the record.\n\n           Andújar   now   challenges   three   portions   of   Bryan’s\n\ntestimony:     (1) the day three testimony about attempting to get\n\nAndújar “on board,” (2) the day three testimony regarding Andújar’s\n\nexplicit invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, and (3) the day\n\nfour testimony again mentioning the attempt to get Andújar “on\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fboard.”   We begin our analysis with consideration of the day three\n\ntestimony specifically mentioning Andújar’s Miranda assertion.\n\n           Because Andújar did not raise a contemporaneous objection\n\nto this testimony, our review is for plain error only.          See United\n\nStates v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 70 & n.13 (1st Cir. 1995).                 For\n\nAndújar to prevail under this standard, he must demonstrate that\n\nthere was an error, that was clear or obvious, and that affected\n\nhis substantial rights. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-\n\n34 (1993) (citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b)).                 If these three\n\nconditions are satisfied, the court may reverse to prevent a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.     Id. at 734-35.\n\n           The Fifth Amendment forbids the use of a defendant’s\n\ncustodial silence as substantive evidence of his guilt.          Miranda,\n\n384 U.S. at 468 n.37.      In Doyle v. Ohio, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat, under the Fourteenth Amendment, where a defendant exercises\n\nhis right to remain silent after being informed of his Miranda\n\nrights, the government may not use that silence to impeach an\n\nexplanation offered by the defendant at trial.        See 426 U.S. 610,\n\n618-19 (1976).    In so holding, the Court recognized that allowing\n\nthe government to use a defendant’s silence against him at trial,\n\nafter having implicitly encouraged that silence through delivery of\n\nthe   Miranda   warning,   would    be    “fundamentally    unfair   and    a\n\ndeprivation of due process.”       Id. at 618.   This court has further\n\nheld that a defendant’s actual statement asserting his Miranda\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\frights,   even     when     uttered    before    a    Miranda      warning   has    been\n\ndelivered,    is      not   admissible    as    substantive         evidence   of    the\n\ndefendant’s guilt. See Coppola v. Powell, 878 F.2d 1562, 1567 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (“[T]he disclosure of the words [the defendant] used to\n\nclaim his privilege results in the same dilemma addressed” in the\n\nSupreme Court cases dealing with prosecutorial reference to a\n\ndefendant’s silence).\n\n           The     question     that    arises       here    is    whether   the    rule\n\nannounced in Miranda -- that the government may not use the\n\ndefendant’s      post-arrest       silence      in   its     case-in-chief     --    is\n\napplicable here, where the defendant initially waived his Fifth\n\nAmendment privilege only to assert his right to silence at some\n\nlater point in the midst of questioning.                    As a general rule, any\n\ninculpatory      or    exculpatory       statements         made    by   a   defendant\n\n(including    silence       with   regard      to    particular      questions)     are\n\nadmissible at trial insofar as they were the product of a knowing\n\nand voluntary waiver.2         See Miranda, 384 U.S. at 475; United States\n\nv. Goldman, 563 F.2d 501, 503 (1st Cir. 1977) (“A defendant cannot\n\nhave it both ways.          If he talks, what he says or omits is to be\n\njudged on its merits or demerits, and not on some artificial\n\nstandard that only the part that helps him can be later referred\n\nto.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).                     But waiver, in this\n\n\n\n     2\n      Andújar does not argue that his waiver was not made knowingly\nand voluntarily.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fcontext, is not an all-or-nothing proposition.           As the Supreme\n\nCourt   noted    in   Miranda,   “where   in-custody   interrogation   is\n\ninvolved, there is no room for the contention that the privilege is\n\nwaived if the individual answers some questions or gives some\n\ninformation on his own prior to invoking his right to remain silent\n\nwhen interrogated.”      384 U.S. at 475-76.    The Court was explicit\n\nthat a detained suspect may change his mind about talking to the\n\npolice “at any time prior to or during questioning,” and that the\n\n“right to cut off questioning,” is essential to the privilege. Id.\n\nat 473-74.\n\n           The government cites a line of Eighth Circuit cases that\n\nhold that testimony regarding a defendant’s refusal to speak to the\n\npolice, following an initial Miranda waiver, is admissible against\n\nthe defendant.    See United States v. Burns, 276 F.3d 439, 442 (8th\n\nCir. 2002) (“[W]here the accused initially waives his or her right\n\nto remain silent and agrees to questioning, but ‘subsequently\n\nrefuses to answer further questions, the prosecution may note the\n\nrefusal because it now constitutes part of an otherwise admissible\n\nconversation between the police and the accused.’”) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Harris, 956 F.2d 177, 181 (8th Cir. 1992), and citing\n\nUnited States v. Collins, 652 F.2d 735, 739 (8th Cir. 1981)).          See\n\nalso Rowan v. Owens, 752 F.2d 1186, 1190 (7th Cir. 1984) (Posner,\n\nJ.) (finding that, on the facts of that case, the government’s\n\ntestimony concerning the end of the interrogation was permissible).\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f           Andújar argues that his case is distinguishable from the\n\nabove cases because the challenged testimony here refers directly\n\nto his express assertion of his constitutional rights.                In the\n\nabove cases, Andújar argues, the challenged testimony mentioned\n\nonly the defendant’s refusal to answer further questions.                  See\n\nBurns, 276 F.3d at 441 (federal agent testified that the defendant,\n\nin response to one particular question, “did not respond and ‘just\n\nlooked’   at   those   questioning    him”);   Harris,   956   F.2d   at   181\n\n(prosecutor’s summation mentioned the defendant’s confession and\n\nthat the defendant thereafter “conclude[d] the interview”); Rowan,\n\n752 F.2d at 1190 (two police officers testified that after the\n\ndefendant answered some questions he “said he didn’t want to say\n\nanything else”); Collins, 652 F.2d at 740 (officers testified that\n\nafter making an incriminating statement, the defendant “refused to\n\nmake any other statement”).     In contrast, Andújar argues, Bryan’s\n\ntestimony explicitly noted that Andújar had asked for a lawyer and\n\nhad “invoked his Miranda warnings.”\n\n           Andújar raises a meaningful distinction.            It has long\n\nbeen established that a witness who has been compelled to testify\n\nmay avoid a question on Fifth Amendment grounds only if the answer\n\nwould pose “some authentic danger of incrimination.” United States\n\nv. Castro, 129 F.3d 226, 229 (1st Cir. 1997).             In light of the\n\nself-evident purpose of the privilege against self-incrimination,\n\na government witness’s testimony that an accused explicitly invoked\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fthe privilege raises a nearly irresistible inference that the\n\naccused was hiding something incriminating.             Put another way,\n\nalthough silence may be interpreted in many ways, see Doyle, 426\n\nU.S. at 617 (“every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous”),\n\nthe   affirmative   assertion    of     the   privilege      against   self-\n\nincrimination    raises   a     clear      inference    of     culpability.\n\nAccordingly, since such testimony more directly implies that the\n\ndefendant was hiding something, it is necessarily more prejudicial\n\nthan testimony that simply notes that the defendant at some point\n\nstopped answering questions.      Indeed, the distinction between an\n\naffirmative statement and simple silence was one important factor\n\nin Coppola.     See 878 F.2d at 1566 (distinguishing from Supreme\n\nCourt precedent upholding the use of pre-arrest silence to impeach\n\na defendant’s credibility because, “[i]n the case at bar, we are\n\nconcerned with the use of a statement made by a suspect and used by\n\nthe prosecutor in his case in chief, not the use of silence to\n\nimpeach the defendant’s credibility”).\n\n          More   importantly,    although     Miranda   acknowledges    the\n\npossibility of a knowing and voluntary waiver, neither Miranda, nor\n\nany subsequent Supreme Court decision, draws a distinction between\n\nan immediate post-arrest Fifth Amendment assertion and a delayed\n\nmid-interrogation   assertion.        In   either   event,   the   assertion\n\ntriggers the privilege, the police must cease interrogation, and\n\nthe government may not use the assertion against the defendant at\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\ftrial.    See Doyle, 426 U.S. at 619; Miranda, 384 U.S. at 468 n.37\n\n(“In    accord     with   our   decision    today,    it   is     impermissible     to\n\npenalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege\n\nwhen he is under police custodial interrogation.                   The prosecution\n\nmay not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or\n\nclaimed his privilege in the face of accusation.”).                     At least with\n\nrespect to clear affirmative assertions, we do not see how an\n\ninitial Miranda waiver can operate to make a subsequent Miranda\n\nassertion admissible against the defendant, nor do we perceive a\n\nsound    rationale        for   cutting    back    the     scope     of     Miranda’s\n\nprotections.        See Coppola, 878 F.2d at 1566 (noting that the\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination is given liberal application\n\nand    cautioning     against     “whittl[ing]       it    down    by     the   subtle\n\nencroachments of judicial opinion”) (quoting Maffie v. United\n\nStates, 209 F.2d 225, 227 (1st Cir. 1954)); see also Castro, 129\n\nF.3d    at   229    (recognizing     that    the     privilege      against      self-\n\nincrimination is “a cornerstone of our adversarial system of\n\ncriminal justice” that “must not be given a crabbed construction”).\n\n             Whatever the merit of the reasoning of the Eighth Circuit\n\ncases, there are limits to how far the government may go in\n\ndescribing the scope of an interrogation.                 See Rowan, 752 F.2d at\n\n1190 (recognizing that the police can “indicate . . . the end as\n\nwell as the beginning of the interrogation, so that the jury [will]\n\nknow that the officers’ testimony [is] complete,” “provided [that]\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fthey [do] not do so with undue emphasis”).             Government witnesses\n\nwho testify concerning the circumstances of an interrogation that\n\nwas terminated by the defendant must proceed with caution.           In the\n\ncircumstances of this case, we hold that the Fifth Amendment bars\n\ntestimony   concerning      a   defendant’s   explicit    mid-interrogation\n\nassertion of his Miranda rights, and that it was error to permit\n\nsuch testimony to go to the jury.\n\n            The government argues, nevertheless, that in light of the\n\nEighth Circuit cases, and a case from this circuit that favorably\n\ncites one of those cases, see United States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282\n\nF.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Harris, 956 F.2d at 181), the\n\ndistrict court’s error was not plain.         As noted above, because the\n\nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination “must be given\n\nliberal construction,” Coppola, 878 F.2d at 1565, any exceptions\n\nthat undermine its protections should be applied narrowly.\n\n            It is important to emphasize that the Eighth Circuit\n\ncases did not confront the precise scenario presented here.              See\n\nsupra at 13-14.       Neither did Lopez-Lopez.     In that case, two co-\n\ndefendants were questioned together and in response to a specific\n\nquestion, one co-defendant told the other “don’t answer.”            Lopez-\n\nLopez,   282   F.3d    at   11.      The    district   court   allowed   the\n\ninterrogating officer to testify regarding that statement at the\n\ndefendants’ joint trial.          We upheld their convictions, holding\n\nthat, after an accused knowingly and voluntarily waives his Miranda\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\frights by making statements, “he may not rely on Doyle to object to\n\nthe admission of those statements simply because the statements\n\nrefer to the act of keeping silent.”   Id. at 12.   As in the Eighth\n\nCircuit cases, the testimony challenged in Lopez-Lopez did not\n\ndescribe the defendant expressly electing to exercise his   Miranda\n\nrights.     Moreover, Lopez-Lopez is further distinguishable by the\n\nfact that it did not involve an accused asserting his own Miranda\n\nrights, but rather involved an accused urging his companion to\n\nassert his rights.\n\n            In sum, Miranda draws no distinction between a mid-\n\ninterrogation assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination\n\nand an immediate post-arrest assertion, see Miranda, 384 U.S. at\n\n468 n.37 & 475-76, and our holding in Coppola makes it clear that\n\nthe words the defendant uses to assert the privilege are themselves\n\nprotected by it, see Coppola, 878 F.2d at 1567-68.    We reject the\n\ncontention that any subsequent cases, of this circuit or of any\n\nother circuit, can be read to have carved out an exception to this\n\nprotection where the express assertion of the privilege comes after\n\na previous waiver.      Such an exception would run contrary to\n\nMiranda’s plain language.    Accordingly, we find that it was plain\n\nerror to allow testimony concerning Andújar’s express assertion of\n\nhis Miranda rights.\n\n            Such a finding, however does not end the plain error\n\nanalysis.     Andújar must establish that the error affected his\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f“substantial rights by altering the outcome of the trial.”                 United\n\nStates v. Shoup, 476 F.3d 38, 42 (1st Cir. 2007).               Put another way,\n\nhe must establish that the error prejudiced him.                        Given the\n\noverwhelming strength of the government’s case, we conclude that it\n\ndid not.\n\n            Although the government’s case largely hinged on the\n\ntestimony     of     a    confidential    informant,      his    testimony    was\n\ncorroborated by several sources, including the testimony of Officer\n\nVidal and Agent Bryan, and the recorded conversations between the\n\ninformant and Cancel.             Bryan’s and Vidal’s testimony, and the\n\nsubstance of the recorded conversations, track the informant’s\n\ntestimony.    Moreover, Vidal personally identified Andújar as being\n\non the other end of the calls Cancel made to set up the time and\n\nthe place for the seller to receive payment for the five kilograms\n\nof cocaine.        The phone records for Cancel’s and Andújar’s mobile\n\nphones -- which show a number of calls between Cancel and Andújar\n\nduring the time period of the conspiracy -- further support the\n\ninformant’s story.\n\n            The     defendant’s     own   actions   and   statements      provide\n\nfurther corroboration.            Andújar’s very arrival at the appointed\n\ntime and place designated for the transfer of the $85,000 is strong\n\ncircumstantial evidence of his involvement in the conspiracy,\n\nespecially    when       viewed   in   context   with   the     other   evidence.\n\nMoreover, Andújar’s post-arrest confession that he was the owner of\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fthe seventy grams of cocaine found in the white BMW provides\n\nadditional       circumstantial          evidence       linking       Andújar       to    the\n\nconspiracy.       Both the quantity and the packaging of the seventy\n\ngrams of cocaine, in 110 individual plastic bags, were consistent\n\nwith distribution. See United States v. Puckett, 405 F.3d 589, 601\n\n(7th Cir. 2005) (noting that “63 grams [of cocaine], is in excess\n\nof what one would possess for personal use, and is in and of itself\n\nsufficient evidence to compel an inference that [the defendant]\n\nintended to distribute the drug”).                     Andújar’s possession of the\n\nseventy grams -- although not directly probative of his ownership\n\nof the five kilograms -- lends credibility to the informant’s\n\ndepiction of Andújar as a drug dealer and undermines the defense\n\ntestimony    aimed       at    establishing       an    innocent      explanation         for\n\nAndújar’s presence at the shopping center parking lot.\n\n            Andújar argues that the credibility of the government’s\n\nidentification is in doubt because the officers who arrested\n\nAndújar inquired whether other people at the scene were “Richard.”\n\nBut the fact that the arresting officers may not have known what\n\nAndújar    looked       like    hardly    undermines       the    government’s           case.\n\nAdmittedly,       the     DEA     relied    on      Cancel       to    make     a    visual\n\nidentification of the seller, and he did just that.                        Andújar also\n\nargues    that   “the     short    duration       of    calls    between      Cancel      and\n\n[Andújar], the lack of certainty as to what was spoken between them\n\nduring those calls, [and] that there was evidence Cancel had direct\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\fcommunication with the owners of the narcotics whom he did not\n\nidentify      to     the    authorities       at     the    time   of   arrest”     further\n\nundermines the government’s case.                       Again, however, it is not\n\nreadily apparent how any of these factors weaken the government’s\n\ncase.     It is hardly surprising that a drug dealer would want to\n\nminimize the length of his phone conversations concerning an\n\nillicit transaction.           Nor is the government charged with providing\n\nthe     precise      contents       of      every     conversation      involved     in     a\n\nconspiracy.           In     any    event,     the     detailed     testimony       of    the\n\nconfidential informant, and the testimony of Officer Vidal, who\n\nlistened in on three of Cancel’s calls with Andújar, could hardly\n\nbe characterized as “uncertain.” Finally, that Cancel may have had\n\ncontact       with    Andújar’s          source      does    not   disprove     Andújar’s\n\nparticipation, especially in light of the testimony that the source\n\ntrusted only Andújar and would not work directly with anyone else.\n\n              We therefore find that Andújar has failed to establish\n\nthat    the    error        “had    [a]     prejudicial       impact    on    the    jury’s\n\ndeliberations.”            Olano, 507 U.S. at 734 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).      For the same reason, Andújar’s unpreserved challenge to\n\nthe day three “on board” testimony also fails.\n\n              Andújar did, however, object to the day four testimony.\n\nAlthough not perceiving a problem, the district court sustained\n\nAndújar’s      objection,          struck    the     offending     testimony      from    the\n\nrecord, and instructed the jury as requested by Andújar. Thus, the\n\n\n                                              -20-\n\fonly question presented on appeal is whether the granting of\n\ngreater relief (i.e., the declaration of a mistrial) was warranted.\n\nAlthough we ordinarily review de novo the question of whether “a\n\nstatement in the presence of the jury infringed upon the privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination,” we review the “denial of a motion for\n\nmistrial for abuse of discretion.”     Gabriele, 63 F.3d at 70.\n\n          The connection between Bryan’s testimony about the DEA’s\n\npost-arrest “attempt[] to have Mr. Andújar . . . get on board” and\n\nAndújar’s election to remain silent is tenuous at best.            The\n\nquestion posed by the government -- asking Bryan how and for what\n\npurpose he had used Andújar’s cell phone -- did not call for such\n\ntestimony.    On its face, the testimony itself does not explicitly\n\nsuggest that Andújar refused to talk to police, nor does it state\n\nwhether the DEA’s “attempt” was ultimately successful.    See Lopez-\n\nLopez, 282 F.3d at 12 (finding no Doyle violation where there     “was\n\nno testimony as to whether [the co-defendant] responded to [the\n\ndefendant’s] suggestion by remaining silent and there was no\n\ntestimony about either party remaining silent in the face of\n\nquestioning”).   Nor did the government make “a point of asking the\n\njury to draw a negative inference from” the attempt to get Andújar\n\n“on board.”    United States v. Daoud, 741 F.2d 478, 482 (1st Cir.\n\n1984).\n\n          Even assuming the jury made the connection Andújar fears,\n\nviewing the totality of the circumstances, we do not perceive a\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fviolation of constitutional magnitude. In a recent habeas case, we\n\nrecognized   that       in   cases   involving     testimony     concerning    a\n\ndefendant’s post-Miranda silence, where the trial court promptly\n\naddresses the improper testimony “in an instruction to disregard\n\nand/or strike from the record, there may not necessarily be a Doyle\n\nviolation because the government has not been permitted to ‘use’\n\nthe defendant’s silence against him.”        Ellen v. Brady, 475 F.3d 5,\n\n11 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing Greer v. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 764-65\n\n(1987)). In Ellen, a government witness, responding to a seemingly\n\ninnocuous question from the prosecutor, testified concerning the\n\ndefendant’s election not to speak to the police.               Id. at 7.      The\n\ndefendant immediately objected and the trial court sustained the\n\nobjection,   struck      the    testimony,   and     delivered     a   curative\n\ninstruction. Id. at 8. In light of the surrounding circumstances,\n\nwe ruled that there was no constitutional violation.               See id. at\n\n12-14.   Important to our consideration were the facts that the\n\ndefendant’s “post-Miranda silence was not mentioned, by either the\n\nprosecutor   or     a    witness,    after   the     judge     sustained      the\n\nobjection[,]” the government’s questions “did not, on their face,\n\ncall for testimony in violation of Doyle,” and the court promptly\n\ndelivered curative instructions that “were proportional to the”\n\noffensive testimony.         Id. at 14.\n\n          The same factors are present here.            The district court\n\nsustained Andújar’s objection and struck the offending testimony\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\ffrom    the   record.        Following    Andújar’s    objection,    no   further\n\nquestions or testimony alluded to his silence and the government\n\nmade no comment on his silence in closing arguments. Additionally,\n\nthe jury was instructed, both at the beginning of the trial and\n\nafter   the    close    of   evidence,    that    it   must   not   consider   any\n\ntestimony stricken from the record.              Following closing arguments,\n\nthe court, at Andújar’s request, again emphasized this point,\n\nreminding the jury “that any testimony that you may have seen or\n\nheard and that I have excluded from evidence, and instructed you to\n\ndisregard, is not evidence.”             The court also instructed the jury\n\nthat Andújar has a “constitutional right not to testify and no\n\ninference of guilt or of anything else, may be drawn from the fact\n\nthat he did not testify.         For any of you to draw such an inference\n\nwould be wrong, indeed it would be a violation of your oath as a\n\njuror.” Andújar presents no sound reason to discard “the customary\n\npresumption that juries follow their instructions.”                 Gabriele, 63\n\nF.3d at 70; see also Ellen, 475 F.3d at 13.\n\n              Andújar argues that we should view the challenged day\n\nfour testimony in context with the previous improper testimony.\n\nAndújar argues that the government purposefully elicited Bryan’s\n\nimproper testimony and the district court should have considered\n\nthe cumulative effect of all the improper testimony.                   First, as\n\nnoted above, we disagree that the government purposefully sought to\n\nelicit testimony about Andújar exercising his Fifth Amendment\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fprivilege.          Additionally, it bears emphasizing that this court\n\nreviews alleged errors of the district court, not errors of the\n\nprosecution, and the district court is not charged with advocating\n\nfor the defense or anticipating issues not brought to the fore by\n\ncounsel.       Cf. United States v. McIntosh, 380 F.3d 548, 555 (1st\n\nCir.       2004).     Andújar    never   referred   the   court   to   the   most\n\nobjectionable testimony directly relating to his Miranda assertion.\n\nHe only objected to the ambiguous and considerably less striking\n\n“on board” testimony.            In such circumstances, the court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying Andújar’s motion for a mistrial.3\n\nB.   Improper Closing Arguments\n\n               Andújar challenges three comments made by the government\n\nin closing arguments.           First, at the end of his initial summation,\n\nthe prosecutor stated, “I feel comfortable and the United States\n\nfeels comfortable that they have proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat this man delivered five kilograms of cocaine between the 20\n\nand 23 of September.”             Day Five Tr. at 39.       In rebuttal, the\n\n\n       3\n      We recognize that, unlike in Ellen, some testimony concerning\nAndújar’s silence was ultimately submitted to the jury. But this\nstate of affairs came about only because of defense counsel’s\ninattention.   Once apprised of the problem, the district court\nacted promptly and reasonably to correct it. We further add that,\neven under the stricter form of harmless error review applicable to\nconstitutional errors, the government has established beyond any\nreasonable doubt that the verdict was not influenced by the\nreferences to Andújar’s Miranda election. United States v. Coker,\n433 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2005).        Based on the overwhelming\nevidence establishing Andújar’s guilt, we are confident that the\nverdict would have been the same even in the absence of the\nimproper testimony. Id.; see supra at 18-20.\n\n                                         -24-\n\fprosecutor argued, inter alia, that Andújar and Cancel “conspired\n\nto distribute five kilograms of cocaine, it does not matter where\n\nit came from.     He gave it to Freddy Cancel.     That is what matters.\n\nI have proven it, absolutely.      We have met our burden.”       Id. at 59.\n\nFinally, in his last words to the jury, the prosecutor urged,\n\n“[y]ou find him guilty, you uphold the law, your duty as jurors,\n\nmake the logical choice and come back with one answer, and telling\n\nthis man, Richard Andújar you are guilty.        Thank you.”      Id. at 67.\n\n           Andújar argues that the first two remarks were improper\n\nbecause   they   amounted   to   “affirmations    of    [the   prosecutor’s]\n\npersonal belief” that Andújar is guilty.           See United States v.\n\nGonzalez Vargas, 558 F.2d 631, 632-33 (1st Cir. 1977) (vacating a\n\nconviction where the prosecutor stated his personal belief in\n\nsummation).      Further    inflaming   the   jurors’   passions,    Andújar\n\nargues, was the prosecutor’s final exhortation to the jurors to do\n\n“your duty.”     See United States v. Mandelbaum, 803 F.2d 42, 44 (1st\n\nCir. 1986) (finding improper the suggestion that a jury has “a duty\n\nto decide one way or the other” because such an appeal “can only\n\ndistract a jury from its actual duty: impartiality”).               Andújar\n\ncontends that the severity of these comments warrants a new trial.\n\nThe government concedes that the comments were improper, but argues\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fthat a new trial is unnecessary because it is not reasonably likely\n\nthese isolated remarks affected the outcome of the trial.4\n\n          Since Andújar did not object to the prosecutor’s remarks\n\nat trial, we may only review for plain error.    See United States v.\n\nHenderson, 320 F.3d 92, 105 (1st Cir. 2003).           The government\n\nexplicitly concedes error and implicitly concedes that the error\n\nwas plain. Nevertheless, as we have already noted above, see supra\n\n18-20, 24 n.3, the record, viewed in the aggregate, presents\n\noverwhelming   evidence   establishing   Andújar’s   guilt.   In   such\n\ncircumstances, we are compelled to conclude that the prosecutor’s\n\nimproper remarks did not “so poison[] the well that the trial’s\n\noutcome was likely affected.” Henderson, 320 F.3d at 107 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).5\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The government also argues that Andújar’s counsel interjected\nher  own    personal  opinion   in   her   summation  and   thereby\n“neutraliz[ed] the harm flowing from the prosecutor’s remarks.”\nUnited States v. Gallagher, 735 F.2d 641, 644 (1st Cir. 1984). We\ndecline to invoke the “invited response” rule here where the\ngovernment launched the “opening salvo.” United States v. Young,\n470 U.S. 1, 12-13 (1985).\n     5\n      Although the lack of prejudice saves the government from a\nlost conviction, we are troubled that such improper arguments\npersist despite our repeated admonitions against them. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Martínez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 120 (1st Cir.\n2002); United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 136 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.\n1998) (collecting cases). The United States Attorney’s office in\nPuerto Rico must redouble its efforts to educate its attorneys\nabout the ground rules for closing arguments.\n\n                                 -26-\n\f                              III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s convictions\n\nare affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -27-\n\f",

And&#250;jar-Basco of conspiring and aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine. And&#250;jar seeks a new trial, arguing that the district court erred by not declaring a mistrial (1) after a government witness testified regarding And&#250;jar's election to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent and to request an attorney, and (2) after the government made unrelated improper remarks in closing arguments.</p>\n      <p>I.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar was ensnared in a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) sting operation. In September 2004, the DEA paid a confidential informant to make purchases of controlled substances. At the behest of DEA Agents Carlos Galloza and Roberto Bryan, the confidential informant contacted Freddy Cancel-Camacho, an acquaintance he had known for twenty years, to inquire about the purchase of ten kilograms of cocaine. Prior to the purchase, the informant and Cancel met on multiple occasions and also had several telephone conversations. The DEA recorded many of these conversations and played them for the jury at trial.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, Cancel told the informant that the only person he knew who could acquire ten kilograms of cocaine was And&#250;jar. The informant was also familiar with And&#250;jar because Cancel had introduced the two a few years earlier. The next day, September 21, the informant went to Cancel's house to discuss the transaction. While the informant was present with a recording device, Cancel talked to And&#250;jar on the phone. And&#250;jar confirmed that he would sell cocaine to the informant, but he lowered the quantity from ten kilograms to five kilograms and set the purchase price at $85,000. The three agreed to meet the next day to complete the transaction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The September 22 meeting did not go as planned. When And&#250;jar and Cancel did not arrive at the arranged meeting location at the appointed time, the informant left. While driving home, he received a call from Cancel on his mobile phone. At one point in the conversation, And&#250;jar took the phone from Cancel and told the informant that he had the five kilograms and was ready to go forward with the deal. It was subsequently agreed that And&#250;jar would give the cocaine to Cancel who would then give it to the informant and that Cancel would thereafter bring the $85,000 from the informant to And&#250;jar.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of September 23, Cancel called the informant and told him that And&#250;jar had given him the cocaine. Cancel instructed the informant to come to his house to exchange the money for the cocaine. The informant and Agent Galloza, posing undercover as the drug buyer financing the purchase, drove to Cancel's house. The informant went inside Cancel's house, took possession of the bag of cocaine, and lead Cancel out to his truck to retrieve the money. After the informant put the cocaine in the back of the truck, local police and federal agents converged on the scene and arrested the informant, Cancel, and Agent Galloza. A forensic chemist testified that the substance seized that day was cocaine weighing just over five kilograms.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cancel subsequently agreed to call And&#250;jar to arrange for And&#250;jar's payment. Eddie Vidal, a Puerto Rico police officer assigned to the DEA, recorded and listened to Cancel's three phone conversations with And&#250;jar. In those conversations, And&#250;jar instructed Cancel to meet him at a shopping center parking lot. Cancel, Galloza, Vidal, and other law enforcement personnel drove to the shopping center and waited. And&#250;jar arrived driving a white BMW with two passengers. After And&#250;jar got out of the car and approached a fast food truck, Cancel identified him, and he was arrested. DEA agents also arrested the two other individuals in the white BMW, and conducted a search of the car's interior. Under the driver's seat the agents found a white plastic bag containing 110 individually wrapped clear plastic bags containing a white powdery substance. A forensic chemist testified that the bags contained approximately seventy grams of cocaine.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging And&#250;jar and Cancel with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846, and aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. Cancel pled guilty to both charges before trial and was sentenced to seventy-eight months imprisonment. A five-day jury trial ensued on the charges against And&#250;jar in which the government elicited testimony from the confidential informant, Officer Vidal, Agent Bryan, and two forensic chemists. The government also presented several recorded conversations, and testimony and documentary evidence concerning And&#250;jar's and Cancel's phone records. The jury found And&#250;jar guilty on both counts and the district court sentenced him to 121 months in prison. And&#250;jar filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n      <p>II.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that two errors necessitate a new trial. First, he contends that the district court erred by not granting a mistrial after the government infringed his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination by eliciting testimony concerning his election to remain silent and to request an attorney while being questioned by DEA agents. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. V (\"No person shall . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . .\"); <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (holding that a defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent may not be used against him at trial). And&#250;jar argues that this testimony resulted from \"intentional government misconduct which was geared to impressing on the [jury] that [he had] refused to talk about the 5 kilo[grams] and wanted a lawyer because he was guilty.\" Second, he contends that his right to a fair trial was \"further violated when the prosecutor made repeated, unprovoked[,] improper closing argument[s] to the jury.\" And&#250;jar argues that the district court should have declared a mistrial after the prosecutor impermissibly interjected his personal opinion and then compounded the error by telling the jurors that it was their \"duty\" to \"uphold the law\" and find And&#250;jar guilty.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Improper Testimony</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with And&#250;jar's contention that the government elicited improper testimony regarding his election to remain silent and to request an attorney. On the third day of the trial, the government called Agent Bryan who testified about And&#250;jar's arrest and booking. According to Bryan, And&#250;jar was advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights and indicated his understanding of those rights. Because And&#250;jar did not initially invoke his right to silence, Bryan began questioning him. Bryan testified as follows concerning that interrogation:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what, if anything, the defendant told you?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Basically we explained the seriousness of the charge that he was looking at and advised him that you know, we have evidence regarding that, and trying to seek his cooperation regarding the next level. . . . <i>At that time we tried to explain to Mr. And&#250;jar the seriousness of the charges, and explain to him this was the particular time that was for him, to be beneficial for him to get on board, what we say, to go ahead and see if we could seek the person that he received the five kilograms of cocaine from.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Did he tell you any information pertaining to any of the cocaine that you seized on that day?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Before we went straight to the five kilograms, what I initially started with was regarding the cocaine found in the vehicle. At that time he admitted to the fact that he said they, they had just purchased that particular cocaine.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. When he said they, who did you take they to be?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Himself and the other individuals in the vehicle.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. What happened after that?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. In addition, as I tried to ascertain further information as far as who he actually received the cocaine from, he then changed the statement and said that it was his cocaine and no one else had anything to do with it.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. His cocaine being the five kilograms or the 70 grams?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. At the time we were specifically talking about the cocaine in the vehicle. <i>When attempting to go further or get further details regarding the five kilograms, and also where was the cocaine ascertained from, at that time he didn't want to speak any further, he advised he wanted his lawyer and invoked his Miranda warnings and we stopped.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Did you question him any further after that?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. No, sir.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Day Three Tr. at 100-03 (emphasis added). And&#250;jar did not object at any point during this line of questioning.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the fourth day of the trial, the government recalled Agent Bryan to testify about a phone call DEA agents had made using And&#250;jar's mobile phone the evening after he was arrested. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Did Richard And&#250;jar have his cellphone with him at the time? A. No, sir, we had it with us, sir.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Did you have occasion to use his cellphone any time later in the night of September 23, 2004?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, I did.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how you used his cellphone and for what purpose?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, sir, <i>after Mr. And&#250;jar was arrested we were attempting to have Mr. And&#250;jar basically what we call get on board,</i> and in order to also keep the other cooperators cool at that particular time&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Day Four Tr. at 5 (emphasis added). At that point, And&#250;jar objected to the testimony concerning \"the other cooperators.\" And&#250;jar requested a mistrial, arguing that the government violated an earlier court order that government witnesses should refrain from suggesting that co-defendant Cancel had cooperated with law enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court offered to instruct the jury that Cancel did not cooperate. And&#250;jar then argued that Bryan's testimony concerning the DEA's attempt to get And&#250;jar \"on board\" \"seems like . . . he is making a comment on Mr. And&#250;jar's choice to remain silent.\" The court did not \"read that into this testimony\" and denied And&#250;jar's request for a mistrial. The court nonetheless struck the testimony from the record.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the start of the fifth and final day of trial, And&#250;jar again moved, both orally and in a written submission, for a mistrial based on Bryan's testimony that the DEA had attempted to get And&#250;jar \"on board.\" And&#250;jar noted that, although he had objected only once, Bryan had twice testified about the attempt to get And&#250;jar \"on board.\" And&#250;jar did not refer or object to the testimony describing And&#250;jar's termination of the interrogation. The court denied the motion for a mistrial but offered to deliver a curative instruction to the jury. And&#250;jar objected to a specific instruction, which he feared would draw attention to the stricken testimony. Therefore, with the assent of both parties, the court simply delivered an instruction emphasizing that the jury could not consider any testimony that had been stricken from the record.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar now challenges three portions of Bryan's testimony: (1) the day three testimony about attempting to get And&#250;jar \"on board,\" (2) the day three testimony regarding And&#250;jar's explicit invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, and (3) the day four testimony again mentioning the attempt to get And&#250;jar \"on board.\" We begin our analysis with consideration of the day three testimony specifically mentioning And&#250;jar's <i>Miranda</i> assertion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because And&#250;jar did not raise a contemporaneous objection to this testimony, our review is for plain error only. <i>See United States v. Gabriele,</i> 63 F.3d 61, 70 &amp; n. 13 (1st Cir.1995). For And&#250;jar to prevail under this standard, he must demonstrate that there was an error, that was clear or obvious, and that affected his substantial rights. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b)). If these three conditions are satisfied, the court may reverse to prevent a miscarriage of justice. <i>Id.</i> at 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment forbids the use of a defendant's custodial silence as substantive evidence of his guilt. <i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602. In <i>Doyle v. Ohio,</i> the Supreme Court held that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, where a defendant exercises his right to remain silent after being informed of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, the government may not use that silence to impeach an explanation offered by the defendant at trial. <i>See</i> 426 U.S. 610, 618-19, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). In so holding, the Court recognized that allowing the government to use a defendant's silence against him at trial, after having implicitly encouraged that silence through delivery of the <i>Miranda</i> warning, would be \"fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process.\" <i>Id.</i> at 618. This court has further held that a defendant's actual statement asserting his <i>Miranda</i> rights, even when uttered before a <i>Miranda</i> warning has been delivered, is not admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt. <i>See Coppola v. Powell,</i> 878 F.2d 1562, 1567 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[T]he disclosure of the words [the defendant] used to claim his privilege results in the same dilemma addressed\" in the Supreme Court cases dealing with prosecutorial reference to a defendant's silence).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question that arises here is whether the rule announced in <i>Miranda</i> &#8212; that the government may not use the defendant's post-arrest silence in its case-in-chief &#8212; is applicable here, where the defendant initially waived his Fifth Amendment privilege only to assert his right to silence at some later point in the midst of questioning. As a general rule, any inculpatory or exculpatory statements made by a defendant (including silence with regard to particular questions) are admissible at trial insofar as they were the product of a knowing and voluntary waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602; <i>United States v. Goldman,</i> 563 F.2d 501, 503 (1st Cir.1977) (\"A defendant cannot have it both ways. If he talks, what he says or omits is to be judged on its merits or demerits, and not on some artificial standard that only the part that helps him can be later referred to.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). But waiver, in this context, is not an all-or-nothing proposition. As the Supreme Court noted in <i>Miranda,</i> \"where in-custody interrogation is involved, there is no room for the contention that the privilege is waived if the individual answers some questions or gives some information on his own prior to invoking his right to remain silent when interrogated.\" 384 U.S. at 475-76, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The Court was explicit that a detained suspect may change his mind about talking to the police \"at any time prior to or during questioning,\" and that the \"right to cut off questioning,\" is essential to the privilege. <i>Id.</i> at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites a line of Eighth Circuit cases that hold that testimony regarding a defendant's refusal to speak to the police, following an initial <i>Miranda</i> waiver, is admissible against the defendant. <i>See United States v. Burns,</i> 276 F.3d 439, 442 (8th Cir.2002) (\"[W]here the accused initially waives his or her right to remain silent and agrees to questioning, but `subsequently refuses to answer further questions, the prosecution may note the refusal because it now constitutes part of an otherwise admissible conversation between the police and the accused.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Harris,</i> 956 F.2d 177, 181 (8th Cir.1992), and citing <i>United States v. Collins,</i> 652 F.2d 735, 739 (8th Cir.1981)). <i>See also Rowan v. Owens,</i> 752 F.2d 1186, 1190 (7th Cir.1984) (Posner, J.) (finding that, on the facts of that case, the government's testimony concerning the end of the interrogation was permissible).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that his case is distinguishable from the above cases because the challenged testimony here refers directly to his express assertion of his constitutional rights. In the above cases, And&#250;jar argues, the challenged testimony mentioned only the defendant's refusal to answer further questions. <i>See Burns,</i> 276 F.3d at 441 (federal agent testified that the defendant, in response to one particular question, \"did not respond and `just looked' at those questioning him\"); <i>Harris,</i> 956 F.2d at 181 (prosecutor's summation mentioned the defendant's confession and that the defendant thereafter \"conclude[d] the interview\"); <i>Rowan,</i> 752 F.2d at 1190 (two police officers testified that after the defendant answered some questions he \"said he didn't want to say anything else\"); <i>Collins,</i> 652 F.2d at 740 (officers testified that after making an incriminating statement, the defendant \"refused to make any other statement\"). In contrast, And&#250;jar argues, Bryan's testimony explicitly noted that And&#250;jar had asked for a lawyer and had \"invoked his Miranda warnings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar raises a meaningful distinction. It has long been established that a witness who has been compelled to testify may avoid a question on Fifth Amendment grounds only if the answer would pose \"some authentic danger of incrimination.\" <i>United States v. Castro,</i> 129 F.3d 226, 229 (1st Cir.1997). In light of the self-evident purpose of the privilege against self-incrimination, a government witness's testimony that an accused explicitly invoked the privilege raises a nearly irresistible inference that the accused was hiding something incriminating. Put another way, although silence may be interpreted in many ways, <i>see Doyle,</i> 426 U.S. at 617, 96 S.Ct. 2240 (\"every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous\"), the affirmative assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination raises a clear inference of culpability. Accordingly, since such testimony more directly implies that the defendant was hiding something, it is necessarily more prejudicial than testimony that simply notes that the defendant at some point stopped answering questions. Indeed, the distinction between an affirmative statement and simple silence was one important factor in <i>Coppola. See</i> 878 F.2d at 1566 (distinguishing from Supreme Court precedent upholding the use of pre-arrest silence to impeach a defendant's credibility because, \"[i]n the case at bar, we are concerned with the use of a statement made by a suspect and used by the prosecutor in his case in chief, not the use of silence to impeach the defendant's credibility\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, although <i>Miranda</i> acknowledges the possibility of a knowing and voluntary waiver, neither <i>Miranda,</i> nor any subsequent Supreme Court decision, draws a distinction between an immediate post-arrest Fifth Amendment assertion and a delayed mid-interrogation assertion. In either event, the assertion triggers the privilege, the police must cease interrogation, and the government may not use the assertion against the defendant at trial. <i>See Doyle,</i> 426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240; <i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (\"In accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.\"). At least with respect to clear affirmative assertions, we do not see how an initial <i>Miranda</i> waiver can operate to make a subsequent <i>Miranda</i> assertion admissible against the defendant, nor do we perceive a sound rationale for cutting back the scope of <i>Miranda's</i> protections. <i>See Coppola,</i> 878 F.2d at 1566 (noting that the privilege against self-incrimination is given liberal application and cautioning against \"whittl[ing] it down by the subtle encroachments of judicial opinion\") (quoting <i>Maffie v. United States,</i> 209 F.2d 225, 227 (1st Cir.1954)); <i>see also Castro,</i> 129 F.3d at 229 (recognizing that the privilege against self-incrimination is \"a cornerstone of our adversarial system of criminal justice\" that \"must not be given a crabbed construction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the merit of the reasoning of the Eighth Circuit cases, there are limits to how far the government may go in describing the scope of an interrogation. <i>See Rowan,</i> 752 F.2d at 1190 (recognizing that the police can \"indicate . . . the end as well as the beginning of the interrogation, so that the jury [will] know that the officers' testimony [is] complete,\" \"provided [that] they [do] not do so with undue emphasis\"). Government witnesses who testify concerning the circumstances of an interrogation that was terminated by the defendant must proceed with caution. In the circumstances of this case, we hold that the Fifth Amendment bars testimony concerning a defendant's explicit mid-interrogation assertion of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and that it was error to permit such testimony to go to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, nevertheless, that in light of the Eighth Circuit cases, and a case from this circuit that favorably cites one of those cases, <i>see United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing <i>Harris,</i> 956 F.2d at 181), the district court's error was not plain. As noted above, because the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination \"must be given liberal construction,\" <i>Coppola,</i> 878 F.2d at 1565, any exceptions that undermine its protections should be applied narrowly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to emphasize that the Eighth Circuit cases did not confront the precise scenario presented here. <i>See supra</i> at 556. Neither did <i>Lopez-Lopez.</i> In that case, two co-defendants were questioned together and in response to a specific question, one co-defendant told the other \"don't answer.\" <i>Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 11. The district court allowed the interrogating officer to testify regarding that statement at the defendants' joint trial. We upheld their convictions, holding that, after an accused knowingly and voluntarily waives his <i>Miranda</i> rights by making statements, \"he may not rely on <i>Doyle</i> to object to the admission of those statements simply because the statements refer to the act of keeping silent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12. As in the Eighth Circuit cases, the testimony challenged in <i>Lopez-Lopez</i> did not describe the defendant expressly electing to exercise his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Moreover, <i>Lopez-Lopez</i> is further distinguishable by the fact that it did not involve an accused asserting his own <i>Miranda</i> rights, but rather involved an accused urging his companion to assert his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, <i>Miranda</i> draws no distinction between a mid-interrogation assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination and an immediate post-arrest assertion, <i>see Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 468 n. 37 &amp; 475-76, 86 S.Ct. 1602, and our holding in <i>Coppola</i> makes it clear that the words the defendant uses to assert the privilege are themselves protected by it, <i>see Coppola,</i> 878 F.2d at 1567-68. We reject the contention that any subsequent cases, of this circuit or of any other circuit, can be read to have carved out an exception to this protection where the express assertion of the privilege comes after a previous waiver. Such an exception would run contrary to <i>Miranda's</i> plain language. Accordingly, we find that it was plain error to allow testimony concerning And&#250;jar's express assertion of his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a finding, however does not end the plain error analysis. And&#250;jar must establish that the error affected his \"substantial rights by altering the outcome of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Shoup,</i> 476 F.3d 38, 42 (1st Cir.2007). Put another way, he must establish that the error prejudiced him. Given the overwhelming strength of the government's case, we conclude that it did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the government's case largely hinged on the testimony of a confidential informant, his testimony was corroborated by several sources, including the testimony of Officer Vidal and Agent Bryan, and the recorded conversations between the informant and Cancel. Bryan's and Vidal's testimony, and the substance of the recorded conversations, track the informant's testimony. Moreover, Vidal personally identified And&#250;jar as being on the other end of the calls Cancel made to set up the time and the place for the seller to receive payment for the five kilograms of cocaine. The phone records for Cancel's and And&#250;jar's mobile phones &#8212; which show a number of calls between Cancel and And&#250;jar during the time period of the conspiracy &#8212; further support the informant's story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's own actions and statements provide further corroboration. And&#250;jar's very arrival at the appointed time and place designated for the transfer of the $85,000 is strong circumstantial evidence of his involvement in the conspiracy, especially when viewed in context with the other evidence. Moreover, And&#250;jar's post-arrest confession that he was the owner of the seventy grams of cocaine found in the white BMW provides additional circumstantial evidence linking And&#250;jar to the conspiracy. Both the quantity and the packaging of the seventy grams of cocaine, in 110 individual plastic bags, were consistent with distribution. <i>See United States v. Puckett,</i> 405 F.3d 589, 601 (7th Cir.2005) (noting that \"63 grams [of cocaine], is in excess of what one would possess for personal use, and is in and of itself sufficient evidence to compel an inference that [the defendant] intended to distribute the drug\"). And&#250;jar's possession of the seventy grams &#8212; although not directly probative of his ownership of the five kilograms &#8212; lends credibility to the informant's depiction of And&#250;jar as a drug dealer and undermines the defense testimony aimed at establishing an innocent explanation for And&#250;jar's presence at the shopping center parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that the credibility of the government's identification is in doubt because the officers who arrested And&#250;jar inquired whether other people at the scene were \"Richard.\" But the fact that the arresting officers may not have known what And&#250;jar looked like hardly undermines the government's case. Admittedly, the DEA relied on Cancel to make a visual identification of the seller, and he did just that. And&#250;jar also argues that \"the short duration of calls between Cancel and [And&#250;jar], the lack of certainty as to what was spoken between them during those calls, [and] that there was evidence Cancel had direct communication with the owners of the narcotics whom he did not identify to the authorities at the time of arrest\" further undermines the government's case. Again, however, it is not readily apparent how any of these factors weaken the government's case. It is hardly surprising that a drug dealer would want to minimize the length of his phone conversations concerning an illicit transaction. Nor is the government charged with providing the precise contents of every conversation involved in a conspiracy. In any event, the detailed testimony of the confidential informant, and the testimony of Officer Vidal, who listened in on three of Cancel's calls with And&#250;jar, could hardly be characterized as \"uncertain.\" Finally, that Cancel may have had contact with And&#250;jar's source does not disprove And&#250;jar's participation, especially in light of the testimony that the source trusted only And&#250;jar and would not work directly with anyone else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore find that And&#250;jar has failed to establish that the error \"had [a] prejudicial impact on the jury's deliberations.\" <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted). For the same reason, And&#250;jar's unpreserved challenge to the day three \"on board\" testimony also fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar did, however, object to the day four testimony. Although not perceiving a problem, the district court sustained And&#250;jar's objection, struck the offending testimony from the record, and instructed the jury as requested by And&#250;jar. Thus, the only question presented on appeal is whether the granting of greater relief (i.e., the declaration of a mistrial) was warranted. Although we ordinarily review de novo the question of whether \"a statement in the presence of the jury infringed upon the privilege against self-incrimination,\" we review the \"denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gabriele,</i> 63 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The connection between Bryan's testimony about the DEA's post-arrest \"attempt[] to have Mr. And&#250;jar . . . get on board\" and And&#250;jar's election to remain silent is tenuous at best. The question posed by the government &#8212; asking Bryan how and for what purpose he had used And&#250;jar's cell phone &#8212; did not call for such testimony. On its face, the testimony itself does not explicitly suggest that And&#250;jar refused to talk to police, nor does it state whether the DEA's \"attempt\" was ultimately successful. <i>See Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 12 (finding no <i>Doyle</i> violation where there \"was no testimony as to whether [the co-defendant] responded to [the defendant's] suggestion by remaining silent and there was no testimony about either party remaining silent in the face of questioning\"). Nor did the government make \"a point of asking the jury to draw a negative inference from\" the attempt to get And&#250;jar \"on board.\" <i>United States v. Daoud,</i> 741 F.2d 478, 482 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming the jury made the connection And&#250;jar fears, viewing the totality of the circumstances, we do not perceive a violation of constitutional magnitude. In a recent habeas case, we recognized that in cases involving testimony concerning a defendant's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence, where the trial court promptly addresses the improper testimony \"in an instruction to disregard and/or strike from the record, there may not necessarily be a <i>Doyle</i> violation because the government has not been permitted to `use' the defendant's silence against him.\" <i>Ellen v. Brady,</i> 475 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>Greer v. Miller,</i> 483 U.S. 756, 764-65, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987)). In <i>Ellen,</i> a government witness, responding to a seemingly innocuous question from the prosecutor, testified concerning the defendant's election not to speak to the police. <i>Id.</i> at 7. The defendant immediately objected and the trial court sustained the objection, struck the testimony, and delivered a curative instruction. <i>Id.</i> at 8. In light of the surrounding circumstances, we ruled that there was no constitutional violation. <i>See id.</i> at 12-14. Important to our consideration were the facts that the defendant's \"post-<i>Miranda</i> silence was not mentioned, by either the prosecutor or a witness, after the judge sustained the objection[,]\" the government's questions \"did not, on their face, call for testimony in violation of <i>Doyle,</i>\" and the court promptly delivered curative instructions that \"were proportional to the\" offensive testimony. <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same factors are present here. The district court sustained And&#250;jar's objection and struck the offending testimony from the record. Following And&#250;jar's objection, no further questions or testimony alluded to his silence and the government made no comment on his silence in closing arguments. Additionally, the jury was instructed, both at the beginning of the trial and after the close of evidence, that it must not consider any testimony stricken from the record. Following closing arguments, the court, at And&#250;jar's request, again emphasized this point, reminding the jury \"that any testimony that you may have seen or heard and that I have excluded from evidence, and instructed you to disregard, is not evidence.\" The court also instructed the jury that And&#250;jar has a \"constitutional right not to testify and no inference of guilt or of anything else, may be drawn from the fact that he did not testify. For any of you to draw such an inference would be wrong, indeed it would be a violation of your oath as a juror.\" And&#250;jar presents no sound reason to discard \"the customary presumption that juries follow their instructions.\" <i>Gabriele,</i> 63 F.3d at 70; <i>see also Ellen,</i> 475 F.3d at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that we should view the challenged day four testimony in context with the previous improper testimony. And&#250;jar argues that the government purposefully elicited Bryan's improper testimony and the district court should have considered the cumulative effect of all the improper testimony. First, as noted above, we disagree that the government purposefully sought to elicit testimony about And&#250;jar exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege. Additionally, it bears emphasizing that this court reviews alleged errors of the district court, not errors of the prosecution, and the district court is not charged with advocating for the defense or anticipating issues not brought to the fore by counsel. <i>Cf. United States v. McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d 548, 555 (1st Cir.2004). And&#250;jar never referred the court to the most objectionable testimony directly relating to his <i>Miranda</i> assertion. He only objected to the ambiguous and considerably less striking \"on board\" testimony. In such circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying And&#250;jar's motion for a mistrial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Improper Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar challenges three comments made by the government in closing arguments. First, at the end of his initial summation, the prosecutor stated, \"I feel comfortable and the United States feels comfortable that they have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that this man delivered five kilograms of cocaine between the 20 and 23 of September.\" Day Five Tr. at 39. In rebuttal, the prosecutor argued, inter alia, that And&#250;jar and Cancel \"conspired to distribute five kilograms of cocaine, it does not matter where it came from. He gave it to Freddy Cancel. That is what matters. I have proven it, absolutely. We have met our burden.\" <i>Id.</i> at 59. Finally, in his last words to the jury, the prosecutor urged, \"[y]ou find him guilty, you uphold the law, your duty as jurors, make the logical choice and come back with one answer, and telling this man, Richard And&#250;jar you are guilty. Thank you.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that the first two remarks were improper because they amounted to \"affirmations of [the prosecutor's] personal belief\" that And&#250;jar is guilty. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez Vargas,</i> 558 F.2d 631, 632-33 (1st Cir. 1977) (vacating a conviction where the prosecutor stated his personal belief in summation). Further inflaming the jurors' passions, And&#250;jar argues, was the prosecutor's final exhortation to the jurors to do \"your duty.\" <i>See United States v. Mandelbaum,</i> 803 F.2d 42, 44 (1st Cir. 1986) (finding improper the suggestion that a jury has \"a duty to decide one way or the other\" because such an appeal \"can only distract a jury from its actual duty: impartiality\"). And&#250;jar contends that the severity of these comments warrants a new trial. The government concedes that the comments were improper, but argues that a new trial is unnecessary because it is not reasonably likely these isolated remarks affected the outcome of the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since And&#250;jar did not object to the prosecutor's remarks at trial, we may only review for plain error. <i>See United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 105 (1st Cir. 2003). The government explicitly concedes error and implicitly concedes that the error was plain. Nevertheless, as we have already noted above, <i>see supra</i> 558-59, 560 n. 3, the record, viewed in the aggregate, presents overwhelming evidence establishing And&#250;jar's guilt. In such circumstances, we are compelled to conclude that the prosecutor's improper remarks did not \"so poison[ ] the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's convictions are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the court had ruled that any testimony referring to co-defendant Cancel's \"cooperation\" with law enforcement was overly prejudicial and misleading because Cancel ultimately chose not to cooperate and not to testify at And&#250;jar's trial. The government was ordered to instruct its witnesses not to characterize Cancel as a \"cooperator.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> And&#250;jar does not argue that his waiver was not made knowingly and voluntarily</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We recognize that, unlike in<i>Ellen,</i> some testimony concerning And&#250;jar's silence was ultimately submitted to the jury. But this state of affairs came about only because of defense counsel's inattention. Once apprised of the problem, the district court acted promptly and reasonably to correct it. We further add that, even under the stricter form of harmless error review applicable to constitutional errors, the government has established beyond any reasonable doubt that the verdict was not influenced by the references to And&#250;jar's <i>Miranda</i> election. <i>United States v. Coker,</i> 433 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2005). Based on the overwhelming evidence establishing And&#250;jar's guilt, we are confident that the verdict would have been the same even in the absence of the improper testimony. <i>Id.; see supra</i> at 558-59.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The government also argues that And&#250;jar's counsel interjected her own personal opinion in her summation and thereby \"neutraliz[ed] the harm flowing from the prosecutor's remarks.\"<i>United States v.

And&#250;jar-Basco of conspiring and aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine. And&#250;jar seeks a new trial, arguing that the district court erred by not declaring a mistrial (1) after a government witness testified regarding And&#250;jar's election to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent and to request an attorney, and (2) after the government made unrelated improper remarks in closing arguments.</p>\n      <p>I.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar was ensnared in a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) sting operation. In September 2004, the DEA paid a confidential informant to make purchases of controlled substances. At the behest of DEA Agents Carlos Galloza and Roberto Bryan, the confidential informant contacted Freddy Cancel-Camacho, an acquaintance he had known for twenty years, to inquire about the purchase of ten kilograms of cocaine. Prior to the purchase, the informant and Cancel met on multiple occasions and also had several telephone conversations. The DEA recorded many of these conversations and played them for the jury at trial.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, Cancel told the informant that the only person he knew who could acquire ten kilograms of cocaine was And&#250;jar. The informant was also familiar with And&#250;jar because Cancel had introduced the two a few years earlier. The next day, September 21, the informant went to Cancel's house to discuss the transaction. While the informant was present with a recording device, Cancel talked to And&#250;jar on the phone. And&#250;jar confirmed that he would sell cocaine to the informant, but he lowered the quantity from ten kilograms to five kilograms and set the purchase price at $85,000. The three agreed to meet the next day to complete the transaction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The September 22 meeting did not go as planned. When And&#250;jar and Cancel did not arrive at the arranged meeting location at the appointed time, the informant left. While driving home, he received a call from Cancel on his mobile phone. At one point in the conversation, And&#250;jar took the phone from Cancel and told the informant that he had the five kilograms and was ready to go forward with the deal. It was subsequently agreed that And&#250;jar would give the cocaine to Cancel who would then give it to the informant and that Cancel would thereafter bring the $85,000 from the informant to And&#250;jar.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of September 23, Cancel called the informant and told him that And&#250;jar had given him the cocaine. Cancel instructed the informant to come to his house to exchange the money for the cocaine. The informant and Agent Galloza, posing undercover as the drug buyer financing the purchase, drove to Cancel's house. The informant went inside Cancel's house, took possession of the bag of cocaine, and lead Cancel out to his truck to retrieve the money. After the informant put the cocaine in the back of the truck, local police and federal agents converged on the scene and arrested the informant, Cancel, and Agent Galloza. A forensic chemist testified that the substance seized that day was cocaine weighing just over five kilograms.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cancel subsequently agreed to call And&#250;jar to arrange for And&#250;jar's payment. Eddie Vidal, a Puerto Rico police officer assigned to the DEA, recorded and listened to Cancel's three phone conversations with And&#250;jar. In those conversations, And&#250;jar instructed Cancel to meet him at a shopping center parking lot. Cancel, Galloza, Vidal, and other law enforcement personnel drove to the shopping center and waited. And&#250;jar arrived driving a white BMW with two passengers. After And&#250;jar got out of the car and approached a fast food truck, Cancel identified him, and he was arrested. DEA agents also arrested the two other individuals in the white BMW, and conducted a search of the car's interior. Under the driver's seat the agents found a white plastic bag containing 110 individually wrapped clear plastic bags containing a white powdery substance. A forensic chemist testified that the bags contained approximately seventy grams of cocaine.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging And&#250;jar and Cancel with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846, and aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. Cancel pled guilty to both charges before trial and was sentenced to seventy-eight months imprisonment. A five-day jury trial ensued on the charges against And&#250;jar in which the government elicited testimony from the confidential informant, Officer Vidal, Agent Bryan, and two forensic chemists. The government also presented several recorded conversations, and testimony and documentary evidence concerning And&#250;jar's and Cancel's phone records. The jury found And&#250;jar guilty on both counts and the district court sentenced him to 121 months in prison. And&#250;jar filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n      <p>II.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that two errors necessitate a new trial. First, he contends that the district court erred by not granting a mistrial after the government infringed his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination by eliciting testimony concerning his election to remain silent and to request an attorney while being questioned by DEA agents. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend.

And&#250;jar argues that this testimony resulted from \"intentional government misconduct which was geared to impressing on the [jury] that [he had] refused to talk about the 5 kilo[grams] and wanted a lawyer because he was guilty.\" Second, he contends that his right to a fair trial was \"further violated when the prosecutor made repeated, unprovoked[,] improper closing argument[s] to the jury.\" And&#250;jar argues that the district court should have declared a mistrial after the prosecutor impermissibly interjected his personal opinion and then compounded the error by telling the jurors that it was their \"duty\" to \"uphold the law\" and find And&#250;jar guilty.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Improper Testimony</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with And&#250;jar's contention that the government elicited improper testimony regarding his election to remain silent and to request an attorney. On the third day of the trial, the government called Agent Bryan who testified about And&#250;jar's arrest and booking. According to Bryan, And&#250;jar was advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights and indicated his understanding of those rights. Because And&#250;jar did not initially invoke his right to silence, Bryan began questioning him. Bryan testified as follows concerning that interrogation:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what, if anything, the defendant told you?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Basically we explained the seriousness of the charge that he was looking at and advised him that you know, we have evidence regarding that, and trying to seek his cooperation regarding the next level. . . . <i>At that time we tried to explain to Mr. And&#250;jar the seriousness of the charges, and explain to him this was the particular time that was for him, to be beneficial for him to get on board, what we say, to go ahead and see if we could seek the person that he received the five kilograms of cocaine from.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Did he tell you any information pertaining to any of the cocaine that you seized on that day?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Before we went straight to the five kilograms, what I initially started with was regarding the cocaine found in the vehicle. At that time he admitted to the fact that he said they, they had just purchased that particular cocaine.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. When he said they, who did you take they to be?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Himself and the other individuals in the vehicle.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. What happened after that?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. In addition, as I tried to ascertain further information as far as who he actually received the cocaine from, he then changed the statement and said that it was his cocaine and no one else had anything to do with it.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. His cocaine being the five kilograms or the 70 grams?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. At the time we were specifically talking about the cocaine in the vehicle. <i>When attempting to go further or get further details regarding the five kilograms, and also where was the cocaine ascertained from, at that time he didn't want to speak any further, he advised he wanted his lawyer and invoked his Miranda warnings and we stopped.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Did you question him any further after that?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. No, sir.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Day Three Tr. at 100-03 (emphasis added). And&#250;jar did not object at any point during this line of questioning.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the fourth day of the trial, the government recalled Agent Bryan to testify about a phone call DEA agents had made using And&#250;jar's mobile phone the evening after he was arrested. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Did Richard And&#250;jar have his cellphone with him at the time? A. No, sir, we had it with us, sir.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Did you have occasion to use his cellphone any time later in the night of September 23, 2004?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, I did.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how you used his cellphone and for what purpose?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, sir, <i>after Mr. And&#250;jar was arrested we were attempting to have Mr. And&#250;jar basically what we call get on board,</i> and in order to also keep the other cooperators cool at that particular time&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Day Four Tr. at 5 (emphasis added). At that point, And&#250;jar objected to the testimony concerning \"the other cooperators.\" And&#250;jar requested a mistrial, arguing that the government violated an earlier court order that government witnesses should refrain from suggesting that co-defendant Cancel had cooperated with law enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court offered to instruct the jury that Cancel did not cooperate. And&#250;jar then argued that Bryan's testimony concerning the DEA's attempt to get And&#250;jar \"on board\" \"seems like . . . he is making a comment on Mr. And&#250;jar's choice to remain silent.\" The court did not \"read that into this testimony\" and denied And&#250;jar's request for a mistrial. The court nonetheless struck the testimony from the record.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the start of the fifth and final day of trial, And&#250;jar again moved, both orally and in a written submission, for a mistrial based on Bryan's testimony that the DEA had attempted to get And&#250;jar \"on board.\" And&#250;jar noted that, although he had objected only once, Bryan had twice testified about the attempt to get And&#250;jar \"on board.\" And&#250;jar did not refer or object to the testimony describing And&#250;jar's termination of the interrogation. The court denied the motion for a mistrial but offered to deliver a curative instruction to the jury. And&#250;jar objected to a specific instruction, which he feared would draw attention to the stricken testimony. Therefore, with the assent of both parties, the court simply delivered an instruction emphasizing that the jury could not consider any testimony that had been stricken from the record.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar now challenges three portions of Bryan's testimony: (1) the day three testimony about attempting to get And&#250;jar \"on board,\" (2) the day three testimony regarding And&#250;jar's explicit invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, and (3) the day four testimony again mentioning the attempt to get And&#250;jar \"on board.\" We begin our analysis with consideration of the day three testimony specifically mentioning And&#250;jar's <i>Miranda</i> assertion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because And&#250;jar did not raise a contemporaneous objection to this testimony, our review is for plain error only. <i>See United States v.

This court has further held that a defendant's actual statement asserting his <i>Miranda</i> rights, even when uttered before a <i>Miranda</i> warning has been delivered, is not admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt. <i>See Coppola v.

As a general rule, any inculpatory or exculpatory statements made by a defendant (including silence with regard to particular questions) are admissible at trial insofar as they were the product of a knowing and voluntary waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 475, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But waiver, in this context, is not an all-or-nothing proposition. As the Supreme Court noted in <i>Miranda,</i> \"where in-custody interrogation is involved, there is no room for the contention that the privilege is waived if the individual answers some questions or gives some information on his own prior to invoking his right to remain silent when interrogated.\" 384 U.S. at 475-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(finding that, on the facts of that case, the government's testimony concerning the end of the interrogation was permissible).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that his case is distinguishable from the above cases because the challenged testimony here refers directly to his express assertion of his constitutional rights. In the above cases, And&#250;jar argues, the challenged testimony mentioned only the defendant's refusal to answer further questions. <i>See Burns,</i> 276 F.3d at 441 (federal agent testified that the defendant, in response to one particular question, \"did not respond and `just looked' at those questioning him\"); <i>Harris,</i> 956 F.2d at 181 (prosecutor's summation mentioned the defendant's confession and that the defendant thereafter \"conclude[d] the interview\"); <i>Rowan,</i> 752 F.2d at 1190 (two police officers testified that after the defendant answered some questions he \"said he didn't want to say anything else\"); <i>Collins,</i> 652 F.2d at 740 (officers testified that after making an incriminating statement, the defendant \"refused to make any other statement\"). In contrast, And&#250;jar argues, Bryan's testimony explicitly noted that And&#250;jar had asked for a lawyer and had \"invoked his Miranda warnings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar raises a meaningful distinction. It has long been established that a witness who has been compelled to testify may avoid a question on Fifth Amendment grounds only if the answer would pose \"some authentic danger of incrimination.\" <i>United States v. Castro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197657\"><a href=\"/opinion/197657/united-states-v-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir.1997). In light of the self-evident purpose of the privilege against self-incrimination, a government witness's testimony that an accused explicitly invoked the privilege raises a nearly irresistible inference that the accused was hiding something incriminating. Put another way, although silence may be interpreted in many ways, <i>see Doyle,</i> 426 U.S. at 617, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2240</span></a></span> (\"every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous\"), the affirmative assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination raises a clear inference of culpability. Accordingly, since such testimony more directly implies that the defendant was hiding something, it is necessarily more prejudicial than testimony that simply notes that the defendant at some point stopped answering questions. Indeed, the distinction between an affirmative statement and simple silence was one important factor in <i>Coppola. See</i> 878 F.2d at 1566 (distinguishing from Supreme Court precedent upholding the use of pre-arrest silence to impeach a defendant's credibility because, \"[i]n the case at bar, we are concerned with the use of a statement made by a suspect and used by the prosecutor in his case in chief, not the use of silence to impeach the defendant's credibility\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, although <i>Miranda</i> acknowledges the possibility of a knowing and voluntary waiver, neither <i>Miranda,</i> nor any subsequent Supreme Court decision, draws a distinction between an immediate post-arrest Fifth Amendment assertion and a delayed mid-interrogation assertion. In either event, the assertion triggers the privilege, the police must cease interrogation, and the government may not use the assertion against the defendant at trial. <i>See Doyle,</i> 426 U.S. at 619, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span> (\"In accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.\"). At least with respect to clear affirmative assertions, we do not see how an initial <i>Miranda</i> waiver can operate to make a subsequent <i>Miranda</i> assertion admissible against the defendant, nor do we perceive a sound rationale for cutting back the scope of <i>Miranda's</i> protections. <i>See Coppola,</i> 878 F.2d at 1566 (noting that the privilege against self-incrimination is given liberal application and cautioning against \"whittl[ing] it down by the subtle encroachments of judicial opinion\") (quoting <i>Maffie v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"233070\"><a href=\"/opinion/233070/maffie-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 227 (1st Cir.1954)); <i>see also Castro,</i> 129 F.3d at 229 (recognizing that the privilege against self-incrimination is \"a cornerstone of our adversarial system of criminal justice\" that \"must not be given a crabbed construction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the merit of the reasoning of the Eighth Circuit cases, there are limits to how far the government may go in describing the scope of an interrogation. <i>See Rowan,</i> 752 F.2d at 1190 (recognizing that the police can \"indicate . . . the end as well as the beginning of the interrogation, so that the jury [will] know that the officers' testimony [is] complete,\" \"provided [that] they [do] not do so with undue emphasis\"). Government witnesses who testify concerning the circumstances of an interrogation that was terminated by the defendant must proceed with caution. In the circumstances of this case, we hold that the Fifth Amendment bars testimony concerning a defendant's explicit mid-interrogation assertion of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and that it was error to permit such testimony to go to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, nevertheless, that in light of the Eighth Circuit cases, and a case from this circuit that favorably cites one of those cases, <i>see United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199833\"><a href=\"/opinion/199833/united-states-v-lopez-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing <i>Harris,</i> 956 F.2d at 181), the district court's error was not plain. As noted above, because the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination \"must be given liberal construction,\" <i>Coppola,</i> 878 F.2d at 1565, any exceptions that undermine its protections should be applied narrowly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to emphasize that the Eighth Circuit cases did not confront the precise scenario presented here. <i>See supra</i> at 556. Neither did <i>Lopez-Lopez.</i> In that case, two co-defendants were questioned together and in response to a specific question, one co-defendant told the other \"don't answer.\" <i>Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 11. The district court allowed the interrogating officer to testify regarding that statement at the defendants' joint trial. We upheld their convictions, holding that, after an accused knowingly and voluntarily waives his <i>Miranda</i> rights by making statements, \"he may not rely on <i>Doyle</i> to object to the admission of those statements simply because the statements refer to the act of keeping silent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12. As in the Eighth Circuit cases, the testimony challenged in <i>Lopez-Lopez</i> did not describe the defendant expressly electing to exercise his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Moreover, <i>Lopez-Lopez</i> is further distinguishable by the fact that it did not involve an accused asserting his own <i>Miranda</i> rights, but rather involved an accused urging his companion to assert his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, <i>Miranda</i> draws no distinction between a mid-interrogation assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination and an immediate post-arrest assertion, <i>see Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 468 n. 37 &amp; 475-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>, and our holding in <i>Coppola</i> makes it clear that the words the defendant uses to assert the privilege are themselves protected by it, <i>see Coppola,</i> 878 F.2d at 1567-68. We reject the contention that any subsequent cases, of this circuit or of any other circuit, can be read to have carved out an exception to this protection where the express assertion of the privilege comes after a previous waiver. Such an exception would run contrary to <i>Miranda's</i> plain language. Accordingly, we find that it was plain error to allow testimony concerning And&#250;jar's express assertion of his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a finding, however does not end the plain error analysis. And&#250;jar must establish that the error affected his \"substantial rights by altering the outcome of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Shoup,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202624\"><a href=\"/opinion/202624/united-states-v-shoup/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2007). Put another way, he must establish that the error prejudiced him. Given the overwhelming strength of the government's case, we conclude that it did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the government's case largely hinged on the testimony of a confidential informant, his testimony was corroborated by several sources, including the testimony of Officer Vidal and Agent Bryan, and the recorded conversations between the informant and Cancel. Bryan's and Vidal's testimony, and the substance of the recorded conversations, track the informant's testimony. Moreover, Vidal personally identified And&#250;jar as being on the other end of the calls Cancel made to set up the time and the place for the seller to receive payment for the five kilograms of cocaine. The phone records for Cancel's and And&#250;jar's mobile phones &#8212; which show a number of calls between Cancel and And&#250;jar during the time period of the conspiracy &#8212; further support the informant's story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's own actions and statements provide further corroboration. And&#250;jar's very arrival at the appointed time and place designated for the transfer of the $85,000 is strong circumstantial evidence of his involvement in the conspiracy, especially when viewed in context with the other evidence. Moreover, And&#250;jar's post-arrest confession that he was the owner of the seventy grams of cocaine found in the white BMW provides additional circumstantial evidence linking And&#250;jar to the conspiracy. Both the quantity and the packaging of the seventy grams of cocaine, in 110 individual plastic bags, were consistent with distribution. <i>See United States v. Puckett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790011\"><a href=\"/opinion/790011/united-states-v-dawon-d-puckett/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 601 (7th Cir.2005) (noting that \"63 grams [of cocaine], is in excess of what one would possess for personal use, and is in and of itself sufficient evidence to compel an inference that [the defendant] intended to distribute the drug\"). And&#250;jar's possession of the seventy grams &#8212; although not directly probative of his ownership of the five kilograms &#8212; lends credibility to the informant's depiction of And&#250;jar as a drug dealer and undermines the defense testimony aimed at establishing an innocent explanation for And&#250;jar's presence at the shopping center parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that the credibility of the government's identification is in doubt because the officers who arrested And&#250;jar inquired whether other people at the scene were \"Richard.\" But the fact that the arresting officers may not have known what And&#250;jar looked like hardly undermines the government's case. Admittedly, the DEA relied on Cancel to make a visual identification of the seller, and he did just that. And&#250;jar also argues that \"the short duration of calls between Cancel and [And&#250;jar], the lack of certainty as to what was spoken between them during those calls, [and] that there was evidence Cancel had direct communication with the owners of the narcotics whom he did not identify to the authorities at the time of arrest\" further undermines the government's case. Again, however, it is not readily apparent how any of these factors weaken the government's case. It is hardly surprising that a drug dealer would want to minimize the length of his phone conversations concerning an illicit transaction. Nor is the government charged with providing the precise contents of every conversation involved in a conspiracy. In any event, the detailed testimony of the confidential informant, and the testimony of Officer Vidal, who listened in on three of Cancel's calls with And&#250;jar, could hardly be characterized as \"uncertain.\" Finally, that Cancel may have had contact with And&#250;jar's source does not disprove And&#250;jar's participation, especially in light of the testimony that the source trusted only And&#250;jar and would not work directly with anyone else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore find that And&#250;jar has failed to establish that the error \"had [a] prejudicial impact on the jury's deliberations.\" <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 734, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although not perceiving a problem, the district court sustained And&#250;jar's objection, struck the offending testimony from the record, and instructed the jury as requested by And&#250;jar. Thus, the only question presented on appeal is whether the granting of greater relief (i.e., the declaration of a mistrial) was warranted. Although we ordinarily review de novo the question of whether \"a statement in the presence of the jury infringed upon the privilege against self-incrimination,\" we review the \"denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gabriele,</i> 63 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The connection between Bryan's testimony about the DEA's post-arrest \"attempt[] to have Mr. And&#250;jar . . . get on board\" and And&#250;jar's election to remain silent is tenuous at best. The question posed by the government &#8212; asking Bryan how and for what purpose he had used And&#250;jar's cell phone &#8212; did not call for such testimony. On its face, the testimony itself does not explicitly suggest that And&#250;jar refused to talk to police, nor does it state whether the DEA's \"attempt\" was ultimately successful. <i>See Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 12 (finding no <i>Doyle</i> violation where there \"was no testimony as to whether [the co-defendant] responded to [the defendant's] suggestion by remaining silent and there was no testimony about either party remaining silent in the face of questioning\"). Nor did the government make \"a point of asking the jury to draw a negative inference from\" the attempt to get And&#250;jar \"on board.\" <i>United States v. Daoud,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440090\"><a href=\"/opinion/440090/united-states-v-suzan-joseph-daoud/\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 482 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming the jury made the connection And&#250;jar fears, viewing the totality of the circumstances, we do not perceive a violation of constitutional magnitude. In a recent habeas case, we recognized that in cases involving testimony concerning a defendant's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence, where the trial court promptly addresses the improper testimony \"in an instruction to disregard and/or strike from the record, there may not necessarily be a <i>Doyle</i> violation because the government has not been permitted to `use' the defendant's silence against him.\" <i>Ellen v.

In <i>Ellen,</i> a government witness, responding to a seemingly innocuous question from the prosecutor, testified concerning the defendant's election not to speak to the police. <i>Id.</i> at 7. The defendant immediately objected and the trial court sustained the objection, struck the testimony, and delivered a curative instruction. <i>Id.</i> at 8. In light of the surrounding circumstances, we ruled that there was no constitutional violation. <i>See id.</i> at 12-14. Important to our consideration were the facts that the defendant's \"post-<i>Miranda</i> silence was not mentioned, by either the prosecutor or a witness, after the judge sustained the objection[,]\" the government's questions \"did not, on their face, call for testimony in violation of <i>Doyle,</i>\" and the court promptly delivered curative instructions that \"were proportional to the\" offensive testimony. <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same factors are present here. The district court sustained And&#250;jar's objection and struck the offending testimony from the record. Following And&#250;jar's objection, no further questions or testimony alluded to his silence and the government made no comment on his silence in closing arguments. Additionally, the jury was instructed, both at the beginning of the trial and after the close of evidence, that it must not consider any testimony stricken from the record. Following closing arguments, the court, at And&#250;jar's request, again emphasized this point, reminding the jury \"that any testimony that you may have seen or heard and that I have excluded from evidence, and instructed you to disregard, is not evidence.\" The court also instructed the jury that And&#250;jar has a \"constitutional right not to testify and no inference of guilt or of anything else, may be drawn from the fact that he did not testify. For any of you to draw such an inference would be wrong, indeed it would be a violation of your oath as a juror.\" And&#250;jar presents no sound reason to discard \"the customary presumption that juries follow their instructions.\" <i>Gabriele,</i> 63 F.3d at 70; <i>see also Ellen,</i> 475 F.3d at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that we should view the challenged day four testimony in context with the previous improper testimony. And&#250;jar argues that the government purposefully elicited Bryan's improper testimony and the district court should have considered the cumulative effect of all the improper testimony. First, as noted above, we disagree that the government purposefully sought to elicit testimony about And&#250;jar exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege. Additionally, it bears emphasizing that this court reviews alleged errors of the district court, not errors of the prosecution, and the district court is not charged with advocating for the defense or anticipating issues not brought to the fore by counsel. <i>Cf. United States v. McIntosh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201215\"><a href=\"/opinion/201215/united-states-v-mcintosh/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 555 (1st Cir.2004). And&#250;jar never referred the court to the most objectionable testimony directly relating to his <i>Miranda</i> assertion. He only objected to the ambiguous and considerably less striking \"on board\" testimony. In such circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying And&#250;jar's motion for a mistrial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Improper Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar challenges three comments made by the government in closing arguments. First, at the end of his initial summation, the prosecutor stated, \"I feel comfortable and the United States feels comfortable that they have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that this man delivered five kilograms of cocaine between the 20 and 23 of September.\" Day Five Tr. at 39. In rebuttal, the prosecutor argued, inter alia, that And&#250;jar and Cancel \"conspired to distribute five kilograms of cocaine, it does not matter where it came from. He gave it to Freddy Cancel. That is what matters. I have proven it, absolutely. We have met our burden.\" <i>Id.</i> at 59. Finally, in his last words to the jury, the prosecutor urged, \"[y]ou find him guilty, you uphold the law, your duty as jurors, make the logical choice and come back with one answer, and telling this man, Richard And&#250;jar you are guilty. Thank you.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And&#250;jar argues that the first two remarks were improper because they amounted to \"affirmations of [the prosecutor's] personal belief\" that And&#250;jar is guilty. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez Vargas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"347072\"><a href=\"/opinion/347072/united-states-v-miguel-gonzalez-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span>, 632-33 (1st Cir. 1977) (vacating a conviction where the prosecutor stated his personal belief in summation). Further inflaming the jurors' passions, And&#250;jar argues, was the prosecutor's final exhortation to the jurors to do \"your duty.\" <i>See United States v. Mandelbaum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"477965\"><a href=\"/opinion/477965/united-states-v-bridget-m-mandelbaum/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir. 1986) (finding improper the suggestion that a jury has \"a duty to decide one way or the other\" because such an appeal \"can only distract a jury from its actual duty: impartiality\"). And&#250;jar contends that the severity of these comments warrants a new trial. The government concedes that the comments were improper, but argues that a new trial is unnecessary because it is not reasonably likely these isolated remarks affected the outcome of the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since And&#250;jar did not object to the prosecutor's remarks at trial, we may only review for plain error. <i>See United States v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200345\"><a href=\"/opinion/200345/united-states-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 105 (1st Cir. 2003). The government explicitly concedes error and implicitly concedes that the error was plain. Nevertheless, as we have already noted above, <i>see supra</i> 558-59, 560 n. 3, the record, viewed in the aggregate, presents overwhelming evidence establishing And&#250;jar's guilt. In such circumstances, we are compelled to conclude that the prosecutor's improper remarks did not \"so poison[ ] the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's convictions are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the court had ruled that any testimony referring to co-defendant Cancel's \"cooperation\" with law enforcement was overly prejudicial and misleading because Cancel ultimately chose not to cooperate and not to testify at And&#250;jar's trial. The government was ordered to instruct its witnesses not to characterize Cancel as a \"cooperator.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> And&#250;jar does not argue that his waiver was not made knowingly and voluntarily</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We recognize that, unlike in<i>Ellen,</i> some testimony concerning And&#250;jar's silence was ultimately submitted to the jury. But this state of affairs came about only because of defense counsel's inattention. Once apprised of the problem, the district court acted promptly and reasonably to correct it. We further add that, even under the stricter form of harmless error review applicable to constitutional errors, the government has established beyond any reasonable doubt that the verdict was not influenced by the references to And&#250;jar's <i>Miranda</i> election. <i>United States v. Coker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201985\"><a href=\"/opinion/201985/united-states-v-coker/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2005). Based on the overwhelming evidence establishing And&#250;jar's guilt, we are confident that the verdict would have been the same even in the absence of the improper testimony. <i>Id.; see supra</i> at 558-59.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The government also argues that And&#250;jar's counsel interjected her own personal opinion in her summation and thereby \"neutraliz[ed] the harm flowing from the prosecutor's remarks.\"<i>United States v.
