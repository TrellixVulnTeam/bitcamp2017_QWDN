In   this   insurance     case,\n\nAmerican Home Assurance Co. (\"American\") seeks to recover pursuant\n\nto an insurance policy that First Specialty Insurance Corporation\n\n(\"First Specialty\") issued to Maine Coast Marine Construction, Inc.\n\n(\"MCMC\").       The case presents us with two questions: (1) whether a\n\n\"watercraft\" exclusion in the policy First Specialty issued to MCMC\n\napplies to a barge being pulled by a tug and (2) whether Maine law\n\nwould bar all recovery if the barge is excluded, even though the\n\ntug is not excluded. The district court found the exclusion barred\n\nall recovery and granted summary judgment to First Specialty.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.    Background\n\n            For the purposes of summary judgment, the facts are as\n\nfollows.    Fore River Dock & Dredge, Inc. (\"FRDD\") hired MCMC to\n\ndeliver a construction barge, the DS64, to a site on the Merrimack\n\nRiver in Newburyport, MA, using a tug, the Seawind II.                               On\n\nDecember 11, 2002, Guy Splettstoesser, an employee and part-owner\n\nof MCMC, set out from Gloucester, MA, using the tug to push the\n\nbarge.     On     account       of        deteriorating      weather      conditions,\n\nSplettstoesser went from pushing the DS64 with the Seawind II to\n\ntowing it using a cable.             As he attempted to maneuver the tug and\n\nbarge to enter the Merrimack River, strong winds pushed the barge\n\nalongside   the     tug   and    then       pushed   both    out    of   the   channel,\n\ngrounding them on Plum Island.\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\f            First Specialty had issued an insurance policy to MCMC,\n\nthe company that was actually operating the Seawind II as it towed\n\nthe DS64.    American had issued an insurance policy to FRDD, the\n\ncompany that hired MCMC to deliver the barge.           As a result of a\n\nsettlement    with    FRDD,   American     has    incurred    expenses    of\n\napproximately    $372,000.      In    response,    American    obtained    a\n\nsettlement from MCMC and Splettstoesser in a subrogation suit that\n\nAmerican brought on behalf of FRDD. MCMC and Splettstoesser agreed\n\nto judgment being entered in favor of American against themselves\n\nin the amount of approximately $372,000, providing, however, that\n\nAmerican would seek to collect the money from First Specialty,\n\nMCMC's insurer.      First Specialty then sought declaratory relief\n\nagainst American to the effect that it was not liable for these\n\ndamages.\n\n            Through this procedural history, American now stands in\n\nthe shoes of MCMC and seeks to recover on MCMC's insurance policy\n\nwith First Specialty.     This policy obliges First Specialty to pay\n\ndamages that MCMC is legally obligated to pay because of \"bodily\n\ninjury\" or \"property damage\" resulting from an \"occurrence.\"              An\n\n\"occurrence\" is defined in the policy as \"an accident, including\n\ncontinuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general\n\nharmful conditions.\"    The policy contains the following exclusion:\n\n            2. Exclusions\n            This insurance does not apply to:\n            ...\n            g. Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           \"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising\n           out of the ownership, maintenance, use or\n           entrustment to others of any aircraft, \"auto\"\n           or watercraft owned or operated by or rented\n           or loaned to any insured. Use includes\n           operation and \"loading or unloading\".\n           This exclusion does not apply to:\n           (1) A watercraft while ashore on premises you\n           own or rent;\n           (2) A watercraft you do not own that is:\n                  (a) Less than 26 feet long; and\n                  (b) Not being used to carry persons or\n                        property for a charge[.]\n\n           The tug, the Seawind II, is 25.5 feet long, and it is\n\nundisputedly not excluded.    The barge, the DS64, is 150 feet long.\n\nThe DS64 served as a floating platform for marine construction\n\nprojects, similar to floating docks common at marinas.                The DS64\n\ntraveled   through   the   water   to     arrive   where   it   was    needed.\n\nThereafter, it served as a floating work platform.          The DS64 had no\n\nmotorized propeller or means of self-propulsion, but relied on\n\ntugboats to move and position it.          Furthermore, the DS64 had no\n\nmeans of steering or navigating, no crew, and was not required to\n\nbe, nor was it, inspected by or registered with the United States\n\nCoast Guard.   Neither the tug nor the barge were used to ferry\n\npersons or property for a charge.\n\n                            II.    Discussion\n\n           On appeal of grants of summary judgment, we apply de novo\n\nreview to any legal issues and to the question of whether there\n\nexists a genuine dispute of material fact requiring a trial.               New\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fEng. Surfaces v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 546 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).\n\n          Though a shipwreck figures in this case, the policy at\n\nissue is a general commercial liability policy and the case comes\n\nbefore us under our diversity jurisdiction, not under our maritime\n\njurisdiction.   There is no dispute that we must apply Maine law to\n\nresolve the two issues in this appeal.\n\n          A.    Does the watercraft exclusion apply to the DS64?\n\n          Maine law on insurance policy interpretation can be set\n\nforth as follows:\n\n          Whether   a   given  insurance   contract   is\n          ambiguous is a question of law for the court.\n          \"The language of a contract of insurance is\n          ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of\n          different interpretations.\" In addition, \"[a]\n          policy is ambiguous if an ordinary person in\n          the shoes of the insured would not understand\n          that the policy did not cover claims such as\n          those brought . . . .\"     Nevertheless, \"the\n          court must interpret unambiguous language in a\n          contract according to its plain and commonly\n          accepted meaning.\" Finally, in determining\n          whether an insurance contract is ambiguous,\n          the long-standing rule in Maine requires an\n          evaluation of the instrument as a whole.\n\n          A contract of insurance, like any other\n          contract, is to be construed in accordance\n          with the intention of the parties, which is to\n          be ascertained from an examination of the\n          whole instrument. All parts and clauses must\n          be considered together that it may be seen if\n          and how far one clause is explained, modified,\n          limited or controlled by the others.\n\nApgar v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 683 A.2d 497, 498 (Me. 1996)\n\n(quoting Me. Drilling & Blasting, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 665\n\n                                 -5-\n\fA.2d 671, 674-75 (Me. 1995)) (alterations in original) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n                   1.     The DS64 is a watercraft.\n\n            The first question we must confront is the meaning of the\n\nterm \"watercraft.\"      First, it cannot be reasonably questioned that\n\na watercraft is a craft for use in or on water.       And we can see no\n\nreason to disagree with the district court's conclusion, made after\n\nconsultation with the Oxford English Dictionary, that \"craft,\" in\n\nthis context, refers to vessels of all kinds for water carriage.\n\nFirst Specialty Ins. Corp. v. Me. Coast Marine Constr., Inc., 532\n\nF. Supp. 2d 188, 196 n.5 (D. Me. 2008) (citing 3 Oxford English\n\nDictionary 1104, \"craft\" meaning V (2d ed. 1989) [hereinafter\n\nOED]); see also 19 OED 992, \"watercraft\" def. 2 (defining the term\n\nas a \"vessel that plies on the water; such vessels collectively\").\n\nUnder this definition, it would be plain and commonly accepted that\n\nthe DS64, which is a vessel for use in the water, and which moved\n\nacross water to reach its destination, was a watercraft.         See 19\n\nOED 574, \"vessel\" def. 4 (defining \"vessel\" as \"[a]ny structure\n\ndesigned to float upon and traverse the water for the carriage of\n\npersons or goods; a craft or ship of any kind, now usually one\n\nlarger than a rowing-boat and often restricted to sea-going craft\n\nor those plying upon the larger rivers or lakes.\").\n\n            Though no Maine case addresses the meaning of this term,\n\npersuasive    precedent    from   other   jurisdictions   supports   this\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fconclusion.     See, e.g., Terra Res., Inc. v. Lake Charles Dredging\n\n& Towing, Inc., 695 F.2d 828, 831 n.7 (5th Cir. 1983) (noting that\n\na watercraft \"exclusion clearly applies to the movements of the\n\nbarges themselves,\" but allowing recovery on other grounds); Pa.\n\nNat'l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. S. State, Inc., No. 07-2989, 2008 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 98456, at *22-23 (D.N.J. Dec. 3, 2008) (holding, on\n\nsummary judgment, that \"[a]lthough a work-barge is not used in the\n\nsame way as most other watercraft, and although it serves important\n\nmining functions in addition to water transport, it is nonetheless\n\nclearly within the meaning of 'watercraft' contemplated by the\n\ninsurance policy.\"); Henry v. S. La. Sugars Coop., Inc., 957 So. 2d\n\n1275, 1278-79 (La. 2007) (finding, on summary judgment, no coverage\n\nunder a watercraft exclusion for a docked barge); Sloan Steel\n\nErectors & Equip.

App.   Div.     1990)   (per   curiam)   (\"[A]\n\n12-foot-by-31-foot barge is a 'watercraft.'\"); see also Illinois v.\n\nKentucky, 500 U.S. 380, 386 (1991) (concluding that Kentucky's\n\nevidence of taxation \"of barges and other watercraft\" failed to\n\nestablish its territorial claims against Illinois).\n\n             Cases suggesting otherwise are easily distinguishable in\n\nthat they involve the land-based use of a barge or its equipment.\n\nSee Consol. Am. Ins. Co. v. Mike Soper Marine Servs., 951 F.2d 186,\n\n189 (9th Cir. 1991) (finding \"ambiguity in the word watercraft\" in\n\nthe context of deciding that a watercraft exception did not apply\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fwhen a barge-mounted crane amputated an arm);            Ison v. Roof, 698\n\nF.2d   294,    298   (6th   Cir.   1983)    (finding   coverage   despite   a\n\nwatercraft exclusion where a pleasure boat struck a work barge\n\ndocked at a coal conveyor facility, since the policy showed it was\n\nintended to cover the work done at such a facility and since the\n\nbarge \"was used as a base for the conveyor and was not intended to\n\nbe used and was not being used as a transportation vessel\"); Ayers\n\nv. C&D Gen. Contractors, 237 F. Supp. 2d 764, 770 (W.D. Ky. 2002)\n\n(relying on the above two cases to find coverage where a crane\n\nmounted on a barge collapsed, reasoning \"[t]he barge was not used\n\nfor transportation during Ayers's employment, it merely enabled\n\nwork underneath the docks\").\n\n              American argues that a watercraft must have its own means\n\nof propulsion.       But we see nothing in that term's plain meaning\n\nthat suggests such a limitation.             Further, the cases American\n\npoints to are inapposite.          American first relies on a nineteenth\n\ncentury British case, which it argues holds that a barge is not a\n\nvessel under a particular British law.             Blanford v. Morrison,\n\n(1850) 117 Eng. Rep. 633, 634-35 (Exch. Ch.).          But, the British law\n\nat issue regulated deliveries by a \"lighter, vessel, barge, or\n\nother craft\" and the opinion simply dealt with whether delivery by\n\ncoal brig met that definition.        Id.   Thus, this case does not speak\n\nto whether a barge is considered a watercraft.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f             American next relies on a Louisiana case in which the\n\ncourt found a barge was not a \"vessel\" under the relevant tax code.\n\nMallard Bay Drilling, Inc. v. Kennedy, 914 So. 2d 533, 545-49 (La.\n\n2005).      But, in that case, the statute dictated that result by\n\napplying one subsection to \"ships, vessels, or barges\" and the next\n\nonly   to   \"ships   or   vessels,\"   thereby   suggesting   a   deliberate\n\nomission of barges.       Id.   In fact, that decision made clear that\n\nits resolution of tax law was specialized and bore little relation\n\nto \"general provisions of the law.\"         Id. at 549.\n\n             Finally, American points to a unpublished case from\n\nMichigan to argue that a means of propulsion is required for\n\nsomething to be a watercraft.          Russian Am. Ass'n of Detroit v.\n\nHastings Mut. Ins. Co., No. 206086, 1999 Mich. App. LEXIS 1599, at\n\n*5 (Mich. Ct. App. Apr. 6, 1999).           There, in concluding that a\n\nrowboat accident was excluded under a watercraft exclusion, the\n\ncourt noted:\n\n             The dictionary definition of \"watercraft\" is\n             \"a boat or ship.\" A \"boat\" is \"a vessel for\n             transport by water, propelled by rowing,\n             sails, or a motor.\" Random House Webster's\n             College Dictionary, (1997). A rowboat is\n             clearly a watercraft within the common\n             definition of that term.\n\nId.    As is evident from this quotation, that court simply noted\n\nthat some boats have a source of propulsion.           That court easily\n\nconcluded that a rowboat was a watercraft and never considered the\n\nproblem of a barge.        Rather, it simply took one definition of\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f\"boat\" that met the facts in that case.     It is by no means clear\n\nthat to be a boat a vessel must be \"propelled by rowing, sails, or\n\na motor.\"    Further, though \"boats or ships\" fit the definition of\n\n\"watercraft,\" as we have described above, that term plainly also\n\nincludes vessels.     And so, if we felt the need to analogize to\n\nother terms and contexts in order to reach a result, we need look\n\nno further than the Supreme Court, which has rejected the idea that\n\na lack of propulsion prevents a barge from being considered a\n\nvessel.     Norton v. Warner Co., 321 U.S. 565, 571 (1944) (finding\n\nthat where \"vessel\" is defined as \"every description of watercraft\n\nor other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as\n\na means of transportation on water\", \"[a] barge is a vessel within\n\nthe meaning of the [Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation\n\nAct] even when it has no motive power of its own, since it is a\n\nmeans of transportation on water.\"), overruled on other grounds by\n\nMcDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U.S. 337 (1991).    Thus, we\n\nreject American's arguments that the broad term \"watercraft\" is\n\nlimited to vessels with a means of propulsion or is ambiguous.\n\n            American raises several other logical and evidentiary\n\narguments, which we address in turn. First, American points to the\n\ndistrict court's acknowledgment that \"there might be some room to\n\nquibble over whether a float or a barge tied to a dock or mooring\n\nmight fairly be regarded as a watercraft.\" First Specialty, 532 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 196.     American argues that since it would not make\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fsense for a barge to move in and out of coverage, an unmoored barge\n\nmust also not be a watercraft.          We reject this argument.         As our\n\nabove distinctions with Consolidated American, Ison, and Ayers\n\nsuggest, there may be valid reasons for concluding certain moored\n\nbarges being used for industrial purposes are not watercraft under\n\nan insurance policy where an injury results from a purely land-\n\nbased industrial use of the barge or its equipment.           But this does\n\nnot establish that all barges cease being watercraft when docked.\n\nThus, American's fear that barges will routinely move in and out of\n\ncoverage is not realized, and we have no need to abandon the plain\n\nmeaning of the term \"watercraft.\"\n\n            American   next   points     to   two   pieces   of    deposition\n\ntestimony to argue for its interpretation.          Specifically, American\n\nrelies on the testimony of Roger Hale, an owner of FRDD, and John\n\nNaughton,   an   alleged   agent   of   First   Specialty.        But,   \"[t]he\n\ninterpretation of an unambiguous contract 'must be determined from\n\nthe plain meaning of the language used and from the four corners of\n\nthe instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence.'\"              Am. Prot.\n\nIns. Co. v. Acadia Ins. Co.,       814 A.2d 989, 993 (Me. 2003) (quoting\n\nPortland Valve Inc. v. Rockwood Sys. Corp., 460 A.2d 1383, 1387\n\n(Me. 1983)).     Thus, we need not consider this testimony.          American\n\ncontends that we should nonetheless consider the testimony of Mr.\n\nNaughton to be a significant admission against interest.             American\n\nclaims that Naughton stated that \"watercraft\" referred to floating\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fobjects   that   had    a    means   of    propulsion.       But   American   has\n\nmischaracterized the record.          In the relevant excerpt, Naughton\n\nstates that he \"would say a watercraft is any waterborne vessel,\n\nflotation device, probably should have them propulsion of some\n\nkind, or able to be propelled in some way, but it's got to be\n\nsomething that's used on the water\" (emphasis added).                Thus, even\n\nif Naughton was First Specialty's agent, a proposition which is\n\ndisputed, he did not admit that a watercraft must have its own\n\nmeans of propulsion, but only that it must be able to be propelled.\n\nThe DS64 clearly can be propelled, and was so propelled through\n\nforce applied to it by the Seawind II.\n\n           Finally,     American     contends     that   a   question   on    the\n\ninsurance application reveals that watercraft are distinct from\n\nfloats, since that application asks the insured to identify all\n\n\"watercraft . . . and floats.\"            But this conjunctive phrasing does\n\nnot indicate that the terms are exclusive and does not overcome the\n\nunambiguous meaning we have described above.\n\n                   2.       Splettstoesser was operating the DS64.\n\n           Having established that the DS64 was a watercraft, we\n\nmust ask whether it was a \"watercraft owned or operated by or\n\nrented or loaned to\" the insured.            It is undisputed that MCMC did\n\nnot own the DS64, and First Specialty has not contended that MCMC\n\nrented or was loaned the barge.               Thus, we must decide whether\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fmoving the barge by application of force created by the Seawind II\n\nconstituted operation.\n\n           Relying on the plain meaning of the term, we conclude\n\nthat Splettstoesser was operating the DS64 using the Seawind II.\n\n\"Operation\" plainly includes manipulation by application of an\n\nexterior force.     For example, definitions of \"operate\" in the\n\nOxford English Dictionary include \"exercise force or influence,\n\nproduce an effect, act, work,\" \"[t]o bring force or influence to\n\nbear on or upon,\" \"[t]o effect or produce by action or the exertion\n\nof force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work,\" and \"[t]o\n\ndirect   the   working   of,   to   manage,   conduct,   work   (a   railway,\n\nbusiness, etc.)\".    See 10 OED 847-48, \"operate\" defs. 1, 2, 5, and\n\n7 (emphasis in original).      There is no ambiguity here since it can\n\nfairly and plainly be said that Splettstoesser was exercising force\n\nto produce an effect on the DS64 and direct its functioning.              In\n\nfact, Splettstoesser's deposition establishes that he maneuvered\n\nthe Seawind II in such a manner as to allow the DS64 to properly\n\nturn behind him.\n\n           American argues that one would not say that pulling a\n\nwaterskier or a log constitutes operation.           But a waterskier is\n\ndistinguishable by virtue of the fact that his or her functioning\n\nis also controlled by independent volition. Further, we do believe\n\nthat pulling a log constitutes operating on the log, just as\n\npulling a trailer using a truck would be operating the trailer.\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fAmerican also points to a federal statute that regulates tugboat\n\noperators, noting that it imposes no restriction based on what is\n\npulled.    See 46 U.S.C. § 8904(a).          But it was never disputed that\n\na tugboat pilot is operating the tugboat.               That such operation is\n\nregulated by statute, whereas operation of pulled vessels is not\n\nregulated,      does    not   establish   that    pulling    a   vessel    is   not\n\noperating that vessel.            Thus, we see no ambiguity in the term\n\n\"operated by\" and conclude that Splettstoesser was operating the\n\nDS64.\n\n               In light of these holdings regarding the plain meaning of\n\nthe terms \"watercraft\" and \"operated by,\" we need not take recourse\n\nto guessing the intent of the parties.              Nonetheless, we pause to\n\nnote    that    this    holding   comports   with   such    likely   intent,    as\n\nascertained      from    an   examination    of   the   whole    policy,   as   is\n\npermitted by Maine law.            The purpose of the policy was not to\n\nprovide blanket coverage of the tugboat, but rather to provide\n\ngeneral commercial liability insurance in the event of certain\n\naccidents. The clear purpose of a watercraft exclusion is to limit\n\nthe scope of the risk of such insurance, so as to avoid the greater\n\nfinancial risk arising from accidents involving larger watercraft.\n\nThough the operation of a tug alone might not entail such risks,\n\nthe risks of financial loss from a maritime accident clearly\n\nincreased when the tug and barge were joined and operated together.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fThus, our reading of these contested terms comports with the likely\n\nintent of the policy.\n\n           For all these reasons, we conclude that MCMC's operation\n\nof the barge fits within the watercraft exclusion of the policy.\n\n           B.    Can American recover under the theory that the\n                 Seawind II was responsible for the loss?\n\n           American argues that even if the barge is excluded, the\n\nfact that the tug is not excluded means that some recovery should\n\nbe had for any and all damages that were caused by operation of the\n\ntugboat. But this argument misreads the language of the exclusion.\n\nThe exclusion provides that insurance does not apply to bodily\n\ninjury or property damage caused by an occurrence arising from the\n\noperation of a watercraft.      It is true that the exclusion does not\n\napply to certain watercraft, including the Seawind II.               American\n\nargues   that   this   exception   to   the    exclusion   means   that    \"all\n\nproperty damage arising out of . . . the use and operation of the\n\nSeawind II is covered by the Policy.\"           This is plainly illogical.\n\nSimply because accidents arising from the use of the Seawind II are\n\nnot excluded does not mean that any accident involving the Seawind\n\nII is automatically covered.         Rather, if such an accident also\n\narose from the use of the DS64, it would not be covered.\n\n           The question we must ask then is whether the wreck arose\n\nout of the operation of the DS64.       In evaluating this question, the\n\ndistrict   court   concluded,      \"[i]n      operating    the   tugboat    Mr.\n\nSplettstoesser operated the barge as well and this incident would\n\n                                    -15-\n\fnot have occurred but for the presence of the barge and the peril\n\ncreated by Mr. Splettstoesser's attempt to convey it down the\n\nchannel into the Merrimack River.\"           First Specialty, 532 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 197.    Though American argues that this is an improper test of\n\ncausation in this circumstance, we see it instead as a conclusion\n\nthat the accident arose out of the joint operation of the Seawind\n\nII and the DS64.     For the reasons stated above, we agree with this\n\nconclusion.      The record   shows that Splettstoesser navigated the\n\ntug with concern for its effect on the barge, that he lost control\n\nof the barge, and that both vessels were then grounded.                 Thus,\n\nAmerican is not entitled to recover for damages to the Seawind II,\n\nthe DS64, or the cleanup costs, as all of these arose from the\n\naccidental occurrence involving the operation of the DS64.\n\n             American attempts to avoid this conclusion by encouraging\n\nus to apply the efficient proximate cause doctrine. \"The efficient\n\nproximate cause rule operates to permit coverage when an insured\n\nperil sets other excluded perils into motion which 'in an unbroken\n\nsequence and connection between the act and final loss, produce the\n\nresult for which recovery is sought.'\"         Kish v. Ins. Co. of N. Am.,\n\n883 P.2d 308, 311 (Wash. 1994) (quoting Graham v. Pub. Employees\n\nMut. Ins. Co., 656 P.2d 1077, 1081 (Wash. 1983)).               \"In such a\n\nsituation, the insured peril is considered the 'proximate cause' of\n\nthe entire loss and the loss is covered despite the fact that the\n\nother   perils    contributing   to    the   loss   were   excluded.\"    Id.\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f(footnote omitted); see also Fajardo Shopping Ctr., S.E. v. Sun\n\nAlliance Ins. Co., 167 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             Under this doctrine, American argues that the operation\n\nof the tugboat was, as a matter of law, the efficient proximate\n\ncause of the occurrence, or, in the alternative, that a jury should\n\nbe permitted to so find.                   American further contends that the\n\ndistrict court erred by (1) analyzing \"but for\" causation rather\n\nthan proximate causation and (2) effectively concluding that the\n\nbarge was the sole cause of the accident.                      We disagree.\n\n             First, it is not clear that Maine courts apply this\n\ndoctrine or that the doctrine is even applicable to the kind of\n\ngeneral liability insurance at issue. But we need not decide these\n\nquestions    of    law        since   we    agree      with    the    district    court's\n\nconclusion    that       application        of     the    doctrine     would     not   save\n\nAmerican.         The    efficient         proximate      cause      doctrine    is    only\n\napplicable where the causes are independent.                      Tento Int'l, Inc. v.\n\nState Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 222 F.3d 660, 662 n.2 (9th Cir.\n\n2000)(\"For the efficient proximate cause theory to apply, . . .\n\nthere must be two separate or distinct perils which 'could each,\n\nunder some circumstances, have occurred independently of the other\n\nand caused damage.'\" (quoting Pieper v. Commercial Underwriters\n\nIns. Co., 69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 551, 557 (Cal. Ct. App. 1997))); Kish,\n\n883   P.2d    at    311.         Here,      the     undisputed       facts     show    that\n\nSplettstoesser          was    operating         the     tug   and    barge     together,\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\fmaneuvering the tug in such a way as to achieve the desired effect\n\non the barge.   There is no way in which his operation of the tug\n\nand his operation of the barge could be thought of as independent\n\ncauses of the accident.    Cf. Terra Res., 695 F.2d at 831 (finding\n\nfor the insured owners of a barge where a defective mooring caused\n\ndamage, concluding that the damage would still have occurred\n\nindependent of the fact that the insured owned the barge).      The\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the accident would not have\n\noccurred \"but for\" the presence of the barge is just another way of\n\nstating this conclusion.     Thus, though the efficient proximate\n\ncause doctrine might be applicable in other circumstances, it does\n\nnot apply on these facts.    Nor is there a question for the jury.\n\nIf some independent cause, say a lightning strike to the tugboat,\n\nhad caused damage, the jury might be called on to parse which cause\n\nwas primarily responsible for the occurrence. But here, the record\n\nindisputably shows that the joint operation of the tug and barge\n\nled to the wreck, which caused all damages for which American now\n\nseeks to recover.\n\n                          III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the summary judgment entered\n\nin favor of First Specialty against American is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

(\"American\") seeks to recover pursuant to an insurance policy that First Specialty Insurance Corporation (\"First Specialty\") issued to Maine Coast Marine Construction, Inc. (\"MCMC\"). The case presents us with two questions: (1) whether a \"watercraft\" exclusion in the policy First Specialty issued to MCMC applies to a barge being pulled by a tug and (2) whether Maine law would bar all recovery if the barge is excluded, even though the tug is not excluded. The district court found the exclusion barred all recovery and granted summary judgment to First Specialty. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of summary judgment, the facts are as follows. Fore River Dock &amp; Dredge, Inc. (\"FRDD\") hired MCMC to deliver a construction barge, the DS64, to a site on the Merrimack River in Newburyport, MA, using a tug, the Seawind II. On December 11, 2002, Guy Splettstoesser, an employee and part-owner of MCMC, set out from Gloucester, MA, using the tug to push the barge. On account of deteriorating weather conditions, Splettstoesser went from pushing the DS64 with the Seawind II to towing it using a cable. As he attempted to maneuver the tug and barge to enter the Merrimack River, strong winds pushed the barge alongside the tug and then pushed both out of the channel, grounding them on Plum Island.</p>\n<p>First Specialty had issued an insurance policy to MCMC, the company that was actually operating the Seawind II as it towed the DS64. American had issued an insurance policy to FRDD, the company that hired MCMC to deliver the barge. As a result of a settlement with FRDD, American has incurred expenses of approximately $372,000. In response, American obtained a settlement from MCMC and Splettstoesser in a subrogation suit that American brought on behalf of FRDD. MCMC and Splettstoesser agreed to judgment being entered in favor of American against themselves in the amount of approximately $372,000, providing, however, that American would seek to collect the money from First Specialty, MCMC's insurer. First Specialty then sought declaratory relief against American to the effect that it was not liable for these damages.</p>\n<p>Through this procedural history, American now stands in the shoes of MCMC and seeks to recover on MCMC's insurance policy with First Specialty. This policy obliges First Specialty to pay damages that MCMC is legally obligated to pay because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" resulting from an \"occurrence.\" An \"occurrence\" is defined in the policy as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" The policy contains the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote>2. Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>g. Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, \"auto\" or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured. Use includes operation and \"loading or unloading\".</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This exclusion does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) A watercraft while ashore on premises you own or rent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) A watercraft you do not own that is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) Less than 26 feet long; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) Not being used to carry persons or property for a charge[.]</blockquote>\n<p>The tug, the Seawind II, is 25.5 feet long, and it is undisputedly not excluded. The barge, the DS64, is 150 feet long. The DS64 served as a floating platform for marine construction projects, similar to floating docks common at marinas. The DS64 traveled through the water to arrive where it was needed. Thereafter, it served as a floating work platform. The DS64 had no motorized propeller or means of self-propulsion, but relied on tugboats to move and position it. Furthermore, the DS64 had no means of steering or navigating, no crew, and was not required to be, nor was it, inspected by or registered with the United States Coast Guard. Neither the tug nor the barge were used to ferry persons or property for a charge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On appeal of grants of summary judgment, we apply <i>de novo</i> review to any legal issues and to the question of whether there exists a genuine dispute of material fact requiring a trial. <i>New Eng. Surfaces v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 546 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Though a shipwreck figures in this case, the policy at issue is a general commercial liability policy and the case comes before us under our diversity jurisdiction, not under our maritime jurisdiction. There is no dispute that we must apply Maine law to resolve the two issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Does the watercraft exclusion apply to the DS64?</h2>\n<p>Maine law on insurance policy interpretation can be set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Whether a given insurance contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. \"The language of a contract of insurance is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.\" In addition, \"[a] policy is ambiguous if an ordinary person in the shoes of the insured would not understand that the policy did not cover claims such as those brought....\" Nevertheless, \"the court must interpret unambiguous language in a contract according to its plain and commonly accepted meaning.\" Finally, in determining whether an insurance contract is ambiguous, the long-standing rule in Maine requires an evaluation of the instrument as a whole. A contract of insurance, like any other contract, is to be construed in accordance with the intention of the parties, which is to be ascertained from an examination of the whole instrument. All parts and clauses must be considered together that it may be seen if and how far one clause is explained, modified, limited or controlled by the others.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Apgar v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> 683 A.2d 497, 498 (Me.1996) (quoting <i>Me. Drilling &amp; Blasting, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 665 A.2d 671, 674-75 (Me.1995)) (alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The DS64 is a watercraft.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The first question we must confront is the meaning of the term \"watercraft.\" First, it cannot be reasonably questioned that a watercraft is a craft for use in or on water. And we can see no reason to disagree with the district court's conclusion, made after consultation with the Oxford English Dictionary, that \"craft,\" in this context, refers to vessels of all kinds for water carriage. <i>First Specialty Ins. Corp. v. Me. Coast Marine Constr., Inc.,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d 188, 196 n. 5 (D.Me.2008) (citing 3 <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> 1104, \"craft\" meaning V (2d ed.1989) [hereinafter <i>OED</i>]); <i>see also</i> 19 <i>OED</i> 992, \"watercraft\" def. 2 (defining the term as a \"vessel that plies on the water; such vessels collectively\"). Under this definition, it would be plain and commonly accepted that the DS64, which is a vessel for use in the water, and which moved across water to reach its destination, was a watercraft. <i>See</i> 19 <i>OED</i> 574, \"vessel\" def. 4 (defining \"vessel\" as \"[a]ny structure designed to float upon and traverse the water for the carriage of persons or goods; a craft or ship of any kind, now usually one larger than a rowing-boat and often restricted to sea-going craft or those plying upon the larger rivers or lakes.\").</p>\n<p>Though no Maine case addresses the meaning of this term, persuasive precedent from other jurisdictions supports this conclusion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Terra Res., Inc. v. Lake Charles Dredging &amp; Towing, Inc.,</i> 695 F.2d 828, 831 n. 7 (5th Cir.1983) (noting that a watercraft \"exclusion clearly applies to the movements of the barges themselves,\" but allowing recovery on other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> grounds); <i>Pa. Nat'l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. S. State, Inc.,</i> No. 07-2989, 2008 WL 5116207, at *7-8, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98456, at *22-23 (D.N.J. Dec. 3, 2008) (holding, on summary judgment, that \"[a]lthough a work-barge is not used in the same way as most other watercraft, and although it serves important mining functions in addition to water transport, it is nonetheless clearly within the meaning of `watercraft' contemplated by the insurance policy.\"); <i>Henry v. S. La. Sugars Coop., Inc.,</i> 957 So.2d 1275, 1278-79 (La.2007) (finding, on summary judgment, no coverage under a watercraft exclusion for a docked barge); <i>Sloan Steel Erectors &amp; Equip. Rental, Inc. v. Ill. Union Ins. Co.,</i> 158 A.D.2d 984, 551 N.Y.S.2d 136, 136 (N.Y.App.Div.1990) (per curiam) (\"[A] 12-foot-by-31-foot barge is a `watercraft.'\"); <i>see also </i><i>Illinois v. Kentucky,</i> 500 U.S. 380, 386, 111 S.Ct. 1877, 114 L.Ed.2d 420 (1991) (concluding that Kentucky's evidence of taxation \"of barges and other watercraft\" failed to establish its territorial claims against Illinois).</p>\n<p>Cases suggesting otherwise are easily distinguishable in that they involve the land-based use of a barge or its equipment. <i>See </i><i>Consol. Am. Ins. Co. v. Mike Soper Marine Servs.,</i> 951 F.2d 186, 189 (9th Cir. 1991) (finding \"ambiguity in the word watercraft\" in the context of deciding that a watercraft exception did not apply when a barge-mounted crane amputated an arm); <i>Ison v. Roof,</i> 698 F.2d 294, 298 (6th Cir. 1983) (finding coverage despite a watercraft exclusion where a pleasure boat struck a work barge docked at a coal conveyor facility, since the policy showed it was intended to cover the work done at such a facility and since the barge \"was used as a base for the conveyor and was not intended to be used and was not being used as a transportation vessel\"); <i>Ayers v. C &amp; D Gen. Contractors,</i> 237 F.Supp.2d 764, 770 (W.D.Ky.2002) (relying on the above two cases to find coverage where a crane mounted on a barge collapsed, reasoning \"[t]he barge was not used for transportation during Ayers's employment, it merely enabled work underneath the docks\").</p>\n<p>American argues that a watercraft must have its own means of propulsion. But we see nothing in that term's plain meaning that suggests such a limitation. Further, the cases American points to are inapposite. American first relies on a nineteenth century British case, which it argues holds that a barge is not a vessel under a particular British law. <i>Blanford v. Morrison,</i> (1850) 117 Eng. Rep. 633, 634-35 (Exch. Ch.). But, the British law at issue regulated deliveries by a \"lighter, vessel, barge, or other craft\" and the opinion simply dealt with whether delivery by coal brig met that definition. <i>Id.</i> Thus, this case does not speak to whether a barge is considered a watercraft.</p>\n<p>American next relies on a Louisiana case in which the court found a barge was not a \"vessel\" under the relevant tax code. <i>Mallard Bay Drilling, Inc. v. Kennedy,</i> 914 So.2d 533, 545-49 (La.2005). But, in that case, the statute dictated that result by applying one subsection to \"ships, vessels, or barges\" and the next only to \"ships or vessels,\" thereby suggesting a deliberate omission of barges. <i>Id.</i> In fact, that decision made clear that its resolution of tax law was specialized and bore little relation to \"general provisions of the law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 549.</p>\n<p>Finally, American points to a unpublished case from Michigan to argue that a means of propulsion is required for something to be a watercraft. <i>Russian Am. Ass'n of Detroit v. Hastings Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> No. 206086, 1999 WL 33447402, at *2, 1999 Mich.App. LEXIS 1599, at *5 (Mich.Ct. App. Apr. 6, 1999). There, in concluding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> that a rowboat accident was excluded under a watercraft exclusion, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote>The dictionary definition of \"watercraft\" is \"a boat or ship.\" A \"boat\" is \"a vessel for transport by water, propelled by rowing, sails, or a motor.\" <i>Random House Webster's College Dictionary,</i> (1997). A rowboat is clearly a watercraft within the common definition of that term.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> As is evident from this quotation, that court simply noted that some boats have a source of propulsion. That court easily concluded that a rowboat was a watercraft and never considered the problem of a barge. Rather, it simply took one definition of \"boat\" that met the facts in that case. It is by no means clear that to be a boat a vessel must be \"propelled by rowing, sails, or a motor.\" Further, though \"boats or ships\" fit the definition of \"watercraft,\" as we have described above, that term plainly also includes vessels. And so, if we felt the need to analogize to other terms and contexts in order to reach a result, we need look no further than the Supreme Court, which has rejected the idea that a lack of propulsion prevents a barge from being considered a vessel. <i>Norton v. Warner Co.,</i> 321 U.S. 565, 571, 64 S.Ct. 747, 88 L.Ed. 931 (1944) (finding that where \"vessel\" is defined as \"every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water\", \"[a] barge is a vessel within the meaning of the [Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act] even when it has no motive power of its own, since it is a means of transportation on water.\"), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander,</i> 498 U.S. 337, 111 S.Ct. 807, 112 L.Ed.2d 866 (1991). Thus, we reject American's arguments that the broad term \"watercraft\" is limited to vessels with a means of propulsion or is ambiguous.</p>\n<p>American raises several other logical and evidentiary arguments, which we address in turn. First, American points to the district court's acknowledgment that \"there might be some room to quibble over whether a float or a barge tied to a dock or mooring might fairly be regarded as a watercraft.\" <i>First Specialty,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 196. American argues that since it would not make sense for a barge to move in and out of coverage, an unmoored barge must also not be a watercraft. We reject this argument. As our above distinctions with <i>Consolidated American, Ison,</i> and <i>Ayers</i> suggest, there may be valid reasons for concluding certain moored barges being used for industrial purposes are not watercraft under an insurance policy where an injury results from a purely land-based industrial use of the barge or its equipment. But this does not establish that all barges cease being watercraft when docked. Thus, American's fear that barges will routinely move in and out of coverage is not realized, and we have no need to abandon the plain meaning of the term \"watercraft.\"</p>\n<p>American next points to two pieces of deposition testimony to argue for its interpretation. Specifically, American relies on the testimony of Roger Hale, an owner of FRDD, and John Naughton, an alleged agent of First Specialty. But, \"[t]he interpretation of an unambiguous contract `must be determined from the plain meaning of the language used and from the four corners of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence.'\" <i>Am. Prot. Ins. Co. v. Acadia Ins. Co.,</i> 814 A.2d 989, 993 (Me. 2003) (quoting <i>Portland Valve Inc. v. Rockwood Sys. Corp.,</i> 460 A.2d 1383, 1387 (Me.1983)). Thus, we need not consider this testimony. American contends that we should nonetheless consider the testimony of Mr. Naughton to be a significant admission against interest. American <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> claims that Naughton stated that \"watercraft\" referred to floating objects that had a means of propulsion. But American has mischaracterized the record. In the relevant excerpt, Naughton states that he \"would say a watercraft is any waterborne vessel, flotation device, probably should have them propulsion of some kind, <i>or able to be propelled in some way,</i> but it's got to be something that's used on the water\" (emphasis added). Thus, even if Naughton was First Specialty's agent, a proposition which is disputed, he did not admit that a watercraft must have its own means of propulsion, but only that it must be able to be propelled. The DS64 clearly can be propelled, and was so propelled through force applied to it by the Seawind II.</p>\n<p>Finally, American contends that a question on the insurance application reveals that watercraft are distinct from floats, since that application asks the insured to identify all \"watercraft ... and floats.\" But this conjunctive phrasing does not indicate that the terms are exclusive and does not overcome the unambiguous meaning we have described above.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Splettstoesser was operating the DS64.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having established that the DS64 was a watercraft, we must ask whether it was a \"watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to\" the insured. It is undisputed that MCMC did not own the DS64, and First Specialty has not contended that MCMC rented or was loaned the barge. Thus, we must decide whether moving the barge by application of force created by the Seawind II constituted operation.</p>\n<p>Relying on the plain meaning of the term, we conclude that Splettstoesser was operating the DS64 using the Seawind II. \"Operation\" plainly includes manipulation by application of an exterior force. For example, definitions of \"operate\" in the Oxford English Dictionary include \"exercise force or influence, produce an effect, act, work,\" \"[t]o bring force or influence to bear <i>on</i> or <i>upon,</i>\" \"[t]o effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work,\" and \"[t]o direct the working of, to manage, conduct, work (a railway, business, etc.)\". <i>See</i> 10 <i>OED</i> 847-48, \"operate\" defs. 1, 2, 5, and 7 (emphasis in original). There is no ambiguity here since it can fairly and plainly be said that Splettstoesser was exercising force to produce an effect on the DS64 and direct its functioning. In fact, Splettstoesser's deposition establishes that he maneuvered the Seawind II in such a manner as to allow the DS64 to properly turn behind him.</p>\n<p>American argues that one would not say that pulling a waterskier or a log constitutes operation. But a waterskier is distinguishable by virtue of the fact that his or her functioning is also controlled by independent volition. Further, we do believe that pulling a log constitutes operating on the log, just as pulling a trailer using a truck would be operating the trailer. American also points to a federal statute that regulates tugboat operators, noting that it imposes no restriction based on what is pulled. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 8904(a). But it was never disputed that a tugboat pilot is operating the tugboat. That such operation is regulated by statute, whereas operation of pulled vessels is not regulated, does not establish that pulling a vessel is not operating that vessel. Thus, we see no ambiguity in the term \"operated by\" and conclude that Splettstoesser was operating the DS64.</p>\n<p>In light of these holdings regarding the plain meaning of the terms \"watercraft\" and \"operated by,\" we need not take recourse to guessing the intent of the parties. Nonetheless, we pause to note that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> this holding comports with such likely intent, as ascertained from an examination of the whole policy, as is permitted by Maine law. The purpose of the policy was not to provide blanket coverage of the tugboat, but rather to provide general commercial liability insurance in the event of certain accidents. The clear purpose of a watercraft exclusion is to limit the scope of the risk of such insurance, so as to avoid the greater financial risk arising from accidents involving larger watercraft. Though the operation of a tug alone might not entail such risks, the risks of financial loss from a maritime accident clearly increased when the tug and barge were joined and operated together. Thus, our reading of these contested terms comports with the likely intent of the policy.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, we conclude that MCMC's operation of the barge fits within the watercraft exclusion of the policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Can American recover under the theory that the Seawind II was responsible for the loss?</h2>\n<p>American argues that even if the barge is excluded, the fact that the tug is not excluded means that some recovery should be had for any and all damages that were caused by operation of the tugboat. But this argument misreads the language of the exclusion. The exclusion provides that insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence arising from the operation of a watercraft. It is true that the exclusion does not apply to certain watercraft, including the Seawind II. American argues that this exception to the exclusion means that \"all property damage arising out of... the use and operation of the <i>Seawind II</i> is covered by the Policy.\" This is plainly illogical. Simply because accidents arising from the use of the Seawind II are not excluded does not mean that any accident involving the Seawind II is automatically covered. Rather, if such an accident also arose from the use of the DS64, it would not be covered.</p>\n<p>The question we must ask then is whether the wreck arose out of the operation of the DS64. In evaluating this question, the district court concluded, \"[i]n operating the tugboat Mr. Splettstoesser operated the barge as well and this incident would not have occurred but for the presence of the barge and the peril created by Mr. Splettstoesser's attempt to convey it down the channel into the Merrimack River.\" <i>First Specialty,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 197. Though American argues that this is an improper test of causation in this circumstance, we see it instead as a conclusion that the accident arose out of the joint operation of the Seawind II and the DS64. For the reasons stated above, we agree with this conclusion. The record shows that Splettstoesser navigated the tug with concern for its effect on the barge, that he lost control of the barge, and that both vessels were then grounded. Thus, American is not entitled to recover for damages to the Seawind II, the DS64, or the cleanup costs, as all of these arose from the accidental occurrence involving the operation of the DS64.</p>\n<p>American attempts to avoid this conclusion by encouraging us to apply the efficient proximate cause doctrine. \"The efficient proximate cause rule operates to permit coverage when an insured peril sets other excluded perils into motion which `in an unbroken sequence and connection between the act and final loss, produce the result for which recovery is sought.'\" <i>Kish v. Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 125 Wash.2d 164, 883 P.2d 308, 311 (1994) (quoting <i>Graham v. Pub. Employees Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 98 Wash.2d 533, 656 P.2d 1077, 1081 (1983)). \"In such a situation, the insured peril is considered the `proximate cause' of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*105</span> entire loss and the loss is covered despite the fact that the other perils contributing to the loss were excluded.\" <i>Id.</i> (footnote omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Fajardo Shopping Ctr., S.E. v. Sun Alliance Ins. Co.,</i> 167 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Under this doctrine, American argues that the operation of the tugboat was, as a matter of law, the efficient proximate cause of the occurrence, or, in the alternative, that a jury should be permitted to so find. American further contends that the district court erred by (1) analyzing \"but for\" causation rather than proximate causation and (2) effectively concluding that the barge was the sole cause of the accident. We disagree.</p>\n<p>First, it is not clear that Maine courts apply this doctrine or that the doctrine is even applicable to the kind of general liability insurance at issue. But we need not decide these questions of law since we agree with the district court's conclusion that application of the doctrine would not save American. The efficient proximate cause doctrine is only applicable where the causes are independent. <i>Tento Int'l, Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.,</i> 222 F.3d 660, 662 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000)(\"For the efficient proximate cause theory to apply, ... there must be two separate or distinct perils which `could each, under some circumstances, have occurred independently of the other and caused damage.'\" (quoting <i>Pieper v. Commercial Underwriters Ins. Co.,</i> 59 Cal.App.4th 1008, 69 Cal. Rptr.2d 551, 557 (1997))); <i>Kish,</i> 883 P.2d at 311. Here, the undisputed facts show that Splettstoesser was operating the tug and barge together, maneuvering the tug in such a way as to achieve the desired effect on the barge. There is no way in which his operation of the tug and his operation of the barge could be thought of as independent causes of the accident. <i>Cf. </i><i>Terra Res.,</i> 695 F.2d at 831 (finding for the insured owners of a barge where a defective mooring caused damage, concluding that the damage would still have occurred independent of the fact that the insured owned the barge). The district court's conclusion that the accident would not have occurred \"but for\" the presence of the barge is just another way of stating this conclusion. Thus, though the efficient proximate cause doctrine might be applicable in other circumstances, it does not apply on these facts. Nor is there a question for the jury. If some independent cause, say a lightning strike to the tugboat, had caused damage, the jury might be called on to parse which cause was primarily responsible for the occurrence. But here, the record indisputably shows that the joint operation of the tug and barge led to the wreck, which caused all damages for which American now seeks to recover.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the summary judgment entered in favor of First Specialty against American is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",

(\"American\") seeks to recover pursuant to an insurance policy that First Specialty Insurance Corporation (\"First Specialty\") issued to Maine Coast Marine Construction, Inc. (\"MCMC\"). The case presents us with two questions: (1) whether a \"watercraft\" exclusion in the policy First Specialty issued to MCMC applies to a barge being pulled by a tug and (2) whether Maine law would bar all recovery if the barge is excluded, even though the tug is not excluded. The district court found the exclusion barred all recovery and granted summary judgment to First Specialty. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of summary judgment, the facts are as follows. Fore River Dock &amp; Dredge, Inc. (\"FRDD\") hired MCMC to deliver a construction barge, the DS64, to a site on the Merrimack River in Newburyport, MA, using a tug, the Seawind II. On December 11, 2002, Guy Splettstoesser, an employee and part-owner of MCMC, set out from Gloucester, MA, using the tug to push the barge. On account of deteriorating weather conditions, Splettstoesser went from pushing the DS64 with the Seawind II to towing it using a cable. As he attempted to maneuver the tug and barge to enter the Merrimack River, strong winds pushed the barge alongside the tug and then pushed both out of the channel, grounding them on Plum Island.</p>\n<p>First Specialty had issued an insurance policy to MCMC, the company that was actually operating the Seawind II as it towed the DS64. American had issued an insurance policy to FRDD, the company that hired MCMC to deliver the barge. As a result of a settlement with FRDD, American has incurred expenses of approximately $372,000. In response, American obtained a settlement from MCMC and Splettstoesser in a subrogation suit that American brought on behalf of FRDD. MCMC and Splettstoesser agreed to judgment being entered in favor of American against themselves in the amount of approximately $372,000, providing, however, that American would seek to collect the money from First Specialty, MCMC's insurer. First Specialty then sought declaratory relief against American to the effect that it was not liable for these damages.</p>\n<p>Through this procedural history, American now stands in the shoes of MCMC and seeks to recover on MCMC's insurance policy with First Specialty. This policy obliges First Specialty to pay damages that MCMC is legally obligated to pay because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" resulting from an \"occurrence.\" An \"occurrence\" is defined in the policy as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" The policy contains the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote>2. Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>g. Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, \"auto\" or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured. Use includes operation and \"loading or unloading\".</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This exclusion does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) A watercraft while ashore on premises you own or rent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) A watercraft you do not own that is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(a) Less than 26 feet long; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) Not being used to carry persons or property for a charge[.]</blockquote>\n<p>The tug, the Seawind II, is 25.5 feet long, and it is undisputedly not excluded. The barge, the DS64, is 150 feet long. The DS64 served as a floating platform for marine construction projects, similar to floating docks common at marinas. The DS64 traveled through the water to arrive where it was needed. Thereafter, it served as a floating work platform. The DS64 had no motorized propeller or means of self-propulsion, but relied on tugboats to move and position it. Furthermore, the DS64 had no means of steering or navigating, no crew, and was not required to be, nor was it, inspected by or registered with the United States Coast Guard. Neither the tug nor the barge were used to ferry persons or property for a charge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On appeal of grants of summary judgment, we apply <i>de novo</i> review to any legal issues and to the question of whether there exists a genuine dispute of material fact requiring a trial. <i>New Eng. Surfaces v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Though a shipwreck figures in this case, the policy at issue is a general commercial liability policy and the case comes before us under our diversity jurisdiction, not under our maritime jurisdiction. There is no dispute that we must apply Maine law to resolve the two issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Does the watercraft exclusion apply to the DS64?</h2>\n<p>Maine law on insurance policy interpretation can be set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Whether a given insurance contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. \"The language of a contract of insurance is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.\" In addition, \"[a] policy is ambiguous if an ordinary person in the shoes of the insured would not understand that the policy did not cover claims such as those brought....\" Nevertheless, \"the court must interpret unambiguous language in a contract according to its plain and commonly accepted meaning.\" Finally, in determining whether an insurance contract is ambiguous, the long-standing rule in Maine requires an evaluation of the instrument as a whole. A contract of insurance, like any other contract, is to be construed in accordance with the intention of the parties, which is to be ascertained from an examination of the whole instrument. All parts and clauses must be considered together that it may be seen if and how far one clause is explained, modified, limited or controlled by the others.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Apgar v.

And we can see no reason to disagree with the district court's conclusion, made after consultation with the Oxford English Dictionary, that \"craft,\" in this context, refers to vessels of all kinds for water carriage. <i>First Specialty Ins.

Under this definition, it would be plain and commonly accepted that the DS64, which is a vessel for use in the water, and which moved across water to reach its destination, was a watercraft. <i>See</i> 19 <i>OED</i> 574, \"vessel\" def. 4 (defining \"vessel\" as \"[a]ny structure designed to float upon and traverse the water for the carriage of persons or goods; a craft or ship of any kind, now usually one larger than a rowing-boat and often restricted to sea-going craft or those plying upon the larger rivers or lakes.\").</p>\n<p>Though no Maine case addresses the meaning of this term, persuasive precedent from other jurisdictions supports this conclusion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Terra Res., Inc. v.

But we see nothing in that term's plain meaning that suggests such a limitation. Further, the cases American points to are inapposite. American first relies on a nineteenth century British case, which it argues holds that a barge is not a vessel under a particular British law. <i>Blanford v. Morrison,</i> (1850) 117 Eng. Rep. 633, 634-35 (Exch. Ch.). But, the British law at issue regulated deliveries by a \"lighter, vessel, barge, or other craft\" and the opinion simply dealt with whether delivery by coal brig met that definition. <i>Id.</i> Thus, this case does not speak to whether a barge is considered a watercraft.</p>\n<p>American next relies on a Louisiana case in which the court found a barge was not a \"vessel\" under the relevant tax code. <i>Mallard Bay Drilling, Inc. v. Kennedy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1957208\"><a href=\"/opinion/1957208/mallard-bay-drilling-inc-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span>, 545-49 (La.2005). But, in that case, the statute dictated that result by applying one subsection to \"ships, vessels, or barges\" and the next only to \"ships or vessels,\" thereby suggesting a deliberate omission of barges. <i>Id.</i> In fact, that decision made clear that its resolution of tax law was specialized and bore little relation to \"general provisions of the law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 549.</p>\n<p>Finally, American points to a unpublished case from Michigan to argue that a means of propulsion is required for something to be a watercraft. <i>Russian Am. Ass'n of Detroit v. Hastings Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> No. 206086, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33447402</span></span>, at *2, 1999 Mich.App. LEXIS 1599, at *5 (Mich.Ct. App. Apr. 6, 1999). There, in concluding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> that a rowboat accident was excluded under a watercraft exclusion, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote>The dictionary definition of \"watercraft\" is \"a boat or ship.\" A \"boat\" is \"a vessel for transport by water, propelled by rowing, sails, or a motor.\" <i>Random House Webster's College Dictionary,</i> (1997). A rowboat is clearly a watercraft within the common definition of that term.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> As is evident from this quotation, that court simply noted that some boats have a source of propulsion. That court easily concluded that a rowboat was a watercraft and never considered the problem of a barge. Rather, it simply took one definition of \"boat\" that met the facts in that case. It is by no means clear that to be a boat a vessel must be \"propelled by rowing, sails, or a motor.\" Further, though \"boats or ships\" fit the definition of \"watercraft,\" as we have described above, that term plainly also includes vessels. And so, if we felt the need to analogize to other terms and contexts in order to reach a result, we need look no further than the Supreme Court, which has rejected the idea that a lack of propulsion prevents a barge from being considered a vessel. <i>Norton v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span> (1991). Thus, we reject American's arguments that the broad term \"watercraft\" is limited to vessels with a means of propulsion or is ambiguous.</p>\n<p>American raises several other logical and evidentiary arguments, which we address in turn. First, American points to the district court's acknowledgment that \"there might be some room to quibble over whether a float or a barge tied to a dock or mooring might fairly be regarded as a watercraft.\" <i>First Specialty,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 196. American argues that since it would not make sense for a barge to move in and out of coverage, an unmoored barge must also not be a watercraft. We reject this argument. As our above distinctions with <i>Consolidated American, Ison,</i> and <i>Ayers</i> suggest, there may be valid reasons for concluding certain moored barges being used for industrial purposes are not watercraft under an insurance policy where an injury results from a purely land-based industrial use of the barge or its equipment. But this does not establish that all barges cease being watercraft when docked. Thus, American's fear that barges will routinely move in and out of coverage is not realized, and we have no need to abandon the plain meaning of the term \"watercraft.\"</p>\n<p>American next points to two pieces of deposition testimony to argue for its interpretation. Specifically, American relies on the testimony of Roger Hale, an owner of FRDD, and John Naughton, an alleged agent of First Specialty. But, \"[t]he interpretation of an unambiguous contract `must be determined from the plain meaning of the language used and from the four corners of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence.'\" <i>Am. Prot. Ins. Co. v. Acadia Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></span>, 993 (Me. 2003) (quoting <i>Portland Valve Inc. v. Rockwood Sys. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1383</span></span>, 1387 (Me.1983)). Thus, we need not consider this testimony. American contends that we should nonetheless consider the testimony of Mr. Naughton to be a significant admission against interest. American <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> claims that Naughton stated that \"watercraft\" referred to floating objects that had a means of propulsion. But American has mischaracterized the record. In the relevant excerpt, Naughton states that he \"would say a watercraft is any waterborne vessel, flotation device, probably should have them propulsion of some kind, <i>or able to be propelled in some way,</i> but it's got to be something that's used on the water\" (emphasis added). Thus, even if Naughton was First Specialty's agent, a proposition which is disputed, he did not admit that a watercraft must have its own means of propulsion, but only that it must be able to be propelled. The DS64 clearly can be propelled, and was so propelled through force applied to it by the Seawind II.</p>\n<p>Finally, American contends that a question on the insurance application reveals that watercraft are distinct from floats, since that application asks the insured to identify all \"watercraft ... and floats.\" But this conjunctive phrasing does not indicate that the terms are exclusive and does not overcome the unambiguous meaning we have described above.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Splettstoesser was operating the DS64.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having established that the DS64 was a watercraft, we must ask whether it was a \"watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to\" the insured. It is undisputed that MCMC did not own the DS64, and First Specialty has not contended that MCMC rented or was loaned the barge. Thus, we must decide whether moving the barge by application of force created by the Seawind II constituted operation.</p>\n<p>Relying on the plain meaning of the term, we conclude that Splettstoesser was operating the DS64 using the Seawind II. \"Operation\" plainly includes manipulation by application of an exterior force. For example, definitions of \"operate\" in the Oxford English Dictionary include \"exercise force or influence, produce an effect, act, work,\" \"[t]o bring force or influence to bear <i>on</i> or <i>upon,</i>\" \"[t]o effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work,\" and \"[t]o direct the working of, to manage, conduct, work (a railway, business, etc.)\". <i>See</i> 10 <i>OED</i> 847-48, \"operate\" defs. 1, 2, 5, and 7 (emphasis in original). There is no ambiguity here since it can fairly and plainly be said that Splettstoesser was exercising force to produce an effect on the DS64 and direct its functioning. In fact, Splettstoesser's deposition establishes that he maneuvered the Seawind II in such a manner as to allow the DS64 to properly turn behind him.</p>\n<p>American argues that one would not say that pulling a waterskier or a log constitutes operation. But a waterskier is distinguishable by virtue of the fact that his or her functioning is also controlled by independent volition. Further, we do believe that pulling a log constitutes operating on the log, just as pulling a trailer using a truck would be operating the trailer. American also points to a federal statute that regulates tugboat operators, noting that it imposes no restriction based on what is pulled. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 8904(a). But it was never disputed that a tugboat pilot is operating the tugboat. That such operation is regulated by statute, whereas operation of pulled vessels is not regulated, does not establish that pulling a vessel is not operating that vessel. Thus, we see no ambiguity in the term \"operated by\" and conclude that Splettstoesser was operating the DS64.</p>\n<p>In light of these holdings regarding the plain meaning of the terms \"watercraft\" and \"operated by,\" we need not take recourse to guessing the intent of the parties. Nonetheless, we pause to note that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> this holding comports with such likely intent, as ascertained from an examination of the whole policy, as is permitted by Maine law. The purpose of the policy was not to provide blanket coverage of the tugboat, but rather to provide general commercial liability insurance in the event of certain accidents. The clear purpose of a watercraft exclusion is to limit the scope of the risk of such insurance, so as to avoid the greater financial risk arising from accidents involving larger watercraft. Though the operation of a tug alone might not entail such risks, the risks of financial loss from a maritime accident clearly increased when the tug and barge were joined and operated together. Thus, our reading of these contested terms comports with the likely intent of the policy.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, we conclude that MCMC's operation of the barge fits within the watercraft exclusion of the policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Can American recover under the theory that the Seawind II was responsible for the loss?</h2>\n<p>American argues that even if the barge is excluded, the fact that the tug is not excluded means that some recovery should be had for any and all damages that were caused by operation of the tugboat. But this argument misreads the language of the exclusion. The exclusion provides that insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence arising from the operation of a watercraft. It is true that the exclusion does not apply to certain watercraft, including the Seawind II. American argues that this exception to the exclusion means that \"all property damage arising out of... the use and operation of the <i>Seawind II</i> is covered by the Policy.\" This is plainly illogical. Simply because accidents arising from the use of the Seawind II are not excluded does not mean that any accident involving the Seawind II is automatically covered. Rather, if such an accident also arose from the use of the DS64, it would not be covered.</p>\n<p>The question we must ask then is whether the wreck arose out of the operation of the DS64. In evaluating this question, the district court concluded, \"[i]n operating the tugboat Mr. Splettstoesser operated the barge as well and this incident would not have occurred but for the presence of the barge and the peril created by Mr. Splettstoesser's attempt to convey it down the channel into the Merrimack River.\" <i>First Specialty,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 197. Though American argues that this is an improper test of causation in this circumstance, we see it instead as a conclusion that the accident arose out of the joint operation of the Seawind II and the DS64. For the reasons stated above, we agree with this conclusion. The record shows that Splettstoesser navigated the tug with concern for its effect on the barge, that he lost control of the barge, and that both vessels were then grounded. Thus, American is not entitled to recover for damages to the Seawind II, the DS64, or the cleanup costs, as all of these arose from the accidental occurrence involving the operation of the DS64.</p>\n<p>American attempts to avoid this conclusion by encouraging us to apply the efficient proximate cause doctrine. \"The efficient proximate cause rule operates to permit coverage when an insured peril sets other excluded perils into motion which `in an unbroken sequence and connection between the act and final loss, produce the result for which recovery is sought.'\" <i>Kish v. Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 125 Wash.2d 164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1388946\"><a href=\"/opinion/1388946/kish-v-insurance-co-of-n-am/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 311 (1994) (quoting <i>Graham v. Pub. Employees Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 98 Wash.2d 533, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612620\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612620/graham-v-pemco/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1077</span></a></span>, 1081 (1983)). \"In such a situation, the insured peril is considered the `proximate cause' of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*105</span> entire loss and the loss is covered despite the fact that the other perils contributing to the loss were excluded.\" <i>Id.</i> (footnote omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Fajardo Shopping Ctr., S.E. v.

American further contends that the district court erred by (1) analyzing \"but for\" causation rather than proximate causation and (2) effectively concluding that the barge was the sole cause of the accident. We disagree.</p>\n<p>First, it is not clear that Maine courts apply this doctrine or that the doctrine is even applicable to the kind of general liability insurance at issue. But we need not decide these questions of law since we agree with the district court's conclusion that application of the doctrine would not save American. The efficient proximate cause doctrine is only applicable where the causes are independent. <i>Tento Int'l, Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769906\"><a href=\"/opinion/769906/tento-international-inc-v-state-farm-fireand-casualty-company-tento/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 662 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000)(\"For the efficient proximate cause theory to apply, ... there must be two separate or distinct perils which `could each, under some circumstances, have occurred independently of the other and caused damage.'\" (quoting <i>Pieper v.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></span>, 557 (1997))); <i>Kish,</i> 883 P.2d at 311. Here, the undisputed facts show that Splettstoesser was operating the tug and barge together, maneuvering the tug in such a way as to achieve the desired effect on the barge. There is no way in which his operation of the tug and his operation of the barge could be thought of as independent causes of the accident. <i>Cf. </i><i>Terra Res.,</i> 695 F.2d at 831 (finding for the insured owners of a barge where a defective mooring caused damage, concluding that the damage would still have occurred independent of the fact that the insured owned the barge). The district court's conclusion that the accident would not have occurred \"but for\" the presence of the barge is just another way of stating this conclusion. Thus, though the efficient proximate cause doctrine might be applicable in other circumstances, it does not apply on these facts. Nor is there a question for the jury. If some independent cause, say a lightning strike to the tugboat, had caused damage, the jury might be called on to parse which cause was primarily responsible for the occurrence. But here, the record indisputably shows that the joint operation of the tug and barge led to the wreck, which caused all damages for which American now seeks to recover.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the summary judgment entered in favor of First Specialty against American is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
