In this age discrimination case,\n\nPlaintiff-appellant Néstor M. Torrech-Hernández (“Torrech”), a\n\nformer   plant   manager   for    Defendant-appellees   General   Electric\n\nCompany and Caribe GE International Electric Meters Corporation\n\n(collectively “GE”), challenges the entry of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of his former employer, GE.          Having conducted a careful de\n\nnovo review, and discerning no reversible error, we affirm albeit\n\non grounds different than the District Court.\n\n                             I.    BACKGROUND\n\n           Over the course of his twenty-eight year career at GE,\n\nTorrech held various positions within company, including plant\n\nmanager at several GE facilities in Puerto Rico.            In July 2000,\n\nthen-President and General Manager of Caribe GE Paul Sledzick\n\nappointed the forty-nine year-old Torrech, who was at that time\n\nplant manager at GE’s Vega Baja plant, to run the GE facility in\n\nHumacao.   Torrech’s appointment to Humacao, while not a promotion,\n\ninvolved running a larger plant with more employees and included a\n\nmore   complicated   and   varied    production   scheme.     Because   of\n\nHumacao’s size and its role in GE’s Puerto Rican market, the job of\n\nHumacao plant manager was akin to managing three different plants\n\nwithin one facility.       Just as with each of his previous plant\n\nmanager positions, at Humacao Torrech ultimately was responsible\n\nfor his plant’s operations and overall results.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f               In April of the following year, after a short transition\n\nperiod, Jeff Sommer replaced Sledzick as President and General\n\nManager    of    Caribe      GE.       During   his       transition    period,    Sommer\n\nfamiliarized himself with the plants under his authority, the\n\nchallenges facing those plants, and plans for improvement.                          Based\n\non his observations, Sommer believed that the operations in GE’s\n\nPuerto Rico plants needed to improve in five areas (“matrices” in\n\nGE     jargon):            service,     cost    out,       quality,     inventory       and\n\nenvironmental health and safety.                    As to the Humacao location in\n\nparticular, Sommer concluded that the plant was struggling in all\n\nfive    matrices       and    lagging       behind    the    other     sites.      Sommer\n\ncommunicated his concerns and plans for improvement to Torrech,\n\nspecifically         his    expectations       as    to   service     and    productivity\n\nimprovement.         Torrech considered Sommer’s plans for improvement to\n\nbe good business ideas.\n\n               Nevertheless, over the course of Sommer’s first few\n\nmonths as President and General Manager, it became clear that\n\ndespite Torrech’s professed agreement with Sommer’s ideas, he was\n\nneither implementing the improvement plans nor meeting Sommer’s\n\nexpectations.          Despite      his     claim    that    the    Humacao     plant   was\n\nmeeting, if not exceeding, company expectations during his time as\n\nplant manager, Torrech admitted that his work was not what he\n\nwanted    it    to    be.      In     his   deposition,      Torrech        described   his\n\nperformance as having its “ups and downs,” and agreed that during\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fhis time as plant manager, Humacao experienced numerous shut downs.\n\nAt the same time, however, Torrech insisted that under his lead,\n\nHumacao was generally on an upward trend.        However, to others, it\n\nwas apparent that Torrech was resistant to change and new ideas.\n\n           Torrech complains of several incidents occurring in the\n\nmonths following Sommer’s arrival in Puerto Rico as being directly\n\nrelated to what he perceived to be GE’s hostility towards older\n\nworkers.   On the evening of Sledzick’s retirement party, held at a\n\nlocal hotel, Roger Gasaway, to whom Sledzick reported in GE’s\n\ncorporate division, remarked to Torrech that there was a perception\n\nat GE that Torrech lacked the energy level he once had.          Several\n\nweeks later, on April 18, 2001, while touring the Humacao plant,\n\nSommer made a similar remark, commenting on Torrech’s lack of\n\nenergy.    Torrech did not ask Gasaway or Sommer what they meant by\n\ntheir comments.    Rather, Torrech assumed the comments referred to\n\nlack of intensity or enthusiasm. He connects these characteristics\n\nto age by noting that “normally when you grow old you grow slower.”\n\nAt the same time, Torrech acknowledges his familiarity with the\n\n“Four   E’s,”   consisting   of   “Edge,”   “Energy,”   Excellence,”   and\n\n“Energized,” a common mantra in GE company jargon.\n\n           Torrech   similarly    attributes   age-based    animus   to   a\n\ncomment made by Sommer during a meeting at the Hard Rock Café in\n\nOld San Juan.    According to Torrech, who cannot recall the context\n\nof the statements, Sommer generally referred to the staff as\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f“dinosaurs.” Torrech inferred from the comment that Sommer felt he\n\nand other employees were “old, sluggish, obsolete, you know,\n\noutdated.”     Another staff member in attendance, Nora Henríquez, a\n\nhuman resources manager, recalls that Sommer made the “dinosaur”\n\ncomment   in   response     to   an    inquiry    about     how   the    corporate\n\nheadquarters viewed the Puerto Rico operations.                    According to\n\nHenríquez, Sommer used the term when explaining the perception that\n\nthe organization was less automated than others, that it was not\n\nimplementing change in the same manner as other operations, and\n\nthat it appeared resistant to new initiatives.\n\n           The final incident complained of by Torrech took place on\n\nJune 18, 2001.       During a tour of the Humacao facility, in a\n\nparticularly warm section of the plant, Sommer pointed to an\n\nemployee, described by Torrech as an “old person,” and stated: “You\n\nsee that person?    In Vega Baja no longer –- nobody no longer walks\n\nthat slow.”     Torrech retorted “In Vega Baja nobody sweats like\n\nthat.”    Later, in Torrech’s office, Sommer indicated that he was\n\nnot happy with how the plant was being run, and that if he did not\n\nsee improvement, he would implement changes himself.                      Although\n\nSommer never explicitly referenced Torrech’s performance as plant\n\nmanager   or    mentioned    the      age   of   any   GE    employee,    Torrech\n\ninterpreted    Sommer   as   speaking         specifically    about     him,   and,\n\nfurther, that Sommer was implying that he wanted to replace Torrech\n\nwith a younger employee.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f           In the evening after the conversation, Torrech called\n\nHenríquez and asked whether there were any plans to replace him.\n\nAlthough Henríquez denied that there were any such plans, Torrech\n\nvolunteered    to     her    that    he   would    be     willing    to     leave   GE\n\n“peacefully” if offered a severance package.                  Henríquez contacted\n\nSommer to inform him about Torrech’s call.                    Without ordering or\n\nauthorizing    Torrech’s      termination,       Sommer    responded        that   they\n\nshould analyze the situation and identify what Torrech wanted.\n\nAfter Torrech’s phone call, and after getting the go-ahead from\n\nSommer, Henríquez began to put together initial figures for a\n\nseverance package.      In the meantime, Sommer updated Gasaway about\n\nTorrech’s phone call, indicated that they would begin to formulate\n\nan “exit plan” for Torrech, and identified Victor Aguilar, a\n\nthirty-three year-old long-term GE Caribe employee, as a possible\n\nreplacement.        At no time during the course of these or the\n\npreceding events did Torrech, who was well familiar with GE’s anti-\n\ndiscrimination policy, complain of discrimination or utilize the\n\ninternal procedures available to him.\n\n           Over the course of the next month, Henríquez began\n\ncorresponding back and forth with Torrech about his severance\n\npackage.   On July 13, 2001, Henríquez sent to Torrech, via e-mail,\n\na sample waiver form and proposed severance package. She explained\n\nto   Torrech   that    she   would    soon      follow   up   on    other    matters,\n\nincluding resignation announcements, and asked that Torrech get\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fback to her with his thoughts.                The following Monday, Torrech\n\nresponded somewhat cryptically - announcing his disappointment in\n\nthe dollar value of the package, but neither rejecting the package\n\nnor commenting on its terms or on Henríquez’s statement about his\n\nresignation.        Several days later, Henríquez and Torrech reviewed\n\ntogether   three      possible   severance      packages.    After      e-mailing\n\nTorrech to inquire as to his thoughts on the proposals, Henríquez\n\nreceived the following response:          “I need the money.       It has to be\n\n$150k and on payroll until September 30, 2001.               We can make the\n\nannouncement tomorrow.”          Two days later, at 7:30 a.m. Henríquez\n\nsent to Torrech a draft organizational announcement, and sought his\n\ncomments on it.       Immediately after, and before the plant-wide\n\ne-mail was finalized or distributed, Torrech sent an e-mail to his\n\nstaff   and    Henríquez   announcing     his    retirement.       An   official\n\nannouncement was released by human resources later that same day.\n\n              The   following    day,   and     after   further    discussions,\n\nHenríquez, apparently under the impression that Torrech had agreed\n\nto the terms offered by GE, sent him a confirmation e-mail with a\n\nfinal severance agreement.        In that e-mail, Henríquez gave Torrech\n\ninformation about his tax obligations, stocks, and pension plan,\n\nand asked that he return certain company property.                The next day,\n\nhowever, on July 25, 2001, Torrech responded curtly - “I am not\n\ngoing to sign anything.           Tell Jeff I will see him in court.”\n\nDespite this declaration, Torrech requested an extension of time\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fwithin which to consider GE’s offer.           By August 3, 2001, hearing no\n\nfurther response from Torrech, Henríquez wrote to Torrech and\n\nreiterated     the    company’s    final    severance     offer,   gave    him    an\n\nadditional week to consider the terms, and informed Torrech that\n\nshe would not continue negotiating with him past August 8, 2001.\n\nImmediately, Torrech requested another extension to consider the\n\nseverance, and Henríquez granted him additional time until August\n\n15, 2001.      On August 10, 2001, after consulting an attorney,\n\nTorrech rejected the severance offered by GE, requested instead a\n\nlump sum payment of $400,000, and informed Henríquez that if the\n\nnew sum was not accepted, he wished to return to his position as\n\nplant manager.        Torrech also threatened legal action if his terms\n\nwere not accepted.       GE rejected Torrech’s demands, and removed him\n\nfrom the company payroll effective August 15, 2001.\n\n            Torrech filed the present action in which he alleges that\n\nhe was terminated or subject to constructive discharge based on his\n\nage.   Torrech brought his suit against GE in the District of Puerto\n\nRico   under   the     federal    Age    Discrimination    in   Employment       Act\n\n(“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634; Puerto Rico’s version of the ADEA,\n\nknown as Law 100, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 146 et. seq.; and Puerto\n\nRico’s Law 80, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 185(a), which prohibits unjust\n\ndismissal.\n\n            The      District    Court   granted   summary      judgment   as     to\n\nTorrech’s ADEA claim and dismissed without prejudice the remaining\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fsupplemental state law claims.               In doing so, the Court held that\n\nTorrech    failed      to    establish   a    prima    facie   case   of    age-based\n\ndiscrimination.         The Court went on to hold that, even assuming\n\nTorrech could meet his initial burden, and viewing the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to him, on the evidence presented, Torrech\n\nfailed to establish that GE’s proffered business reason for his\n\ntermination was a pretext for discrimination.                       Torrech timely\n\nappealed, asserting that the District Court erred in its ultimate\n\nholdings and, in doing so, improperly drew inferences in favor of\n\nGE.\n\n                              II.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n               This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo.           See Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 98\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).            Summary judgment is proper where there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.             Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).            As was the\n\nobligation of the District Court below, we must take the facts of\n\nrecord    in    the   light    most    flattering      to   the   nonmovant    (here,\n\nTorrech) and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.                         See\n\nIverson, 452 F.3d at 98; Dávila v. Corporación de Puerto Rico Para\n\nLa Difusión Pública, 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007).                       “Once the\n\nmoving party avers the absence of genuine issues of material fact,\n\nthe   nonmovant       must    show   that    a    factual   dispute   does    exist.”\n\nVelázquez-Fernández v. NCE Foods, Inc., 476 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\f2007) (citation omitted).         Summary judgment cannot be defeated,\n\nhowever,   “by   relying     on     improbable       inferences,      conclusory\n\nallegations or rank speculation.”           Id.\n\n                            III.     DISCUSSION\n\n           Torrech alleges that he was fired from his position as\n\nplant manager at GE’s Humacao plant because of his age.                       He\n\nalternatively    alleges     that     if     he     wasn’t   fired,     he   was\n\nconstructively discharged and replaced by a younger employee as a\n\npart of GE’s efforts to rid the Humacao operation of older workers.\n\nIn order to succeed on these claims, Torrech must adduce facts\n\nsufficient to support an inference of discrimination, and in doing\n\nso may not rely on bold assertions, unsupported conclusions, or\n\noptimistic surmises.   Bennett v. Saint-Gobain Corp., 507 F.3d 23,\n\n30 (1st Cir. 2007).        Because the non-movant has the burden of\n\nproof, “the evidence adduced on each of the elements of his\n\nasserted cause of action must be significantly probative in order\n\nto forestall summary judgment.”            Id.     As correctly found by the\n\nDistrict Court, Torrech’s efforts fail to clear this hurdle.\n\n           Before   setting        forth     the     appropriate      test   and\n\naccompanying analysis for establishing a violation of the ADEA, we\n\nmust address one of Torrech’s underlying premises for this appeal.\n\nTorrech contends that the District Court, in failing to credit at\n\nface value each of his assertions, impermissibly failed to draw all\n\ninferences in his favor.          While it is true that in the summary\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fjudgment context all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor\n\nof the non-moving party, the District Court is not obliged to\n\naccept as true or to deem as a disputed material fact, each and\n\nevery unsupported, subjective, conclusory, or imaginative statement\n\nmade to the Court by a party.1    See Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni\n\n& Sons, Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994) (a party resisting\n\nsummary judgment may not rest on mere allegations or denials, but\n\nmust identify and allege specific facts showing a genuine issue for\n\n\n\n     1\n       Torrech’s Counterstatement of Material Facts in Controversy\nand Statement of Objections contains numerous statements by Torrech\nthat, while representing Torrech’s own subjective interpretation of\nseemingly innocuous words and actions on the part of Sommer, are\npresented as material facts.        Such representations include\nTorrech’s statements, citing only to his own deposition, that\n“Among the ideas that Sommer allegedly brought as GM was the idea\nof getting rid of old people in the [Puerto Rico] organization.”\nLikewise, as support for his discrimination claim, and as part of\nhis denial of GE’s assertion that Sommer wanted to improve Humacao\nplant operations, Torrech includes the following as a material fact\n- “Sommer’s message [when he handed to Torrech his recent,\npositive, performance review] was clear: ‘you are an old man and\nI do not care about how you have performed or about how Paul\nSledzick thinks you are performing.     I am going to get you out\nanyway because of your age.’” It is important to reiterate that\nthese are quotations of Torrech’s own thoughts - not words alleged\nto have been spoken by Sommer.     Torrech makes numerous similar\nassertions and argues that inferences must be drawn in his favor\nbased on these musings. We are not obliged to take at face value\nTorrech’s subjective beliefs when they are not factually based and\nmerely constitute conclusory, self-serving statements. See Vega v.\nKodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir. 1993) (material\ncreating a factual dispute “must herald the existence of ‘definite,\ncompetent evidence’ fortifying the plaintiff’s version of the\ntruth”).    Thus, the District Court’s disregard for certain\nstatements and allegations put forward by Torrech does not\nconstitute an impermissible failure to draw all inferences in his\nfavor, nor does it amount to impermissible inference-drawing in\nfavor of the moving party.\n\n                                 -11-\n\ftrial); Velázquez-Fernández,476 F.3d at 10.         This is particularly\n\ntrue where, as here, Torrech submitted as part of his objection to\n\nGE’s motion for summary judgment an affidavit in which he seemingly\n\ncontradicts his own deposition testimony and asserts what amount to\n\nnothing more than self-serving, factually-devoid declarations. See\n\nAbreu-Guzman v. Ford, 241 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 2001) (“a party\n\nopposing summary judgment may not manufacture a dispute of fact by\n\ncontradicting his earlier sworn testimony”); Orta-Castro v. Merck,\n\nSharp & Dohme Química P.R., Inc., 447 F.3d 105, 110 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     Therefore, insomuch as the District Court did not consider\n\ncertain statements and assertions put forward by Torrech in support\n\nof   his    objection   to   GE’s   motion   for   summary   judgment   as\n\nconstituting reliable evidence or a disputed material fact, there\n\nwas no error.\n\n             Pursuant to the ADEA, an employer is prohibited from\n\ntaking an adverse employment action against an employee who is\n\nforty years of age or older because of that employee’s age.        See 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 623(a)(1),631(a); Bennett, 507 F.3d at 30.            “When an\n\nemployee claims to have been discharged in violation of the ADEA,\n\nhe must shoulder the ultimate ‘burden of proving that his years\n\nwere the determinative factor in his discharge, that is, that he\n\nwould not have been fired but for his age.’”         Davila, 498 F.3d at\n\n15 (quoting Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir.\n\n1991)).     When direct evidence of age discrimination is lacking, an\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\femployee     may   utilize   the    McDonnell    Douglas   burden-shifting\n\nframework to carry his burden.           Dávila, 498 F.3d at 15 (citing\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973)).\n\n           The     initial   step   in   the    burden-shifting   framework\n\nrequires the employee to establish a prima facie case of age\n\ndiscrimination.      Velázquez-Fernández, 476 F.3d at 11.         To do so,\n\nthe plaintiff-employee must set forth facts showing each of the\n\nfollowing:    (i) that he was at least forty years old at the time of\n\nthe adverse employment action complained of; (ii) that his job\n\nperformance met or exceeded the employer’s legitimate expectations;\n\n(iii) that his employer actually or constructively discharged him;\n\nand (iv) that his employer had a continuing need for the services\n\nhe had been performing.        See id.; Cordero-Soto v. Island Fin.,\n\nInc., 418 F.3d 114, 119 (1st Cir. 2005).          Upon a sufficient prima\n\nfacie showing, the burden of production shifts to the defendant-\n\nemployer “to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for\n\nits adverse employment action.”          Hoffman v. Applicators Sales &\n\nServ., Inc., 439 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).\n\n           The employer’s burden is minimal - it “need do no more\n\nthan articulate a reason which, on its face, would justify a\n\nconclusion that the plaintiff was let go for a nondiscriminatory\n\nmotive.”   Dávila, 498 F.3d at 16.       Once the employer has satisfied\n\nthis requirement, the burden shifts back to the employee, who must\n\nthen show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the “reason\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fgiven   by   the    employer   for   the    discharge    is    pretextual,   and,\n\nmoreover,    that    it   is   pretext     for   age   discrimination.”       Id.\n\n(citation omitted); Velázquez-Fernández, 476 F.3d at 11. “In other\n\nwords, the bottom-line question of discrimination vel non comes\n\nfront and center.”        Dávila, 498 F.3d at 16.        At this stage in the\n\nproceedings, “this question reduces to whether or not the plaintiff\n\nhas adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to conclude that he was fired because of his age.”                 Id.\n\n(citing Ramírez Rodríguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc., 425\n\nF.3d 67, 78 (1st Cir. 2005)).\n\n             Here, it is undisputed that Torrech, who was 50 in the\n\nsummer of 2001, satisfies the age requirement of the prima facie\n\ntest.   As to whether Torrech’s performance met or exceeded GE’s\n\nlegitimate expectations, the parties disagree.                Torrech highlights\n\nhis positive review and accompanying salary increase from January\n\nof the same year as evidence that he was meeting the legitimate\n\nexpectations of his superiors.             GE, on the other hand, primarily\n\ncites Torrech’s own testimony as to the “ups and downs” experienced\n\nin the Humacao plant during his tenure there, and his admission\n\nthat Humacao was “not where I would like [it] to be” on the five\n\nmatrices. The District Court considered Torrech’s testimony, along\n\nwith evidence establishing certain deficiencies in the Humacao\n\nplant’s productivity under Torrech, to find that Torrech was not\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fmeeting his employers’ expectations as plant manager at the Humacao\n\nfacility.\n\n            Although we agree with the District Court’s ultimate\n\ndecision to grant summary judgment to GE, we do not agree with its\n\nanalysis or conclusion as to the second prong of the prima facie\n\ntest.     Despite GE’s assertions that the Humacao plant was not\n\nreaching projected financial goals and that Torrech, as plant\n\nmanager, was not doing enough to implement necessary change, GE has\n\nbeen steadfast in its position that but for Torrech’s voluntary\n\nresignation, he would not have been fired.         Sommer testified, and\n\ncounsel reaffirmed at oral argument, that if Torrech had not\n\nvoluntarily left his position, and improvement was not made in the\n\nHumacao plant, Torrech would have been placed on a structured\n\nimprovement plan, not terminated.          Thus, GE’s tactical claim that\n\nTorrech was not meeting legitimate job expectations is directly at\n\nodds    with    its   assertion   that   Torrech   resigned   on   his   own\n\ninitiative, and that he was doing well enough in his role as plant\n\nmanager that there were no plans to fire him.\n\n            Although it is Torrech’s burden to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination, as the employer, GE cannot play fast\n\nand loose with the facts in order to position itself advantageously\n\nwith regard to the burden shifting scheme of the McDonnell Douglas\n\nrubric.        By simultaneously proclaiming that Torrech was doing\n\nsufficiently well as plant manager that there were no plans to get\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\frid of him, and that he was failing to meet work expectations in\n\norder to legitimize his dismissal, GE improperly attempts to play\n\nboth sides against the middle. This juxtaposition of claims belies\n\nthe appropriateness of granting of summary judgment on this ground.\n\n            Unlike situations in which an employer can document well\n\nan employee’s failure to meet legitimate expectations, in this case\n\nno such documentation exists.      On the contrary, as Torrech points\n\nout, the performance review conducted within six             months of his\n\ndecision to part ways with GE Caribe was positive, and resulted in\n\na salary increase.       Furthermore, while it is true that Torrech\n\nadmitted that he could have performed better, this falls far short\n\nof proving that he has failed to meet his employer’s legitimate\n\nperformance expectations.       An “employee’s perception of himself .\n\n. . is not relevant.       [Rather,] [i]t is the perception of the\n\ndecision maker which is relevant.”           Karazanos v. Navistar Int’l\n\nTransp.   Corp.,   948   F.2d   332,   338   (7th   Cir.   1991)   (citation\n\nomitted).    There is just no factual support, save Sommer’s after-\n\nthe-fact testimony as to Torrech’s alleged failings, for GE’s\n\nassertion that Torrech was not meeting its legitimate expectations.\n\nThis, coupled with GE’s assertion that Torrech was performing\n\nsufficiently well enough that termination was not planned for him,\n\nundermines the District Court’s conclusion on this issue.            Because\n\nonly a minimal evidentiary showing is necessary to satisfy an\n\nemployee’s burden of production at this stage, it cannot be said\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthat Torrech did not set forth at least minimally sufficient\n\nevidence to overcome summary judgment on this prong of the test.\n\nDavis v. KARK-TV, Inc., 421 F.3d 699, 704 (8th Cir. 2005); Cruz-\n\nRamos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 384 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(burden of establishing a prima facie case is not an onerous one).\n\n          Although we disagree with the District Court’s analysis\n\nof the second prong of the McDonnell Douglas rubric, Torrech’s\n\nclaim nevertheless falls far short of the mark on the third prong.\n\nTorrech fails to present facts from which a reasonable jury could\n\nconclude that he was discharged; and further, he has come forward\n\nwith insufficient evidence of pretext.      While the District Court\n\nabstained from making a determination on the third prong of the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas test, we think the inquiry is determinative of\n\nTorrech’s appeal.   Adverse employment action, for purposes of the\n\nADEA, includes actual or constructive discharge. On the undisputed\n\nfacts of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to Torrech,\n\nwe think that it is clear that Torrech resigned his position.\n\nTorrech initiated the talks that lead to his resignation, and he\n\nconcedes that he expressed a desire to leave the company in\n\nexchange for a severance package.      Torrech presented no facts at\n\nall, aside from his personal belief, to support his assertion that\n\nhe was terminated from his position as plant manager. Finally, and\n\nmost tellingly, Torrech sent to his employees an unambiguously\n\nworded   resignation   announcement,   without   being   prompted   or\n\n\n                                -17-\n\finstructed to do so by GE.2        Although Torrech denies that his\n\nletter was in fact a resignation, this argument is hard to take\n\nseriously.    Torrech’s words speak for themselves.\n\n            Moreover, even Torrech does not wholeheartedly deny that\n\nhe resigned.    Rather, he contends that if he did resign, he was\n\nforced to do so under circumstances that amounted to constructive\n\ndischarge. It is well-established that “[j]ust as the ADEA bars an\n\nemployer from dismissing an employee because of his age, so too it\n\nbars an employer from engaging in a calculated, age-inspired effort\n\nto force an employee to quit.”     De La Vega v. San Juan Star, Inc.,\n\n377 F.3d 111, 117 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).        “To prove\n\nconstructive discharge, a plaintiff must usually ‘show that her\n\nworking   conditions   were   so   difficult   or   unpleasant   that   a\n\nreasonable person in [his] shoes would have felt compelled to\n\nresign.’”    Id. (quoting Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe,\n\nInc., 354 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 2003)); see also Velázquez-\n\nFernández, 476 F.3d at 12.     “It is not enough that the plaintiff\n\nsuffered the ordinary slings and arrows that workers routinely\n\nencounter in a hard, cold world.”         De La Vega, 377 F.3d at 117\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n\n     2\n       Torrech’s unprompted e-mail of July 24, 2001, sent before a\ncompany-wide announcement was made, stated: “After 27 wonderful\nyears with GE, I have decided to a change of pace and to pursue my\nown business opportunity more in tone with my present plan for life\nand health condition. You have been a great team and we did great\nthings together. Thank you for letting me be your leader this past\nyear. God bless you all. Néstor.”\n\n                                   -18-\n\f            In order to establish constructive discharge, Torrech\n\nmust show that conditions were so intolerable that they rendered a\n\nseemingly voluntary resignation a termination.                  In such cases,\n\n“[t]he question is not whether working conditions at the facility\n\nwere difficult or unpleasant,” but rather, an employee “must show\n\nthat, at the time of his resignation, his employer did not allow\n\nhim the opportunity to make a free choice regarding his employment\n\nrelationship.”      Exum v. U.S. Olympic Comm., 389 F.3d 1130, 1135\n\n(10th Cir. 2004).      Thus, in order for a resignation to constitute\n\na constructive discharge, it effectively must be void of choice or\n\nfree will.    Id.; see also Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d\n\n476, 480 (1st Cir. 1993) (constructive discharge exists where\n\nemployer’s actions “effectively vitiate the employees’ power to\n\nchoose work over retirement”); Equal Employment Opportunity Comm’n\n\nv. Univ. of Chicago Hosps., 276 F.3d 326, 332 (7th Cir. 2002)\n\n(“When an employer acts in a manner so as to have communicated to\n\na   reasonable     employee    that   she    will    be   terminated,    and   the\n\nplaintiff employee resigns, the employer’s conduct may amount to\n\nconstructive discharge.”).\n\n            The gravamen of Torrech’s constructive discharge claim is\n\nthat the words and actions of his employer, beginning with Sommer’s\n\narrival in Puerto Rico, lead him to believe that he would soon be\n\nterminated from his position as plant manager of the Humacao\n\nfacility.     In    support,    Torrech      cites   to   the   four    incidents\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fdescribed above - namely, the two times that Torrech was told that\n\nhe lacked the same “energy” he once had, the meeting at which\n\nSommer   used    the     term    “dinosaur”     when     describing      the    local\n\noperations, and the incident at the Humacao plant during which\n\nSommer commented on an older employee and then later indicated that\n\nhe wanted to make changes.            Torrech contends that these comments\n\nled him to believe that older employees were no longer welcome at\n\nGE and that he eventually would have been fired had he not taken\n\nmatters into his own hands. Regardless of how Torrech subjectively\n\nfelt about these comments (assuming they were made and intended to\n\nbe   age-related),       these    incidents      alone      do   not     amount    to\n\nconstructive    discharge.3           See   Alfieri    v.    SYSCO    Food     Servs.-\n\nSyracuse, 192 F. Supp. 2d 14, 24 (W.D.N.Y. 2001) (an “employee’s\n\nsubjective    interpretation       that     continued       employment    would    be\n\nuncomfortable     and     demeaning     and    would    lead     to    demotion    or\n\ntermination     in     the   future    does    not     constitute      constructive\n\n\n\n     3\n       In support for his argument that he resigned because he\notherwise would have been fired, Torrech cites to an e-mail written\nby Sommer and sent to Roger Gasaway, Henríquez, and another human\nresources representative, in which Sommer describes putting\ntogether an “exit plan” for Torrech. Torrech cites the e-mail as\nproof that GE planned to get rid of him. His assertion, however,\nis undercut by the rest of the e-mail and the context in which it\nwas written.    The subject e-mail was written two days after\nTorrech’s June 18, 2001 phone call to Henríquez in which he\ninitiated resignation negotiations. The e-mail does not reveal any\nnefarious intent on the part of Sommer.        Rather, it informs\nGasaway, Sommer’s superior, of Torrech’s decision, and updates him\non the “exit plan” for Torrech, as well as the necessary plans to\nfill the open position resulting from Torrech’s departure.\n\n                                        -20-\n\fdischarge.”); Agnew v.

See id.     Nor is there any basis to conclude\n\nthat a reasonable employee standing in Torrech’s shoes would have\n\nbelieved that his termination was imminent.         See Bragg v. Navistar\n\nInt’l     Transp.

Am. Sheep Indus.\n\nAss’n, 981 F.2d 1569, 1574 (10th Cir. 1992) (upholding finding of\n\nconstructive discharge where employee resigned because she was “too\n\ntired” to fight after her employer treated her as “incapable and\n\nuneducable” during her final months of employment, and after being\n\nasked to quit because of her age and “image,” and told that if she\n\ndid not quit she would be fired).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f             Torrech admits that prior to expressing his interest in\n\nresignation, he asked Henríquez whether there were any plans to\n\nhave him replaced, and her answer was no.4               Despite Henríquez’s\n\nassurances, Torrech marched forward with his plan - he announced\n\nthat he would resign in exchange for a severance package.                There is\n\nno factual support in the record for Torrech’s assertion that if he\n\nhad not voluntarily done so, he would have been fired.                  There is\n\nonly Torrech’s claim that this was his subjective belief.                 This is\n\ntoo thin a reed to support a constructive discharge claim.                    An\n\nemployee “may not be unreasonably sensitive to his [or her] working\n\nenvironment.”     Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp., 798 F.2d 559, 561\n\n(1st Cir. 1986) (citation omitted).             The standard for assessing a\n\nconstructive discharge claim “is an objective one:                 it cannot be\n\ntriggered solely by the employee’s subjective beliefs, no matter\n\nhow sincerely held.”       Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304\n\nF.3d 7, 28 (1st Cir. 2002) (citation omitted); see also Calhoun,\n\n798   F.2d   at   561   (“[T]he    law   does    not   permit     an   employee’s\n\nsubjective     perceptions    to    govern       a   claim   of    constructive\n\ndischarge.”); Suarez v. Pueblo Int’l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n\n      4\n       GE maintains that there were no plans to fire or otherwise\nreplace Torrech.   Instead, as discussed above, Sommer testified\nthat if Torrech had remained, and the Humacao plant had continued\nto have difficulties in the five matrices, Torrech likely would\nhave been put on an improvement plan. Such a placement does not\nconstitute a constructive discharge. See Agnew v. BASF Corp., 286\nF.3d 307, 310 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\n                                     -22-\n\f           Here, Torrech insists that his personal opinion, and his\n\nperception that he was wanted out of the organization, should\n\nsuffice as support for his constructive discharge claim. He relies\n\non little else to establish that he was compelled to resign by\n\nthreat of imminent termination.        However, apprehension of future\n\ntermination is insufficient to establish constructive discharge -\n\ninstead, an employee “is obliged ‘not to assume the worst, and not\n\nto jump to conclusions too fast.’”          Agnew, 286 F.3d at 310 (quoting\n\nGarner v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 807 F.2d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir.\n\n1987)). Here, even accepting as true all facts alleged by Torrech,\n\nnothing presented to us evidences any immediate intent on the part\n\nof GE to rid itself of older employees, including Torrech.                  The\n\nbottom line is that Torrech’s resignation was grossly premature, as\n\nit was based entirely on his own worst-case-scenario assumption as\n\nto his future at GE.\n\n           In    the    alternative,   Torrech      also   alludes   to    the\n\nnegotiations leading up to his eventual removal from the company\n\npayroll as a constructive discharge. He posits that he was subject\n\nto a “take it or leave it” offer, whereby he was forced to choose\n\nbetween retirement and involuntary termination.            Putting aside the\n\ninconsistency of these two theories for a moment, Torrech’s conduct\n\nwas nothing short of a deceptive bait and switch tactic, something\n\nwhich   this    Court   cannot   condone.      We   explain:   Torrech    first\n\ndeclared his desire to resign on June 18, 2001.            One month later,\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fafter GE gave him a close to, if not final, offer as to a severance\n\npackage, Torrech tentatively indicated his agreement with it,\n\nunilaterally     announced    his     resignation      to   his     employees,    and\n\nstopped     working.       Then,      for    several    weeks       following    his\n\nresignation,     Torrech     continued       to    negotiate      with    the   human\n\nresources    representative      as    to    the   details     of   his     severance\n\npackage.     On August 10, 2001, Torrech increased his severance\n\ndemand by $250,0005 to $400,000, well beyond the terms discussed,\n\nand nearly agreed-upon by the parties in the previous weeks. More\n\ntellingly, Torrech simultaneously warned GE that if his new demands\n\nwere rejected he wanted his job back, and threatened legal action\n\nif his ultimatum were not accepted.6               This is a classic bait and\n\nswitch: Torrech initiated interest in a severance arrangement - he\n\noffered his resignation under what appeared to be a reasonable\n\nrequest for severance (which was met almost fully by GE), resigned\n\nand left work, and then rebuked GE’s good faith offer by suddenly\n\ndemanding    a   sum   grossly   out    of    proportion     with     the   previous\n\ndiscussions.      Then, to add insult to injury, Torrech threatened\n\n\n\n     5\n       In an e-mail dated July 22, 2001, Torrech sought a lump sum\npayment of $150,000 as well as two months’ salary. As of August 3,\n2001, GE offered to Torrech a lump sum payment of $150,000 plus one\nmonth’s salary. In his demand letter of August 10, 2001, Torrech\nincreased his demand to $400,000 and threatened legal action should\nhis dun be rejected.\n     6\n      Upon Torrech’s rejection of the severance package offered by\nGE, he was taken off of the company payroll effective August 15,\n2001.\n\n                                       -24-\n\fthat if he did not receive his sought after plunder, he wanted his\n\njob back - the one from which he had already resigned and for which\n\na replacement had been selected - or else.\n\n            GE’s unwillingness to accede to Torrech’s demands does\n\nnot transform Torrech’s resignation into a termination.          Torrech\n\nselectively cites this Court’s language in Vega, 3 F.3d at 480, in\n\nwhich we discussed the circumstances under which an offer of early\n\nretirement may be transformed into constructive discharge.        There,\n\nwe counseled “a plaintiff who has accepted an employer’s offer to\n\nretire can be said to have been constructively discharged when the\n\noffer presented was, at rock bottom, ‘a choice between early\n\nretirement with benefits or discharge without benefits.”              Id.\n\n(citation omitted). This case is clearly distinguishable from Vega\n\nin at least one crucial way - Torrech voluntarily resigned, without\n\nprompting or coercion by GE.     See id.\n\n            As   discussed   above,   Torrech   presents   no   evidence\n\nsuggestive of a plot by GE to rid itself of older employees or\n\nspecifically to terminate Torrech.        Rather, Torrech’s resignation\n\nwas unforced, driven by his willingness to part ways with his\n\nemployer in exchange for a severance.       GE’s offer, and subsequent\n\nrefusal, when faced with Torrech’s bait and switch, either to pay\n\nTorrech’s    inflated   demand   or   reinstate    him,    is   not   the\n\n“impermissible take-it-or-leave-it choice between retirement or\n\ndischarge” that Vega describes.          Under these circumstances, an\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\femployer is not obligated to reinstate an employee who voluntarily\n\nresigned, nor is it obligated to continue severance negotiations\n\nwith       an   employee      whose    demands   were    becoming     increasingly\n\nunreasonable.\n\n                Although the District Court below hesitated to decide the\n\nquestion of whether Torrech was discharged or resigned because it\n\nfound summary judgment was proper on other grounds, we are of the\n\nview, after taking the facts in the light most favorable to Torrech,\n\nthat Torrech’s separation from GE was without any serious doubt a\n\nvoluntary resignation.            Summary judgment was and is warranted on\n\nthis ground.\n\n                If more were needed, and we believe it is not, Torrech’s\n\nclaim also fails for absence of pretext.7               In his briefs before this\n\nCourt,      Torrech    relies     on    his   subjective      opinions   as   to    the\n\nmotivations and intentions of Sommer and GE, few of which are fact-\n\nbased.      As detailed above, personal opinion, unsupported by fact,\n\nis not sufficiently probative on the issue of                        pretext.       See\n\ngenerally Cruz-Ramos, 202 F.3d at 385 n.3.                 The only facts Torrech\n\ncites      to   show   that    GE’s    actions   were   but    a   pretext    for   age\n\ndiscrimination are the allegedly discriminatory comments made to\n\nTorrech.        The first two incidents involved comments that Torrech\n\nseemed to lack energy.            It is well-established that “energy,” as\n\n\n\n       7\n       Torrech concedes that GE meets its burden of articulating a\nnon-discriminatory reason for terminating him.\n\n                                          -26-\n\fwell as similarly defined terms, does not necessarily connote youth\n\nor other age-related characteristics.             See Erickson v. Farmland\n\nIndus., Inc., 271 F.3d 718, 730 (8th Cir. 2001) (energy is a\n\nlegitimate performance issue not facially related to age); Luks v.\n\nBaxter Healthcare Corp., 467 F.3d 1049, 1055 (7th Cir. 2006)\n\n(employer’s   “expressed      interest     in   ‘higher   energy’    employees,\n\nalthough potentially consistent with age discrimination, is not by\n\nitself    direct   evidence    of   such    discrimination”);        Fortier   v.\n\nAmeritech Mobile Commc’ns Inc., 161 F.3d 1106, 1113 (7th Cir. 1998)\n\n(“Standard usage and common sense dictate that ‘energetic’ means\n\nactive . . . [and] simply cannot support a determination of age\n\nbias.”).    Here, Torrech does not allege that the energy comments\n\nwere made in the context of an age-related discussion, nor did he\n\nask Sommer or Gasaway what they meant by their comments. Thus, even\n\nassuming, for purposes of summary judgment, that the comments were\n\nnot related to GE’s “Four E” mantra, they are insufficient to\n\nestablish discriminatory animus.\n\n            As for Sommer’s dinosaur comment, even assuming, despite\n\nwitness    testimony   to     the   contrary,     that    Sommer’s    statement\n\ncommunicated a personal belief, it does not on its face evidence\n\nage-related animus or bias.8        Standard usage of the term “dinosaur”\n\n\n     8\n       District courts outside of the First Circuit have addressed\nsimilar statements when assessing whether the term “dinosaur” is\nevidence of pretext. There is little uniformity among the courts,\nhowever, and the conclusions reached largely are based on the\ncontext in which the statements were made. See Bunk v. Gen. Servs.\n\n                                     -27-\n\fdoes not convey an age-related message.

Supp. 2d 153, 158 (W.D.N.Y. 2006) (employer’s use of\nthe term “dinosaur” in reference to a co-worker’s age not\nsufficient evidence of discriminatory intent, and are merely stray\nremarks); Aylward v.

This definition comports entirely with Sommer’s explanation,\n\ncorroborated by witnesses, that his statement referred to the out-\n\ndated   practices   and   machines    still       used     in    the   Puerto   Rico\n\nfactories. Given the context of Sommer’s statement - made during a\n\nmanager assimilation meeting at Old San Juan’s Hard Rock Café, in\n\nresponse to an inquiry as to how corporate headquarters viewed GE’s\n\nPuerto Rico operation, and without any reference to any specific\n\nemployee and his or her age - this comment amounts to little more\n\nthan a stray remark insufficient to establish discriminatory animus.\n\nSee Velasquez-Fernandez, 476 F.3d at 11-12 (“stray workplace remarks\n\n. . . normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either\n\npretext or the requisite discriminatory animus”).\n\n            Torrech admits that Sommer’s dinosaur reference “by itself\n\ndoes not suggest more than Sommer’s feeling toward older employees\n\nin general.”    He posits, however, that the comment, Sommer’s desire\n\nfor change, and an alleged series of appointments of younger\n\nemployees, including his own replacement by a man nearly twenty\n\nyears his junior, supports an inference of age discrimination.                    In\n\nhis briefs, Torrech asserts that in Sommer’s first four months as\n\nPresident and General Manager of Caribe GE, he decreased the average\n\nage of plant manager from forty-one to thirty-four.                     Aside from\n\nTorrech’s replacement by a man in his early thirties, Torrech does\n\nnot   provide   evidentiary   support       for     his    assertion.      Torrech\n\nseemingly   admits,   however,   that       there    was    no   policy,   whether\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fexplicit or implicit, of excluding employees over the age of forty\n\nor otherwise favoring employees under that age.9   Instead, Torrech\n\nasserts that if appointments of individuals over the age of fifty\n\nwere made, Sommer was not responsible for them.\n\n          At the end of the day, Sommer’s personal appointment\n\nhistory is of little importance - what is telling, however, is\n\nTorrech’s failure to deny that many high-level appointments of\n\nindividuals within the protected class10 were made in the Puerto\n\nRico organization during the relevant time frame.11   On the whole,\n\nwhile Torrech attempts to paint himself a part of a pattern of\n\ndiscriminatory conduct, his efforts are unsuccessful.   Rather, the\n\n\n     9\n       On the contrary, Torrech asserts that Sommer’s oldest\npersonal appointee to plant manager was forty-two years old.\n     10\n       The Age Discrimination in Employment Act protects persons\nforty years of age or older. See 29 U.S.C. § 631(a).\n     11\n        GE’s Statement of Uncontested Facts submitted to the\nDistrict Court contained three separate paragraphs in which GE\nlisted, individually, each of Sommer’s plant manager appointments\nsince he became President and General Manager of Caribe GE,\nincluding the age of each appointee, as well as appointments made\nto positions at the same level as or higher than plant manager,\nalong with the ages of said appointees, as well as Sommer’s\nappointments outside of Puerto Rico, of employees in their forties,\nfifties, and sixties. In his Counterstatement, Torrech makes a\nblanket denial of all three paragraphs of GE’s Statement of\nUndisputed Facts. In support, Torrech simply declares that since\nSommer’s arrival he has not appointed any plant manager over the\nage of forty-two, and that other appointments of older individuals,\nif made, were not done by Sommer. Torrech’s record citations on\nthese issues do not support his contentions and his blanket,\nfactually unsupported denial does not create a material dispute of\nfact. Furthermore, even a denial does not suffice to establish, as\nTorrech attempts, a series of appointments of younger individuals\nat or around the time of Torrech’s resignation.\n\n                               -30-\n\frecord is devoid of evidence to support any discriminatory behavior\n\non the part of GE.    On these facts, Torrech cannot show that GE’s\n\nacceptance of his resignation was pretextual.\n\n                          IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment as to Torrech’s ADEA claims.

Torrech-Hernández (\"Torrech\"), a former plant manager for Defendant-appellees General Electric Company and Caribe GE International Electric Meters Corporation (collectively \"GE\"), challenges the entry of summary judgment in favor of his former employer, GE. Having conducted a careful de novo review, and discerning no reversible error, we affirm albeit on grounds different than the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Over the course of his twenty-eight year career at GE, Torrech held various positions within company, including plant manager at several GE facilities in Puerto Rico. In July 2000, then-President and General Manager of Caribe GE Paul Sledzick appointed the forty-nine year-old Torrech, who was at that time plant manager at GE's Vega Baja plant, to run the GE facility in Humacao. Torrech's appointment to Humacao, while not a promotion, involved running a larger plant with more employees and included a more complicated and varied production scheme. Because of Humacao's size and its role in GE's Puerto Rican market, the job of Humacao plant manager was akin to managing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> three different plants within one facility. Just as with each of his previous plant manager positions, at Humacao Torrech ultimately was responsible for his plant's operations and overall results.</p>\n<p>In April of the following year, after a short transition period, Jeff Sommer replaced Sledzick as President and General Manager of Caribe GE. During his transition period, Sommer familiarized himself with the plants under his authority, the challenges facing those plants, and plans for improvement. Based on his observations, Sommer believed that the operations in GE's Puerto Rico plants needed to improve in five areas (\"matrices\" in GE jargon): service, cost out, quality, inventory and environmental health and safety. As to the Humacao location in particular, Sommer concluded that the plant was struggling in all five matrices and lagging behind the other sites. Sommer communicated his concerns and plans for improvement to Torrech, specifically his expectations as to service and productivity improvement. Torrech considered Sommer's plans for improvement to be good business ideas.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, over the course of Sommer's first few months as President and General Manager, it became clear that despite Torrech's professed agreement with Sommer's ideas, he was neither implementing the improvement plans nor meeting Sommer's expectations. Despite his claim that the Humacao plant was meeting, if not exceeding, company expectations during his time as plant manager, Torrech admitted that his work was not what he wanted it to be. In his deposition, Torrech described his performance as having its \"ups and downs,\" and agreed that during his time as plant manager, Humacao experienced numerous shut downs. At the same time, however, Torrech insisted that under his lead, Humacao was generally on an upward trend. However, to others, it was apparent that Torrech was resistant to change and new ideas.</p>\n<p>Torrech complains of several incidents occurring in the months following Sommer's arrival in Puerto Rico as being directly related to what he perceived to be GE's hostility towards older workers. On the evening of Sledzick's retirement party, held at a local hotel, Roger Gasaway, to whom Sledzick reported in GE's corporate division, remarked to Torrech that there was a perception at GE that Torrech lacked the energy level he once had. Several weeks later, on April 18, 2001, while touring the Humacao plant, Sommer made a similar remark, commenting on Torrech's lack of energy. Torrech did not ask Gasaway or Sommer what they meant by their comments. Rather, Torrech assumed the comments referred to lack of intensity or enthusiasm. He connects these characteristics to age by noting that \"normally when you grow old you grow slower.\" At the same time, Torrech acknowledges his familiarity with the \"Four E's,\" consisting of \"Edge,\" \"Energy,\" \"Excellence,\" and \"Energized,\" a common mantra in GE company jargon.</p>\n<p>Torrech similarly attributes age-based animus to a comment made by Sommer during a meeting at the Hard Rock Café in Old San Juan. According to Torrech, who cannot recall the context of the statements, Sommer generally referred to the staff as \"dinosaurs.\" Torrech inferred from the comment that Sommer felt he and other employees were \"old, sluggish, obsolete, you know, outdated.\" Another staff member in attendance, Nora Henríquez, a human resources manager, recalls that Sommer made the \"dinosaur\" comment in response to an inquiry about how the corporate headquarters viewed the Puerto Rico operations. According to Henríquez, Sommer used the term when <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> explaining the perception that the organization was less automated than others, that it was not implementing change in the same manner as other operations, and that it appeared resistant to new initiatives.</p>\n<p>The final incident complained of by Torrech took place on June 18, 2001. During a tour of the Humacao facility, in a particularly warm section of the plant, Sommer pointed to an employee, described by Torrech as an \"old person,\" and stated: \"You see that person? In Vega Baja no longer  nobody no longer walks that slow.\" Torrech retorted \"In Vega Baja nobody sweats like that.\" Later, in Torrech's office, Sommer indicated that he was not happy with how the plant was being run, and that if he did not see improvement, he would implement changes himself. Although Sommer never explicitly referenced Torrech's performance as plant manager or mentioned the age of any GE employee, Torrech interpreted Sommer as speaking specifically about him, and, further, that Sommer was implying that he wanted to replace Torrech with a younger employee.</p>\n<p>In the evening after the conversation, Torrech called Henríquez and asked whether there were any plans to replace him. Although Henríquez denied that there were any such plans, Torrech volunteered to her that he would be willing to leave GE \"peacefully\" if offered a severance package. Henríquez contacted Sommer to inform him about Torrech's call. Without ordering or authorizing Torrech's termination, Sommer responded that they should analyze the situation and identify what Torrech wanted. After Torrech's phone call, and after getting the go-ahead from Sommer, Henríquez began to put together initial figures for a severance package. In the meantime, Sommer updated Gasaway about Torrech's phone call, indicated that they would begin to formulate an \"exit plan\" for Torrech, and identified Victor Aguilar, a thirty-three year-old long-term GE Caribe employee, as a possible replacement. At no time during the course of these or the preceding events did Torrech, who was well familiar with GE's anti-discrimination policy, complain of discrimination or utilize the internal procedures available to him.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next month, Henríquez began corresponding back and forth with Torrech about his severance package. On July 13, 2001, Henríquez sent to Torrech, via e-mail, a sample waiver form and proposed severance package. She explained to Torrech that she would soon follow up on other matters, including resignation announcements, and asked that Torrech get back to her with his thoughts. The following Monday, Torrech responded somewhat cryptically  announcing his disappointment in the dollar value of the package, but neither rejecting the package nor commenting on its terms or on Henríquez's statement about his resignation. Several days later, Henríquez and Torrech reviewed together three possible severance packages. After e-mailing Torrech to inquire as to his thoughts on the proposals, Henríquez received the following response: \"I need the money. It has to be $150k and on payroll until September 30, 2001. We can make the announcement tomorrow.\" Two days later, at 7:30 a.m. Henríquez sent to Torrech a draft organizational announcement, and sought his comments on it. Immediately after, and before the plant-wide e-mail was finalized or distributed, Torrech sent an e-mail to his staff and Henríquez announcing his retirement. An official announcement was released by human resources later that same day.</p>\n<p>The following day, and after further discussions, Henríquez, apparently under the impression that Torrech had agreed to the terms offered by GE, sent him a confirmation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> e-mail with a final severance agreement. In that e-mail, Henríquez gave Torrech information about his tax obligations, stocks, and pension plan, and asked that he return certain company property. The next day, however, on July 25, 2001, Torrech responded curtly  \"I am not going to sign anything. Tell Jeff I will see him in court.\" Despite this declaration, Torrech requested an extension of time within which to consider GE's offer. By August 3, 2001, hearing no further response from Torrech, Henríquez wrote to Torrech and reiterated the company's final severance offer, gave him an additional week to consider the terms, and informed Torrech that she would not continue negotiating with him past August 8, 2001. Immediately, Torrech requested another extension to consider the severance, and Henríquez granted him additional time until August 15, 2001. On August 10, 2001, after consulting an attorney, Torrech rejected the severance offered by GE, requested instead a lump sum payment of $400,000, and informed Henríquez that if the new sum was not accepted, he wished to return to his position as plant manager. Torrech also threatened legal action if his terms were not accepted. GE rejected Torrech's demands, and removed him from the company payroll effective August 15, 2001.</p>\n<p>Torrech filed the present action in which he alleges that he was terminated or subject to constructive discharge based on his age. Torrech brought his suit against GE in the District of Puerto Rico under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634; Puerto Rico's version of the ADEA, known as Law 100, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 146 et. seq.; and Puerto Rico's Law 80, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 185(a), which prohibits unjust dismissal.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment as to Torrech's ADEA claim and dismissed without prejudice the remaining supplemental state law claims. In doing so, the Court held that Torrech failed to establish a prima facie case of age-based discrimination. The Court went on to hold that, even assuming Torrech could meet his initial burden, and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to him, on the evidence presented, Torrech failed to establish that GE's proffered business reason for his termination was a pretext for discrimination. Torrech timely appealed, asserting that the District Court erred in its ultimate holdings and, in doing so, improperly drew inferences in favor of GE.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>This Court reviews a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>See </i><i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). As was the obligation of the District Court below, we must take the facts of record in the light most flattering to the nonmovant (here, Torrech) and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>See </i><i>Iverson,</i> 452 F.3d at 98; <i>Dávila v. Corporación de Puerto Rico Para La Difusión Pública,</i> 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007). \"Once the moving party avers the absence of genuine issues of material fact, the nonmovant must show that a factual dispute does exist.\" <i>Velázquez-Fernández v. NCE Foods, Inc.,</i> 476 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Summary judgment cannot be defeated, however, \"by relying on improbable inferences, conclusory allegations or rank speculation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Torrech alleges that he was fired from his position as plant manager at GE's Humacao <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> plant because of his age. He alternatively alleges that if he wasn't fired, he was constructively discharged and replaced by a younger employee as a part of GE's efforts to rid the Humacao operation of older workers. In order to succeed on these claims, Torrech must adduce facts sufficient to support an inference of discrimination, and in doing so may not rely on bold assertions, unsupported conclusions, or optimistic surmises. <i>Bennett v. Saint-Gobain Corp.,</i> 507 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir.2007). Because the non-movant has the burden of proof, \"the evidence adduced on each of the elements of his asserted cause of action must be significantly probative in order to forestall summary judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> As correctly found by the District Court, Torrech's efforts fail to clear this hurdle.</p>\n<p>Before setting forth the appropriate test and accompanying analysis for establishing a violation of the ADEA, we must address one of Torrech's underlying premises for this appeal. Torrech contends that the District Court, in failing to credit at face value each of his assertions, impermissibly failed to draw all inferences in his favor. While it is true that in the summary judgment context all <i>reasonable</i> inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party, the District Court is not obliged to accept as true or to deem as a disputed material fact, each and every unsupported, subjective, conclusory, or imaginative statement made to the Court by a party.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> 44 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1994) (a party resisting summary judgment may not rest on mere allegations or denials, but must identify and allege specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial); <i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 10. This is particularly true where, as here, Torrech submitted as part of his objection to GE's motion for summary judgment an affidavit in which he seemingly contradicts his own deposition testimony and asserts what amount to nothing more than self-serving, factually-devoid declarations. <i>See </i><i>Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> 241 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir.2001) (\"a party opposing summary judgment may not manufacture a dispute of fact by contradicting his earlier sworn testimony\"); <i>Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Química P.R., Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> 105, 110 (1st Cir.2006). Therefore, insomuch as the District Court did not consider certain statements and assertions put forward by Torrech in support of his objection to GE's motion for summary judgment as constituting reliable evidence or a disputed material fact, there was no error.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the ADEA, an employer is prohibited from taking an adverse employment action against an employee who is forty years of age or older because of that employee's age. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. §§ 623(a)(1),631(a); <i>Bennett,</i> 507 F.3d at 30. \"When an employee claims to have been discharged in violation of the ADEA, he must shoulder the ultimate `burden of proving that his years were the determinative factor in his discharge, that is, that he would not have been fired but for his age.'\" <i>Davila,</i> 498 F.3d at 15 (quoting <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir.1991)). When direct evidence of age discrimination is lacking, an employee may utilize the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting framework to carry his burden. <i>Dávila,</i> 498 F.3d at 15 (citing <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)).</p>\n<p>The initial step in the burden-shifting framework requires the employee to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. <i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 11. To do so, the plaintiff-employee must set forth facts showing each of the following: (i) that he was at least forty years old at the time of the adverse employment action complained of; (ii) that his job performance met or exceeded the employer's legitimate expectations; (iii) that his employer actually or constructively discharged him; and (iv) that his employer had a continuing need for the services he had been performing. <i>See id.</i>; <i>Cordero-Soto v. Island Fin., Inc.,</i> 418 F.3d 114, 119 (1st Cir.2005). Upon a sufficient prima facie showing, the burden of production shifts to the defendant-employer \"to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment action.\" <i>Hoffman v. Applicators Sales &amp; Serv., Inc.,</i> 439 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The employer's burden is minimal  it \"need do no more than articulate a reason which, on its face, would justify a conclusion that the plaintiff was let go for a nondiscriminatory motive.\" <i>Dávila,</i> 498 F.3d at 16. Once the employer has satisfied this requirement, the burden shifts back to the employee, who must then show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \"reason given by the employer for the discharge is pretextual, and, moreover, that it is pretext for age discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted); <i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 11. \"In other words, the bottom-line question of discrimination vel non comes front and center.\" <i>Dávila,</i> 498 F.3d at 16. At this stage in the proceedings, \"this question reduces to whether or not the plaintiff has adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was fired because of his age.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Ramírez Rodríguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc.,</i> 425 F.3d 67, 78 (1st Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p>Here, it is undisputed that Torrech, who was 50 in the summer of 2001, satisfies the age requirement of the prima facie test. As to whether Torrech's performance met or exceeded GE's legitimate expectations, the parties disagree. Torrech highlights his positive review and accompanying salary increase from January of the same year as evidence that he was meeting the legitimate expectations of his superiors. GE, on the other hand, primarily cites Torrech's own testimony as to the \"ups and downs\" experienced in the Humacao plant during his tenure there, and his admission that Humacao was \"not where I would like <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> [it] to be\" on the five matrices. The District Court considered Torrech's testimony, along with evidence establishing certain deficiencies in the Humacao plant's productivity under Torrech, to find that Torrech was not meeting his employers' expectations as plant manager at the Humacao facility.</p>\n<p>Although we agree with the District Court's ultimate decision to grant summary judgment to GE, we do not agree with its analysis or conclusion as to the second prong of the prima facie test. Despite GE's assertions that the Humacao plant was not reaching projected financial goals and that Torrech, as plant manager, was not doing enough to implement necessary change, GE has been steadfast in its position that but for Torrech's voluntary resignation, he would not have been fired. Sommer testified, and counsel reaffirmed at oral argument, that if Torrech had not voluntarily left his position, and improvement was not made in the Humacao plant, Torrech would have been placed on a structured improvement plan, not terminated. Thus, GE's tactical claim that Torrech was not meeting legitimate job expectations is directly at odds with its assertion that Torrech resigned on his own initiative, and that he was doing well enough in his role as plant manager that there were no plans to fire him.</p>\n<p>Although it is Torrech's burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, as the employer, GE cannot play fast and loose with the facts in order to position itself advantageously with regard to the burden shifting scheme of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> rubric. By simultaneously proclaiming that Torrech was doing sufficiently well as plant manager that there were no plans to get rid of him, <i>and</i> that he was failing to meet work expectations in order to legitimize his dismissal, GE improperly attempts to play both sides against the middle. This juxtaposition of claims belies the appropriateness of granting of summary judgment on this ground.</p>\n<p>Unlike situations in which an employer can document well an employee's failure to meet legitimate expectations, in this case no such documentation exists. On the contrary, as Torrech points out, the performance review conducted within six months of his decision to part ways with GE Caribe was positive, and resulted in a salary increase. Furthermore, while it is true that Torrech admitted that he could have performed better, this falls far short of proving that he has failed to meet his employer's legitimate performance expectations. An \"employee's perception of himself . . . is not relevant. [Rather,] [i]t is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant.\" <i>Karazanos v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp.,</i> 948 F.2d 332, 338 (7th Cir.1991) (citation omitted). There is just no factual support, save Sommer's after-the-fact testimony as to Torrech's alleged failings, for GE's assertion that Torrech was not meeting its legitimate expectations. This, coupled with GE's assertion that Torrech was performing sufficiently well enough that termination was not planned for him, undermines the District Court's conclusion on this issue. Because only a minimal evidentiary showing is necessary to satisfy an employee's burden of production at this stage, it cannot be said that Torrech did not set forth at least minimally sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment on this prong of the test. <i>Davis v. KARK-TV, Inc.,</i> 421 F.3d 699, 704 (8th Cir.2005); <i>Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co.,</i> 202 F.3d 381, 384 (1st Cir.2000) (burden of establishing a prima facie case is not an onerous one).</p>\n<p>Although we disagree with the District Court's analysis of the second prong of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> rubric, Torrech's claim nevertheless falls far short of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> mark on the third prong. Torrech fails to present facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude that he was discharged; and further, he has come forward with insufficient evidence of pretext. While the District Court abstained from making a determination on the third prong of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> test, we think the inquiry is determinative of Torrech's appeal. Adverse employment action, for purposes of the ADEA, includes actual or constructive discharge. On the undisputed facts of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to Torrech, we think that it is clear that Torrech resigned his position. Torrech initiated the talks that lead to his resignation, and he concedes that he expressed a desire to leave the company in exchange for a severance package. Torrech presented no facts at all, aside from his personal belief, to support his assertion that he was terminated from his position as plant manager. Finally, and most tellingly, Torrech sent to his employees an unambiguously worded resignation announcement, without being prompted or instructed to do so by GE.<sup>[2]</sup> Although Torrech denies that his letter was in fact a resignation, this argument is hard to take seriously. Torrech's words speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even Torrech does not wholeheartedly deny that he resigned. Rather, he contends that if he did resign, he was forced to do so under circumstances that amounted to constructive discharge. It is well-established that \"[j]ust as the ADEA bars an employer from dismissing an employee because of his age, so too it bars an employer from engaging in a calculated, age-inspired effort to force an employee to quit.\" <i>De La Vega v. San Juan Star, Inc.,</i> 377 F.3d 111, 117 (1st Cir.2004) (citation omitted). \"To prove constructive discharge, a plaintiff must usually `show that her working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in [his] shoes would have felt compelled to resign.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe, Inc.,</i> 354 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir.2003)); <i>see also </i><i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 12. \"It is not enough that the plaintiff suffered the ordinary slings and arrows that workers routinely encounter in a hard, cold world.\" <i>De La Vega,</i> 377 F.3d at 117 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>In order to establish constructive discharge, Torrech must show that conditions were so intolerable that they rendered a seemingly voluntary resignation a termination. In such cases, \"[t]he question is not whether working conditions at the facility were difficult or unpleasant,\" but rather, an employee \"must show that, at the time of his resignation, his employer did not allow him the opportunity to make a free choice regarding his employment relationship.\" <i>Exum v. U.S. Olympic Comm.,</i> 389 F.3d 1130, 1135 (10th Cir. 2004). Thus, in order for a resignation to constitute a constructive discharge, it effectively must be void of choice or free will. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd.,</i> 3 F.3d 476, 480 (1st Cir.1993) (constructive discharge exists where employer's actions \"effectively vitiate the employees' power to choose work over retirement\"); <i>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Univ. of Chicago Hosps.,</i> 276 F.3d 326, 332 (7th Cir.2002) (\"When an employer acts in a manner so as to have communicated to a reasonable employee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> that she will be terminated, and the plaintiff employee resigns, the employer's conduct may amount to constructive discharge.\").</p>\n<p>The gravamen of Torrech's constructive discharge claim is that the words and actions of his employer, beginning with Sommer's arrival in Puerto Rico, lead him to believe that he would soon be terminated from his position as plant manager of the Humacao facility. In support, Torrech cites to the four incidents described above  namely, the two times that Torrech was told that he lacked the same \"energy\" he once had, the meeting at which Sommer used the term \"dinosaur\" when describing the local operations, and the incident at the Humacao plant during which Sommer commented on an older employee and then later indicated that he wanted to make changes. Torrech contends that these comments led him to believe that older employees were no longer welcome at GE and that he eventually would have been fired had he not taken matters into his own hands. Regardless of how Torrech subjectively felt about these comments (assuming they were made and intended to be age-related), these incidents alone do not amount to constructive discharge.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Alfieri v. SYSCO Food Servs.-Syracuse,</i> 192 F.Supp.2d 14, 24 (W.D.N.Y.2001) (an \"employee's subjective interpretation that continued employment would be uncomfortable and demeaning and would lead to demotion or termination in the future does not constitute constructive discharge.\"); <i>Agnew v. BASF Corp.,</i> 286 F.3d 307, 310 (6th Cir.2002) (no constructive discharge where employer advises employee that employment status is contingent on future levels of performance and improvement).</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the incidents cited that could allow a rational trier of fact to infer that GE deliberately created conditions so difficult or unpleasant that Torrech would have felt compelled to resign. <i>See id.</i> Nor is there any basis to conclude that a reasonable employee standing in Torrech's shoes would have believed that his termination was imminent. <i>See </i><i>Bragg v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp.,</i> 164 F.3d 373, 377 (7th Cir.1998) (constructive discharge protects the employee who \"decides to quit rather than wait around to be fired\"); <i>cf., EEOC,</i> 276 F.3d at 332 (burden of establishing constructive discharge was met where evidence overwhelmingly pointed to employee's imminent termination, including employee's arrival at work to find her belongings packed and office being used for storage); <i>Acrey v. Am. Sheep Indus. Ass'n,</i> 981 F.2d 1569, 1574 (10th Cir.1992) (upholding finding of constructive discharge where employee resigned because she was \"too tired\" to fight after her employer treated her as \"incapable and uneducable\" during her final months of employment, and after being asked to quit because of her age and \"image,\" and told that if she did not quit she would be fired).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> Torrech admits that prior to expressing his interest in resignation, he asked Henríquez whether there were any plans to have him replaced, and her answer was no.<sup>[4]</sup> Despite Henríquez's assurances, Torrech marched forward with his plan  he announced that he would resign in exchange for a severance package. There is no factual support in the record for Torrech's assertion that if he had not voluntarily done so, he would have been fired. There is only Torrech's claim that this was his subjective belief. This is too thin a reed to support a constructive discharge claim. An employee \"may not be unreasonably sensitive to his [or her] working environment.\" <i>Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp.,</i> 798 F.2d 559, 561 (1st Cir.1986) (citation omitted). The standard for assessing a constructive discharge claim \"is an objective one: it cannot be triggered solely by the employee's subjective beliefs, no matter how sincerely held.\" <i>Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 28 (1st Cir.2002) (citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Calhoun,</i> 798 F.2d at 561 (\"[T]he law does not permit an employee's subjective perceptions to govern a claim of constructive discharge.\"); <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>Here, Torrech insists that his personal opinion, and his perception that he was wanted out of the organization, should suffice as support for his constructive discharge claim. He relies on little else to establish that he was compelled to resign by threat of imminent termination. However, apprehension of future termination is insufficient to establish constructive discharge  instead, an employee \"is obliged `not to assume the worst, and not to jump to conclusions too fast.'\" <i>Agnew,</i> 286 F.3d at 310 (quoting <i>Garner v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 807 F.2d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir.1987)). Here, even accepting as true all <i>facts</i> alleged by Torrech, nothing presented to us evidences any immediate intent on the part of GE to rid itself of older employees, including Torrech. The bottom line is that Torrech's resignation was grossly premature, as it was based entirely on his own worst-case-scenario assumption as to his future at GE.</p>\n<p>In the alternative, Torrech also alludes to the negotiations leading up to his eventual removal from the company payroll as a constructive discharge. He posits that he was subject to a \"take it or leave it\" offer, whereby he was forced to choose between retirement and involuntary termination. Putting aside the inconsistency of these two theories for a moment, Torrech's conduct was nothing short of a deceptive bait and switch tactic, something which this Court cannot condone. We explain: Torrech first declared his desire to resign on June 18, 2001. One month later, after GE gave him a close to, if not final, offer as to a severance package, Torrech tentatively indicated his agreement with it, unilaterally announced his resignation to his employees, and stopped working. Then, for several weeks following his resignation, Torrech continued to negotiate with the human resources representative as to the details of his severance package. On August 10, 2001, Torrech increased his severance demand by $250,000<sup>[5]</sup> to $400,000, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> well beyond the terms discussed, and nearly agreed-upon by the parties in the previous weeks. More tellingly, Torrech simultaneously warned GE that if his new demands were rejected he wanted his job back, <i>and</i> threatened legal action if his ultimatum were not accepted.<sup>[6]</sup> This is a classic bait and switch: Torrech initiated interest in a severance arrangement  he offered his resignation under what appeared to be a reasonable request for severance (which was met almost fully by GE), resigned and left work, and then rebuked GE's good faith offer by suddenly demanding a sum grossly out of proportion with the previous discussions. Then, to add insult to injury, Torrech threatened that if he did not receive his sought after plunder, he wanted his job back  the one from which he had already resigned and for which a replacement had been selected  or else.</p>\n<p>GE's unwillingness to accede to Torrech's demands does not transform Torrech's resignation into a termination. Torrech selectively cites this Court's language in <i>Vega,</i> 3 F.3d at 480, in which we discussed the circumstances under which an offer of early retirement may be transformed into constructive discharge. There, we counseled \"a plaintiff who has accepted an employer's offer to retire can be said to have been constructively discharged when the offer presented was, at rock bottom, `a choice between early retirement with benefits or discharge without benefits.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). This case is clearly distinguishable from <i>Vega</i> in at least one crucial way  Torrech voluntarily resigned, without prompting or coercion by GE. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>As discussed above, Torrech presents no evidence suggestive of a plot by GE to rid itself of older employees or specifically to terminate Torrech. Rather, Torrech's resignation was unforced, driven by his willingness to part ways with his employer in exchange for a severance. GE's offer, and subsequent refusal, when faced with Torrech's bait and switch, either to pay Torrech's inflated demand or reinstate him, is not the \"impermissible take-it-or-leave-it choice between retirement or discharge\" that <i>Vega</i> describes. Under these circumstances, an employer is not obligated to reinstate an employee who voluntarily resigned, nor is it obligated to continue severance negotiations with an employee whose demands were becoming increasingly unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Although the District Court below hesitated to decide the question of whether Torrech was discharged or resigned because it found summary judgment was proper on other grounds, we are of the view, after taking the facts in the light most favorable to Torrech, that Torrech's separation from GE was without any serious doubt a voluntary resignation. Summary judgment was and is warranted on this ground.</p>\n<p>If more were needed, and we believe it is not, Torrech's claim also fails for absence of pretext.<sup>[7]</sup> In his briefs before this Court, Torrech relies on his subjective opinions as to the motivations and intentions of Sommer and GE, few of which are fact-based. As detailed above, personal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> opinion, unsupported by fact, is not sufficiently probative on the issue of pretext. <i>See generally </i><i>Cruz-Ramos,</i> 202 F.3d at 385 n. 3. The only facts Torrech cites to show that GE's actions were but a pretext for age discrimination are the allegedly discriminatory comments made to Torrech. The first two incidents involved comments that Torrech seemed to lack energy. It is well-established that \"energy,\" as well as similarly defined terms, does not necessarily connote youth or other age-related characteristics. <i>See </i><i>Erickson v. Farmland Indus., Inc.,</i> 271 F.3d 718, 730 (8th Cir.2001) (energy is a legitimate performance issue not facially related to age); <i>Luks v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,</i> 467 F.3d 1049, 1055 (7th Cir.2006) (employer's \"expressed interest in `higher energy' employees, although potentially consistent with age discrimination, is not by itself direct evidence of such discrimination\"); <i>Fortier v. Ameritech Mobile Commc'ns Inc.,</i> 161 F.3d 1106, 1113 (7th Cir.1998) (\"Standard usage and common sense dictate that `energetic' means active . . . [and] simply cannot support a determination of age bias.\"). Here, Torrech does not allege that the energy comments were made in the context of an age-related discussion, nor did he ask Sommer or Gasaway what they meant by their comments. Thus, even assuming, for purposes of summary judgment, that the comments were not related to GE's \"Four E\" mantra, they are insufficient to establish discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p>As for Sommer's dinosaur comment, even assuming, despite witness testimony to the contrary, that Sommer's statement communicated a personal belief, it does not on its face evidence age-related animus or bias.<sup>[8]</sup> Standard usage of the term \"dinosaur\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> does not convey an age-related message. Rather, as defined by Merriam-Webster, \"dinosaur\" means \"impractically large, out-of-date, or obsolete.\" <i>Merriam-Webster's</i> Collegiate Dictionary 326 (10th ed.2002). This definition comports entirely with Sommer's explanation, corroborated by witnesses, that his statement referred to the out-dated practices and machines still used in the Puerto Rico factories. Given the context of Sommer's statement  made during a manager assimilation meeting at Old San Juan's Hard Rock Café, in response to an inquiry as to how corporate headquarters viewed GE's Puerto Rico operation, and without any reference to any specific employee and his or her age  this comment amounts to little more than a stray remark insufficient to establish discriminatory animus. <i>See Velazquez-Fernandez,</i> 476 F.3d at 11-12 (\"stray workplace remarks . . . normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus\").</p>\n<p>Torrech admits that Sommer's dinosaur reference \"by itself does not suggest more than Sommer's feeling toward older employees in general.\" He posits, however, that the comment, Sommer's desire for change, and an alleged series of appointments of younger employees, including his own replacement by a man nearly twenty years his junior, supports an inference of age discrimination. In his briefs, Torrech asserts that in Sommer's first four months as President and General Manager of Caribe GE, he decreased the average age of plant manager from forty-one to thirty-four. Aside from Torrech's replacement by a man in his early thirties, Torrech does not provide evidentiary support for his assertion. Torrech seemingly admits, however, that there was no policy, whether explicit or implicit, of excluding employees over the age of forty or otherwise favoring employees under that age.<sup>[9]</sup> Instead, Torrech asserts that if appointments of individuals over the age of fifty were made, Sommer was not responsible for them.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Sommer's personal appointment history is of little importance  what is telling, however, is Torrech's failure to deny that many high-level appointments of individuals within the protected class<sup>[10]</sup> were made in the Puerto Rico organization during the relevant time frame.<sup>[11]</sup> On the whole, while Torrech attempts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> to paint himself a part of a pattern of discriminatory conduct, his efforts are unsuccessful. Rather, the record is devoid of evidence to support any discriminatory behavior on the part of GE. On these facts, Torrech cannot show that GE's acceptance of his resignation was pretextual.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court's grant of summary judgment as to Torrech's ADEA claims. Supplemental state law claims remain dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Torrech's Counterstatement of Material Facts in Controversy and Statement of Objections contains numerous statements by Torrech that, while representing Torrech's own subjective interpretation of seemingly innocuous words and actions on the part of Sommer, are presented as material facts. Such representations include Torrech's statements, citing only to his own deposition, that \"Among the ideas that Sommer allegedly brought as GM was the idea of getting rid of old people in the [Puerto Rico] organization.\" Likewise, as support for his discrimination claim, and as part of his denial of GE's assertion that Sommer wanted to improve Humacao plant operations, Torrech includes the following as a <i>material fact</i>  \"Sommer's message [when he handed to Torrech his recent, positive, performance review] was clear: `you are an old man and I do not care about how you have performed or about how Paul Sledzick thinks you are performing. I am going to get you out anyway because of your age.'\" It is important to reiterate that these are quotations of Torrech's own thoughts  not words alleged to have been spoken by Sommer. Torrech makes numerous similar assertions and argues that inferences must be drawn in his favor based on these musings. We are not obliged to take at face value Torrech's subjective beliefs when they are not factually based and merely constitute conclusory, self-serving statements. <i>See </i><i>Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd.,</i> 3 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir. 1993) (material creating a factual dispute \"must herald the existence of `definite, competent evidence' fortifying the plaintiff's version of the truth\"). Thus, the District Court's disregard for certain statements and allegations put forward by Torrech does not constitute an impermissible failure to draw all inferences in his favor, nor does it amount to impermissible inference-drawing in favor of the moving party.</p>\n<p>[2]  Torrech's unprompted e-mail of July 24, 2001, sent <i>before</i> a company-wide announcement was made, stated: \"After 27 wonderful years with GE, I have decided to a change of pace and to pursue my own business opportunity more in tone with my present plan for life and health condition. You have been a great team and we did great things together. Thank you for letting me be your leader this past year. God bless you all. Néstor.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  In support for his argument that he resigned because he otherwise would have been fired, Torrech cites to an e-mail written by Sommer and sent to Roger Gasaway, Henríquez, and another human resources representative, in which Sommer describes putting together an \"exit plan\" for Torrech. Torrech cites the e-mail as proof that GE planned to get rid of him. His assertion, however, is undercut by the rest of the e-mail and the context in which it was written. The subject e-mail was written two days after Torrech's June 18, 2001 phone call to Henríquez in which he initiated resignation negotiations. The e-mail does not reveal any nefarious intent on the part of Sommer. Rather, it informs Gasaway, Sommer's superior, of Torrech's decision, and updates him on the \"exit plan\" for Torrech, as well as the necessary plans to fill the open position resulting from Torrech's departure.</p>\n<p>[4]  GE maintains that there were no plans to fire or otherwise replace Torrech. Instead, as discussed above, Sommer testified that if Torrech had remained, and the Humacao plant had continued to have difficulties in the five matrices, Torrech likely would have been put on an improvement plan. Such a placement does not constitute a constructive discharge. <i>See </i><i>Agnew v. BASF Corp.,</i> 286 F.3d 307, 310 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>[5]  In an e-mail dated July 22, 2001, Torrech sought a lump sum payment of $150,000 as well as two months' salary. As of August 3, 2001, GE offered to Torrech a lump sum payment of $150,000 plus one month's salary. In his demand letter of August 10, 2001, Torrech increased his demand to $400,000 and threatened legal action should his dun be rejected.</p>\n<p>[6]  Upon Torrech's rejection of the severance package offered by GE, he was taken off of the company payroll effective August 15, 2001.</p>\n<p>[7]  Torrech concedes that GE meets its burden of articulating a non-discriminatory reason for terminating him.</p>\n<p>[8]  District courts outside of the First Circuit have addressed similar statements when assessing whether the term \"dinosaur\" is evidence of pretext. There is little uniformity among the courts, however, and the conclusions reached largely are based on the context in which the statements were made. <i>See </i><i>Bunk v. Gen. Servs. Admin.,</i> 408 F.Supp.2d 153, 158 (W.D.N.Y.2006) (employer's use of the term \"dinosaur\" in reference to a coworker's age not sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent, and are merely stray remarks); <i>Aylward v.

Aug.5, 2005) (isolated remark by employer that there were \"dinosaurs\" that he would not mind seeing leave, without specific reference to plaintiff-employee, made months before plaintiff-employee's termination, was insufficient to raise a question of fact on the issue of pretext); <i>Cochrane v.

In his Counterstatement, Torrech makes a blanket denial of all three paragraphs of GE's Statement of Undisputed Facts. In support, Torrech simply declares that since Sommer's arrival he has not appointed any plant manager over the age of forty-two, and that other appointments of older individuals, if made, were not done by Sommer. Torrech's record citations on these issues do not support his contentions and his blanket, factually unsupported denial does not create a material dispute of fact. Furthermore, even a denial does not suffice to establish, as Torrech attempts, a series of appointments of younger individuals at or around the time of Torrech's resignation.</p>\n\n</div>",

Torrech-Hernández (\"Torrech\"), a former plant manager for Defendant-appellees General Electric Company and Caribe GE International Electric Meters Corporation (collectively \"GE\"), challenges the entry of summary judgment in favor of his former employer, GE. Having conducted a careful de novo review, and discerning no reversible error, we affirm albeit on grounds different than the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Over the course of his twenty-eight year career at GE, Torrech held various positions within company, including plant manager at several GE facilities in Puerto Rico. In July 2000, then-President and General Manager of Caribe GE Paul Sledzick appointed the forty-nine year-old Torrech, who was at that time plant manager at GE's Vega Baja plant, to run the GE facility in Humacao. Torrech's appointment to Humacao, while not a promotion, involved running a larger plant with more employees and included a more complicated and varied production scheme. Because of Humacao's size and its role in GE's Puerto Rican market, the job of Humacao plant manager was akin to managing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> three different plants within one facility. Just as with each of his previous plant manager positions, at Humacao Torrech ultimately was responsible for his plant's operations and overall results.</p>\n<p>In April of the following year, after a short transition period, Jeff Sommer replaced Sledzick as President and General Manager of Caribe GE. During his transition period, Sommer familiarized himself with the plants under his authority, the challenges facing those plants, and plans for improvement. Based on his observations, Sommer believed that the operations in GE's Puerto Rico plants needed to improve in five areas (\"matrices\" in GE jargon): service, cost out, quality, inventory and environmental health and safety. As to the Humacao location in particular, Sommer concluded that the plant was struggling in all five matrices and lagging behind the other sites. Sommer communicated his concerns and plans for improvement to Torrech, specifically his expectations as to service and productivity improvement. Torrech considered Sommer's plans for improvement to be good business ideas.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, over the course of Sommer's first few months as President and General Manager, it became clear that despite Torrech's professed agreement with Sommer's ideas, he was neither implementing the improvement plans nor meeting Sommer's expectations. Despite his claim that the Humacao plant was meeting, if not exceeding, company expectations during his time as plant manager, Torrech admitted that his work was not what he wanted it to be. In his deposition, Torrech described his performance as having its \"ups and downs,\" and agreed that during his time as plant manager, Humacao experienced numerous shut downs. At the same time, however, Torrech insisted that under his lead, Humacao was generally on an upward trend. However, to others, it was apparent that Torrech was resistant to change and new ideas.</p>\n<p>Torrech complains of several incidents occurring in the months following Sommer's arrival in Puerto Rico as being directly related to what he perceived to be GE's hostility towards older workers. On the evening of Sledzick's retirement party, held at a local hotel, Roger Gasaway, to whom Sledzick reported in GE's corporate division, remarked to Torrech that there was a perception at GE that Torrech lacked the energy level he once had. Several weeks later, on April 18, 2001, while touring the Humacao plant, Sommer made a similar remark, commenting on Torrech's lack of energy. Torrech did not ask Gasaway or Sommer what they meant by their comments. Rather, Torrech assumed the comments referred to lack of intensity or enthusiasm. He connects these characteristics to age by noting that \"normally when you grow old you grow slower.\" At the same time, Torrech acknowledges his familiarity with the \"Four E's,\" consisting of \"Edge,\" \"Energy,\" \"Excellence,\" and \"Energized,\" a common mantra in GE company jargon.</p>\n<p>Torrech similarly attributes age-based animus to a comment made by Sommer during a meeting at the Hard Rock Café in Old San Juan. According to Torrech, who cannot recall the context of the statements, Sommer generally referred to the staff as \"dinosaurs.\" Torrech inferred from the comment that Sommer felt he and other employees were \"old, sluggish, obsolete, you know, outdated.\" Another staff member in attendance, Nora Henríquez, a human resources manager, recalls that Sommer made the \"dinosaur\" comment in response to an inquiry about how the corporate headquarters viewed the Puerto Rico operations. According to Henríquez, Sommer used the term when <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> explaining the perception that the organization was less automated than others, that it was not implementing change in the same manner as other operations, and that it appeared resistant to new initiatives.</p>\n<p>The final incident complained of by Torrech took place on June 18, 2001. During a tour of the Humacao facility, in a particularly warm section of the plant, Sommer pointed to an employee, described by Torrech as an \"old person,\" and stated: \"You see that person? In Vega Baja no longer  nobody no longer walks that slow.\" Torrech retorted \"In Vega Baja nobody sweats like that.\" Later, in Torrech's office, Sommer indicated that he was not happy with how the plant was being run, and that if he did not see improvement, he would implement changes himself. Although Sommer never explicitly referenced Torrech's performance as plant manager or mentioned the age of any GE employee, Torrech interpreted Sommer as speaking specifically about him, and, further, that Sommer was implying that he wanted to replace Torrech with a younger employee.</p>\n<p>In the evening after the conversation, Torrech called Henríquez and asked whether there were any plans to replace him. Although Henríquez denied that there were any such plans, Torrech volunteered to her that he would be willing to leave GE \"peacefully\" if offered a severance package. Henríquez contacted Sommer to inform him about Torrech's call. Without ordering or authorizing Torrech's termination, Sommer responded that they should analyze the situation and identify what Torrech wanted. After Torrech's phone call, and after getting the go-ahead from Sommer, Henríquez began to put together initial figures for a severance package. In the meantime, Sommer updated Gasaway about Torrech's phone call, indicated that they would begin to formulate an \"exit plan\" for Torrech, and identified Victor Aguilar, a thirty-three year-old long-term GE Caribe employee, as a possible replacement. At no time during the course of these or the preceding events did Torrech, who was well familiar with GE's anti-discrimination policy, complain of discrimination or utilize the internal procedures available to him.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next month, Henríquez began corresponding back and forth with Torrech about his severance package. On July 13, 2001, Henríquez sent to Torrech, via e-mail, a sample waiver form and proposed severance package. She explained to Torrech that she would soon follow up on other matters, including resignation announcements, and asked that Torrech get back to her with his thoughts. The following Monday, Torrech responded somewhat cryptically  announcing his disappointment in the dollar value of the package, but neither rejecting the package nor commenting on its terms or on Henríquez's statement about his resignation. Several days later, Henríquez and Torrech reviewed together three possible severance packages. After e-mailing Torrech to inquire as to his thoughts on the proposals, Henríquez received the following response: \"I need the money. It has to be $150k and on payroll until September 30, 2001. We can make the announcement tomorrow.\" Two days later, at 7:30 a.m. Henríquez sent to Torrech a draft organizational announcement, and sought his comments on it. Immediately after, and before the plant-wide e-mail was finalized or distributed, Torrech sent an e-mail to his staff and Henríquez announcing his retirement. An official announcement was released by human resources later that same day.</p>\n<p>The following day, and after further discussions, Henríquez, apparently under the impression that Torrech had agreed to the terms offered by GE, sent him a confirmation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> e-mail with a final severance agreement. In that e-mail, Henríquez gave Torrech information about his tax obligations, stocks, and pension plan, and asked that he return certain company property. The next day, however, on July 25, 2001, Torrech responded curtly  \"I am not going to sign anything. Tell Jeff I will see him in court.\" Despite this declaration, Torrech requested an extension of time within which to consider GE's offer. By August 3, 2001, hearing no further response from Torrech, Henríquez wrote to Torrech and reiterated the company's final severance offer, gave him an additional week to consider the terms, and informed Torrech that she would not continue negotiating with him past August 8, 2001. Immediately, Torrech requested another extension to consider the severance, and Henríquez granted him additional time until August 15, 2001. On August 10, 2001, after consulting an attorney, Torrech rejected the severance offered by GE, requested instead a lump sum payment of $400,000, and informed Henríquez that if the new sum was not accepted, he wished to return to his position as plant manager. Torrech also threatened legal action if his terms were not accepted. GE rejected Torrech's demands, and removed him from the company payroll effective August 15, 2001.</p>\n<p>Torrech filed the present action in which he alleges that he was terminated or subject to constructive discharge based on his age. Torrech brought his suit against GE in the District of Puerto Rico under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634; Puerto Rico's version of the ADEA, known as Law 100, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 146 et. seq.; and Puerto Rico's Law 80, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 185(a), which prohibits unjust dismissal.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment as to Torrech's ADEA claim and dismissed without prejudice the remaining supplemental state law claims. In doing so, the Court held that Torrech failed to establish a prima facie case of age-based discrimination. The Court went on to hold that, even assuming Torrech could meet his initial burden, and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to him, on the evidence presented, Torrech failed to establish that GE's proffered business reason for his termination was a pretext for discrimination. Torrech timely appealed, asserting that the District Court erred in its ultimate holdings and, in doing so, improperly drew inferences in favor of GE.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>This Court reviews a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>See </i><i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202298\"><a href=\"/opinion/202298/iverson-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 98 (1st Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). As was the obligation of the District Court below, we must take the facts of record in the light most flattering to the nonmovant (here, Torrech) and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>See </i><i>Iverson,</i> 452 F.3d at 98; <i>Dávila v. Corporación de Puerto Rico Para La Difusión Pública,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202880\"><a href=\"/opinion/202880/davila-v-corporacion-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 2007). \"Once the moving party avers the absence of genuine issues of material fact, the nonmovant must show that a factual dispute does exist.\" <i>Velázquez-Fernández v. NCE Foods, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202607\"><a href=\"/opinion/202607/velazquez-fernandez-v-nce-food-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Summary judgment cannot be defeated, however, \"by relying on improbable inferences, conclusory allegations or rank speculation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Torrech alleges that he was fired from his position as plant manager at GE's Humacao <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> plant because of his age. He alternatively alleges that if he wasn't fired, he was constructively discharged and replaced by a younger employee as a part of GE's efforts to rid the Humacao operation of older workers. In order to succeed on these claims, Torrech must adduce facts sufficient to support an inference of discrimination, and in doing so may not rely on bold assertions, unsupported conclusions, or optimistic surmises. <i>Bennett v. Saint-Gobain Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435201\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435201/bennett-v-saint-gobain-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2007). Because the non-movant has the burden of proof, \"the evidence adduced on each of the elements of his asserted cause of action must be significantly probative in order to forestall summary judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> As correctly found by the District Court, Torrech's efforts fail to clear this hurdle.</p>\n<p>Before setting forth the appropriate test and accompanying analysis for establishing a violation of the ADEA, we must address one of Torrech's underlying premises for this appeal. Torrech contends that the District Court, in failing to credit at face value each of his assertions, impermissibly failed to draw all inferences in his favor. While it is true that in the summary judgment context all <i>reasonable</i> inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party, the District Court is not obliged to accept as true or to deem as a disputed material fact, each and every unsupported, subjective, conclusory, or imaginative statement made to the Court by a party.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1994) (a party resisting summary judgment may not rest on mere allegations or denials, but must identify and allege specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial); <i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 10. This is particularly true where, as here, Torrech submitted as part of his objection to GE's motion for summary judgment an affidavit in which he seemingly contradicts his own deposition testimony and asserts what amount to nothing more than self-serving, factually-devoid declarations. <i>See </i><i>Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199293\"><a href=\"/opinion/199293/abreu-guzman-v-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2001) (\"a party opposing summary judgment may not manufacture a dispute of fact by contradicting his earlier sworn testimony\"); <i>Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Química P.R., Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> 105, 110 (1st Cir.2006). Therefore, insomuch as the District Court did not consider certain statements and assertions put forward by Torrech in support of his objection to GE's motion for summary judgment as constituting reliable evidence or a disputed material fact, there was no error.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the ADEA, an employer is prohibited from taking an adverse employment action against an employee who is forty years of age or older because of that employee's age. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. §§ 623(a)(1),631(a); <i>Bennett,</i> 507 F.3d at 30. \"When an employee claims to have been discharged in violation of the ADEA, he must shoulder the ultimate `burden of proving that his years were the determinative factor in his discharge, that is, that he would not have been fired but for his age.'\" <i>Davila,</i> 498 F.3d at 15 (quoting <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 823 (1st Cir.1991)). When direct evidence of age discrimination is lacking, an employee may utilize the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting framework to carry his burden. <i>Dávila,</i> 498 F.3d at 15 (citing <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1817</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973)).</p>\n<p>The initial step in the burden-shifting framework requires the employee to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. <i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 11. To do so, the plaintiff-employee must set forth facts showing each of the following: (i) that he was at least forty years old at the time of the adverse employment action complained of; (ii) that his job performance met or exceeded the employer's legitimate expectations; (iii) that his employer actually or constructively discharged him; and (iv) that his employer had a continuing need for the services he had been performing. <i>See id.</i>; <i>Cordero-Soto v. Island Fin., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201762\"><a href=\"/opinion/201762/cordero-soto-v-island-finance-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir.2005). Upon a sufficient prima facie showing, the burden of production shifts to the defendant-employer \"to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment action.\" <i>Hoffman v. Applicators Sales &amp; Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202073\"><a href=\"/opinion/202073/hoffman-v-applicators-sales/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The employer's burden is minimal  it \"need do no more than articulate a reason which, on its face, would justify a conclusion that the plaintiff was let go for a nondiscriminatory motive.\" <i>Dávila,</i> 498 F.3d at 16. Once the employer has satisfied this requirement, the burden shifts back to the employee, who must then show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \"reason given by the employer for the discharge is pretextual, and, moreover, that it is pretext for age discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted); <i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 11. \"In other words, the bottom-line question of discrimination vel non comes front and center.\" <i>Dávila,</i> 498 F.3d at 16. At this stage in the proceedings, \"this question reduces to whether or not the plaintiff has adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was fired because of his age.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Ramírez Rodríguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201844\"><a href=\"/opinion/201844/ramirez-rodriguez-v-boehringer/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p>Here, it is undisputed that Torrech, who was 50 in the summer of 2001, satisfies the age requirement of the prima facie test. As to whether Torrech's performance met or exceeded GE's legitimate expectations, the parties disagree. Torrech highlights his positive review and accompanying salary increase from January of the same year as evidence that he was meeting the legitimate expectations of his superiors. GE, on the other hand, primarily cites Torrech's own testimony as to the \"ups and downs\" experienced in the Humacao plant during his tenure there, and his admission that Humacao was \"not where I would like <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> [it] to be\" on the five matrices. The District Court considered Torrech's testimony, along with evidence establishing certain deficiencies in the Humacao plant's productivity under Torrech, to find that Torrech was not meeting his employers' expectations as plant manager at the Humacao facility.</p>\n<p>Although we agree with the District Court's ultimate decision to grant summary judgment to GE, we do not agree with its analysis or conclusion as to the second prong of the prima facie test. Despite GE's assertions that the Humacao plant was not reaching projected financial goals and that Torrech, as plant manager, was not doing enough to implement necessary change, GE has been steadfast in its position that but for Torrech's voluntary resignation, he would not have been fired. Sommer testified, and counsel reaffirmed at oral argument, that if Torrech had not voluntarily left his position, and improvement was not made in the Humacao plant, Torrech would have been placed on a structured improvement plan, not terminated. Thus, GE's tactical claim that Torrech was not meeting legitimate job expectations is directly at odds with its assertion that Torrech resigned on his own initiative, and that he was doing well enough in his role as plant manager that there were no plans to fire him.</p>\n<p>Although it is Torrech's burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, as the employer, GE cannot play fast and loose with the facts in order to position itself advantageously with regard to the burden shifting scheme of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> rubric. By simultaneously proclaiming that Torrech was doing sufficiently well as plant manager that there were no plans to get rid of him, <i>and</i> that he was failing to meet work expectations in order to legitimize his dismissal, GE improperly attempts to play both sides against the middle. This juxtaposition of claims belies the appropriateness of granting of summary judgment on this ground.</p>\n<p>Unlike situations in which an employer can document well an employee's failure to meet legitimate expectations, in this case no such documentation exists. On the contrary, as Torrech points out, the performance review conducted within six months of his decision to part ways with GE Caribe was positive, and resulted in a salary increase. Furthermore, while it is true that Torrech admitted that he could have performed better, this falls far short of proving that he has failed to meet his employer's legitimate performance expectations. An \"employee's perception of himself . . . is not relevant. [Rather,] [i]t is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant.\" <i>Karazanos v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571298\"><a href=\"/opinion/571298/57-fair-emplpraccas-bna-605-57-empl-prac-dec-p-41081-george-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 338 (7th Cir.1991) (citation omitted). There is just no factual support, save Sommer's after-the-fact testimony as to Torrech's alleged failings, for GE's assertion that Torrech was not meeting its legitimate expectations. This, coupled with GE's assertion that Torrech was performing sufficiently well enough that termination was not planned for him, undermines the District Court's conclusion on this issue. Because only a minimal evidentiary showing is necessary to satisfy an employee's burden of production at this stage, it cannot be said that Torrech did not set forth at least minimally sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment on this prong of the test. <i>Davis v. KARK-TV, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791723\"><a href=\"/opinion/791723/lesa-davis-v-kark-tv-inc-doing-business-as-morris-multimedia-nexstar/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span>, 704 (8th Cir.2005); <i>Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198801\"><a href=\"/opinion/198801/cruz-ramos-v-puerto-rico-sun/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 384 (1st Cir.2000) (burden of establishing a prima facie case is not an onerous one).</p>\n<p>Although we disagree with the District Court's analysis of the second prong of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> rubric, Torrech's claim nevertheless falls far short of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> mark on the third prong. Torrech fails to present facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude that he was discharged; and further, he has come forward with insufficient evidence of pretext. While the District Court abstained from making a determination on the third prong of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> test, we think the inquiry is determinative of Torrech's appeal. Adverse employment action, for purposes of the ADEA, includes actual or constructive discharge. On the undisputed facts of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to Torrech, we think that it is clear that Torrech resigned his position. Torrech initiated the talks that lead to his resignation, and he concedes that he expressed a desire to leave the company in exchange for a severance package. Torrech presented no facts at all, aside from his personal belief, to support his assertion that he was terminated from his position as plant manager. Finally, and most tellingly, Torrech sent to his employees an unambiguously worded resignation announcement, without being prompted or instructed to do so by GE.<sup>[2]</sup> Although Torrech denies that his letter was in fact a resignation, this argument is hard to take seriously. Torrech's words speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even Torrech does not wholeheartedly deny that he resigned. Rather, he contends that if he did resign, he was forced to do so under circumstances that amounted to constructive discharge. It is well-established that \"[j]ust as the ADEA bars an employer from dismissing an employee because of his age, so too it bars an employer from engaging in a calculated, age-inspired effort to force an employee to quit.\" <i>De La Vega v.

In support, Torrech cites to the four incidents described above  namely, the two times that Torrech was told that he lacked the same \"energy\" he once had, the meeting at which Sommer used the term \"dinosaur\" when describing the local operations, and the incident at the Humacao plant during which Sommer commented on an older employee and then later indicated that he wanted to make changes. Torrech contends that these comments led him to believe that older employees were no longer welcome at GE and that he eventually would have been fired had he not taken matters into his own hands. Regardless of how Torrech subjectively felt about these comments (assuming they were made and intended to be age-related), these incidents alone do not amount to constructive discharge.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Alfieri v.

There is no factual support in the record for Torrech's assertion that if he had not voluntarily done so, he would have been fired. There is only Torrech's claim that this was his subjective belief.

He relies on little else to establish that he was compelled to resign by threat of imminent termination. However, apprehension of future termination is insufficient to establish constructive discharge  instead, an employee \"is obliged `not to assume the worst, and not to jump to conclusions too fast.'\" <i>Agnew,</i> 286 F.3d at 310 (quoting <i>Garner v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480789\"><a href=\"/opinion/480789/lana-e-garner-cross-appellant-v-wal-mart-stores-inc-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1536</span></a></span>, 1539 (11th Cir.1987)). Here, even accepting as true all <i>facts</i> alleged by Torrech, nothing presented to us evidences any immediate intent on the part of GE to rid itself of older employees, including Torrech. The bottom line is that Torrech's resignation was grossly premature, as it was based entirely on his own worst-case-scenario assumption as to his future at GE.</p>\n<p>In the alternative, Torrech also alludes to the negotiations leading up to his eventual removal from the company payroll as a constructive discharge. He posits that he was subject to a \"take it or leave it\" offer, whereby he was forced to choose between retirement and involuntary termination. Putting aside the inconsistency of these two theories for a moment, Torrech's conduct was nothing short of a deceptive bait and switch tactic, something which this Court cannot condone. We explain: Torrech first declared his desire to resign on June 18, 2001. One month later, after GE gave him a close to, if not final, offer as to a severance package, Torrech tentatively indicated his agreement with it, unilaterally announced his resignation to his employees, and stopped working. Then, for several weeks following his resignation, Torrech continued to negotiate with the human resources representative as to the details of his severance package. On August 10, 2001, Torrech increased his severance demand by $250,000<sup>[5]</sup> to $400,000, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> well beyond the terms discussed, and nearly agreed-upon by the parties in the previous weeks. More tellingly, Torrech simultaneously warned GE that if his new demands were rejected he wanted his job back, <i>and</i> threatened legal action if his ultimatum were not accepted.<sup>[6]</sup> This is a classic bait and switch: Torrech initiated interest in a severance arrangement  he offered his resignation under what appeared to be a reasonable request for severance (which was met almost fully by GE), resigned and left work, and then rebuked GE's good faith offer by suddenly demanding a sum grossly out of proportion with the previous discussions. Then, to add insult to injury, Torrech threatened that if he did not receive his sought after plunder, he wanted his job back  the one from which he had already resigned and for which a replacement had been selected  or else.</p>\n<p>GE's unwillingness to accede to Torrech's demands does not transform Torrech's resignation into a termination. Torrech selectively cites this Court's language in <i>Vega,</i> 3 F.3d at 480, in which we discussed the circumstances under which an offer of early retirement may be transformed into constructive discharge. There, we counseled \"a plaintiff who has accepted an employer's offer to retire can be said to have been constructively discharged when the offer presented was, at rock bottom, `a choice between early retirement with benefits or discharge without benefits.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). This case is clearly distinguishable from <i>Vega</i> in at least one crucial way  Torrech voluntarily resigned, without prompting or coercion by GE. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>As discussed above, Torrech presents no evidence suggestive of a plot by GE to rid itself of older employees or specifically to terminate Torrech. Rather, Torrech's resignation was unforced, driven by his willingness to part ways with his employer in exchange for a severance. GE's offer, and subsequent refusal, when faced with Torrech's bait and switch, either to pay Torrech's inflated demand or reinstate him, is not the \"impermissible take-it-or-leave-it choice between retirement or discharge\" that <i>Vega</i> describes. Under these circumstances, an employer is not obligated to reinstate an employee who voluntarily resigned, nor is it obligated to continue severance negotiations with an employee whose demands were becoming increasingly unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Although the District Court below hesitated to decide the question of whether Torrech was discharged or resigned because it found summary judgment was proper on other grounds, we are of the view, after taking the facts in the light most favorable to Torrech, that Torrech's separation from GE was without any serious doubt a voluntary resignation. Summary judgment was and is warranted on this ground.</p>\n<p>If more were needed, and we believe it is not, Torrech's claim also fails for absence of pretext.<sup>[7]</sup> In his briefs before this Court, Torrech relies on his subjective opinions as to the motivations and intentions of Sommer and GE, few of which are fact-based. As detailed above, personal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> opinion, unsupported by fact, is not sufficiently probative on the issue of pretext. <i>See generally </i><i>Cruz-Ramos,</i> 202 F.3d at 385 n. 3. The only facts Torrech cites to show that GE's actions were but a pretext for age discrimination are the allegedly discriminatory comments made to Torrech. The first two incidents involved comments that Torrech seemed to lack energy. It is well-established that \"energy,\" as well as similarly defined terms, does not necessarily connote youth or other age-related characteristics. <i>See </i><i>Erickson v. Farmland Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775579\"><a href=\"/opinion/775579/robert-e-erickson-v-farmland-industries-inc-a-missouri-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span>, 730 (8th Cir.2001) (energy is a legitimate performance issue not facially related to age); <i>Luks v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></span>, 1055 (7th Cir.2006) (employer's \"expressed interest in `higher energy' employees, although potentially consistent with age discrimination, is not by itself direct evidence of such discrimination\"); <i>Fortier v. Ameritech Mobile Commc'ns Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759556\"><a href=\"/opinion/759556/fernand-l-fortier-iii-v-ameritech-mobile-communications-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span>, 1113 (7th Cir.1998) (\"Standard usage and common sense dictate that `energetic' means active . . . [and] simply cannot support a determination of age bias.\"). Here, Torrech does not allege that the energy comments were made in the context of an age-related discussion, nor did he ask Sommer or Gasaway what they meant by their comments. Thus, even assuming, for purposes of summary judgment, that the comments were not related to GE's \"Four E\" mantra, they are insufficient to establish discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p>As for Sommer's dinosaur comment, even assuming, despite witness testimony to the contrary, that Sommer's statement communicated a personal belief, it does not on its face evidence age-related animus or bias.<sup>[8]</sup> Standard usage of the term \"dinosaur\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> does not convey an age-related message. Rather, as defined by Merriam-Webster, \"dinosaur\" means \"impractically large, out-of-date, or obsolete.\" <i>Merriam-Webster's</i> Collegiate Dictionary 326 (10th ed.2002). This definition comports entirely with Sommer's explanation, corroborated by witnesses, that his statement referred to the out-dated practices and machines still used in the Puerto Rico factories. Given the context of Sommer's statement  made during a manager assimilation meeting at Old San Juan's Hard Rock Café, in response to an inquiry as to how corporate headquarters viewed GE's Puerto Rico operation, and without any reference to any specific employee and his or her age  this comment amounts to little more than a stray remark insufficient to establish discriminatory animus. <i>See Velazquez-Fernandez,</i> 476 F.3d at 11-12 (\"stray workplace remarks . . . normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus\").</p>\n<p>Torrech admits that Sommer's dinosaur reference \"by itself does not suggest more than Sommer's feeling toward older employees in general.\" He posits, however, that the comment, Sommer's desire for change, and an alleged series of appointments of younger employees, including his own replacement by a man nearly twenty years his junior, supports an inference of age discrimination. In his briefs, Torrech asserts that in Sommer's first four months as President and General Manager of Caribe GE, he decreased the average age of plant manager from forty-one to thirty-four. Aside from Torrech's replacement by a man in his early thirties, Torrech does not provide evidentiary support for his assertion. Torrech seemingly admits, however, that there was no policy, whether explicit or implicit, of excluding employees over the age of forty or otherwise favoring employees under that age.<sup>[9]</sup> Instead, Torrech asserts that if appointments of individuals over the age of fifty were made, Sommer was not responsible for them.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Sommer's personal appointment history is of little importance  what is telling, however, is Torrech's failure to deny that many high-level appointments of individuals within the protected class<sup>[10]</sup> were made in the Puerto Rico organization during the relevant time frame.<sup>[11]</sup> On the whole, while Torrech attempts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> to paint himself a part of a pattern of discriminatory conduct, his efforts are unsuccessful. Rather, the record is devoid of evidence to support any discriminatory behavior on the part of GE. On these facts, Torrech cannot show that GE's acceptance of his resignation was pretextual.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court's grant of summary judgment as to Torrech's ADEA claims. Supplemental state law claims remain dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Torrech's Counterstatement of Material Facts in Controversy and Statement of Objections contains numerous statements by Torrech that, while representing Torrech's own subjective interpretation of seemingly innocuous words and actions on the part of Sommer, are presented as material facts. Such representations include Torrech's statements, citing only to his own deposition, that \"Among the ideas that Sommer allegedly brought as GM was the idea of getting rid of old people in the [Puerto Rico] organization.\" Likewise, as support for his discrimination claim, and as part of his denial of GE's assertion that Sommer wanted to improve Humacao plant operations, Torrech includes the following as a <i>material fact</i>  \"Sommer's message [when he handed to Torrech his recent, positive, performance review] was clear: `you are an old man and I do not care about how you have performed or about how Paul Sledzick thinks you are performing. I am going to get you out anyway because of your age.'\" It is important to reiterate that these are quotations of Torrech's own thoughts  not words alleged to have been spoken by Sommer. Torrech makes numerous similar assertions and argues that inferences must be drawn in his favor based on these musings. We are not obliged to take at face value Torrech's subjective beliefs when they are not factually based and merely constitute conclusory, self-serving statements. <i>See </i><i>Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628958\"><a href=\"/opinion/628958/62-fair-emplpraccas-1198-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42530-17-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 479 (1st Cir. 1993) (material creating a factual dispute \"must herald the existence of `definite, competent evidence' fortifying the plaintiff's version of the truth\"). Thus, the District Court's disregard for certain statements and allegations put forward by Torrech does not constitute an impermissible failure to draw all inferences in his favor, nor does it amount to impermissible inference-drawing in favor of the moving party.</p>\n<p>[2]  Torrech's unprompted e-mail of July 24, 2001, sent <i>before</i> a company-wide announcement was made, stated: \"After 27 wonderful years with GE, I have decided to a change of pace and to pursue my own business opportunity more in tone with my present plan for life and health condition. You have been a great team and we did great things together. Thank you for letting me be your leader this past year. God bless you all. Néstor.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  In support for his argument that he resigned because he otherwise would have been fired, Torrech cites to an e-mail written by Sommer and sent to Roger Gasaway, Henríquez, and another human resources representative, in which Sommer describes putting together an \"exit plan\" for Torrech. Torrech cites the e-mail as proof that GE planned to get rid of him. His assertion, however, is undercut by the rest of the e-mail and the context in which it was written. The subject e-mail was written two days after Torrech's June 18, 2001 phone call to Henríquez in which he initiated resignation negotiations. The e-mail does not reveal any nefarious intent on the part of Sommer. Rather, it informs Gasaway, Sommer's superior, of Torrech's decision, and updates him on the \"exit plan\" for Torrech, as well as the necessary plans to fill the open position resulting from Torrech's departure.</p>\n<p>[4]  GE maintains that there were no plans to fire or otherwise replace Torrech. Instead, as discussed above, Sommer testified that if Torrech had remained, and the Humacao plant had continued to have difficulties in the five matrices, Torrech likely would have been put on an improvement plan. Such a placement does not constitute a constructive discharge. <i>See </i><i>Agnew v. BASF Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777221\"><a href=\"/opinion/777221/richard-agnew-linda-agnew-v-basf-corporation-a-delaware-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 310 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>[5]  In an e-mail dated July 22, 2001, Torrech sought a lump sum payment of $150,000 as well as two months' salary. As of August 3, 2001, GE offered to Torrech a lump sum payment of $150,000 plus one month's salary. In his demand letter of August 10, 2001, Torrech increased his demand to $400,000 and threatened legal action should his dun be rejected.</p>\n<p>[6]  Upon Torrech's rejection of the severance package offered by GE, he was taken off of the company payroll effective August 15, 2001.</p>\n<p>[7]  Torrech concedes that GE meets its burden of articulating a non-discriminatory reason for terminating him.</p>\n<p>[8]  District courts outside of the First Circuit have addressed similar statements when assessing whether the term \"dinosaur\" is evidence of pretext.

April 26, 2002) (summary judgment precluded where evidence established that a company's hiring managers viewed older employees as \"dinosaurs\" and where discriminatory hiring practices were evident).</p>\n<p>[9]  On the contrary, Torrech asserts that Sommer's oldest personal appointee to plant manager was forty-two years old.</p>\n<p>[10]  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act protects persons forty years of age or older. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 631(a).</p>\n<p>[11]  GE's Statement of Uncontested Facts submitted to the District Court contained three separate paragraphs in which GE listed, individually, each of Sommer's plant manager appointments since he became President and General Manager of Caribe GE, including the age of each appointee, as well as appointments made to positions at the same level as or higher than plant manager, along with the ages of said appointees, as well as Sommer's appointments outside of Puerto Rico, of employees in their forties, fifties, and sixties. In his Counterstatement, Torrech makes a blanket denial of all three paragraphs of GE's Statement of Undisputed Facts. In support, Torrech simply declares that since Sommer's arrival he has not appointed any plant manager over the age of forty-two, and that other appointments of older individuals, if made, were not done by Sommer. Torrech's record citations on these issues do not support his contentions and his blanket, factually unsupported denial does not create a material dispute of fact. Furthermore, even a denial does not suffice to establish, as Torrech attempts, a series of appointments of younger individuals at or around the time of Torrech's resignation.</p>\n\n</div>",
