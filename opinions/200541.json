This    appeal       concerns   claims,\n\ncomplicated both factually and legally, arising from an ill-starred\n\nhousehold move. On June 16, 2000, Ronald and Liz Rankin contracted\n\nwith Right-On-Time Moving & Storage, Inc. (\"ROTMS\") to transport\n\ntheir possessions from California to Maine.                    ROTMS subcontracted\n\nwith SI Trucking, Inc. (\"SI\") to handle most of the move.                             The\n\nRankins had homeowners insurance policies in force with Allstate\n\nInsurance Company (\"Allstate\") and Concord General Mutual Insurance\n\nCompany (\"Concord\"), one covering the origin residence and one the\n\ndestination.\n\n             ROTMS employees picked up the Rankins' possessions in\n\nCalifornia in June 2000 and brought them to a warehouse.                               SI\n\nemployees then transferred them to an SI truck for transportation\n\nand delivery.       When SI arrived at the Rankins' new home in Maine on\n\nJuly   24,    2000,       the   Rankins    discovered         that    some    of   their\n\npossessions had been damaged and that many others were missing.\n\nUpon delivery, the SI movers could not account for the damaged or\n\nmissing    items    and     became    abusive     and    threatening         toward   the\n\nRankins.\n\n             Shortly thereafter, the Rankins notified their insurer,\n\nAllstate, which hired an adjuster to determine what goods were\n\ndamaged and their value.              In August 2000, the Rankins provided\n\nAllstate     with     a    detailed    list     of     lost    or     damaged      items,\n\nsupplemented with more information in September.                         The task of\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fappraisal was substantial as the list comprised a large array of\n\nobjects,   including   household   goods,   electronics,   artwork,   and\n\nfurniture.   In September, their attorney sent Allstate a demand\n\nletter.\n\n           The Allstate policy covered theft and damage to property\n\nin transit but, on Allstate's reading, did not cover items that\n\nwere merely misplaced by the carrier.        Allstate maintained in an\n\nOctober 2000 letter that the Rankins' missing goods were not\n\ncovered by the policy because it was unclear whether they were\n\nstolen or merely misplaced in a carrier or warehouse.       On December\n\n19, 2000, the Rankins filed a police report about the missing\n\ngoods, convinced by now that their property had in fact been\n\nstolen.\n\n           On January 23, 2001, Allstate sent a worksheet to the\n\nRankins giving its appraisal of the damaged items, but making no\n\nmention of the larger number of stolen items.     In the Rankins' view\n\nat the time, the damage to the items that were delivered amounted\n\nto about $24,000-–of which Allstate's share was half.1      On February\n\n12, 2001, Allstate agreed to pay $6,000 to satisfy what it claimed\n\nwas its share of the losses stemming from the damaged goods.          The\n\nnext day the Rankins gave Allstate an itemized account of their\n\n\n     1\n      The Concord policy covered damage but not theft and all\nparties appear to agree that, as to damaged property, Allstate and\nConcord were each liable for half. Concord ultimately valued the\nlosses from damage at around $24,000, and paid half of that amount\nto the Rankins in February 2002.\n\n                                   -3-\n\flosses, calculating the total loss (damaged goods and stolen goods)\n\nat $97,583 (a figure the Rankins later raised to $106,000).\n\n             On March 2, 2001, the Rankins brought suit against ROTMS\n\nand Allstate in federal district court in Maine.                The original\n\ncomplaint alleged inter alia that ROTMS had violated the Carmack\n\nAmendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. § 14706 (2000),\n\nwhich imposes something close to strict liability upon originating\n\nand   delivering     carriers,    and   that   Allstate   had   breached   its\n\ncontract with the Rankins by failing to provide the benefits due\n\nthem under the insurance policy.\n\n             In June 2001, the Rankins added SI as a defendant,\n\nclaiming against it under the Carmack Amendment and separately for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress based on the behavior\n\nof the employees who delivered the load and abused the Rankins.\n\nThe same amendment added a claim against Allstate under Maine's\n\nUnfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (\"UCSPA\"), 24-A M.R.S.A. §\n\n2436-A(1)(E) (2000), which imposes attorneys' fees and interest for\n\nan insurer's unreasonable failure to make timely settlement of\n\ninsurance claims.\n\n             The magistrate judge empowered by consent to act as the\n\ndistrict court, 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) (2000), permitted the addition\n\nof    the   new   claims   and   defendants    but   deferred   then-existing\n\ndiscovery deadlines. The Rankins and Allstate made obligatory\n\ndisclosures and conducted some discovery. When SI failed to answer\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe amended complaint, the Rankins in September 2001 sought and\n\nreceived entry of default against it.       Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a).        On\n\nSeptember 14, 2001, the court set a new discovery deadline of\n\nDecember 14, 2001.\n\n           In October 2001, all parties had an informal settlement\n\nconference.   Allstate thereafter requested a copy of the police\n\nreport filed by the Rankins in December 2000, which the Rankins\n\nthen provided.   Allstate did not depose the Rankins–-it had their\n\nrecorded statements--but Concord did take their deposition in\n\nDecember 2001.   Allstate did depose ROTMS and also asked that its\n\nadjuster be allowed to contact the Rankins directly.\n\n           Shortly after the discovery deadline and not long before\n\nthe scheduled    trial   date   of   February   11,   2002,   Allstate,   on\n\nDecember 19, 2001, sent a letter invoking an arbitration provision\n\nin the policy for resolving disputes as to the amount of loss or\n\ndamage.2   The Rankins rejected this demand as coming too late.\n\nAllstate then, on December 26, 2001, sent the Rankins a check for\n\n$38,500, as purported full payment for the theft claims–-which the\n\nRankins had estimated as approximately $82,000.\n\n           Allstate then sought summary judgment on the claims\n\nagainst it.   The court granted the motion on March 25, 2002, as to\n\n\n\n     2\n      The arbitration provision, limited to valuation disputes,\nprovided for each side to appoint an appraiser and, if the two\nappraisers could not agree, to select an \"umpire\" whose decision\nwould be final.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcertain claims not pressed on this appeal but denied the motion as\n\nto the Rankins' contract and UCSPA claims with which we are now\n\nconcerned.    Trial was rescheduled for August 2002, and the parties\n\nwere ordered to confer and provide further information to each\n\nother.   In consequence, Allstate paid the Rankins two further sums\n\n(totaling a little over $25,000) on account of the theft claim in\n\nMay and July 2002.     This brought the total payments for theft to\n\nabout $63,500--still about $19,000 short of the Rankins' final\n\nestimate.\n\n             On July 11, 2002, the court reconsidered sua sponte its\n\ndenials of summary judgment, invited a new motion by Allstate, and\n\ndeferred the trial again. On September 16, 2002, the court granted\n\nthe motion for summary judgment, resolving both the contract claim\n\nand the UCSPA claim in favor of Allstate.      Thereafter the court\n\nheld a hearing on November 6, 2002, to determine SI's liability on\n\nthe default and heard evidence from the Rankins as to the amount of\n\ntheir property losses and as to their emotional distress claims.\n\nThe next day it awarded $150,000 on the latter but--on grounds\n\ndescribed below--denied recovery on the former.\n\n             In the course of the litigation, the Rankins settled\n\ntheir disputes with ROTMS and Concord out of court.     The Rankins\n\nhave now appealed from the district court's dismissal of their\n\ncontract and UCSPA claims against Allstate and the refusal of the\n\ndistrict court to award damages on their property loss claim\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fagainst SI.      We consider the issues on appeal in the same order.\n\nOn the grant of summary judgment, our review is de novo.           Roche v.\n\nJohn Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 253 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nAs   to   the   ruling   on   the   default   judgment   determination,   the\n\nstandard of review depends upon the basis for the ruling.\n\n            Contract Claims.        In a nutshell, the Rankins say that\n\nAllstate breached its insurance contract by failing to make timely\n\npayment for all covered losses; that Allstate's share of the losses\n\nis still not completely paid--a further breach of contract; and,\n\nfinally, that Allstate cannot rely on the arbitration provision for\n\ntwo reasons: that Allstate itself breached the contract and that it\n\nfailed to invoke the arbitration provision in a timely manner.\n\n            The magistrate judge concluded that the delays in payment\n\nwere explainable in light of the changing nature of the Rankins'\n\nclaims and various litigation-related events and that no reasonable\n\njury could find otherwise.          As to the remaining gap between what\n\nAllstate paid and the Rankins' larger estimate of losses, the\n\nmagistrate judge stated that \"Allstate is entitled to invoke the\n\ncontract provision requiring arbitration of any remaining disputes\n\nregarding the value of items stolen or damaged.\"\n\n            Whether Allstate unreasonably delayed payment of what was\n\ndue, whether it stills owes money, and whether it lost its right to\n\ninvoke the arbitration provision are three different questions,\n\nalbeit set against the same background facts and intertwined with\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\feach other (and with the Rankins' separate statutory claim based on\n\nunreasonable delay).\n\n            We start with the question whether Allstate unreasonably\n\ndelayed making payment of what was (or still is) due to the\n\nRankins.    More precisely, the question is whether summary judgment\n\nshould have been granted by the magistrate judge on that issue.\n\nOur conclusion is that the undue delay question presents a jury\n\nissue, assuming arguendo that there is a contractual obligation to\n\nact diligently.     The reasons why the delay question could not be\n\ndecided on summary judgment are more appropriately set forth in our\n\nlater discussion of the statutory claim, where the answer clearly\n\nmatters.\n\n            Quite likely the answer does not matter in the case of\n\nthe contract claim.       Whatever may still be due under the policy for\n\ndirect losses (that is, for direct damage to or loss of insured\n\ngoods) is due regardless of whether there has been delay.                 The\n\nRankins have suggested only two reasons why delay itself may be\n\npertinent    to   their    contract    claim:   first,   as   a   basis   for\n\nconsequential damages and second, as a basis for rejecting the\n\narbitration demand.       The first is doubtful and the second wrong.\n\n            There is only the barest hint that the Rankins are\n\nseriously seeking consequential damages, that is, damages not for\n\nthe direct loss but in consequence of it.          In his deposition, Ron\n\nRankin indicated quite tersely that because his new house was awash\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin damaged furnishings, he could not use it for some in-house\n\nmeeting or demonstration relating to his work.              Almost nothing\n\nabout this is said in his appellate briefs and it strikes us as an\n\nimprobable claim.\n\n           The Rankins have not briefed the question whether the\n\npolicy permits liability for consequential damages; nor is it clear\n\nthat such a claim would turn on undue delay; nor is it especially\n\nplausible that either the damage to furnishings or the delay in\n\nreimbursement prevented Rankin from conducting business from home.\n\nThis has more the feel of a kitchen-sink claim than anything likely\n\nto be pursued on the remand that is otherwise required because of\n\nthe statutory consequences of any undue delay.\n\n           The other reason why the Rankins say undue delay is\n\nrelevant   under    the   contract   concerns   the   arbitration   clause.\n\nDescribing the delay as a \"total\" breach of contract by Allstate,\n\nas opposed to a partial breach, the Rankins say that the total\n\nbreach   prevents    Allstate   from   taking   advantage   of   any   other\n\nprovision of the contract, including the arbitration clause. Undue\n\ndelay or not, we think that on the facts of this case no one could\n\nreasonably conclude that the delay is the kind of breach that would\n\ndefeat the arbitration clause, if timely invoked (which is a\n\ndifferent question).\n\n           Arbitration clauses are often invoked precisely because\n\none side claims, and the other denies, that a contract has been\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fviolated.     Some violations may be so broad and fundamental that\n\nthey should prevent the wrongdoer from invoking the arbitration\n\nprovision itself.    But for obvious reasons of doctrine and policy,\n\nthis requires something more than a claim by one side that the\n\nother paid some of what was due a bit too slowly and is insisting\n\non arbitration as to the rest under a provision explicitly designed\n\nto resolve disputes about value.       County of Middlesex v. Gevyn\n\nConstr. Corp., 450 F.2d 53, 56 (1st Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405\n\nU.S. 955 (1972); 15 Corbin on Contracts § 1443, at 388-89 (interim\n\ned. 1962).\n\n            Whether the arbitration is defeated by Allstate's delay\n\nin invoking the clause is a different issue commonly addressed\n\nunder the heading \"waiver,\" here meaning forfeiture rather than\n\nintentional relinquishment.      The Rankins support their waiver\n\nargument by invoking a Maine insurance law provision requiring\n\ntimely reservation of defenses by the insurer, 24-A M.R.S.A. §\n\n2436-A(1)(D); but it is not clear whether this provision applies at\n\nall to an arbitration clause, and there is not much state law\n\nprecedent as to the statute.\n\n             Yet an arbitration provision has to be invoked in a\n\ntimely manner or the option is lost.    See, e.g., Menorah Ins. Co.,\n\nLtd. v. INX Reinsurance Corp., 72 F.3d 218, 221-22 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\nSaga Communications of New England v. Voornas, 756 A.2d   954, 959-\n\n61 (Me. 2000).    Under federal law, such a forfeiture is an issue\n\n\n                                -10-\n\ffor the judge, Menorah, 72 F.3d at 220, and, pertinent fact\n\nfindings by the judge aside (which would be reviewed for clear\n\nerror), our review is plenary.             Id.    Where we are dealing with a\n\nforfeiture by inaction (as opposed to an explicit waiver), the\n\ncomponents of waiver of an arbitration clause are undue delay and\n\na modicum of prejudice to the other side.                Id. at 221-22.3\n\n                 In this instance, by February 2001 the parties were in\n\ndisagreement not only about whether the missing items were covered\n\nat all–-not an issue subject to arbitration-–but also about the\n\nvalue of damaged items, value being the arbitrable issue.                       Yet\n\nAllstate neither invoked the arbitration clause at that time nor\n\ndid it in its April 2001 answer to the complaint filed in March\n\n2001.       Nor did it assert its right to arbitrate value in June 2001\n\nwhen       the   Rankins'   final   list   of    lost   and   damaged   items   and\n\nestimates was delivered and when the likelihood of theft was fairly\n\nobvious.\n\n                 Ordinarily, arbitration is provided for the dispute, not\n\nsome limited aspect of it, so the precedents tend to insist that an\n\n\n\n       3\n      Although the parties do not discuss the question,\narbitration-related issues in this case are probably governed by\nthe Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (2000). If so,\nfederal law would automatically govern waiver issues, S & H\nContractors v. A.J. Taft Coal Co., 906 F.2d 1507, 1514 (11th Cir.\n1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1026 (1991); Saga, 756 A.2d at 958-\n59, although there is no indication that Maine law differs as to\nthe requirements for waiver.      See Design Dwellings, Inc. v.\nLabrecque, No. Civ. A. RE-00-039, 2001 WL 1710593, at *1 (Me.\nSuper. Apr. 5, 2001).\n\n                                       -11-\n\farbitration   clause   be   invoked   at   the   earliest   opportunity.\n\nE.g., Cabinetree of Wis., Inc. v. Kraftmaid Cabinetry, Inc., 50\n\nF.3d 388, 391 (7th Cir. 1995).          If arbitration is invoked in\n\nresponse to a lawsuit, this must be done early on in the case so\n\nresources are not needlessly deployed.       E.g., Menorah, 72 F.3d at\n\n221.   Here, the situation is somewhat different:      the arbitration\n\nclause applies only to disputes about value and not to other\n\nquestions, including in this case whether certain of the goods were\n\nstolen and so covered at all.\n\n              Even so, it is still hard to see why arbitration was\n\nnot demanded once the suit had been brought and the Rankins'\n\nestimated losses had been firmed up in June 2001. Admittedly some,\n\nperhaps most, of the disagreements as to value concerned items as\n\nto which coverage was still disputed–-although it is not easy to\n\nunderstand why theft was doubtful by June 2001.        Still, discovery\n\nin the suit was open until December 2001, the delays being no\n\napparent fault of Allstate and owing something to the Rankins'\n\naddition of new claims and defendants in June 2001.\n\n           It is true that discovery could narrow the arbitrable\n\nissues or even produce a settlement, and sometimes arbitrating as\n\nto value might make no sense until after discovery or even after\n\ntrial (e.g., if liability itself could only be determined at\n\ntrial). Yet our concern here is with when a timely demand for\n\narbitration must be made, not when the arbitration itself occurs.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fAnd knowing early on, or at least after suit is brought what\n\nprocedures are to be followed--specifically, whether arbitration is\n\nsought   as    to   arbitrable   issues--is    a   condition   of   efficient\n\nplanning by the court and in protecting the opponent against\n\nprejudice.\n\n              We need not fashion some mechanical rule embracing all\n\npossible cases.      It is sufficient here that by waiting until after\n\ndiscovery had closed and the long-scheduled trial date had almost\n\narrived, Allstate did unduly delay in invoking the arbitration\n\nclause in this case.       Certainly by June 2001, Allstate ought to\n\nhave known that theft coverage was likely to apply and that it\n\nwould dispute some of the theft claims as to value, the Rankins\n\nhaving asserted these claims throughout and given their own dollar\n\nfigures as early as February 2001.\n\n              But was there any prejudice from the delay?       The Rankins\n\nsay that they told Allstate in September 2000, after Allstate's\n\nappraiser had a chance to examine the property, that they (the\n\nRankins) planned to dispose of broken or damaged items, which they\n\nthen did.       Now, they say they have been prejudiced because--\n\narbitration     having   been    belatedly   demanded--they    have   nothing\n\n(beyond photographs) to show the experts who act as appraisers\n\nunder the policy.         Allstate does not deny the allegation or\n\notherwise respond to the waiver argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          The absence of the damaged items themselves does not help\n\nthe Rankins very much.      The Rankins cannot have supposed that\n\nAllstate was conceding value and, seemingly, the now disposed of\n\nproperty would have been as useful (or useless) in a jury trial as\n\nin arbitration.     A better argument, at least hinted at, is that\n\nthere is prejudice inherent in wasted trial preparation when an\n\narbitration demand is made, and effectively granted, after many\n\nmonths of delay and only six weeks before a long-scheduled trial.\n\n          In our view, this is enough in this case.   The prejudice\n\nshowing required is tame at best, Menorah, 72 F.3d at 222, and\n\nAllstate's failure to address the issue in its brief is itself a\n\nkind of waiver.   Brandt v. Wand Partners, 242 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   If there were no hint of prejudice, that would be a\n\ndifferent matter.    But as the case stands, we think that Allstate\n\nhas forfeited its right to arbitration and that value disputes\n\nshould be tried in court, along with the statutory claim to which\n\nwe now turn.4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      In the alternative, Allstate says that it is entitled to\nsummary judgment on the contract claim because the Rankins failed\nto present any evidence regarding the value of their possessions at\nthe summary judgment stage and thus did not meet their burden of\nproof.   However, the Rankins gave their own estimates of their\nproperty's value, and owner valuation is sufficient to show\ndamages. Fredette v. Allied Van Lines, Inc., 66 F.3d 369, 372-73\n(1st Cir. 1995); Glidden v. Belden, 684 A.2d 1306, 1320 (Me. 1996).\nAllstate also apparently failed to raise the issue before the\nmagistrate judge. Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                -14-\n\f          The Statutory Claim. This claim, understandably, is a\n\nmajor focus of Allstate's attention.            The difference between\n\nAllstate and   the   Rankins   in   valuation   of    damaged   and   stolen\n\nproperty is fairly limited (about $25,000).              By contrast, if\n\nAllstate violated its duty under the UCSPA to make timely payment,\n\nit is liable for attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest.               To\n\nstate our conclusion at the outset, we think that the question\n\nwhether Allstate complied with its duty of prompt settlement under\n\nthe statute is complicated, arguably close, and (alas) not subject\n\nto resolution on summary judgment.\n\n          The Maine statute says that an insured is entitled to\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest (one and a half\n\npercent interest per month on damages) if the insurer, \"[w]ithout\n\njust cause,\" fails to \"effectuate prompt, fair and equitable\n\nsettlement of claims submitted in which liability has become\n\nreasonably clear.\" 24-A M.R.S.A. § 2436-A(1)(E). The statute thus\n\nhas two conditions and is narrowly construed, Marquis v. Farm\n\nFamily Mut. Ins. Co., 628 A.2d 644, 651 (Me. 1993); but seemingly\n\nthe insurer (absent good cause) must pay claims clearly due even\n\nthough other claims from the same incident are open to dispute,\n\nCurtis v. Allstate Ins. Co., 787 A.2d 760, 768-69 (Me. 2002), and\n\nwhether or not there is pending litigation.          County Forest Prods.,\n\nInc. v. Green Mountain Agency, Inc., 758 A.2d 59, 68 n.4 (Me.\n\n2000).\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f             Here, by February 2001, Allstate knew that the listed\n\nproperty had been undelivered for more than six months and that the\n\nRankins were claiming that it had been stolen.              Perhaps it did not\n\nknow that the Rankins had filed a police report in December 2000,\n\na condition of a theft claim under the policy; but if this were the\n\nconcern, Allstate could easily have objected on this ground and\n\nwould have been given a copy of the report, as it was later when it\n\nrequested a copy.      Allstate apparently offered no such objection.\n\n             Allstate had no obligation to take the Rankins' word as\n\nto whether the property had been stolen, what items were still\n\nmissing or what the items were worth.             As to the first, it could\n\nhave contacted the carriers and the police; as to the second, the\n\nRankins     were   there   to   be   interrogated    (and    several   recorded\n\nstatements were taken); and as to the third, the arbitration\n\nprovision could have been invoked. But under the statute, Allstate\n\ndid have a duty to investigate, cf. Masters v. Allstate Ins. Co.,\n\nNo. 99-37-B, 1999 WL 33117068, at *2 (D. Me. Sept. 20, 1999), and\n\nnot just wait to be sued–-unless it wanted to face claims under\n\nUCSPA.\n\n             The magistrate judge-–whose reasoning is heavily relied\n\nupon   by   Allstate--said      this   in     substance:   that   matters   were\n\nuncertain until early 2001 and once litigation had begun in March\n\n2001, discovery rules prevented Allstate from engaging in discovery\n\nuntil the court ordered or the parties so agreed, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f26(d); that when the \"discovery window\" opened on May 7, 2001, with\n\nan order by the court, it was closed again in mid-June by the court\n\ndue to the Rankins' own addition of new claims and defendants and\n\ndid not reopen until a new order in mid-September 2001, setting a\n\nthree month discovery schedule.\n\n            At that point, Allstate did ask for the earlier police\n\nreport made by the Rankins in December 2000, conducted a deposition\n\nof   an   ROTMS   employee   in   November   2001,   and   presumably   took\n\nadvantage of Concord's deposition of the Rankins in December 2001.\n\nOn December 19, 2001, not long after discovery closed, Allstate\n\npaid the Rankins $38,510 on the theft claims (later payments\n\nfollowed in May and July 2002).        It also invoked the arbitration\n\nclause as to the remaining claims.\n\n            As to the first payment, the magistrate judge said that\n\nthree months from mid-September to mid-December was as a matter of\n\nlaw not an unreasonable delay. And, as to the subsequent payments,\n\nthe magistrate judge said, given the complexity of the case, the\n\nfailure of Allstate to \"immediately pay all the money [the Rankins]\n\ndemanded,\" was not a violation of the statute.         This may mean that\n\nthe magistrate judge deemed the amounts over and above the initial\n\npayment to be reasonably disputable until paid in the spring and\n\nsummer of 2002, although the point is not discussed in detail.\n\n              We do not think that the magistrate judge's assessment\n\nis unreasonable, and we would likely defer if it were a mixed\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\ffinding of an issue properly committed to the magistrate judge. In\n\nre Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1st Cir. 1993). And admittedly,\n\nassessing what is reasonable behavior in the context of litigation\n\nrules and procedures is not the easiest task for a jury.    But this\n\nassessment under the UCSPA, unlike the arbitration waiver question,\n\nis committed to the jury unless a reasonable jury could decide it\n\nonly one way.5\n\n          The precedents today are far more favorable to summary\n\njudgment than they once were, e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\n\nU.S. 317, 321-23 (1986), and Maine courts do not lightly impose\n\nliability under UCSPA.   Marquis, 628 A.2d at 651.   Still, the Maine\n\nstatute does not make litigation a blanket excuse for inaction by\n\nthe insurer, County Forest, 758 A.2d at 68 n.4, nor did the\n\nmagistrate judge say otherwise--and we think that a jury, even\n\nafter being told how discovery rules limited Allstate, could--if\n\nthe trial evidence matches the present record--take a different\n\nview of Allstate's behavior without being deemed irrational.    This\n\nis so in two, and possibly three, respects.\n\n          First, admittedly, proof that the goods were likely\n\nstolen emerged only over the course of time.   But with even modest\n\n\n\n     5\n      Assuming the matter is fairly debatable, juries in federal\ncourt usually decide whether conduct was \"reasonable,\" e.g.,\nThacker v. City of Columbus, 328 F.3d 244, 255 (6th Cir. 2003).\nUnder the Seventh Amendment, it would not matter whether Maine\ncourts gave such issues to the judge. Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural\nElec. Coop., Inc., 356 U.S. 525, 537-40 (1958).\n\n                                -18-\n\finvestigation this arguably should have been clear to Allstate even\n\nbefore the suit was brought on March 2, 2001.                    Whatever the\n\nlimitations on formal discovery during some of the period after\n\nsuit, and whatever delay might have been caused by the Rankins'\n\nenlarging slightly their claimed loss in June 2001, a jury might\n\nwell think based on the record before us that waiting until late\n\nDecember 2001 to pay theft claims for items of undisputed value was\n\nnot reasonable.\n\n           Second, there is very little from Allstate, and nothing\n\nspecific from the magistrate judge, to explain why the balance of\n\nthe now undisputed claim (some disputed amounts still remain after\n\nall three payments) took until July 2002–-some two years after the\n\nnon-delivery.     Perhaps    there    is    some   good   reason       for   these\n\nsubsequent delays; unduly hasty decisions by insurers to pay\n\ndoubtful claims raise premiums for everyone.                   But to justify\n\nsummary judgment, it was for Allstate to explain the reasons for\n\nthis   delay.     We   can   find   no     explanation    so    far,    although\n\nconceivably it could still be furnished at trial.\n\n           Third, it is also unclear what basis Allstate had for\n\ncontesting the still disputed amounts ($25,000, of which $19,000\n\nwas due to stolen items).      We assume that any legitimate doubt is\n\na safe harbor under UCSPA       and that other legitimate reasons for\n\ndelay can be offered; but, in its reply brief, the Rankins say\n\nAllstate has never explained why it still disputes these amounts.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fIt is true that Allstate invoked the arbitration clause but, quite\n\napart from what we have found is a waiver of arbitration, the\n\nquestion remains what basis Allstate had for disputing the figures,\n\narbitrable or not.\n\n           On   appeal,    Allstate     argues     that   its     contractual\n\nobligation under the terms of its policy is to make payment within\n\n60 days after the amount of the loss is \"finally determined\"\n\n(whatever this means) and that it was always within the control of\n\nthe Rankins to invoke the arbitration provision to speed up the\n\nprocess.   This argument is primarily presented in response to the\n\ncontract claim,    not    the   UCSPA   claim    and,   however   the    60-day\n\nlanguage is read, it is open to serious doubt whether it overrides\n\nUCSPA obligations–-a question of Maine law which we need not\n\ndecide.\n\n           It is enough for the present that, at least as applied to\n\nthe UCSPA claim, the argument based on the policy language is so\n\nlittle developed that we have no occasion to pass upon it.              Brandt,\n\n242 F.3d at 17.   Further, according to the Rankins, Allstate never\n\nmade this argument in the district court; and, if so, it could not\n\nbe made here even if it were developed since new legal arguments\n\ncannot be debuted on the appeal.        Daigle, 14 F.3d at 687.         And, if\n\nnot made before the appeal, it is almost certainly no longer\n\navailable even on remand.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f            SI's Liability.            The Rankins sued both ROTMS and SI\n\nunder the Carmack Amendment.                That statute provides a federal\n\nprivate right of action to obtain actual damages under the bill of\n\nlading     for     property        \"loss   or     injury\"    caused    by    carriers\n\ntransporting       goods      in     interstate     commerce.         49    U.S.C.     §\n\n14706(a)(1).       It embraces both the originating and the destination\n\ncarrier.     Id.     With irrelevant exceptions, liability is without\n\nfault, PNH Corp. v. Hullquist Corp., 843 F.2d 586, 588-89 (1st Cir.\n\n1988), but subject to limitation as to amount where the contract so\n\nprovides in exchange for a reduced transportation rate.                      49 U.S.C.\n\n§ 14706(c)(1)(A).\n\n            The claim against ROTMS was proceeding toward eventual\n\ntrial when the Rankins and ROTMS reached a settlement.                      Because SI\n\nnever entered an appearance or filed an answer in the lower court,\n\na default was entered against it on September 17, 2001.                       Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 55(a).       Pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2), a hearing for damages\n\nwas scheduled on November 5, 2002, at which time the Rankins gave\n\nevidence as to the extent of their losses.                  Following the hearing,\n\nthe magistrate judge determined that damages for property damage\n\nand loss under the statute could not be awarded against SI.                          Her\n\nfull discussion of the Carmack Amendment claim (count I) is as\n\nfollows:\n\n                   Count   I    seeks  relief    against\n            Right-on-Time Moving and Storage, Inc. as a\n            carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce\n            Act.    SI Trucking's liability under this\n\n                                           -21-\n\f          count, as the subcontractor, would necessarily\n          be co-extensive with Right-on-Time's.        I\n          cannot grant the Rankins greater relief than\n          their complaint seeks. The Rankins have not\n          alleged a separate breach of contract claim\n          against SI Trucking nor a separate tort claim\n          for damage to personal property nor does Count\n          I seek any relief against SI Trucking beyond\n          the relief obtained against Right-On-Time.\n          The Rankins did not present any evidence of\n          the extent of SI Trucking's liability under\n          the Interstate Commerce Act and therefore I\n          decline to enter judgment in any monetary\n          amount on Count I and direct that Count I is\n          DISMISSED as the plaintiffs have not presented\n          sufficient evidence to establish the amount of\n          SI Trucking's statutory liability pursuant to\n          49 U.S.C. § 14706.\n\n          The Rankins argue on appeal that ROTMS's liability is\n\nimmaterial to SI's liability and that they (the Rankins) did\n\npresent evidence of SI's liability and the extent of damages.           SI\n\nhas not entered an appearance, so there is no one to explain and\n\ndefend the ruling of the magistrate judge.       We must do the best we\n\ncan,   adjusting   the   standard     of   review--de   novo,   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion, and so on--to the underlying issues presented by the\n\nruling.\n\n          It is clear from count I that both ROTMS and SI were sued\n\nas \"carriers\" subject to the Carmack Amendment and, from the\n\nincorporated prior factual assertions in the complaint, that one\n\nwas the originating and the other the destination carrier of goods\n\ndamaged or stolen in transit.        Broadly speaking, the magistrate\n\njudge is right that ordinarily liability of the two carriers would\n\nbe co-extensive (not because SI was a subcontractor but because the\n\n                                    -22-\n\fstatute makes the two carriers each fully liable)--a liability\n\nunderstood, in the jargon of the common law, to be joint and\n\nseveral.   Pizzo v. Bekin Van Lines Co., 258 F.3d 629, 634 (7th Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           Thus it is hard to understand what the magistrate judge\n\nmeant in saying that \"[t]he Rankins have not alleged a separate\n\nbreach of contract claim against SI nor a separate tort claim for\n\ndamage to personal property . . . .\"                  The Carmack Amendment\n\neffectively creates a federal statutory remedy on the bill of\n\nlading against both the originating and destination carrier, and\n\nthe complaint is clear that the Rankins were seeking this remedy\n\nagainst SI as well as ROTMS.           Whether one thinks of the claim\n\nagainst the destination carrier as contract, tort, or just a\n\nproduct of the statute, count I does assert a claim against SI.\n\n             Admittedly, liability is likely to be co-extensive if\n\neach carrier asserts the same defenses and faces and presents the\n\nsame evidence; and ROTMS argued that its liability was not for the\n\nfull value of the lost or damaged goods because it had limited its\n\nliability to 60 cents per pound, as the Carmack Amendment permits\n\nsubject to certain procedures.         Hollingsworth & Vose Co. v. A-P-A\n\nTransp. Corp., 158 F.3d 617, 618-21 (1st Cir. 1998).                   But the\n\nmagistrate    judge   had   earlier    refused   to    grant   ROTMS   summary\n\njudgment even on this limited liability issue (because it was not\n\nclear that the Rankins had consented to the limitation).               And that\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fdefense--which is only a limitation on the amount--was never\n\nadjudicated because ROTMS settled thereafter with the Rankins.\n\n           In a few states, a settlement with one joint tortfeasor\n\nreleases   the    other,    e.g.,   Dougherty    v.    Cal.     Kettleman   Oil\n\nRoyalties, Inc., 88 P.2d 690, 693 (Cal. 1939), but the predominant\n\n\"modern\" rule is that release of one joint tortfeasor does not\n\nrelease another.       See Restatement (Second) Judgments § 50, cmt. a,\n\nillus. 1 (1982).        Of course, anything paid by ROTMS for stolen\n\nproperty or damage should reduce SI's liability for property loss\n\nor damage--collateral source issues aside, one cannot collect twice\n\nfor the same injury, id. at illus. 1--but there is no indication\n\nthat ROTMS paid in settlement all of the approximately $105,000\n\nthat the Rankins apparently claim.\n\n           Did then the magistrate judge mean that the Rankins had\n\nsimply   failed   to    offer   evidence   as   to   damages?      This   seems\n\nunlikely, despite one reference to a supposed failure of the\n\nRankins to present \"sufficient evidence to establish the amount\" of\n\nSI's liability.        The reason why this is unlikely is that the\n\nRankins plausibly represent that in substance they offered their\n\nown testimony at the hearing as to what was damaged or missing and\n\nprovided their estimates of worth, together with photographs of\n\ndamaged items. Such evidence is ordinarily competent, even without\n\nexpert testimony.       See note 4, above.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\f          Through a mechanical malfunction, the default judgment\n\nhearing was not recorded.   However, the Rankins properly presented\n\na statement of their evidence for the approval of the magistrate\n\njudge, which was given.   Fed. R. App. P. 10(c).   This comprised the\n\nlists of property and loss estimates, copies of the photographs,\n\nand the representation that Ron Rankin had testified that the lists\n\ncontained accurate statements of what was damaged or missing and\n\nhis best estimate of the value of lost items and the dollar value\n\nof the damage.   If the magistrate judge thought that the Rankins'\n\nevidence was defective, neither this conclusion nor the grounds for\n\nit have been explicitly set forth.\n\n          Accordingly, we are bound to remand the count I claim\n\nagainst SI for further proceedings.     Of course, even if liability\n\nis clear--and we do not foreclose some further explanation of why\n\nit is not--the magistrate judge is not bound to accept the Rankins'\n\nown estimates, which Allstate itself apparently contests; but that\n\nwould reduce rather than eliminate SI's liability.       If the same\n\nissues are to be tried against Allstate, nothing prevents the\n\nmagistrate judge from deferring a decision on SI's liability until\n\nthat proceeding is complete.\n\n          This is a peculiar case.     Although the Rankins have been\n\nlargely successful on this appeal, it is far from plain that the\n\nRankins' estimates, as opposed to Allstate's, will necessarily\n\nprevail at trial and equally unclear that Allstate is liable for\n\n\n                                -25-\n\funreasonable delay under the statute--let alone for consequential\n\ndamages:   we have said only that the delay issue is not quite\n\nsuitable   for   summary    judgment    on   this   record.     Given   these\n\nuncertainties, we urge again--as we did at oral argument--that the\n\nRankins and Allstate consider anew the possibility of settlement.\n\n           The   judgment    of   the   district    court     insofar   as   it\n\ndismissed or denied the contract and statutory claims against\n\nAllstate and the Carmack Amendment claim against SI Trucking is\n\nvacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this decision.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f",

When SI arrived at the Rankins' new home in Maine on July 24, 2000, the Rankins discovered that some of their possessions had been damaged and that many others were missing. Upon delivery, the SI movers could not account for the damaged or missing items and became abusive and threatening toward the Rankins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the Rankins notified their insurer, Allstate, which hired an adjuster to determine what goods were damaged and their value. In August 2000, the Rankins provided Allstate with a detailed list of lost or damaged items, supplemented with more information in September. The task of appraisal was substantial as the list comprised a large array of objects, including household goods, electronics, artwork, and furniture. In September, their attorney sent Allstate a demand letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Allstate policy covered theft and damage to property in transit but, on Allstate's reading, did not cover items that were merely misplaced by the carrier. Allstate maintained in an October 2000 letter that the Rankins' missing goods were not covered by the policy because it was unclear whether they were stolen or merely misplaced in a carrier or warehouse. On December 19, 2000, the Rankins filed a police report about the missing goods, convinced by now that their property had in fact been stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 23, 2001, Allstate sent a worksheet to the Rankins giving its appraisal of the damaged items, but making no mention of the larger number of stolen items. In the Rankins' view at the time, the damage to the items that were delivered amounted to about $24,000 &#8212; of which Allstate's share was half.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On February 12, 2001, Allstate agreed to pay $6,000 to satisfy what it claimed was its share of the losses stemming from the damaged goods. The next day the Rankins gave Allstate an itemized account of their losses, calculating the total loss (damaged goods and stolen goods) at $97,583 (a figure the Rankins later raised to $106,000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 2, 2001, the Rankins brought suit against ROTMS and Allstate in federal district court in Maine. The original complaint alleged <i>inter alia</i> that ROTMS had violated the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 14706 (2000), which imposes something close to strict liability upon originating and delivering carriers, and that Allstate had breached its contract with the Rankins by failing to provide the benefits due them under the insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2001, the Rankins added SI as a defendant, claiming against it under the Carmack Amendment and separately for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on the behavior of the employees who delivered the load and abused the Rankins. The same amendment added a claim against Allstate under Maine's Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (\"UCSPA\"), 24-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2436-A(1)(E) (2000), which imposes attorneys' fees and interest for an insurer's unreasonable failure to make timely settlement of insurance claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge empowered by consent to act as the district court, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c) (2000), permitted the addition of the new claims and defendants but deferred then-existing discovery deadlines. The Rankins and Allstate made obligatory disclosures and conducted some discovery. When SI failed to answer the amended complaint, the Rankins in September 2001 sought and received entry of default against it. Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a). On September 14, 2001, the court set a new discovery deadline of December 14, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2001, all parties had an informal settlement conference. Allstate thereafter requested a copy of the police report filed by the Rankins in December 2000, which the Rankins then provided. Allstate did not depose the Rankins &#8212; it had their recorded statements &#8212; but Concord did take their deposition in December 2001. Allstate did depose ROTMS and also asked that its adjuster be allowed to contact the Rankins directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the discovery deadline and not long before the scheduled trial date of February 11, 2002, Allstate, on December 19, 2001, sent a letter invoking an arbitration provision in the policy for resolving disputes as to the amount of loss or damage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Rankins rejected this demand as coming too late. Allstate then, on December 26, 2001, sent the Rankins a check for $38,500, as purported full payment for the theft claims &#8212; which the Rankins had estimated as approximately $82,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allstate then sought summary judgment on the claims against it. The court granted the motion on March 25, 2002, as to certain claims not pressed on this appeal but denied the motion as to the Rankins' contract and UCSPA claims with which we are now concerned. Trial was rescheduled for August 2002, and the parties were ordered to confer and provide further information to each other. In consequence, Allstate paid the Rankins two further sums (totaling a little over $25,000) on account of the theft claim in May and July 2002. This brought the total payments for theft to about $63,500 &#8212; still about $19,000 short of the Rankins' final estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 11, 2002, the court reconsidered <i>sua sponte</i> its denials of summary judgment, invited a new motion by Allstate, and deferred the trial again. On September 16, 2002, the court granted the motion for summary judgment, resolving both the contract claim and the UCSPA claim in favor of Allstate. Thereafter the court held a hearing on November 6, 2002, to determine SI's liability on the default and heard evidence from the Rankins as to the amount of their property losses and as to their emotional distress claims. The next day it awarded $150,000 on the latter but &#8212; on grounds described below &#8212; denied recovery on the former.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of the litigation, the Rankins settled their disputes with ROTMS and Concord out of court. The Rankins have now appealed from the district court's dismissal of their contract and UCSPA claims against Allstate and the refusal of the district court to award damages on their property loss claim against SI. We consider the issues on appeal in the same order. On the grant of summary judgment, our review is <i>de novo. Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 81 F.3d 249, 253 (1st Cir.1996). As to the ruling on the default judgment determination, the standard of review depends upon the basis for the ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Contract Claims.</i> In a nutshell, the Rankins say that Allstate breached its insurance contract by failing to make timely payment for all covered losses; that Allstate's share of the losses is still not completely paid &#8212; a further breach of contract; and, finally, that Allstate cannot rely on the arbitration provision for two reasons: that Allstate itself breached the contract and that it failed to invoke the arbitration provision in a timely manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge concluded that the delays in payment were explainable in light of the changing nature of the Rankins' claims and various litigation-related events and that no reasonable jury could find otherwise. As to the remaining gap between what Allstate paid and the Rankins' larger estimate of losses, the magistrate judge stated that \"Allstate is entitled to invoke the contract provision requiring arbitration of any remaining disputes regarding the value of items stolen or damaged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Allstate unreasonably delayed payment of what was due, whether it stills owes money, and whether it lost its right to invoke the arbitration provision are three different questions, albeit set against the same background facts and intertwined with each other (and with the Rankins' separate statutory claim based on unreasonable delay).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the question whether Allstate unreasonably delayed making payment of what was (or still is) due to the Rankins. More precisely, the question is whether summary judgment should have been granted by the magistrate judge on that issue. Our conclusion is that the undue delay question presents a jury issue, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that there is a contractual obligation to act diligently. The reasons why the delay question could not be decided on summary judgment are more appropriately set forth in our later discussion of the statutory claim, where the answer clearly matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite likely the answer does <i>not</i> matter in the case of the contract claim. Whatever may still be due under the policy for direct losses (that is, for direct damage to or loss of insured goods) is due regardless of whether there has been delay. The Rankins have suggested only two reasons why delay itself may be pertinent to their contract claim: first, as a basis for consequential damages and second, as a basis for rejecting the arbitration demand. The first is doubtful and the second wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is only the barest hint that the Rankins are seriously seeking consequential damages, that is, damages not for the direct loss but in consequence of it. In his deposition, Ron Rankin indicated quite tersely that because his new house was awash in damaged furnishings, he could not use it for some in-house meeting or demonstration relating to his work. Almost nothing about this is said in his appellate briefs and it strikes us as an improbable claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rankins have not briefed the question whether the policy permits liability for consequential damages; nor is it clear that such a claim would turn on undue delay; nor is it especially plausible that either the damage to furnishings or the delay in reimbursement prevented Rankin from conducting business from home. This has more the feel of a kitchen-sink claim than anything likely to be pursued on the remand that is otherwise required because of the <i>statutory</i> consequences of any undue delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other reason why the Rankins say undue delay is relevant under the contract concerns the arbitration clause. Describing the delay as a \"total\" breach of contract by Allstate, as opposed to a partial breach, the Rankins say that the total breach prevents Allstate from taking advantage of any other provision of the contract, including the arbitration clause. Undue delay or not, we think that on the facts of this case no one could reasonably conclude that the delay is the kind of breach that would defeat the arbitration clause, if timely invoked (which is a different question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arbitration clauses are often invoked precisely because one side claims, and the other denies, that a contract has been violated. Some violations may be so broad and fundamental that they should prevent the wrongdoer from invoking the arbitration provision itself. But for obvious reasons of doctrine and policy, this requires something more than a claim by one side that the other paid some of what was due a bit too slowly and is insisting on arbitration as to the rest under a provision explicitly designed to resolve disputes about value. <i>County of Middlesex v. Gevyn Constr. Corp.,</i> 450 F.2d 53, 56 (1st Cir.1971), <i>cert. denied,</i> 405 U.S. 955, 92 S.Ct. 1176, 31 L.Ed.2d 232 (1972); 15 <i>Corbin on Contracts</i> &#167; 1443, at 388-89 (interim ed.1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the arbitration is defeated by Allstate's delay in invoking the clause is a different issue commonly addressed under the heading \"waiver,\" here meaning forfeiture rather than intentional relinquishment. The Rankins support their waiver argument by invoking a Maine insurance law provision requiring timely reservation of defenses by the insurer, 24-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2436-A(1)(D); but it is not clear whether this provision applies at all to an arbitration clause, and there is not much state law precedent as to the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet an arbitration provision has to be invoked in a timely manner or the option is lost. <i>See, e.g., Menorah Ins. Co., Ltd. v. INX Reinsurance Corp.,</i> 72 F.3d 218, 221-22 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Saga Communications of New England v. Voornas,</i> 756 A.2d 954, 959-61 (Me.2000). Under federal law, such a forfeiture is an issue for the judge, <i>Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 220, and, pertinent fact findings by the judge aside (which would be reviewed for clear error), our review is plenary. <i>Id.</i> Where we are dealing with a forfeiture by inaction (as opposed to an explicit waiver), the components of waiver of an arbitration clause are undue delay and a modicum of prejudice to the other side. <i>Id.</i> at 221-22.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, by February 2001 the parties were in disagreement not only about whether the missing items were covered at all &#8212; not an issue subject to arbitration &#8212; but also about the value of damaged items, value being the arbitrable issue. Yet Allstate neither invoked the arbitration clause at that time nor did it in its April 2001 answer to the complaint filed in March 2001. Nor did it assert its right to arbitrate value in June 2001 when the Rankins' final list of lost and damaged items and estimates was delivered and when the likelihood of theft was fairly obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, arbitration is provided for the dispute, not some limited aspect of it, so the precedents tend to insist that an arbitration clause be invoked at the earliest opportunity. <i>E.g., Cabinetree of Wis., Inc. v. Kraftmaid Cabinetry, Inc.,</i> 50 F.3d 388, 391 (7th Cir.1995). If arbitration is invoked in response to a lawsuit, this must be done early on in the case so resources are not needlessly deployed. <i>E.g., Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 221. Here, the situation is somewhat different: the arbitration clause applies only to disputes about value and not to other questions, including in this case whether certain of the goods were stolen and so covered at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, it is still hard to see why arbitration was not demanded once the suit had been brought and the Rankins' estimated losses had been firmed up in June 2001. Admittedly some, perhaps most, of the disagreements as to value concerned items as to which coverage was still disputed &#8212; although it is not easy to understand why theft was doubtful by June 2001. Still, discovery in the suit was open until December 2001, the delays being no apparent fault of Allstate and owing something to the Rankins' addition of new claims and defendants in June 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that discovery could narrow the arbitrable issues or even produce a settlement, and sometimes arbitrating as to value might make no sense until after discovery or even after trial (<i>e.g.,</i> if liability itself could only be determined at trial). Yet our concern here is with when a timely <i>demand</i> for arbitration must be made, not when the arbitration itself occurs. And knowing early on, or at least after suit is brought what procedures are to be followed &#8212; specifically, whether arbitration is sought as to arbitrable issues &#8212; is a condition of efficient planning by the court and of protecting the opponent against prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not fashion some mechanical rule embracing all possible cases. It is sufficient here that by waiting until after discovery had closed and the long-scheduled trial date had almost arrived, Allstate did unduly delay in invoking the arbitration clause in this case. Certainly by June 2001, Allstate ought to have known that theft coverage was likely to apply and that it would dispute some of the theft claims as to value, the Rankins having asserted these claims throughout and given their own dollar figures as early as February 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But was there any prejudice from the delay? The Rankins say that they told Allstate in September 2000, after Allstate's appraiser had a chance to examine the property, that they (the Rankins) planned to dispose of broken or damaged items, which they then did. Now, they say they have been prejudiced because &#8212; arbitration having been belatedly demanded &#8212; they have nothing (beyond photographs) to show the experts who act as appraisers under the policy. Allstate does not deny the allegation or otherwise respond to the waiver argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of the damaged items themselves does not help the Rankins very much. The Rankins cannot have supposed that Allstate was conceding value and, seemingly, the now disposed of property would have been as useful (or useless) in a jury trial as in arbitration. A better argument, at least hinted at, is that there is prejudice inherent in wasted trial preparation when an arbitration demand is made, and effectively granted, after many months of delay and only six weeks before a long-scheduled trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this is enough in this case. The prejudice showing required is tame at best, <i>Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 222, and Allstate's failure to address the issue in its brief is itself a kind of waiver. <i>Brandt v. Wand Partners,</i> 242 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir.2001). If there were no hint of prejudice, that would be a different matter. But as the case stands, we think that Allstate has forfeited its right to arbitration and that value disputes should be tried in court, along with the statutory claim to which we now turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Statutory Claim.</i> This claim, understandably, is a major focus of Allstate's attention. The difference between Allstate and the Rankins in valuation of damaged and stolen property is fairly limited (about $25,000). By contrast, if Allstate violated its duty under the UCSPA to make timely payment, it is liable for attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest. To state our conclusion at the outset, we think that the question whether Allstate complied with its duty of prompt settlement under the statute is complicated, arguably close, and (alas) not subject to resolution on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine statute says that an insured is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest (one and a half percent interest per month on damages) if the insurer, \"[w]ithout just cause,\" fails to \"effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlement of claims submitted in which liability has become reasonably clear.\" 24-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2436-A(1)(E). The statute thus has two conditions and is narrowly construed, <i>Marquis v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 628 A.2d 644, 651 (Me.1993); but seemingly the insurer (absent good cause) must pay claims clearly due even though other claims from the same incident are open to dispute, <i>Curtis v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 787 A.2d 760, 768-69 (Me.2002), and whether or not there is pending litigation. <i>County Forest Prods., Inc. v. Green Mountain Agency, Inc.,</i> 758 A.2d 59, 68 n. 4 (Me.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by February 2001, Allstate knew that the listed property had been undelivered for more than six months and that the Rankins were claiming that it had been stolen. Perhaps it did not know that the Rankins had filed a police report in December 2000, a condition of a theft claim under the policy; but if this were the concern, Allstate could easily have objected on this ground and would have been given a copy of the report, as it was later when it requested a copy. Allstate apparently offered no such objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allstate had no obligation to take the Rankins' word as to whether the property had been stolen, what items were still missing or what the items were worth. As to the first, it could have contacted the carriers and the police; as to the second, the Rankins were there to be interrogated (and several recorded statements were taken); and as to the third, the arbitration provision could have been invoked. But under the statute, Allstate did have a duty to investigate, <i>cf. Masters v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> No. 99-37-B, 1999 WL 33117068, at *2 (D.Me. Sept.20, 1999), and not just wait to be sued &#8212; unless it wanted to face claims under UCSPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge &#8212; whose reasoning is heavily relied upon by Allstate &#8212; said this in substance: that matters were uncertain until early 2001 and once litigation had begun in March 2001, discovery rules prevented Allstate from engaging in discovery until the court ordered or the parties so agreed, Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(d); that when the \"discovery window\" opened on May 7, 2001, with an order by the court, it was closed again in mid-June by the court due to the Rankins' own addition of new claims and defendants and did not reopen until a new order in mid-September 2001, setting a three month discovery schedule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, Allstate did ask for the earlier police report made by the Rankins in December 2000, conducted a deposition of an ROTMS employee in November 2001, and presumably took advantage of Concord's deposition of the Rankins in December 2001. On December 19, 2001, not long after discovery closed, Allstate paid the Rankins $38,510 on the theft claims (later payments followed in May and July 2002). It also invoked the arbitration clause as to the remaining claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first payment, the magistrate judge said that three months from mid-September to mid-December was as a matter of law not an unreasonable delay. And, as to the subsequent payments, the magistrate judge said, given the complexity of the case, the failure of Allstate to \"immediately pay all the money [the Rankins] demanded,\" was not a violation of the statute. This may mean that the magistrate judge deemed the amounts over and above the initial payment to be reasonably disputable until paid in the spring and summer of 2002, although the point is not discussed in detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that the magistrate judge's assessment is unreasonable, and we would likely defer if it were a mixed finding of an issue properly committed to the magistrate judge. <i>In re Howard,</i> 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1st Cir.1993). And admittedly, assessing what is reasonable behavior in the context of litigation rules and procedures is not the easiest task for a jury. But <i>this</i> assessment under the UCSPA, unlike the arbitration waiver question, is committed to the jury unless a reasonable jury could decide it only one way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precedents today are far more favorable to summary judgment than they once were, <i>e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 321-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), and Maine courts do not lightly impose liability under UCSPA. <i>Marquis,</i> 628 A.2d at 651. Still, the Maine statute does not make litigation a blanket excuse for inaction by the insurer, <i>County Forest,</i> 758 A.2d at 68 n. 4, nor did the magistrate judge say otherwise &#8212; and we think that a jury, even after being told how discovery rules limited Allstate, could &#8212; if the trial evidence matches the present record &#8212; take a different view of Allstate's behavior without being deemed irrational. This is so in two, and possibly three, respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, admittedly, proof that the goods were likely stolen emerged only over the course of time. But with even modest investigation this arguably should have been clear to Allstate even before the suit was brought on March 2, 2001. Whatever the limitations on formal discovery during some of the period after suit, and whatever delay might have been caused by the Rankins' enlarging slightly their claimed loss in June 2001, a jury might well think based on the record before us that waiting until late December 2001 to pay theft claims for items of undisputed value was not reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is very little from Allstate, and nothing specific from the magistrate judge, to explain why the balance of the now <i>undisputed</i> claim (some disputed amounts still remain after all three payments) took until July 2002 &#8212; some <i>two years</i> after the non-delivery. Perhaps there is some good reason for these subsequent delays; unduly hasty decisions by insurers to pay doubtful claims raise premiums for everyone. But to justify summary judgment, it was for Allstate to explain the reasons for this delay. We can find no explanation so far, although conceivably it could still be furnished at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, it is also unclear what basis Allstate had for contesting the still disputed amounts ($25,000, of which $19,000 was due to stolen items). We assume that any legitimate doubt is a safe harbor under UCSPA and that other legitimate reasons for delay can be offered; but, in its reply brief, the Rankins say Allstate has never explained why it still disputes these amounts. It is true that Allstate invoked the arbitration clause but, quite apart from what we have found is a waiver of arbitration, the question remains what basis Allstate had for disputing the figures, arbitrable or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Allstate argues that its contractual obligation under the terms of its policy is to make payment within 60 days after the amount of the loss is \"finally determined\" (whatever this means) and that it was always within the control of the Rankins to invoke the arbitration provision to speed up the process. This argument is primarily presented in response to the contract claim, not the UCSPA claim and, however the 60-day language is read, it is open to serious doubt whether it overrides UCSPA obligations &#8212; a question of Maine law which we need not decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is enough for the present that, at least as applied to the UCSPA claim, the argument based on the policy language is so little developed that we have no occasion to pass upon it. <i>Brandt,</i> 242 F.3d at 17. Further, according to the Rankins, Allstate never made this argument in the district court; and, if so, it could not be made here even if it were developed since new legal arguments cannot be debuted on the appeal. <i>Daigle,</i> 14 F.3d at 687. And, if not made before the appeal, it is almost certainly no longer available even on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>SI's Liability.</i> The Rankins sued both ROTMS and SI under the Carmack Amendment. That statute provides a federal private right of action to obtain actual damages under the bill of lading for property \"loss or injury\" caused by carriers transporting goods in interstate commerce. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 14706(a)(1). It embraces both the originating and the destination carrier. <i>Id.</i> With irrelevant exceptions, liability is without fault, <i>PNH Corp. v. Hullquist Corp.,</i> 843 F.2d 586, 588-89 (1st Cir.1988), but subject to limitation as to amount where the contract so provides in exchange for a reduced transportation rate. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 14706(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim against ROTMS was proceeding toward eventual trial when the Rankins and ROTMS reached a settlement. Because SI never entered an appearance or filed an answer in the lower court, a default was entered against it on September 17, 2001. Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a). Pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2), a hearing for damages was scheduled on November 5, 2002, at which time the Rankins gave evidence as to the extent of their losses. Following the hearing, the magistrate judge determined that damages for property damage and loss under the statute could not be awarded against SI. Her full discussion of the Carmack Amendment claim (count I) is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I seeks relief against Right-on-Time Moving and Storage, Inc. as a carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. SI Trucking's liability under this count, as the subcontractor, would necessarily be co-extensive with Right-on-Time's. I cannot grant the Rankins greater relief than their complaint seeks. The Rankins have not alleged a separate breach of contract claim against SI Trucking nor a separate tort claim for damage to personal property nor does Count I seek any relief against SI Trucking beyond the relief obtained against Right-On-Time. The Rankins did not present any evidence of the extent of SI Trucking's liability under the Interstate Commerce Act and therefore I decline to enter judgment in any monetary amount on Count I and direct that Count I is DISMISSED as the plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence to establish the amount of SI Trucking's statutory liability pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 14706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rankins argue on appeal that ROTMS's liability is immaterial to SI's liability and that they (the Rankins) did present evidence of SI's liability and the extent of damages. SI has not entered an appearance, so there is no one to explain and defend the ruling of the magistrate judge. We must do the best we can, adjusting the standard of review &#8212; <i>de novo,</i> abuse of discretion, and so on &#8212; to the underlying issues presented by the ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from count I that both ROTMS and SI were sued as \"carriers\" subject to the Carmack Amendment and, from the incorporated prior factual assertions in the complaint, that one was the originating and the other the destination carrier of goods damaged or stolen in transit. Broadly speaking, the magistrate judge is right that ordinarily liability of the two carriers would be co-extensive (not because SI was a subcontractor but because the statute makes the two carriers each fully liable) &#8212; a liability understood, in the jargon of the common law, to be joint and several. <i>Pizzo v. Bekin Van Lines Co.,</i> 258 F.3d 629, 634 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus it is hard to understand what the magistrate judge meant in saying that \"[t]he Rankins have not alleged a separate breach of contract claim against SI nor a separate tort claim for damage to personal property....\" The Carmack Amendment effectively creates a federal statutory remedy on the bill of lading against both the originating and destination carrier, and the complaint is clear that the Rankins were seeking this remedy against SI as well as ROTMS. Whether one thinks of the claim against the destination carrier as contract, tort, or just a product of the statute, count I does assert a claim against SI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, liability is likely to be co-extensive if each carrier asserts the same defenses and faces and presents the same evidence; and ROTMS argued that its liability was not for the full value of the lost or damaged goods because it had limited its liability to 60 cents per pound, as the Carmack Amendment permits subject to certain procedures. <i>Hollingsworth &amp; Vose Co. v. A-P-A Transp. Corp.,</i> 158 F.3d 617, 618-21 (1st Cir.1998). But the magistrate judge had earlier refused to grant ROTMS summary judgment even on this limited liability issue (because it was not clear that the Rankins had consented to the limitation). And that defense &#8212; which is only a limitation on the amount &#8212; was never adjudicated because ROTMS settled thereafter with the Rankins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a few states, a settlement with one joint tortfeasor releases the other, <i>e.g., Dougherty v. Cal. Kettleman Oil Royalties, Inc.,</i> 13 Cal.2d 174, 88 P.2d 690, 693 (Cal.1939), but the predominant \"modern\" rule is that release of one joint tortfeasor does not release another. <i>See Restatement (Second) Judgments</i> &#167; 50, cmt. a, illus. 1 (1982). Of course, anything paid by ROTMS for stolen property or damage should reduce SI's liability for property loss or damage &#8212; collateral source issues aside, one cannot collect twice for the same injury, <i>id.</i> at illus. 1 &#8212; but there is no indication that ROTMS paid in settlement all of the approximately $105,000 that the Rankins apparently claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did then the magistrate judge mean that the Rankins had simply failed to offer evidence as to damages? This seems unlikely, despite one reference to a supposed failure of the Rankins to present \"sufficient evidence to establish the amount\" of SI's liability. The reason why this is unlikely is that the Rankins plausibly represent that in substance they offered their own testimony at the hearing as to what was damaged or missing and provided their estimates of worth, together with photographs of damaged items. Such evidence is ordinarily competent, even without expert testimony. <i>See</i> note 4, above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through a mechanical malfunction, the default judgment hearing was not recorded. However, the Rankins properly presented a statement of their evidence for the approval of the magistrate judge, which was given. Fed.R.App.P. 10(c). This comprised the lists of property and loss estimates, copies of the photographs, and the representation that Ron Rankin had testified that the lists contained accurate statements of what was damaged or missing and his best estimate of the value of lost items and the dollar value of the damage. If the magistrate judge thought that the Rankins' evidence was defective, neither this conclusion nor the grounds for it have been explicitly set forth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we are bound to remand the count I claim against SI for further proceedings. Of course, even if liability is clear &#8212; and we do not foreclose some further explanation of why it is not &#8212; the magistrate judge is not bound to accept the Rankins' own estimates, which Allstate itself apparently contests; but that would reduce rather than eliminate SI's liability. If the same issues are to be tried against Allstate, nothing prevents the magistrate judge from deferring a decision on SI's liability until that proceeding is complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a peculiar case. Although the Rankins have been largely successful on this appeal, it is far from plain that the Rankins' estimates, as opposed to Allstate's, will necessarily prevail at trial and equally unclear that Allstate is liable for unreasonable delay under the statute &#8212; let alone for consequential damages: we have said only that the delay issue is not quite suitable for summary judgment on this record. Given these uncertainties, we urge again &#8212; as we did at oral argument &#8212; that the Rankins and Allstate consider anew the possibility of settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court insofar as it dismissed or denied the contract and statutory claims against Allstate and the Carmack Amendment claim against SI Trucking is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Concord policy covered damage but not theft and all parties appear to agree that, as to damaged property, Allstate and Concord were each liable for half.

On June 16, 2000, Ronald and Liz Rankin contracted with Right-On-Time Moving &amp; Storage, Inc. (\"ROTMS\") to transport their possessions from California to Maine. ROTMS subcontracted with SI Trucking, Inc. (\"SI\") to handle most of the move. The Rankins had homeowners insurance policies in force with Allstate Insurance Company (\"Allstate\") and Concord General Mutual Insurance Company (\"Concord\"), one covering the origin residence and one the destination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ROTMS employees picked up the Rankins' possessions in California in June 2000 and brought them to a warehouse. SI employees then transferred them to an SI truck for transportation and delivery. When SI arrived at the Rankins' new home in Maine on July 24, 2000, the Rankins discovered that some of their possessions had been damaged and that many others were missing. Upon delivery, the SI movers could not account for the damaged or missing items and became abusive and threatening toward the Rankins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the Rankins notified their insurer, Allstate, which hired an adjuster to determine what goods were damaged and their value. In August 2000, the Rankins provided Allstate with a detailed list of lost or damaged items, supplemented with more information in September. The task of appraisal was substantial as the list comprised a large array of objects, including household goods, electronics, artwork, and furniture. In September, their attorney sent Allstate a demand letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Allstate policy covered theft and damage to property in transit but, on Allstate's reading, did not cover items that were merely misplaced by the carrier. Allstate maintained in an October 2000 letter that the Rankins' missing goods were not covered by the policy because it was unclear whether they were stolen or merely misplaced in a carrier or warehouse. On December 19, 2000, the Rankins filed a police report about the missing goods, convinced by now that their property had in fact been stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 23, 2001, Allstate sent a worksheet to the Rankins giving its appraisal of the damaged items, but making no mention of the larger number of stolen items. In the Rankins' view at the time, the damage to the items that were delivered amounted to about $24,000 &#8212; of which Allstate's share was half.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On February 12, 2001, Allstate agreed to pay $6,000 to satisfy what it claimed was its share of the losses stemming from the damaged goods. The next day the Rankins gave Allstate an itemized account of their losses, calculating the total loss (damaged goods and stolen goods) at $97,583 (a figure the Rankins later raised to $106,000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 2, 2001, the Rankins brought suit against ROTMS and Allstate in federal district court in Maine. The original complaint alleged <i>inter alia</i> that ROTMS had violated the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 14706 (2000), which imposes something close to strict liability upon originating and delivering carriers, and that Allstate had breached its contract with the Rankins by failing to provide the benefits due them under the insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2001, the Rankins added SI as a defendant, claiming against it under the Carmack Amendment and separately for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on the behavior of the employees who delivered the load and abused the Rankins. The same amendment added a claim against Allstate under Maine's Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (\"UCSPA\"), 24-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2436-A(1)(E) (2000), which imposes attorneys' fees and interest for an insurer's unreasonable failure to make timely settlement of insurance claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge empowered by consent to act as the district court, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c) (2000), permitted the addition of the new claims and defendants but deferred then-existing discovery deadlines. The Rankins and Allstate made obligatory disclosures and conducted some discovery. When SI failed to answer the amended complaint, the Rankins in September 2001 sought and received entry of default against it. Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a). On September 14, 2001, the court set a new discovery deadline of December 14, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2001, all parties had an informal settlement conference. Allstate thereafter requested a copy of the police report filed by the Rankins in December 2000, which the Rankins then provided. Allstate did not depose the Rankins &#8212; it had their recorded statements &#8212; but Concord did take their deposition in December 2001. Allstate did depose ROTMS and also asked that its adjuster be allowed to contact the Rankins directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the discovery deadline and not long before the scheduled trial date of February 11, 2002, Allstate, on December 19, 2001, sent a letter invoking an arbitration provision in the policy for resolving disputes as to the amount of loss or damage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Rankins rejected this demand as coming too late. Allstate then, on December 26, 2001, sent the Rankins a check for $38,500, as purported full payment for the theft claims &#8212; which the Rankins had estimated as approximately $82,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allstate then sought summary judgment on the claims against it. The court granted the motion on March 25, 2002, as to certain claims not pressed on this appeal but denied the motion as to the Rankins' contract and UCSPA claims with which we are now concerned. Trial was rescheduled for August 2002, and the parties were ordered to confer and provide further information to each other. In consequence, Allstate paid the Rankins two further sums (totaling a little over $25,000) on account of the theft claim in May and July 2002. This brought the total payments for theft to about $63,500 &#8212; still about $19,000 short of the Rankins' final estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 11, 2002, the court reconsidered <i>sua sponte</i> its denials of summary judgment, invited a new motion by Allstate, and deferred the trial again. On September 16, 2002, the court granted the motion for summary judgment, resolving both the contract claim and the UCSPA claim in favor of Allstate. Thereafter the court held a hearing on November 6, 2002, to determine SI's liability on the default and heard evidence from the Rankins as to the amount of their property losses and as to their emotional distress claims. The next day it awarded $150,000 on the latter but &#8212; on grounds described below &#8212; denied recovery on the former.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of the litigation, the Rankins settled their disputes with ROTMS and Concord out of court. The Rankins have now appealed from the district court's dismissal of their contract and UCSPA claims against Allstate and the refusal of the district court to award damages on their property loss claim against SI. We consider the issues on appeal in the same order. On the grant of summary judgment, our review is <i>de novo. Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins.

As to the remaining gap between what Allstate paid and the Rankins' larger estimate of losses, the magistrate judge stated that \"Allstate is entitled to invoke the contract provision requiring arbitration of any remaining disputes regarding the value of items stolen or damaged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Allstate unreasonably delayed payment of what was due, whether it stills owes money, and whether it lost its right to invoke the arbitration provision are three different questions, albeit set against the same background facts and intertwined with each other (and with the Rankins' separate statutory claim based on unreasonable delay).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the question whether Allstate unreasonably delayed making payment of what was (or still is) due to the Rankins. More precisely, the question is whether summary judgment should have been granted by the magistrate judge on that issue. Our conclusion is that the undue delay question presents a jury issue, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that there is a contractual obligation to act diligently. The reasons why the delay question could not be decided on summary judgment are more appropriately set forth in our later discussion of the statutory claim, where the answer clearly matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite likely the answer does <i>not</i> matter in the case of the contract claim. Whatever may still be due under the policy for direct losses (that is, for direct damage to or loss of insured goods) is due regardless of whether there has been delay. The Rankins have suggested only two reasons why delay itself may be pertinent to their contract claim: first, as a basis for consequential damages and second, as a basis for rejecting the arbitration demand. The first is doubtful and the second wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is only the barest hint that the Rankins are seriously seeking consequential damages, that is, damages not for the direct loss but in consequence of it. In his deposition, Ron Rankin indicated quite tersely that because his new house was awash in damaged furnishings, he could not use it for some in-house meeting or demonstration relating to his work. Almost nothing about this is said in his appellate briefs and it strikes us as an improbable claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rankins have not briefed the question whether the policy permits liability for consequential damages; nor is it clear that such a claim would turn on undue delay; nor is it especially plausible that either the damage to furnishings or the delay in reimbursement prevented Rankin from conducting business from home. This has more the feel of a kitchen-sink claim than anything likely to be pursued on the remand that is otherwise required because of the <i>statutory</i> consequences of any undue delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other reason why the Rankins say undue delay is relevant under the contract concerns the arbitration clause. Describing the delay as a \"total\" breach of contract by Allstate, as opposed to a partial breach, the Rankins say that the total breach prevents Allstate from taking advantage of any other provision of the contract, including the arbitration clause. Undue delay or not, we think that on the facts of this case no one could reasonably conclude that the delay is the kind of breach that would defeat the arbitration clause, if timely invoked (which is a different question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arbitration clauses are often invoked precisely because one side claims, and the other denies, that a contract has been violated. Some violations may be so broad and fundamental that they should prevent the wrongdoer from invoking the arbitration provision itself. But for obvious reasons of doctrine and policy, this requires something more than a claim by one side that the other paid some of what was due a bit too slowly and is insisting on arbitration as to the rest under a provision explicitly designed to resolve disputes about value. <i>County of Middlesex v.

The Rankins support their waiver argument by invoking a Maine insurance law provision requiring timely reservation of defenses by the insurer, 24-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2436-A(1)(D); but it is not clear whether this provision applies at all to an arbitration clause, and there is not much state law precedent as to the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet an arbitration provision has to be invoked in a timely manner or the option is lost. <i>See, e.g., Menorah Ins. Co., Ltd. v. INX Reinsurance Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196492\"><a href=\"/opinion/196492/menorah-v-inx/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 221-22 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Saga Communications of New England v.

Under federal law, such a forfeiture is an issue for the judge, <i>Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 220, and, pertinent fact findings by the judge aside (which would be reviewed for clear error), our review is plenary. <i>Id.</i> Where we are dealing with a forfeiture by inaction (as opposed to an explicit waiver), the components of waiver of an arbitration clause are undue delay and a modicum of prejudice to the other side. <i>Id.</i> at 221-22.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, by February 2001 the parties were in disagreement not only about whether the missing items were covered at all &#8212; not an issue subject to arbitration &#8212; but also about the value of damaged items, value being the arbitrable issue. Yet Allstate neither invoked the arbitration clause at that time nor did it in its April 2001 answer to the complaint filed in March 2001. Nor did it assert its right to arbitrate value in June 2001 when the Rankins' final list of lost and damaged items and estimates was delivered and when the likelihood of theft was fairly obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, arbitration is provided for the dispute, not some limited aspect of it, so the precedents tend to insist that an arbitration clause be invoked at the earliest opportunity. <i>E.g., Cabinetree of Wis., Inc. v. Kraftmaid Cabinetry, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691984\"><a href=\"/opinion/691984/cabinetree-of-wisconsin-incorporated-v-kraftmaid-cabinetry-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 391 (7th Cir.1995). If arbitration is invoked in response to a lawsuit, this must be done early on in the case so resources are not needlessly deployed. <i>E.g., Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 221. Here, the situation is somewhat different: the arbitration clause applies only to disputes about value and not to other questions, including in this case whether certain of the goods were stolen and so covered at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, it is still hard to see why arbitration was not demanded once the suit had been brought and the Rankins' estimated losses had been firmed up in June 2001. Admittedly some, perhaps most, of the disagreements as to value concerned items as to which coverage was still disputed &#8212; although it is not easy to understand why theft was doubtful by June 2001. Still, discovery in the suit was open until December 2001, the delays being no apparent fault of Allstate and owing something to the Rankins' addition of new claims and defendants in June 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that discovery could narrow the arbitrable issues or even produce a settlement, and sometimes arbitrating as to value might make no sense until after discovery or even after trial (<i>e.g.,</i> if liability itself could only be determined at trial). Yet our concern here is with when a timely <i>demand</i> for arbitration must be made, not when the arbitration itself occurs. And knowing early on, or at least after suit is brought what procedures are to be followed &#8212; specifically, whether arbitration is sought as to arbitrable issues &#8212; is a condition of efficient planning by the court and of protecting the opponent against prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not fashion some mechanical rule embracing all possible cases. It is sufficient here that by waiting until after discovery had closed and the long-scheduled trial date had almost arrived, Allstate did unduly delay in invoking the arbitration clause in this case. Certainly by June 2001, Allstate ought to have known that theft coverage was likely to apply and that it would dispute some of the theft claims as to value, the Rankins having asserted these claims throughout and given their own dollar figures as early as February 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But was there any prejudice from the delay? The Rankins say that they told Allstate in September 2000, after Allstate's appraiser had a chance to examine the property, that they (the Rankins) planned to dispose of broken or damaged items, which they then did. Now, they say they have been prejudiced because &#8212; arbitration having been belatedly demanded &#8212; they have nothing (beyond photographs) to show the experts who act as appraisers under the policy. Allstate does not deny the allegation or otherwise respond to the waiver argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of the damaged items themselves does not help the Rankins very much. The Rankins cannot have supposed that Allstate was conceding value and, seemingly, the now disposed of property would have been as useful (or useless) in a jury trial as in arbitration. A better argument, at least hinted at, is that there is prejudice inherent in wasted trial preparation when an arbitration demand is made, and effectively granted, after many months of delay and only six weeks before a long-scheduled trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this is enough in this case. The prejudice showing required is tame at best, <i>Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 222, and Allstate's failure to address the issue in its brief is itself a kind of waiver. <i>Brandt v. Wand Partners,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199295\"><a href=\"/opinion/199295/brandt-v-wand-partners/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2001). If there were no hint of prejudice, that would be a different matter. But as the case stands, we think that Allstate has forfeited its right to arbitration and that value disputes should be tried in court, along with the statutory claim to which we now turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Statutory Claim.</i> This claim, understandably, is a major focus of Allstate's attention. The difference between Allstate and the Rankins in valuation of damaged and stolen property is fairly limited (about $25,000). By contrast, if Allstate violated its duty under the UCSPA to make timely payment, it is liable for attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest. To state our conclusion at the outset, we think that the question whether Allstate complied with its duty of prompt settlement under the statute is complicated, arguably close, and (alas) not subject to resolution on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine statute says that an insured is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest (one and a half percent interest per month on damages) if the insurer, \"[w]ithout just cause,\" fails to \"effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlement of claims submitted in which liability has become reasonably clear.\" 24-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2436-A(1)(E). The statute thus has two conditions and is narrowly construed, <i>Marquis v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></span>, 651 (Me.1993); but seemingly the insurer (absent good cause) must pay claims clearly due even though other claims from the same incident are open to dispute, <i>Curtis v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></span>, 768-69 (Me.2002), and whether or not there is pending litigation. <i>County Forest Prods., Inc. v. Green Mountain Agency, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 68 n. 4 (Me.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by February 2001, Allstate knew that the listed property had been undelivered for more than six months and that the Rankins were claiming that it had been stolen. Perhaps it did not know that the Rankins had filed a police report in December 2000, a condition of a theft claim under the policy; but if this were the concern, Allstate could easily have objected on this ground and would have been given a copy of the report, as it was later when it requested a copy. Allstate apparently offered no such objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allstate had no obligation to take the Rankins' word as to whether the property had been stolen, what items were still missing or what the items were worth. As to the first, it could have contacted the carriers and the police; as to the second, the Rankins were there to be interrogated (and several recorded statements were taken); and as to the third, the arbitration provision could have been invoked. But under the statute, Allstate did have a duty to investigate, <i>cf. Masters v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> No. 99-37-B, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33117068</span></span>, at *2 (D.Me. Sept.20, 1999), and not just wait to be sued &#8212; unless it wanted to face claims under UCSPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge &#8212; whose reasoning is heavily relied upon by Allstate &#8212; said this in substance: that matters were uncertain until early 2001 and once litigation had begun in March 2001, discovery rules prevented Allstate from engaging in discovery until the court ordered or the parties so agreed, Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(d); that when the \"discovery window\" opened on May 7, 2001, with an order by the court, it was closed again in mid-June by the court due to the Rankins' own addition of new claims and defendants and did not reopen until a new order in mid-September 2001, setting a three month discovery schedule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, Allstate did ask for the earlier police report made by the Rankins in December 2000, conducted a deposition of an ROTMS employee in November 2001, and presumably took advantage of Concord's deposition of the Rankins in December 2001. On December 19, 2001, not long after discovery closed, Allstate paid the Rankins $38,510 on the theft claims (later payments followed in May and July 2002). It also invoked the arbitration clause as to the remaining claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first payment, the magistrate judge said that three months from mid-September to mid-December was as a matter of law not an unreasonable delay. And, as to the subsequent payments, the magistrate judge said, given the complexity of the case, the failure of Allstate to \"immediately pay all the money [the Rankins] demanded,\" was not a violation of the statute. This may mean that the magistrate judge deemed the amounts over and above the initial payment to be reasonably disputable until paid in the spring and summer of 2002, although the point is not discussed in detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that the magistrate judge's assessment is unreasonable, and we would likely defer if it were a mixed finding of an issue properly committed to the magistrate judge. <i>In re Howard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1327-28 (1st Cir.1993). And admittedly, assessing what is reasonable behavior in the context of litigation rules and procedures is not the easiest task for a jury. But <i>this</i> assessment under the UCSPA, unlike the arbitration waiver question, is committed to the jury unless a reasonable jury could decide it only one way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precedents today are far more favorable to summary judgment than they once were, <i>e.g., Celotex Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1986), and Maine courts do not lightly impose liability under UCSPA. <i>Marquis,</i> 628 A.2d at 651. Still, the Maine statute does not make litigation a blanket excuse for inaction by the insurer, <i>County Forest,</i> 758 A.2d at 68 n. 4, nor did the magistrate judge say otherwise &#8212; and we think that a jury, even after being told how discovery rules limited Allstate, could &#8212; if the trial evidence matches the present record &#8212; take a different view of Allstate's behavior without being deemed irrational. This is so in two, and possibly three, respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, admittedly, proof that the goods were likely stolen emerged only over the course of time. But with even modest investigation this arguably should have been clear to Allstate even before the suit was brought on March 2, 2001. Whatever the limitations on formal discovery during some of the period after suit, and whatever delay might have been caused by the Rankins' enlarging slightly their claimed loss in June 2001, a jury might well think based on the record before us that waiting until late December 2001 to pay theft claims for items of undisputed value was not reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is very little from Allstate, and nothing specific from the magistrate judge, to explain why the balance of the now <i>undisputed</i> claim (some disputed amounts still remain after all three payments) took until July 2002 &#8212; some <i>two years</i> after the non-delivery. Perhaps there is some good reason for these subsequent delays; unduly hasty decisions by insurers to pay doubtful claims raise premiums for everyone. But to justify summary judgment, it was for Allstate to explain the reasons for this delay. We can find no explanation so far, although conceivably it could still be furnished at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, it is also unclear what basis Allstate had for contesting the still disputed amounts ($25,000, of which $19,000 was due to stolen items). We assume that any legitimate doubt is a safe harbor under UCSPA and that other legitimate reasons for delay can be offered; but, in its reply brief, the Rankins say Allstate has never explained why it still disputes these amounts. It is true that Allstate invoked the arbitration clause but, quite apart from what we have found is a waiver of arbitration, the question remains what basis Allstate had for disputing the figures, arbitrable or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Allstate argues that its contractual obligation under the terms of its policy is to make payment within 60 days after the amount of the loss is \"finally determined\" (whatever this means) and that it was always within the control of the Rankins to invoke the arbitration provision to speed up the process. This argument is primarily presented in response to the contract claim, not the UCSPA claim and, however the 60-day language is read, it is open to serious doubt whether it overrides UCSPA obligations &#8212; a question of Maine law which we need not decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is enough for the present that, at least as applied to the UCSPA claim, the argument based on the policy language is so little developed that we have no occasion to pass upon it. <i>Brandt,</i> 242 F.3d at 17. Further, according to the Rankins, Allstate never made this argument in the district court; and, if so, it could not be made here even if it were developed since new legal arguments cannot be debuted on the appeal. <i>Daigle,</i> 14 F.3d at 687. And, if not made before the appeal, it is almost certainly no longer available even on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>SI's Liability.</i> The Rankins sued both ROTMS and SI under the Carmack Amendment. That statute provides a federal private right of action to obtain actual damages under the bill of lading for property \"loss or injury\" caused by carriers transporting goods in interstate commerce. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 14706(a)(1). It embraces both the originating and the destination carrier. <i>Id.</i> With irrelevant exceptions, liability is without fault, <i>PNH Corp. v.

Because SI never entered an appearance or filed an answer in the lower court, a default was entered against it on September 17, 2001. Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a). Pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2), a hearing for damages was scheduled on November 5, 2002, at which time the Rankins gave evidence as to the extent of their losses. Following the hearing, the magistrate judge determined that damages for property damage and loss under the statute could not be awarded against SI. Her full discussion of the Carmack Amendment claim (count I) is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I seeks relief against Right-on-Time Moving and Storage, Inc. as a carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. SI Trucking's liability under this count, as the subcontractor, would necessarily be co-extensive with Right-on-Time's. I cannot grant the Rankins greater relief than their complaint seeks. The Rankins have not alleged a separate breach of contract claim against SI Trucking nor a separate tort claim for damage to personal property nor does Count I seek any relief against SI Trucking beyond the relief obtained against Right-On-Time. The Rankins did not present any evidence of the extent of SI Trucking's liability under the Interstate Commerce Act and therefore I decline to enter judgment in any monetary amount on Count I and direct that Count I is DISMISSED as the plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence to establish the amount of SI Trucking's statutory liability pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 14706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rankins argue on appeal that ROTMS's liability is immaterial to SI's liability and that they (the Rankins) did present evidence of SI's liability and the extent of damages. SI has not entered an appearance, so there is no one to explain and defend the ruling of the magistrate judge. We must do the best we can, adjusting the standard of review &#8212; <i>de novo,</i> abuse of discretion, and so on &#8212; to the underlying issues presented by the ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from count I that both ROTMS and SI were sued as \"carriers\" subject to the Carmack Amendment and, from the incorporated prior factual assertions in the complaint, that one was the originating and the other the destination carrier of goods damaged or stolen in transit. Broadly speaking, the magistrate judge is right that ordinarily liability of the two carriers would be co-extensive (not because SI was a subcontractor but because the statute makes the two carriers each fully liable) &#8212; a liability understood, in the jargon of the common law, to be joint and several. <i>Pizzo v. Bekin Van Lines Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774178\"><a href=\"/opinion/774178/josephine-pizzo-v-bekin-van-lines-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span>, 634 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus it is hard to understand what the magistrate judge meant in saying that \"[t]he Rankins have not alleged a separate breach of contract claim against SI nor a separate tort claim for damage to personal property....\" The Carmack Amendment effectively creates a federal statutory remedy on the bill of lading against both the originating and destination carrier, and the complaint is clear that the Rankins were seeking this remedy against SI as well as ROTMS. Whether one thinks of the claim against the destination carrier as contract, tort, or just a product of the statute, count I does assert a claim against SI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, liability is likely to be co-extensive if each carrier asserts the same defenses and faces and presents the same evidence; and ROTMS argued that its liability was not for the full value of the lost or damaged goods because it had limited its liability to 60 cents per pound, as the Carmack Amendment permits subject to certain procedures. <i>Hollingsworth &amp; Vose Co. v. A-P-A Transp. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198178\"><a href=\"/opinion/198178/hollingsworth-vose-v-a-p-a-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 618-21 (1st Cir.1998). But the magistrate judge had earlier refused to grant ROTMS summary judgment even on this limited liability issue (because it was not clear that the Rankins had consented to the limitation). And that defense &#8212; which is only a limitation on the amount &#8212; was never adjudicated because ROTMS settled thereafter with the Rankins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a few states, a settlement with one joint tortfeasor releases the other, <i>e.g., Dougherty v. Cal. Kettleman Oil Royalties, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449139\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449139/dougherty-v-cal-kettleman-oil-r-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></span>, 693 (Cal.1939), but the predominant \"modern\" rule is that release of one joint tortfeasor does not release another. <i>See Restatement (Second) Judgments</i> &#167; 50, cmt. a, illus. 1 (1982). Of course, anything paid by ROTMS for stolen property or damage should reduce SI's liability for property loss or damage &#8212; collateral source issues aside, one cannot collect twice for the same injury, <i>id.</i> at illus. 1 &#8212; but there is no indication that ROTMS paid in settlement all of the approximately $105,000 that the Rankins apparently claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did then the magistrate judge mean that the Rankins had simply failed to offer evidence as to damages? This seems unlikely, despite one reference to a supposed failure of the Rankins to present \"sufficient evidence to establish the amount\" of SI's liability. The reason why this is unlikely is that the Rankins plausibly represent that in substance they offered their own testimony at the hearing as to what was damaged or missing and provided their estimates of worth, together with photographs of damaged items. Such evidence is ordinarily competent, even without expert testimony. <i>See</i> note 4, above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through a mechanical malfunction, the default judgment hearing was not recorded. However, the Rankins properly presented a statement of their evidence for the approval of the magistrate judge, which was given. Fed.R.App.P. 10(c). This comprised the lists of property and loss estimates, copies of the photographs, and the representation that Ron Rankin had testified that the lists contained accurate statements of what was damaged or missing and his best estimate of the value of lost items and the dollar value of the damage. If the magistrate judge thought that the Rankins' evidence was defective, neither this conclusion nor the grounds for it have been explicitly set forth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we are bound to remand the count I claim against SI for further proceedings. Of course, even if liability is clear &#8212; and we do not foreclose some further explanation of why it is not &#8212; the magistrate judge is not bound to accept the Rankins' own estimates, which Allstate itself apparently contests; but that would reduce rather than eliminate SI's liability. If the same issues are to be tried against Allstate, nothing prevents the magistrate judge from deferring a decision on SI's liability until that proceeding is complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a peculiar case. Although the Rankins have been largely successful on this appeal, it is far from plain that the Rankins' estimates, as opposed to Allstate's, will necessarily prevail at trial and equally unclear that Allstate is liable for unreasonable delay under the statute &#8212; let alone for consequential damages: we have said only that the delay issue is not quite suitable for summary judgment on this record. Given these uncertainties, we urge again &#8212; as we did at oral argument &#8212; that the Rankins and Allstate consider anew the possibility of settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court insofar as it dismissed or denied the contract and statutory claims against Allstate and the Carmack Amendment claim against SI Trucking is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Concord policy covered damage but not theft and all parties appear to agree that, as to damaged property, Allstate and Concord were each liable for half. Concord ultimately valued the losses from damage at around $24,000, and paid half of that amount to the Rankins in February 2002</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The arbitration provision, limited to valuation disputes, provided for each side to appoint an appraiser and, if the two appraisers could not agree, to select an \"umpire\" whose decision would be final</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the parties do not discuss the question, arbitration-related issues in this case are probably governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 1,<i>et seq.</i> (2000).
