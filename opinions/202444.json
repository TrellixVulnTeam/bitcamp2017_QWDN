Plaintiff-appellant   James   M.\n\nFeeney, a former inmate of the Massachusetts correctional system,\n\nbrought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming that Correctional\n\nMedical Services, Inc. (\"CMS\") and seven health care professionals\n\nacted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in\n\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.      The district court dismissed\n\nthe case against five of the defendants for failure to state a\n\nclaim and later granted summary judgment in favor of the other\n\nthree.1   Feeney appeals, and we affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\nA.   Factual Background\n\n           At all times relevant to his complaint, appellant Feeney\n\nwas an inmate at the Old County Correctional Center in Bridgewater,\n\nMassachusetts.   He was released in December 2004.    He claims that,\n\nfor more than two years during his incarceration, he was denied\n\nappropriate medical care, including prescribed orthopedic footwear,\n\nfor “plantar fasciitis,” a painful foot condition. The following\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       CMS provided medical care for Massachusetts inmates through\nDecember 2002.    Its successor, the University of Massachusetts\nCorrectional Healthcare Program (\"UMCHP\"), is not a defendant in\nthis case. The defendants dismissed were: CMS; the director of the\nHealth Services Unit (“HSU”) at Old County Correctional Center,\nJohn Crotty; two medical doctors in the unit, Donald Kern and Kasim\nGouda; and John Noonan, director of the Department of Correction’s\nHealth Services Division. The remaining defendants were Arthur\nBrewer, Regional Medical Director of CMS through December 2002;\nCharles King, a podiatrist; and Carol McLellan, a nurse\npractitioner in Old County’s HSU.\n\n                                  -2-\n\ffacts concerning his treatment, summarized from the record, are not\n\nin dispute.\n\n          Feeney first reported foot pain on August 7, 2000.\n\nBetween August and November, he was examined repeatedly by nurses\n\nand once by physician Kern.         Medication for pain relief was\n\nprescribed, x-rays were taken, and generic shoe inserts (heel cups)\n\nwere provided.   On November 7, podiatrist King diagnosed Feeney\n\nwith \"acute plantar fasciitis.\"2         The doctor provided an anti-\n\ninflammatory steroid injection and advised continued use of the\n\nshoe inserts and pain medication.       Treatment of Feeney's foot pain\n\ncontinued during the next several months. He was examined multiple\n\ntimes by various medical practitioners, and additional laboratory\n\ntests and x-rays were ordered.          Different shoe inserts (arch\n\nsupports) were prescribed and provided.          Stretching exercises,\n\nice, and alternative pain medications were prescribed when prior\n\nmedications became ineffective.\n\n          On June 19, 2001, King saw Feeney for the third time.\n\nFeeney would not permit King to examine his feet, claiming that\n\nthey were too sore to be touched.        King ordered a \"custom molded\n\northotic\" and \"walking shoes.\"     The next day, Kern discussed the\n\ncase with King and countermanded “for now” King's prescription for\n\n\n\n     2\n       The plantar fascia is a fibrous tissue in the sole of the\nfoot. Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation of the plantar fascia\nthat causes foot or heel pain. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 646-\n47, 649, 652 (27th ed. 2000).\n\n                                  -3-\n\forthotics because \"the patient did not allow Dr. King to examine\n\nhim.\"     In the absence of any objective medical evidence, Kern\n\nthought    it   premature   to   order   orthotics.      King   scheduled   a\n\nreevaluation of Feeney, which occurred on July 24, with Kern\n\npresent.     This time, according to Kern’s report, King indicated\n\nthat Feeney's \"evaluation is not consistent with a diagnosis of\n\nplantar faci[i]tis.         Other possibilities include a neurologic\n\netiology and/or non-organic etiology.\"        King suggested that custom\n\narch supports be placed in Feeney's current shoes because such an\n\nintervention would not aggravate a neurologic problem and would\n\nlikely resolve a true case of plantar fasciitis.           Before adopting\n\nKing’s recommendation, Kern sought outside review to explore the\n\npossibility of a neurological cause for Feeney's foot pain.\n\n            Although Feeney met with medical professionals repeatedly\n\nduring the next year and a half, he did not receive the prescribed\n\northotics.      He had various diagnostic tests and a physical therapy\n\nconsultation.      On December 30, 2002, Feeney was evaluated by a\n\nneurosurgeon at Tufts-New England Medical Center. The neurosurgeon\n\nalso suspected plantar fasciitis: \"I think James Feeney has right\n\nplantar fasciitis which evolved into a right lower extremity pain\n\nsyndrome.\"      On March 25, 2003, podiatrist King saw Feeney again.\n\nHe   \"strongly      recommend[ed]    supportive       walking   shoe[s]     in\n\nconjunction with custom orthotics,\" and his report was reviewed and\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fendorsed by Kern on April 21.         Feeney eventually received his\n\northotics in May 2003.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n           Feeney filed the pro se complaint underlying this case in\n\nearly January 2002, while his treatment was ongoing.          On June 19,\n\n2002, the district court issued an order directing that the claims\n\nagainst CMS, Crotty, Gouda, and Kern be dismissed for failure to\n\nstate a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e), unless Feeney\n\nshowed good cause within 42 days why the claims against those\n\ndefendants should survive.3    The time period elapsed with no filing\n\nby Feeney.4\n\n           Nearly   three   years   later,   and   after   numerous   other\n\nfilings, Feeney retained counsel.         On May 31, 2005, the three\n\n\n      3\n       Section 1915 governs proceedings that are filed in forma\npauperis. The statute authorizes a federal court, sua sponte, to\ndismiss such an action if the court determines that it fails to\nstate a claim on which relief may be granted. See 28 U.S.C. §\n1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).   The district court concluded that Feeney’s\nallegations arguably raised a claim for deliberate indifference\nagainst Brewer, Noonan, McLellan and King, but that he failed “to\nallege any facts indicating that any action (or inaction) by [CMS,\nCrotty, Kern or Gouda] . . . actually injured him.”\n\n     4\n       Appellant did submit a cursory motion seeking to amend his\ncomplaint on August 26, 2002 – after the 42-day deadline.      The\ncourt denied that motion a month later, without prejudice, because\nit was not accompanied by a proposed amended complaint. Another\nmotion for leave to amend was docketed on October 3, but again no\nproposed amended complaint was attached. The earlier motion stated\nthat CMS and Kern were “necessary to properly proceed in this\naction,” but did not elaborate and made no reference to Crotty and\nGouda.    The second motion added a reference to Crotty as a\n“necessary” party.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fremaining defendants – Brewer, McLellan, and King – jointly filed\n\na motion for summary judgment.5    On June 8, CMS, Crotty, Gouda and\n\nKern filed a motion for entry of a separate and final judgment\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).   The district court held a hearing on\n\nthe pending motion for summary judgment on July 7.    It granted the\n\nmotion the same day, and entered a final judgment in favor of all\n\ndefendants, including those previously dismissed.        On appeal,\n\nFeeney challenges the court’s summary judgment ruling.6\n\n                                  II.\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n           We review a district court's summary judgment ruling de\n\nnovo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty and likewise drawing all reasonable inferences in that\n\nparty’s favor.   McConkie v. Nichols, 446 F.3d 258, 260 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Merchants Ins. Co. of NH v. U.S. Fidelity and Guaranty Co.,\n\n143 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1998).    Summary judgment is appropriate if\n\nthe record shows there is no genuine issue of material fact and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. McConkie,\n\n446 F.3d at 260; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       By this time, the court had granted Noonan’s motion to\ndismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n     6\n      Appellant’s brief does not address the dismissal rulings and\nwe accordingly do not consider them.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fB.   Analysis\n\n1.   Legal framework\n\n           In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976), the Supreme\n\nCourt established that an Eighth Amendment claim of “cruel and\n\nunusual punishment” based on medical mistreatment requires more\n\nthan “an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care” and\n\nmust involve “acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.”         Id. at 105-06;\n\nsee also Miranda v. Munoz, 770 F.2d 255, 259 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n     The obvious case would be a denial of needed medical\n     treatment in order to punish the inmate. But deliberate\n     indifference may also reside in 'wanton' decisions to\n     deny or delay care, where the action is recklessness,\n     ‘not in the tort law sense but in the appreciably\n     stricter criminal-law sense, requiring actual knowledge\n     of impending harm, easily preventable.’\n\nWatson v. Caton, 984 F.2d 537, 540 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n           “Deliberate indifference” thus defines a narrow band of\n\nconduct in this setting.       In Layne v. Vinzant, 657 F.2d 468 (1st\n\nCir. 1981), we stated that even a jury finding of \"treatment\n\nsubstandard, even to the point of malpractice, is not the issue.\"\n\nId. at 474.     Importantly for our analysis of Feeney's claim, we\n\nheld in Ferranti v. Moran, 618 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1980), that when\n\na plaintiff's \"allegations simply reflect a disagreement on the\n\nappropriate course of treatment[, s]uch a dispute with an exercise\n\nof   professional   judgment    may    present   a   colorable   claim   of\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fnegligence,       but   it    falls   short     of    alleging    a    constitutional\n\nviolation.\"       Id. at 891; see also Torraco v. Maloney, 923 F.2d 231,\n\n234 (1st Cir. 1991).               The care provided must have been “‘so\n\ninadequate as to shock the conscience.’”                   Torraco, 923 F.2d at 235\n\n(quoting Sires v. Berman, 834 F.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n2.   Feeney's claim\n\n             In    alleging       deliberate     indifference         to   his    serious\n\nmedical needs, Feeney points particularly to the lengthy delay in\n\nproviding him with orthopedic footwear after King first prescribed\n\nit in June 2001.             That delay is plain from the record.                 Within\n\ncontext,     however,        it   falls   short      of    establishing      an    Eighth\n\nAmendment violation. The summary judgment record reveals that: (1)\n\nFeeney was examined by medical professionals many times – sometimes\n\nweekly   –   after      he    first   reported       his   symptoms;       (2)   numerous\n\ndiagnostic tests were performed, including blood work, x-rays, and\n\nMRIs;    (3)       outside        specialists,        including       a     podiatrist,\n\nneurologist, neurosurgeon, and physical therapist were consulted;\n\n(4) Feeney was given other treatments for his symptoms, including\n\npain medications, generic shoe inserts (as opposed to custom\n\northotics), steroid injections, and physical therapy; and (5)\n\nthroughout the relevant time period, uncertainty remained about the\n\nsource of his pain, and causes other than plantar faciitis were\n\nbeing investigated.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f            Kern’s cancellation “for now” of King’s prescription for\n\northotics in June 2001 was reasonably based on the fact that Feeney\n\nhad refused to allow King to examine his feet that day, and the\n\npodiatrist also had not yet seen recently taken x-rays.           King thus\n\nhad no current clinical support for the prescription.             The next\n\nmonth, after King examined Feeney with Kern present, the podiatrist\n\nindicated    that   a   neurological   problem,   rather   than    plantar\n\nfasciitis, might be the problem.         Although King again suggested\n\ncustom orthotics, the recommendation was offered as a method for\n\npossibly excluding plantar faciitis as a diagnosis.           Given the\n\nspeculative value of the proposed remedy, Kern’s desire to obtain\n\nreview of King’s conclusions before moving ahead with a remedial\n\nplan was understandable.\n\n            Although the course of treatment during the next twenty-\n\ntwo months led back to the prescription for orthotics, the delay\n\nalone – given the ongoing efforts to identify the source of\n\nappellant’s pain – does not on any view of the facts rise to the\n\nlevel of an Eighth Amendment violation.      The correctional center’s\n\nmedical staff was responsive to appellant’s complaints, expended\n\nsubstantial resources trying to get to the root of his problem, and\n\nadopted other measures in an effort to alleviate his discomfort.\n\nEven if it could be said that failing to provide the orthotics\n\nearlier reflected poor judgment on the part of some defendants – a\n\nmatter on which we take no view – this was not an omission that\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fcould be termed “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,\"\n\nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 104.   “‘[W]here the dispute concerns not the\n\nabsence of help, but the choice of a certain course of treatment,’\n\n. . . deliberate indifference may be found where the attention\n\nreceived is ‘so clearly inadequate as to amount to a refusal to\n\nprovide essential care.’”    Torraco, 923 F.2d at 234 (internal\n\ncitations omitted).   The record unequivocally demonstrates that\n\nthis is not such a case.\n\n          Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Brewer, McLellan, and King.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

King scheduled a reevaluation of Feeney, which occurred on July 24, with Kern present. This time, according to Kern's report, King indicated that Feeney's \"evaluation is not consistent with a diagnosis of plantar faci[i]tis. Other possibilities include a neurologic etiology and/or non-organic etiology.\" King suggested that custom arch supports be placed in Feeney's current shoes because such an intervention would not aggravate a neurologic problem and would likely resolve a true case of plantar fasciitis.

That delay is plain from the record. Within context, however, it falls short of establishing an Eighth Amendment violation. The summary judgment record reveals that: (1) Feeney was examined by medical professionals many times &#8212; sometimes weekly &#8212; after he first reported his symptoms; (2) numerous diagnostic tests were performed, including blood work, x-rays, and MRIs; (3) outside specialists, including a podiatrist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, and physical therapist were consulted; (4) Feeney was given other treatments for his symptoms, including pain medications, generic shoe inserts (as opposed to custom orthotics), steroid injections, and physical therapy; and (5) throughout the relevant time period, uncertainty remained about the source of his pain, and causes other than plantar faciitis were being investigated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kern's cancellation \"for now\" of King's prescription for orthotics in June 2001 was reasonably based on the fact that Feeney had refused to allow King to examine his feet that day, and the podiatrist also had not yet seen recently taken x-rays. King thus had no current clinical support for the prescription. The next month, after King examined Feeney with Kern present, the podiatrist indicated that a neurological problem, rather than plantar fasciitis, might be the problem. Although King again suggested custom orthotics, the recommendation was offered as a method for possibly excluding plantar faciitis as a diagnosis. Given the speculative value of the proposed remedy, Kern's desire to obtain review of King's conclusions before moving ahead with a remedial plan was understandable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the course of treatment during the next twenty-two months led back to the prescription for orthotics, the delay alone &#8212; given the ongoing efforts to identify the source of appellant's pain &#8212; does not on any view of the facts rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. The correctional center's medical staff was responsive to appellant's complaints, expended substantial resources trying to get to the root of his problem, and adopted other measures in an effort to alleviate his discomfort. Even if it could be said that failing to provide the orthotics earlier reflected poor judgment on the part of some defendants &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; this was not an omission that could be termed \"deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,\" <i>Estelle,</i> 429 U.S. at 104, 97 S.Ct. 285. \"`[W]here the dispute concerns not the absence of help, but the choice of a certain course of treatment,' . . . deliberate indifference may be found where the attention received is `so clearly inadequate as to amount to a refusal to provide essential care.'\" <i>Torraco,</i> 923 F.2d at 234 (internal citations omitted).

Feeney, a former inmate of the Massachusetts correctional system, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 claiming that Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (\"CMS\") and seven health care professionals acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The district court dismissed the case against five of the defendants for failure to state a claim and later granted summary judgment in favor of the other three.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Feeney appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At all times relevant to his complaint, appellant Feeney was an inmate at the Old County Correctional Center in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. He was released in December 2004. He claims that, for more than two years during his incarceration, he was denied appropriate medical care, including prescribed orthopedic footwear, for \"plantar fasciitis,\" a painful foot condition. The following facts concerning his treatment, summarized from the record, are not in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feeney first reported foot pain on August 7, 2000. Between August and November, he was examined repeatedly by nurses and once by physician Kern. Medication for pain relief was prescribed, x-rays were taken, and generic shoe inserts (heel cups) were provided. On November 7, podiatrist King diagnosed Feeney with \"acute plantar fasciitis.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The doctor provided an anti-inflammatory steroid injection and advised continued use of the shoe inserts and pain medication. Treatment of Feeney's foot pain continued during the next several months. He was examined multiple times by various medical practitioners, and additional laboratory tests and x-rays were ordered. Different shoe inserts (arch supports) were prescribed and provided. Stretching exercises, ice, and alternative pain medications were prescribed when prior medications became ineffective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 2001, King saw Feeney for the third time. Feeney would not permit King to examine his feet, claiming that they were too sore to be touched. King ordered a \"custom molded orthotic\" and \"walking shoes.\" The next day, Kern discussed the case with King and countermanded \"for now\" King's prescription for orthotics because \"the patient did not allow Dr. King to examine him.\" In the absence of any objective medical evidence, Kern thought it premature to order orthotics. King scheduled a reevaluation of Feeney, which occurred on July 24, with Kern present. This time, according to Kern's report, King indicated that Feeney's \"evaluation is not consistent with a diagnosis of plantar faci[i]tis. Other possibilities include a neurologic etiology and/or non-organic etiology.\" King suggested that custom arch supports be placed in Feeney's current shoes because such an intervention would not aggravate a neurologic problem and would likely resolve a true case of plantar fasciitis. Before adopting King's recommendation, Kern sought outside review to explore the possibility of a neurological cause for Feeney's foot pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Feeney met with medical professionals repeatedly during the next year and a half, he did not receive the prescribed orthotics. He had various diagnostic tests and a physical therapy consultation. On December 30, 2002, Feeney was evaluated by a neurosurgeon at Tufts-New England Medical Center. The neurosurgeon also suspected plantar fasciitis: \"I think James Feeney has right plantar fasciitis which evolved into a right lower extremity pain syndrome.\" On March 25, 2003, podiatrist King saw Feeney again. He \"strongly recommend[ed] supportive walking shoe[s] in conjunction with custom orthotics,\" and his report was reviewed and endorsed by Kern on April 21. Feeney eventually received his orthotics in May 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feeney filed the <i>pro se</i> complaint underlying this case in early January 2002, while his treatment was ongoing. On June 19, 2002, the district court issued an order directing that the claims against CMS, Crotty, Gouda, and Kern be dismissed for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1915(e), unless Feeney showed good cause within 42 days why the claims against those defendants should survive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The time period elapsed with no filing by Feeney.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly three years later, and after numerous other filings, Feeney retained counsel. On May 31, 2005, the three remaining defendants &#8212; Brewer, McLellan, and King &#8212; jointly filed a motion for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> On June 8, CMS, Crotty, Gouda and Kern filed a motion for entry of a separate and final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). The district court held a hearing on the pending motion for summary judgment on July 7. It granted the motion the same day, and entered a final judgment in favor of all defendants, including those previously dismissed. On appeal, Feeney challenges the court's summary judgment ruling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.
