Petitioner       Claudia   Elena   Orrego-Quiroz\n\n(\"Petitioner\") seeks review of a final order of removal issued by\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which affirmed, without\n\nopinion, the decision of the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denying\n\nPetitioner's applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").1\n\n                              I.    BACKGROUND\n\n          Petitioner, a native and citizen of Columbia, entered the\n\nUnited States illegally on June 26, 2002.             The Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS)2 issued a Notice to Appear on June 28,\n\n2002, charging   her   with    removability      pursuant   to   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1182(a)(6)(A)(i) as an alien present in the United States without\n\nbeing admitted or paroled.         Petitioner conceded removability, but\n\nsought relief from removal in the form of asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and withholding of removal under the CAT, on the ground\n\nthat she feared persecution on the basis of imputed political\n\naffiliation and membership in a particular social group.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms\nof Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10,\n1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, was implemented in the United States by the\nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No.\n105-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681-822 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231).\n     2\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §\n471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. §\n291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            Petitioner testified at her hearing before the IJ that\n\nshe had fled Colombia because she had suffered persecution, and\n\nfeared future persecution, resulting from her affiliation with a\n\nyouth organization called Urban Central Communal Action (\"Communal\n\nAction Group\"), a group that provides poor communities with food,\n\nhousehold items, and educational programs.              Petitioner testified\n\nthat in order to carry out their mission, the Communal Action Group\n\nhad   to   \"pay    the   politicians    for   their   help\"   and   that   their\n\nactivities were financed by politicians.              She further testified\n\nthat although she and the Communal Action Group did not work for\n\nthe government, a terrorist group called the Revolutionary Armed\n\nForces of Colombia (\"FARC\") believes the Communal Action Members\n\nare helping the Colombian government, and thus targets them for\n\npersecution on the basis of imputed political affiliation.\n\n            The incidents of alleged persecution against Petitioner\n\nin Colombia consist of threatening phone calls and letters, and\n\nthree discrete additional incidents.            The first incident involved\n\nFARC members shooting at the Communal Action Group while they were\n\nattempting to carry out one of their charity missions. During this\n\nattack, members of FARC shot at Petitioner and her group and\n\nwounded the father of her son and two others.              The second attack\n\noccurred when she and other members of her group were traveling to\n\na town when FARC members ordered them out of their cars at\n\ngunpoint,    and    proceeded   to     burn   their   vehicles   with   ignited\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fgasoline.     In the last incident, Petitioner claims that a man\n\nthreatened her and demanded that she contribute a million pesos to\n\nFARC.    Petitioner left Colombia soon thereafter.    After Petitioner\n\nleft Colombia, the owners of the taxi she used to drive were\n\nattacked, with one of the two being killed.       Petitioner claims it\n\nis likely that she was the target of this attack.\n\n            The IJ found that Petitioner did not establish past\n\npersecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution, because\n\nshe was not a credible witness, and, even if Petitioner were\n\ncredible, that she had failed to establish a nexus between the\n\npersecution and a protected ground.           The IJ then went on to\n\nconclude that Petitioner also had failed to satisfy her burden for\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the CAT.      Finding that\n\nthe IJ's credibility determinations are supported by substantial\n\nevidence, we deny Petitioner's petition for review.3\n\n                           II.   DISCUSSION\n\n            While this case involves judicial review of a decision by\n\nthe BIA, when the BIA summarily affirms the opinion of the IJ, we\n\nreview the IJ's analysis.    Diab v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 35, 39 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    The BIA's decision will be upheld if it is \"supported\n\nby reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record\n\n\n\n     3\n      We need not decide, and thus express no opinion on, the issue\nof whether there is a nexus between the alleged acts of persecution\nagainst Petitioner on one of the five protected grounds that serve\nas a basis for asylum.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fconsidered as a whole.\"     INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992).    We will overturn a decision of the BIA \"only when the\n\nrecord evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a\n\ncontrary determination.\"     Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (citing Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 & n.1).\n\nA.          Asylum\n\n            In order to establish eligibility for asylum, Petitioner\n\nbears the burden to show that she is a \"refugee\" under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(b)(1), meaning that she is \"unable or unwilling to return to\n\n. . . [Colombia] because of persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\"     8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A).      Petitioner can \"meet this burden in one of two\n\nways:    (1) by demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of one of the statutory grounds, or (2) by establishing\n\npast persecution on one of the statutory grounds so as to be\n\nentitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.\"\n\nMukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Here, Petitioner relies primarily upon her affidavit and\n\nher testimony to support her claim for asylum.4   Although an asylum\n\n\n     4\n      Petitioner also provided the IJ with a copy of her brother's\ndeath certificate from 1988 (to corroborate her story that her\nbrother had been murdered, and that his murder inspired her to join\nthe Community Action Group, following in her brother's footsteps of\ndoing something for the greater good), a letter from the Assembly\nof Urban Central Communal Action stating, without evidence or\nexample, that Petitioner had received multiple threats from armed\n\n                                  -5-\n\fapplicant's testimony \"may be sufficient to sustain the burden of\n\nproof without corroboration,\" such testimony must be credible.\n\nSettenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting 8\n\nC.F.R. 1208.13(a)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                      The IJ\n\nfound Petitioner       not    to   be    a   credible    witness,     stating   that\n\nPetitioner was \"evasive and wholly lacking in credibility in\n\ncertain crucial parts of her testimony.\"                 The IJ also found that\n\nher testimony was internally inconsistent and contradicted parts of\n\nthe affidavit she submitted in support of her asylum application.\n\nThe     IJ   identified      three      particular      inconsistencies:         (1)\n\ndiscrepancies about her places of residence in Colombia; (2)\n\ninconsistency between her affidavit which states that she last\n\nsaw/heard from the father of her child in the hospital after he was\n\ninjured in the FARC attack, and her hearing testimony, which stated\n\nthat after he was released from the hospital their \"relationship\n\nbegan to deteriorate;\" and (3) inconsistency between her affidavit\n\nwhich    says   that   both   the    husband     and    wife   taxi   owners    were\n\n\"brutally massacred\" and her testimony, which states that only the\n\nhusband was killed, and the wife was merely injured.                     And, even\n\nthough the Petitioner attempts to explain away each inconsistency,\n\nlooking at all of the inconsistencies as a whole, coupled with the\n\n\nrebel groups, and several pieces of evidence irrelevant to this\nappeal.   The record also includes a U.S. Department of Justice\ncountry condition report for Colombia dated March 31, 2003, which\nprovides some background information on the guerilla activities of\nthe FARC.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fIJ's determination that Petitioner was evasive in her responses,\n\nthe IJ's determination that Petitioner has failed to establish her\n\neligibility for asylum is well-supported.          Further, the limited\n\ndocumentary evidence provided by Petitioner does not compel that we\n\ndisregard the adverse credibility findings of the IJ.             Petitioner\n\nhas failed to meet her burden to establish eligibility for asylum.\n\nB.          Withholding of Removal\n\n            To establish eligibility for withholding of removal,\n\nPetitioner has to prove that, \"upon deportation, [s]he [was] more\n\nlikely than not to face persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"    Salazar v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(emphasis in original).      As this is a more stringent standard than\n\nthat   required    to   establish   eligibility   for   asylum,    a    burden\n\nPetitioner has failed to meet, Petitioner necessarily fails to meet\n\nher burden to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\n\nC.          CAT\n\n            Lastly, Petitioner seeks protection under the CAT.              To\n\nseek relief under the CAT, an applicant must \"establish that it is\n\nmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to\n\n[Colombia].\"      8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2) (emphasis added).            \"For an\n\nact to constitute torture it must be:        (1) an act causing severe\n\nphysical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted;\n\n(3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwith the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has\n\ncustody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from\n\nlawful sanctions.\"    Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quotation omitted).     Petitioner makes no argument to this\n\nCourt that she is more like than not to be tortured upon her return\n\nto Colombia, and, fails to even address the requirement that to be\n\nprotected under the CAT, any alleged torture must be \"with the\n\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or\n\nphysical control of the victim.\"         Id.; see, e.g., Smilow v.\n\nSouthwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (\"Issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner (or not at\n\nall) are waived.\").\n\n                           III.   CONCLUSION\n\n             For the above-mentioned reasons, the petition for review\n\nis DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

Petitioner can \"meet this burden in one of two\n\nways:    (1) by demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of one of the statutory grounds, or (2) by establishing\n\npast persecution on one of the statutory grounds so as to be\n\nentitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.\"\n\nMukamusoni v.

The IJ\n\nfound Petitioner       not    to   be    a   credible    witness,     stating   that\n\nPetitioner was \"evasive and wholly lacking in credibility in\n\ncertain crucial parts of her testimony.\"                 The IJ also found that\n\nher testimony was internally inconsistent and contradicted parts of\n\nthe affidavit she submitted in support of her asylum application.\n\nThe     IJ   identified      three      particular      inconsistencies:         (1)\n\ndiscrepancies about her places of residence in Colombia; (2)\n\ninconsistency between her affidavit which states that she last\n\nsaw/heard from the father of her child in the hospital after he was\n\ninjured in the FARC attack, and her hearing testimony, which stated\n\nthat after he was released from the hospital their \"relationship\n\nbegan to deteriorate;\" and (3) inconsistency between her affidavit\n\nwhich    says   that   both   the    husband     and    wife   taxi   owners    were\n\n\"brutally massacred\" and her testimony, which states that only the\n\nhusband was killed, and the wife was merely injured.                     And, even\n\nthough the Petitioner attempts to explain away each inconsistency,\n\nlooking at all of the inconsistencies as a whole, coupled with the\n\n\nrebel groups, and several pieces of evidence irrelevant to this\nappeal.   The record also includes a U.S. Department of Justice\ncountry condition report for Colombia dated March 31, 2003, which\nprovides some background information on the guerilla activities of\nthe FARC.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fIJ's determination that Petitioner was evasive in her responses,\n\nthe IJ's determination that Petitioner has failed to establish her\n\neligibility for asylum is well-supported.          Further, the limited\n\ndocumentary evidence provided by Petitioner does not compel that we\n\ndisregard the adverse credibility findings of the IJ.             Petitioner\n\nhas failed to meet her burden to establish eligibility for asylum.\n\nB.          Withholding of Removal\n\n            To establish eligibility for withholding of removal,\n\nPetitioner has to prove that, \"upon deportation, [s]he [was] more\n\nlikely than not to face persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"    Salazar v.

As this is a more stringent standard than\n\nthat   required    to   establish   eligibility   for   asylum,    a    burden\n\nPetitioner has failed to meet, Petitioner necessarily fails to meet\n\nher burden to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\n\nC.          CAT\n\n            Lastly, Petitioner seeks protection under the CAT.              To\n\nseek relief under the CAT, an applicant must \"establish that it is\n\nmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to\n\n[Colombia].\"      8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2) (emphasis added).            \"For an\n\nact to constitute torture it must be:        (1) an act causing severe\n\nphysical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted;\n\n(3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwith the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has\n\ncustody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from\n\nlawful sanctions.\"    Elien v.

Petitioner makes no argument to this\n\nCourt that she is more like than not to be tortured upon her return\n\nto Colombia, and, fails to even address the requirement that to be\n\nprotected under the CAT, any alleged torture must be \"with the\n\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or\n\nphysical control of the victim.\"         Id.; see, e.g., Smilow v.\n\nSouthwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200373\"><a href=\"/opinion/200373/smilow-v-southwestern-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (\"Issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner (or not at\n\nall) are waived.\").\n\n                           III.
