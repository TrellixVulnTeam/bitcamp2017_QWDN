Cox on brief for petitioner.\n     Jennifer R. Khouri, Trial Attorney, Tony West, Assistant\nAttorney General, and Barry J. Pettinato, Assistant Director, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          December 11, 2009\n\f           Per Curiam.     This is a petition for review of a removal\n\norder.   The petitioner, Hua Li, a Chinese citizen who entered the\n\nUnited States illegally and was subsequently ordered removed, seeks\n\nreview of the denial of his application for asylum and withholding\n\nof removal.     For the reasons discussed below--essentially, that Li\n\nfailed to meet his burden of proving that he had an objectively\n\nreasonable fear of future persecution if removed to China--we deny\n\nthe petition.\n\n           Given the uncontested finding that Li did not suffer past\n\npersecution, he cannot benefit from the presumption that he would\n\nsuffer   future    persecution    on    a    protected   ground.    8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(b)(1); see also Jorgji v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 53, 57 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).       Rather, it was his burden to show that he had an\n\nobjectively reasonable fear of future persecution.                  8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b)(1); see also Sugiarto v. Holder, 2009 WL 3738792, at\n\n*3 (1st Cir. Nov. 10, 2009).           To show that a fear is objectively\n\nreasonable, the applicant must show \"a reasonable possibility of\n\nsuffering such persecution\" upon return to his country.             8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b)(2)(i)(b); see also Castillo-Diaz v. Holder, 562 F.3d\n\n23, 26 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          Our     review   of    the    Board    of   Immigration   Appeals'\n\ndetermination that Li did not satisfy that burden is deferential.\n\nJorgji, 514 F.3d at 57.     That determination must be upheld \"unless\n\nthe record 'points unerringly in the opposite direction.'\"               Lopez\n\n                                       -2-\n\fde Hincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting\n\nLaurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 69 (1st Cir. 2004)).      Under that\n\nstandard, this petition fails.\n\n              As the BIA acknowledged, Li could have established his\n\neligibility for asylum if he had demonstrated a well-founded fear\n\nof persecution on account of an imputed affiliation with Falun\n\nGong.1       See Lin v. Holder, 561 F.3d 68, 73 n.2 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nHowever, the BIA was \"not persuaded by the unsupported assertion\n\nthat the later denouncement [of Li] by the village cadre2 'could\n\nvery well' have led the police to believe that [Li] was more\n\ninvolved in Falun Gong than they had previously thought.\"\n\n              The BIA's skepticism in that regard is amply supported by\n\nthe record.      The letter threatening \"serious consequences\" came not\n\nfrom the police, the feared persecutors, but from the village cadre\n\nwhom, Li admits, was motivated not by Li's alleged Falun Gong\n\nactivities but by his refusal to marry the cadre's sister.         And\n\nthose unspecified consequences were threatened to flow from Li's\n\n\n\n         1\n      According to a 2006 State Department report submitted as an\nexhibit in this case, \"Falun Gong blends aspects of Taoism,\nBuddhism, and the meditation techniques and physical exercises of\nqigong (a traditional Chinese exercise discipline) with the\nteachings of Falun Gong leader Li Hongzhi.\"\n         2\n      Li defined the \"village cadre\" as the \"head of the village.\"\nFrom the context here and in previous cases, see, e.g., Zheng v.\nGonzales, 416 F.3d 97, 99 (1st Cir. 2005), it appears that the\ncadres (Li used the term \"cadre\" as a singular rather than a\ncollective noun) are local officials who enforce the law in\nconjunction with the local police.\n\n                                    -3-\n\ffailure to report to the police station on the appointed date, not\n\nfrom his distribution of Falun Gong leaflets.       The police were\n\nalready aware of Li's August 2005 leafleting activities and had\n\naddressed them only by requiring him to file a written statement and\n\nreport to the police station for reeducation once a week for 10 or\n\n11 weeks.    Although, under Chinese law, Falun Gong leafleters may\n\nbe imprisoned for up to seven years, there is no evidence that a\n\nperson in Li's circumstances, who was not a Falun Gong adherent and\n\nmerely leafleted for money on two occasions, would be treated that\n\nharshly.\n\n            Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Li\n\nwould be persecuted if he returned to China, we uphold the denial\n\nof his application for asylum and withholding of removal.       And,\n\nbecause he did not seek relief under the Convention Against Torture\n\nbefore the immigration judge or the BIA, we have no jurisdiction to\n\nreview the denial of such relief.      Accordingly, the petition for\n\nreview is denied.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
