George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n              Torruella, Dyk,* and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert C. Andrews for appellant.\n     Michael J. Conley, Attorney with whom Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney and F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation\nCounsel, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 14, 2005\n\n\n\n\n*\n Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge. Robert Brown appeals the district\n\ncourt's refusal to dismiss his indictment on double jeopardy\n\ngrounds following a trial that ended in a hung jury.                           Brown\n\ncontends that, although the jury was unable to reach a unanimous\n\nverdict, the court abused its discretion by declaring a mistrial\n\nbefore    it    had   explored    all   of       the   potential   alternatives.\n\nAccordingly, Brown argues, the government failed to establish the\n\n\"manifest necessity\" of declaring a mistrial.                We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            Brown was charged with a single count of distribution of\n\ncocaine.       See 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1).              The government's case --\n\nwhich    primarily    consisted    of    testimony        from   David   Pease,   a\n\nconfidential informant who testified that Brown had sold him the\n\ncocaine,   and     Daniel   Rousseau,        a   Special   Agent   of    the    Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration who testified that Brown had confessed\n\nto giving the cocaine to Pease -- was completed by early afternoon\n\non the trial's first day.         On the morning of the second day, the\n\ndefense called Robert Yankowsky, who testified that it was he, not\n\nBrown, who had unwittingly transferred an envelope containing the\n\ncocaine to Pease. Closing arguments were presented that same\n\nmorning.       The defense argued that the government's entire case\n\nrelied on Pease's testimony and that Pease, an admitted drug user\n\nwho was cooperating with the police in return for leniency in his\n\nown criminal proceedings, was not a credible witness.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f             After    receiving   instructions,   the   jury    retired   to\n\ndeliberate early that afternoon.       Four hours later, and after the\n\ncourt had already received four notes from the jury concerning\n\ntestimony and evidence, the court received the following note from\n\nthe jury: \"We are not close to a decision at this time and have\n\nmembers that need to make calls for child care.         We also would like\n\na sense of how long we will be required to deliberate prior to\n\nbreaking for the evening.\"1        After consulting with counsel, the\n\ncourt instructed the jury to continue deliberations for at least\n\none more hour.       An hour later, the jury sent a second note stating\n\nthat it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict and would like to\n\nrecess for the evening.       The court granted the request.\n\n             Deliberations resumed the next morning, the third and\n\nfinal day of the trial.      At 10:29 a.m. the court received the first\n\nnote indicating that the jury might be deadlocked:             \"We are 11-1\n\nand unable to move despite hours of work.           Where do we go from\n\nhere?\"     The court elicited proposals from counsel.      The government\n\nrequested an Allen charge, see Allen v. United States, 164 U.S.\n\n492, 501 (1896) (upholding the practice of using a supplemental\n\njury instruction to help a deadlocked jury reach unanimity), but\n\ndefense counsel expressed concern that such an instruction might\n\nexert undue pressure on the minority juror.        The court agreed and\n\nsent a note simply urging the jury to continue deliberations.             An\n\n\n     1\n         All of the jury's notes were signed by the foreperson.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhour later, the jury requested and obtained a read-back of Pease's\n\nand Yankowsky's testimony.   At 2:11 p.m., the jury sent a second\n\nnote expressing deadlock: \"We have one juror indicating a complete\n\nunwillingness, for any reason, to change his vote.    Where do we go\n\nfrom here?\"   Again the court sought suggestions from counsel, and\n\nagain the government requested an Allen charge.    This time defense\n\ncounsel concurred with the government's request and the court\n\ndelivered a modified Allen charge.\n\n           An hour-and-a-half after deliberations had resumed, the\n\ncourt, concerned by the lack of progress and a worsening snow\n\nstorm, summoned counsel to discuss the next course of action.    The\n\ngovernment requested that the court do nothing for at least another\n\nhour. Defense counsel announced concern about the weather and that\n\nthe jury had deliberated for a long time.    He suggested that the\n\ncourt inquire whether any progress was being made.        The court\n\nagreed and sent a note to the jury in accord with defense counsel's\n\nrequest.\n\n           At 4:04 p.m., the jury responded with a third note\n\nexpressing impasse: \"The juror who is not in agreement has advised\n\nwe are not making any headway in convincing him of our position.\"\n\nThe court turned to counsel, and the government suggested for the\n\nfirst time that a mistrial might be appropriate.     Defense counsel\n\nargued that for a mistrial to be appropriate \"we need to get the\n\njury to come to a position where it says that it is, in fact,\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fhopeless.\"   Agreeing with defense counsel, the court suggested\n\nsending a note asking whether there was \"any chance of reaching a\n\nverdict in this case?\"     Defense counsel endorsed the court's\n\nproposed note, and it was sent to the jury.\n\n          The response, the final note from the jury, read: \"As I\n\ndo not believe the juror not in agreement is basing his decision on\n\nevidence, but on his own 'issues,' a verdict is not likely.\"   When\n\nthe court asked defense counsel whether he had any other ideas,\n\ncounsel requested an instruction specifically aimed at the holdout\n\njuror \"requiring him to view the evidence.\" The following colloquy\n\nensued:\n\n                 THE COURT: I'm not going to do that.\n          I'm not going to instruct a juror who is\n          holding out -- that's undue force on a juror,\n          I believe. I don't think that's appropriate.\n                 Everybody has a right, obviously, to\n          view the evidence. That's what I told them in\n          the Allen charge. To point out to one juror\n          that they have to do that, I don't think it's\n          appropriate.\n                 Another alternative?\n\n                 [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I have no other\n          alternative. I don't want a mistrial in this\n          case.\n\n                 THE COURT: And what do you suggest?\n\n                 [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If you can't come to\n          a verdict, the only other option is a motion\n          to dismiss it or acquittal, or for you to\n          declare a mistrial.\n                 I don't want to agree to a mistrial.\n          Obviously if it's hopeless, the jury has\n          indicated it is, I guess the final decision is\n          up to you.\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f                   THE COURT: Alright.   Government?\n\n                                * * *\n\n                   [GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: I think, unless\n            the   Court  feels   that  questioning  this\n            particular juror would be helpful --\n\n                   THE COURT: I am concerned about doing\n            that. I think that puts a lot of pressure on\n            one juror to change an opinion that juror may\n            honestly hold, especially when the Judge is\n            squeezing that juror to look at things\n            differently.    I know what that jury is\n            thinking, and the Judge's forcing me to change\n            my mind, and I don't think that's right. I\n            won't.\n\n                   [GOVERNMENT   COUNSEL]:   No     other\n            suggestion. I would defer to the Court.\n\n                   THE COURT: I'm going to declare a\n            mistrial on this. I believe that the jury is\n            hopelessly deadlocked here.     It's plain as\n            day, as the notes that we've received.\n            Nothing has happened for a considerable period\n            of time in terms of any progress.\n                   The situation is simply that one person\n            has a strongly held opinion, and they have\n            indicated, as in the last note, they are not\n            going to move and there is no need to continue\n            this.\n                   So   I  believe   that   the  jury   is\n            deadlocked, and I believe it's manifest that a\n            mistrial be declared, and I'm going to declare\n            a mistrial in this case and reschedule this\n            for trial, another trial.\n\n            Before declaring a mistrial, the court called the jury\n\nback to the courtroom.       The court then asked, first     of the\n\nforeperson, and then of the jury collectively, whether there was a\n\ndeadlock.     When the jurors answered affirmatively, the court\n\ndeclared a mistrial, excused the jury, and set a new trial date.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           Brown filed a motion to dismiss shortly thereafter,\n\narguing   that   the   court    had   abused   its   discretion   by   hastily\n\ndeclaring a mistrial, by not engaging in the analysis required for\n\na motion for judgment of acquittal, and by failing \"to inquire of\n\nthe jurors to determine their positions on guilt or innocence.\" At\n\noral argument on the motion to dismiss, Brown additionally argued\n\nthat the court could have dismissed the holdout juror for good\n\ncause and then entered the verdict of the eleven-member jury.              The\n\ncourt denied the motion for substantially the same reasons that it\n\ndeclared the mistrial.         This interlocutory appeal followed.         See\n\nUnited States v. Keene, 287 F.3d 229, 232 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating\n\nthat an interlocutory appeal is permitted when a defendant claims\n\nthat further proceedings in the trial court constitute double\n\njeopardy).\n\n                                      II.\n\n           The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides that no\n\nperson shall be \"twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\" for the\n\nsame offense.     Among other things, the double jeopardy clause\n\nprotects defendants against \"serial attempts by the government to\n\nconvict a defendant on a single charge.\"                Id.   Without such\n\nprotection, a defendant could be subjected to multiple trials,\n\nincreasing the expense and embarrassment of the defendant, and\n\nenhancing the risk of convicting an innocent person.          Id.      In light\n\nof these concerns, \"courts have construed the Double Jeopardy\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fClause to bar retrial of a defendant after a mistrial ordered over\n\nthe defendant's objection unless the mistrial was occasioned by\n\nmanifest necessity.\"     United States v. McIntosh, 380 F.3d 548, 553\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (footnote omitted).          Although the government bears\n\nthe burden of establishing manifest necessity, \"a hung jury is the\n\nparadigmatic example of manifest necessity.\"           Id.\n\n           When a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds\n\nfollows from a district court's declaration of a mistrial, we\n\nreview the court's manifest necessity determination for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     Keene, 287 F.3d at 233 (citing Arizona v. Washington,\n\n434 U.S. 497, 514 (1978)).         The court's findings of fact are\n\nreviewed for clear error, and legal determinations are reviewed de\n\nnovo.   McIntosh, 380 F.3d at 553-54.             While our review of the\n\nmanifest necessity determination is case-specific and cannot be\n\ndischarged by resort to a mechanical checklist, see id. at 554, we\n\nhave identified three factors that are particularly relevant: (1)\n\nwhether the court provided counsel an opportunity to be heard; (2)\n\nwhether the court considered alternatives to a mistrial; and (3)\n\nwhether the court's decision was made after adequate reflection.\n\nUnited States v. Simonetti, 998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1993).          See\n\nalso Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.3 (\"Before ordering a mistrial, the court\n\nmust give each defendant and the government an opportunity to\n\ncomment on the propriety of the order, to state whether that party\n\nconsents   or    objects,   and   to    suggest    alternatives.\").   The\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\foverarching question on appeal is \"whether the district judge's\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the\n\ncircumstances.\"    Keene, 287 F.3d at 234.\n\n          The record demonstrates that the district court was\n\ncareful to satisfy each of the Simonetti factors before declaring\n\na mistrial. Throughout the course of the jury's deliberations, and\n\nfollowing the receipt of each note from the jury, the court sought\n\nsuggestions from counsel for both sides.         Not only did the court\n\nconsider alternatives to a mistrial, but, with one exception, the\n\ncourt   always    acceded   to     defense   counsel's   requests:     first\n\nwithholding an Allen charge, then delivering it in modified form,\n\nand finally sending a pair of notes to the jury to confirm that\n\nthere was no hope of a verdict.       Only defense counsel's suggestion\n\nthat the holdout juror be singled out for an additional instruction\n\nwas rejected by the court, and even then the court gave defense\n\ncounsel an opportunity to suggest an alternative.\n\n          The     record    also      reflects   the     court's     careful\n\nconsideration of the situation before it declared a mistrial.            The\n\ncourt was aware that the jury had deliberated for 13 hours in an\n\nuncomplicated case that essentially came down to choosing which of\n\nthe witnesses to believe.        The straightforward nature of the case,\n\nand the fact that the jury had communicated its deadlock on five\n\noccasions, including once in open court, support the conclusion\n\nthat the court withheld the declaration of a mistrial until it was\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fevident that a unanimous verdict was not forthcoming.        See Keene,\n\n287 F.3d at 235 (no abuse of discretion in declaring a mistrial\n\ngiven the length of deliberations in comparison to the brevity of\n\nthe trial and the simplicity of the issues, the fact that a\n\nmodified   Allen   charge   had    proven    unsuccessful,   and   \"the\n\nincreasingly adamant manner in which the jurors announced that they\n\nwere deadlocked\").\n\n           Where the Simonetti factors are satisfied, \"we will\n\nreverse only if the district court applied an incorrect legal\n\nprinciple or made a meaningful error in judgment\" in deciding to\n\ndeclare a mistrial.   McIntosh, 380 F.3d at 554.      Brown argues that\n\nfour errors precipitated the district court's erroneous mistrial\n\ndeclaration: (1) placing the burden to establish the non-existence\n\nof manifest necessity on the defendant, (2) failing to examine the\n\nevidence under the judgment of acquittal standard, (3) declining\n\nthe defense request to instruct the holdout juror to consider the\n\nevidence, and (4) refusing to voir dire the holdout juror to\n\ndetermine the basis of his position.2       Brown focuses predominantly\n\n\n     2\n      We may quickly dispose of Brown's first two contentions. As\nto the first, suffice it to say that permitting defense counsel the\nopportunity to offer alternatives to a mistrial is not tantamount\nto placing the burden on defense counsel to prove the absence of\nmanifest necessity. Such consultations are required by the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and are intended to \"reduce the\npossibility of an erroneously ordered mistrial\" to the \"benefit\n[of] both the prosecution and the defense.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.3\nadvisory committee's note 1993.\n     The contention that the court erred by failing to analyze the\nevidence under the standard for a judgment of acquittal, after\n\n                                  -10-\n\fon the third and fourth alleged errors.     He asserts that, when a\n\ncourt is faced with a choice between a defense request for a second\n\njury instruction or a mistrial, the court must issue the charge in\n\nthe case of an 11 to 1 jury panel.    Brown further argues that a\n\nvoir dire of the lone holdout juror could have revealed that the\n\njuror was not deliberating in good faith.    If that were the case,\n\nthe court could have dismissed the juror for cause and allowed the\n\n11 remaining jurors to return a verdict.      See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n23(b)(3); United States v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1309 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (upholding an 11-juror verdict where one juror had been\n\ndismissed for cause).   The court should have been aware of this\n\npotential solution, Brown argues, because the final jury note\n\nsuggested that the holdout juror's vote was based on \"his own\n\nissues,\" not on the evidence. Thus, Brown concludes, a potentially\n\nviable alternative to mistrial existed, and the court abused its\n\ndiscretion by not fully exploring that avenue.    See United States\n\nv. Toribio-Lugo, 376 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 2004) (no manifest\n\nnecessity where there was a viable alternative to mistrial that the\n\ndistrict court failed to adequately explore).\n\n\n\ndefense counsel had suggested dismissal as an alternative to a\nmistrial, also fails.     Although the court disregarded defense\ncounsel's request without explanation, it is readily apparent why:\nthe government had presented ample evidence to support a conviction\nunder 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1). Pease's testimony, if credited, made\nout the essential elements of the crime: that Brown had \"knowingly\nand intentionally transferred cocaine from himself to someone\nelse.\" United States v. Piper, 298 F.3d 47, 59 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                               -11-\n\f               Our resolution of these two arguments is controlled by\n\nthe deferential standard of review.                  Because of the delicacy\n\ninherent in dealing with a holdout juror, and because the cold\n\nrecord is a poor substitute for the district court's on-the-spot\n\nperceptions, we will defer to the court's determination so long as\n\nit is reasonable.3         See McIntosh, 380 F.3d at 555-56.        Here, aware\n\nthat the jury was deadlocked by a single juror, the court was\n\nproperly        cautious    in   its    employment     of     deadlock-breaking\n\nprocedures, see McIntosh, 380 F.3d at 556 (\"[T]he wisest course\n\nwhen       a   [holdout]    juror's    views   are    known    is   to   proceed\n\ncautiously.\"); United States v. Hotz, 620 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1980)\n\n(noting that a court must avoid putting pressure on the jury), and\n\nreasonably concluded that any further instruction, particularly one\n\ndirected solely to the holdout, would have been unduly coercive,\n\nsee Keene, 287 F.3d at 235 (giving a second modified Allen charge\n\nis \"an extraordinary measure . . . that should be shunned absent\n\nspecial circumstances\").\n\n               The argument that the holdout juror should have been\n\nquestioned was not advanced by Brown before the district court.\n\n\n\n       3\n      We reject Brown's argument that a court must accede to a\ndefense request for a second modified Allen charge in a situation\nwhere a jury is deadlocked 11 to 1. Cf. Keene, 287 F.3d at 235\n(although the district court is required to \"consider\" the\nsuggestions of counsel, it is not required to \"employ a particular\nalternative upon demand\"). In our view, the appropriateness of\ndeciding to give such a charge must be assessed on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fIndeed, only the government suggested such questioning.              Defense\n\ncounsel did not concur with the government's request, object when\n\nthe court denied the government's request, or attempt to revive the\n\nrequest prior to the court's declaration of a mistrial.

Brown contends that, although the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the court abused its discretion by declaring a mistrial before it had explored all of the potential alternatives. Accordingly, Brown argues, the government failed to establish the \"manifest necessity\" of declaring a mistrial. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown was charged with a single count of distribution of cocaine. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). The government's case&#8212; which primarily consisted of testimony from David Pease, a confidential informant who testified that Brown had sold him the cocaine, and Daniel Rousseau, a Special Agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who testified that Brown had confessed to giving the cocaine to Pease &#8212; was completed by early afternoon on the trial's first day. On the morning of the second day, the defense called Robert Yankowsky, who testified that it was he, not Brown, who had unwittingly transferred an envelope containing the cocaine to Pease. Closing arguments were presented that same morning. The defense argued that the government's entire case relied on Pease's testimony and that Pease, an admitted drug user who was cooperating with the police in return for leniency in his own criminal proceedings, was not a credible witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving instructions, the jury retired to deliberate early that afternoon. Four hours later, and after the court had already received four notes from the jury concerning testimony and evidence, the court received the following note from the jury: \"We are not close to a decision at this time and have members that need to make calls for child care. We also would like a sense of how long we will be required to deliberate prior to breaking for the evening.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After consulting with counsel, the court instructed the jury to continue deliberations for at least one more hour. An hour later, the jury sent a second note stating that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict and would like to recess for the evening. The court granted the request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deliberations resumed the next morning, the third and final day of the trial. At 10:29 a.m. the court received the first note indicating that the jury might be deadlocked: \"We are 11-1 and unable to move despite hours of work. Where do we go from here?\" The court elicited proposals from counsel. The government requested an <i>Allen</i> charge, <i>see Allen v. United States,</i> 164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896) (upholding the practice of using a supplemental jury instruction to help a deadlocked jury reach unanimity), but defense counsel expressed concern that such an instruction might exert undue pressure on the minority juror. The court agreed and sent a note simply urging the jury to continue deliberations. An hour later, the jury requested and obtained a read-back of Pease's and Yankowsky's testimony. At 2:11 p.m., the jury sent a second note expressing deadlock: \"We have one juror indicating a complete unwillingness, for any reason, to change his vote. Where do we go from here?\" Again the court sought suggestions from counsel, and again the government requested an <i>Allen</i> charge. This time defense counsel concurred with the government's request and the court delivered a modified <i>Allen</i> charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An hour-and-a-half after deliberations had resumed, the court, concerned by the lack of progress and a worsening snow storm, summoned counsel to discuss the next course of action. The government requested that the court do nothing for at least another hour. Defense counsel announced concern about the weather and that the jury had deliberated for a long time. He suggested that the court inquire whether any progress was being made. The court agreed and sent a note to the jury in accord with defense counsel's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 4:04 p.m., the jury responded with a third note expressing impasse: \"The juror who is not in agreement has advised we are not making any headway in convincing him of our position.\" The court turned to counsel, and the government suggested for the first time that a mistrial might be appropriate. Defense counsel argued that for a mistrial to be appropriate \"we need to get the jury to come to a position where it says that it is, in fact, hopeless.\" Agreeing with defense counsel, the court suggested sending a note asking whether there was \"any chance of reaching a verdict in this case?\" Defense counsel endorsed the court's proposed note, and it was sent to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The response, the final note from the jury, read: \"As I do not believe the juror not in agreement is basing his decision on evidence, but on his own `issues,' a verdict is not likely.\" When the court asked defense counsel whether he had any other ideas, counsel requested an instruction specifically aimed at the holdout juror \"requiring him to view the evidence.\" The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I'm not going to do that.

Obviously if it's hopeless, the jury has indicated it is, I guess the final decision is up to you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Alright. Government?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: I think, unless the Court feels that questioning this particular juror would be helpful &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I am concerned about doing that. I think that puts a lot of pressure on one juror to change an opinion that juror may honestly hold, especially when the Judge is squeezing that juror to look at things differently. I know what that jury is thinking, and the Judge's forcing me to change my mind, and I don't think that's right. I won't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: No other suggestion. I would defer to the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I'm going to declare a mistrial on this. I believe that the jury is hopelessly deadlocked here. It's plain as day, as the notes that we've received. Nothing has happened for a considerable period of time in terms of any progress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation is simply that one person has a strongly held opinion, and they have indicated, as in the last note, they are not going to move and there is no need to continue this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I believe that the jury is deadlocked, and I believe it's manifest that a mistrial be declared, and I'm going to declare a mistrial in this case and reschedule this for trial, another trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before declaring a mistrial, the court called the jury back to the courtroom. The court then asked, first of the foreperson, and then of the jury collectively, whether there was a deadlock. When the jurors answered affirmatively, the court declared a mistrial, excused the jury, and set a new trial date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown filed a motion to dismiss shortly thereafter, arguing that the court had abused its discretion by hastily declaring a mistrial, by not engaging in the analysis required for a motion for judgment of acquittal, and by failing \"to inquire of the jurors to determine their positions on guilt or innocence.\" At oral argument on the motion to dismiss, Brown additionally argued that the court could have dismissed the holdout juror for good cause and then entered the verdict of the eleven-member jury. The court denied the motion for substantially the same reasons that it declared the mistrial. This interlocutory appeal followed. <i>See United States v. Keene,</i> 287 F.3d 229, 232 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that an interlocutory appeal is permitted when a defendant claims that further proceedings in the trial court constitute double jeopardy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides that no person shall be \"twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\" for the same offense. Among other things, the double jeopardy clause protects defendants against \"serial attempts by the government to convict a defendant on a single charge.\" <i>Id.</i> Without such protection, a defendant could be subjected to multiple trials, increasing the expense and embarrassment of the defendant, and enhancing the risk of convicting an innocent person. <i>Id.</i> In light of these concerns, \"courts have construed the Double Jeopardy Clause to bar retrial of a defendant after a mistrial ordered over the defendant's objection unless the mistrial was occasioned by manifest necessity.\" <i>United States v. McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d 548, 553 (1st Cir.2004) (footnote omitted). Although the government bears the burden of establishing manifest necessity, \"a hung jury is the paradigmatic example of manifest necessity.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds follows from a district court's declaration of a mistrial, we review the court's manifest necessity determination for an abuse of discretion. <i>Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 233 (citing <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. 497, 514, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978)). The court's findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <i>McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 553-54. While our review of the manifest necessity determination is case-specific and cannot be discharged by resort to a mechanical checklist, <i>see id.</i> at 554, we have identified three factors that are particularly relevant: (1) whether the court provided counsel an opportunity to be heard; (2) whether the court considered alternatives to a mistrial; and (3) whether the court's decision was made after adequate reflection. <i>United States v. Simonetti,</i> 998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir.1993). <i>See also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.3 (\"Before ordering a mistrial, the court must give each defendant and the government an opportunity to comment on the propriety of the order, to state whether that party consents or objects, and to suggest alternatives.\"). The overarching question on appeal is \"whether the district judge's declaration of a mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the circumstances.\" <i>Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 234.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates that the district court was careful to satisfy each of the <i>Simonetti</i> factors before declaring a mistrial. Throughout the course of the jury's deliberations, and following the receipt of each note from the jury, the court sought suggestions from counsel for both sides. Not only did the court consider alternatives to a mistrial, but, with one exception, the court always acceded to defense counsel's requests: first withholding an <i>Allen</i> charge, then delivering it in modified form, and finally sending a pair of notes to the jury to confirm that there was no hope of a verdict. Only defense counsel's suggestion that the holdout juror be singled out for an additional instruction was rejected by the court, and even then the court gave defense counsel an opportunity to suggest an alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also reflects the court's careful consideration of the situation before it declared a mistrial. The court was aware that the jury had deliberated for 13 hours in an uncomplicated case that essentially came down to choosing which of the witnesses to believe. The straightforward nature of the case, and the fact that the jury had communicated its deadlock on five occasions, including once in open court, support the conclusion that the court withheld the declaration of a mistrial until it was evident that a unanimous verdict was not forthcoming. <i>See Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 235 (no abuse of discretion in declaring a mistrial given the length of deliberations in comparison to the brevity of the trial and the simplicity of the issues, the fact that a modified <i>Allen</i> charge had proven unsuccessful, and \"the increasingly adamant manner in which the jurors announced that they were deadlocked\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the <i>Simonetti</i> factors are satisfied, \"we will reverse only if the district court applied an incorrect legal principle or made a meaningful error in judgment\" in deciding to declare a mistrial. <i>McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 554. Brown argues that four errors precipitated the district court's erroneous mistrial declaration: (1) placing the burden to establish the non-existence of manifest necessity on the defendant, (2) failing to examine the evidence under the judgment of acquittal standard, (3) declining the defense request to instruct the holdout juror to consider the evidence, and (4) refusing to voir dire the holdout juror to determine the basis of his position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Brown focuses predominantly on the third and fourth alleged errors. He asserts that, when a court is faced with a choice between a defense request for a second jury instruction or a mistrial, the court must issue the charge in the case of an 11 to 1 jury panel. Brown further argues that a voir dire of the lone holdout juror could have revealed that the juror was not deliberating in good faith. If that were the case, the court could have dismissed the juror for cause and allowed the 11 remaining jurors to return a verdict. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(b)(3); <i>United States v. Barone,</i> 114 F.3d 1284, 1309 (1st Cir.1997) (upholding an 11-juror verdict where one juror had been dismissed for cause). The court should have been aware of this potential solution, Brown argues, because the final jury note suggested that the holdout juror's vote was based on \"his own issues,\" not on the evidence. Thus, Brown concludes, a potentially viable alternative to mistrial existed, and the court abused its discretion by not fully exploring that avenue. <i>See United States v. Toribio-Lugo,</i> 376 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir.2004) (no manifest necessity where there was a viable alternative to mistrial that the district court failed to adequately explore).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of these two arguments is controlled by the deferential standard of review. Because of the delicacy inherent in dealing with a holdout juror, and because the cold record is a poor substitute for the district court's on-the-spot perceptions, we will defer to the court's determination so long as it is reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 555-56. Here, aware that the jury was deadlocked by a single juror, the court was properly cautious in its employment of deadlock-breaking procedures, <i>see McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 556 (\"[T]he wisest course when a [holdout] juror's views are known is to proceed cautiously.\"); <i>United States v. Hotz,</i> 620 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1980) (noting that a court must avoid putting pressure on the jury), and reasonably concluded that any further instruction, particularly one directed solely to the holdout, would have been unduly coercive, <i>see Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 235 (giving a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge is \"an extraordinary measure . . . that should be shunned absent special circumstances\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that the holdout juror should have been questioned was not advanced by Brown before the district court. Indeed, only the government suggested such questioning. Defense counsel did not concur with the government's request, object when the court denied the government's request, or attempt to revive the request prior to the court's declaration of a mistrial. We thus face an arguable forfeiture of that claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 555. Regardless, the claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here again, the court believed that singling out the lone holdout for questioning would have been unduly coercive. This conclusion was not unreasonable, notwithstanding the note from the jury foreperson indicating her suspicion that the holdout juror's position was based on unspecified personal \"issues.\" The district court was concerned that a juror, summoned individually for a colloquy with the judge, might feel pressured to change his position, and was entitled to prioritize the avoidance of coercion over an inquiry into the dynamic giving rise to the foreperson's cryptic note. We cannot say that the court's decision was an abuse of discretion. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 557 (finding that the district court acted within its discretion in \"declining to probe further into [a holdout juror's] views\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's denial of Brown's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> All of the jury's notes were signed by the foreperson</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We may quickly dispose of Brown's first two contentions. As to the first, suffice it to say that permitting defense counsel the opportunity to offer alternatives to a mistrial is not tantamount to placing the burden on defense counsel to prove the absence of manifest necessity. Such consultations are required by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and are intended to \"reduce the possibility of an erroneously ordered mistrial\" to the \"benefit [of] both the prosecution and the defense.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.3 advisory committee's note 1993</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The contention that the court erred by failing to analyze the evidence under the standard for a judgment of acquittal, after defense counsel had suggested dismissal as an alternative to a mistrial, also fails. Although the court disregarded defense counsel's request without explanation, it is readily apparent why: the government had presented ample evidence to support a conviction under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Pease's testimony, if credited, made out the essential elements of the crime: that Brown had \"knowingly and intentionally transferred cocaine from himself to someone else.\" <i>United States v.

The government's case&#8212; which primarily consisted of testimony from David Pease, a confidential informant who testified that Brown had sold him the cocaine, and Daniel Rousseau, a Special Agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who testified that Brown had confessed to giving the cocaine to Pease &#8212; was completed by early afternoon on the trial's first day. On the morning of the second day, the defense called Robert Yankowsky, who testified that it was he, not Brown, who had unwittingly transferred an envelope containing the cocaine to Pease. Closing arguments were presented that same morning. The defense argued that the government's entire case relied on Pease's testimony and that Pease, an admitted drug user who was cooperating with the police in return for leniency in his own criminal proceedings, was not a credible witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving instructions, the jury retired to deliberate early that afternoon. Four hours later, and after the court had already received four notes from the jury concerning testimony and evidence, the court received the following note from the jury: \"We are not close to a decision at this time and have members that need to make calls for child care. We also would like a sense of how long we will be required to deliberate prior to breaking for the evening.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After consulting with counsel, the court instructed the jury to continue deliberations for at least one more hour. An hour later, the jury sent a second note stating that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict and would like to recess for the evening. The court granted the request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deliberations resumed the next morning, the third and final day of the trial. At 10:29 a.m. the court received the first note indicating that the jury might be deadlocked: \"We are 11-1 and unable to move despite hours of work. Where do we go from here?\" The court elicited proposals from counsel. The government requested an <i>Allen</i> charge, <i>see Allen v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94565\"><a href=\"/opinion/94565/allen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 501, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></span> (1896) (upholding the practice of using a supplemental jury instruction to help a deadlocked jury reach unanimity), but defense counsel expressed concern that such an instruction might exert undue pressure on the minority juror. The court agreed and sent a note simply urging the jury to continue deliberations. An hour later, the jury requested and obtained a read-back of Pease's and Yankowsky's testimony. At 2:11 p.m., the jury sent a second note expressing deadlock: \"We have one juror indicating a complete unwillingness, for any reason, to change his vote. Where do we go from here?\" Again the court sought suggestions from counsel, and again the government requested an <i>Allen</i> charge. This time defense counsel concurred with the government's request and the court delivered a modified <i>Allen</i> charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An hour-and-a-half after deliberations had resumed, the court, concerned by the lack of progress and a worsening snow storm, summoned counsel to discuss the next course of action. The government requested that the court do nothing for at least another hour. Defense counsel announced concern about the weather and that the jury had deliberated for a long time. He suggested that the court inquire whether any progress was being made. The court agreed and sent a note to the jury in accord with defense counsel's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 4:04 p.m., the jury responded with a third note expressing impasse: \"The juror who is not in agreement has advised we are not making any headway in convincing him of our position.\" The court turned to counsel, and the government suggested for the first time that a mistrial might be appropriate. Defense counsel argued that for a mistrial to be appropriate \"we need to get the jury to come to a position where it says that it is, in fact, hopeless.\" Agreeing with defense counsel, the court suggested sending a note asking whether there was \"any chance of reaching a verdict in this case?\" Defense counsel endorsed the court's proposed note, and it was sent to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The response, the final note from the jury, read: \"As I do not believe the juror not in agreement is basing his decision on evidence, but on his own `issues,' a verdict is not likely.\" When the court asked defense counsel whether he had any other ideas, counsel requested an instruction specifically aimed at the holdout juror \"requiring him to view the evidence.\" The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I'm not going to do that.

I think that puts a lot of pressure on one juror to change an opinion that juror may honestly hold, especially when the Judge is squeezing that juror to look at things differently. I know what that jury is thinking, and the Judge's forcing me to change my mind, and I don't think that's right.

Nothing has happened for a considerable period of time in terms of any progress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation is simply that one person has a strongly held opinion, and they have indicated, as in the last note, they are not going to move and there is no need to continue this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I believe that the jury is deadlocked, and I believe it's manifest that a mistrial be declared, and I'm going to declare a mistrial in this case and reschedule this for trial, another trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before declaring a mistrial, the court called the jury back to the courtroom. The court then asked, first of the foreperson, and then of the jury collectively, whether there was a deadlock. When the jurors answered affirmatively, the court declared a mistrial, excused the jury, and set a new trial date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown filed a motion to dismiss shortly thereafter, arguing that the court had abused its discretion by hastily declaring a mistrial, by not engaging in the analysis required for a motion for judgment of acquittal, and by failing \"to inquire of the jurors to determine their positions on guilt or innocence.\" At oral argument on the motion to dismiss, Brown additionally argued that the court could have dismissed the holdout juror for good cause and then entered the verdict of the eleven-member jury. The court denied the motion for substantially the same reasons that it declared the mistrial. This interlocutory appeal followed. <i>See United States v. Keene,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199931\"><a href=\"/opinion/199931/united-states-v-keene/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 232 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that an interlocutory appeal is permitted when a defendant claims that further proceedings in the trial court constitute double jeopardy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides that no person shall be \"twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\" for the same offense. Among other things, the double jeopardy clause protects defendants against \"serial attempts by the government to convict a defendant on a single charge.\" <i>Id.</i> Without such protection, a defendant could be subjected to multiple trials, increasing the expense and embarrassment of the defendant, and enhancing the risk of convicting an innocent person. <i>Id.</i> In light of these concerns, \"courts have construed the Double Jeopardy Clause to bar retrial of a defendant after a mistrial ordered over the defendant's objection unless the mistrial was occasioned by manifest necessity.\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span> (1978)). The court's findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <i>McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 553-54. While our review of the manifest necessity determination is case-specific and cannot be discharged by resort to a mechanical checklist, <i>see id.</i> at 554, we have identified three factors that are particularly relevant: (1) whether the court provided counsel an opportunity to be heard; (2) whether the court considered alternatives to a mistrial; and (3) whether the court's decision was made after adequate reflection. <i>United States v. Simonetti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610899\"><a href=\"/opinion/610899/united-states-v-domenic-simonetti/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.1993). <i>See also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.3 (\"Before ordering a mistrial, the court must give each defendant and the government an opportunity to comment on the propriety of the order, to state whether that party consents or objects, and to suggest alternatives.\"). The overarching question on appeal is \"whether the district judge's declaration of a mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the circumstances.\" <i>Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 234.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates that the district court was careful to satisfy each of the <i>Simonetti</i> factors before declaring a mistrial. Throughout the course of the jury's deliberations, and following the receipt of each note from the jury, the court sought suggestions from counsel for both sides. Not only did the court consider alternatives to a mistrial, but, with one exception, the court always acceded to defense counsel's requests: first withholding an <i>Allen</i> charge, then delivering it in modified form, and finally sending a pair of notes to the jury to confirm that there was no hope of a verdict. Only defense counsel's suggestion that the holdout juror be singled out for an additional instruction was rejected by the court, and even then the court gave defense counsel an opportunity to suggest an alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also reflects the court's careful consideration of the situation before it declared a mistrial. The court was aware that the jury had deliberated for 13 hours in an uncomplicated case that essentially came down to choosing which of the witnesses to believe. The straightforward nature of the case, and the fact that the jury had communicated its deadlock on five occasions, including once in open court, support the conclusion that the court withheld the declaration of a mistrial until it was evident that a unanimous verdict was not forthcoming. <i>See Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 235 (no abuse of discretion in declaring a mistrial given the length of deliberations in comparison to the brevity of the trial and the simplicity of the issues, the fact that a modified <i>Allen</i> charge had proven unsuccessful, and \"the increasingly adamant manner in which the jurors announced that they were deadlocked\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the <i>Simonetti</i> factors are satisfied, \"we will reverse only if the district court applied an incorrect legal principle or made a meaningful error in judgment\" in deciding to declare a mistrial. <i>McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 554. Brown argues that four errors precipitated the district court's erroneous mistrial declaration: (1) placing the burden to establish the non-existence of manifest necessity on the defendant, (2) failing to examine the evidence under the judgment of acquittal standard, (3) declining the defense request to instruct the holdout juror to consider the evidence, and (4) refusing to voir dire the holdout juror to determine the basis of his position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Brown focuses predominantly on the third and fourth alleged errors. He asserts that, when a court is faced with a choice between a defense request for a second jury instruction or a mistrial, the court must issue the charge in the case of an 11 to 1 jury panel. Brown further argues that a voir dire of the lone holdout juror could have revealed that the juror was not deliberating in good faith. If that were the case, the court could have dismissed the juror for cause and allowed the 11 remaining jurors to return a verdict. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(b)(3); <i>United States v. Barone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197399\"><a href=\"/opinion/197399/united-states-v-barone/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span>, 1309 (1st Cir.1997) (upholding an 11-juror verdict where one juror had been dismissed for cause). The court should have been aware of this potential solution, Brown argues, because the final jury note suggested that the holdout juror's vote was based on \"his own issues,\" not on the evidence. Thus, Brown concludes, a potentially viable alternative to mistrial existed, and the court abused its discretion by not fully exploring that avenue. <i>See United States v. Toribio-Lugo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786983\"><a href=\"/opinion/786983/united-states-v-jose-toribio-lugo/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2004) (no manifest necessity where there was a viable alternative to mistrial that the district court failed to adequately explore).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of these two arguments is controlled by the deferential standard of review. Because of the delicacy inherent in dealing with a holdout juror, and because the cold record is a poor substitute for the district court's on-the-spot perceptions, we will defer to the court's determination so long as it is reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 555-56. Here, aware that the jury was deadlocked by a single juror, the court was properly cautious in its employment of deadlock-breaking procedures, <i>see McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 556 (\"[T]he wisest course when a [holdout] juror's views are known is to proceed cautiously.\"); <i>United States v. Hotz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377154\"><a href=\"/opinion/377154/united-states-v-helenmary-hotz/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1980) (noting that a court must avoid putting pressure on the jury), and reasonably concluded that any further instruction, particularly one directed solely to the holdout, would have been unduly coercive, <i>see Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 235 (giving a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge is \"an extraordinary measure . . . that should be shunned absent special circumstances\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that the holdout juror should have been questioned was not advanced by Brown before the district court. Indeed, only the government suggested such questioning. Defense counsel did not concur with the government's request, object when the court denied the government's request, or attempt to revive the request prior to the court's declaration of a mistrial. We thus face an arguable forfeiture of that claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See McIntosh,</i> 380 F.3d at 555. Regardless, the claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here again, the court believed that singling out the lone holdout for questioning would have been unduly coercive. This conclusion was not unreasonable, notwithstanding the note from the jury foreperson indicating her suspicion that the holdout juror's position was based on unspecified personal \"issues.\" The district court was concerned that a juror, summoned individually for a colloquy with the judge, might feel pressured to change his position, and was entitled to prioritize the avoidance of coercion over an inquiry into the dynamic giving rise to the foreperson's cryptic note. We cannot say that the court's decision was an abuse of discretion. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 557 (finding that the district court acted within its discretion in \"declining to probe further into [a holdout juror's] views\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's denial of Brown's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> All of the jury's notes were signed by the foreperson</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We may quickly dispose of Brown's first two contentions. As to the first, suffice it to say that permitting defense counsel the opportunity to offer alternatives to a mistrial is not tantamount to placing the burden on defense counsel to prove the absence of manifest necessity. Such consultations are required by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and are intended to \"reduce the possibility of an erroneously ordered mistrial\" to the \"benefit [of] both the prosecution and the defense.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.3 advisory committee's note 1993</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The contention that the court erred by failing to analyze the evidence under the standard for a judgment of acquittal, after defense counsel had suggested dismissal as an alternative to a mistrial, also fails. Although the court disregarded defense counsel's request without explanation, it is readily apparent why: the government had presented ample evidence to support a conviction under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Pease's testimony, if credited, made out the essential elements of the crime: that Brown had \"knowingly and intentionally transferred cocaine from himself to someone else.\" <i>United States v.
