Pro se plaintiff-appellant Frederick H. Movitz\n\n(\"Movitz\") appeals from a district court order denying his request\n\nto amend his complaint to add a conspiracy claim to his wrongful\n\ntermination action against his former employer, defendant-appellee\n\nHome Depot U.S.A., Inc. (\"Home Depot\").               We review the denial of\n\nleave to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion, deferring to\n\nthe district court if any adequate reason for the denial is\n\napparent from the record.          Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d\n\n251,       253    (1st   Cir.   1994).    We   have   reviewed   the   parties'\n\nsubmissions and the record on appeal.                 We affirm the district\n\ncourt's order because Movitz's requested amendment would have been\n\nfutile.          We briefly explain.1\n\n       Movitz argues that he should have been permitted to add a\n\n\"count of conspiracy to commit fraud for writing false statements.\"\n\nUnder New Hampshire law, a civil conspiracy consists of: (1) two or\n\nmore persons; (2) an unlawful object to be accomplished; (3) an\n\nagreement on the object or course of action; (4) one or more\n\nunlawful overt acts; and (5) damages proximately resulting from the\n\nacts.      University Sys. of N.H. v. United States Gypsum Co., 756 F.\n\nSupp. 640, 652 (D.N.H. 1991), citing Jay Edwards, Inc. v. Baker,\n\n\n       1\n          We do not discuss Home Depot's separate contention that\nMovitz's appeal fails because of his brief's flagrant failure to\ncomply with the procedural requirements of the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure.     A pro se party is not insulated from\ncomplying with those rules. Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 890\n(1st Cir. 1997). Because Movitz's appeal lacks substantive merit,\nwe elect to proceed on that basis.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f130 N.H. 41, 47, 534 A.2d 706, 709 (1987).            New Hampshire, however,\n\ndoes not recognize a civil action based on conspiracy alone.                    Id.\n\nRather,   for   a    civil    conspiracy      to   exist,   there   must   be   an\n\nunderlying tort which the alleged conspirators agreed to commit.\n\nId. Thus, if the underlying tort claim fails, the action for civil\n\nconspiracy also fails.        See id.\n\n     Movitz asserts that the object of the alleged conspiracy was\n\nto commit the tort of fraud.         In order to prove fraud, a plaintiff\n\nmust show that: (1) the defendant misrepresented a material fact to\n\nthe plaintiff, knowing it to be false; (2) the defendant intended\n\nthat the plaintiff act on it; and (3) the plaintiff, without\n\nknowledge    of      its     falsity,     detrimentally       relied      on    the\n\nrepresentation.       Alexander v. Fujitsu Bus. Communication Sys.,\n\nInc., 818 F. Supp. 462, 467 (D.N.H. 1993), citing Proctor v. Bank\n\nof N.H., 123 N.H. 395, 399, 464 A.2d 263, 265 (1983).\n\n     Movitz's claim is based on an allegedly false statement\n\nsubmitted to Home Depot by Troy Patterson (\"Patterson\"), a former\n\nco-worker.      Movitz     alleges   that     Patterson     admitted     that   his\n\nstatement to Home Depot was false, that he had been asked by an\n\nassistant    store    manager,    Chris    Croce    (\"Croce\"),      to   make   the\n\nstatement, and that Scott Neal, the assistant store manager who\n\nterminated Movitz, was \"aware of the false statement.\"                     Movitz\n\nasserts that Home Depot \"store managers have had Mr. Patterson\n\nwrite false statements and offered him higher positions in the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fcompany for doing so.\" Movitz argues that, \"[i]f Mr. Patterson did\n\nnot come    forward   the   statements   would   have   been   against   the\n\nplaintiff in his personnel file at Home Depot.\"\n\n       Movitz's allegations fail to establish the elements of fraud\n\nagainst the defendant, Home Depot.        Movitz does not allege that\n\nanyone at Home Depot misrepresented any facts to him.            Rather, he\n\nasserts that Patterson, at the instance of Croce, the assistant\n\nstore manager, misrepresented facts to Home Depot.             Also, Movitz\n\ndoes not allege that any of the purported misrepresentations were\n\nmade with the intent that he rely on them, or that he actually\n\nrelied on them.    Indeed, Movitz admits that he was not even aware\n\nof Patterson's \"false statement\" until discovery in this case.\n\nFurther, Movitz does not allege that he suffered any actual damages\n\nas a result of the alleged conspiracy to make these purported\n\nmisrepresentations, or from the misrepresentations themselves.\n\nAlthough Movitz asserts that Patterson's November 2, 2001 statement\n\nwould have been used against him in his personnel file at Home\n\nDepot, Movitz alleged that he was terminated on November 2, 2001,\n\nand at no point contends that Home Depot waited until after it\n\nreviewed Patterson's statement to make the decision to terminate\n\nhim.    Further, at no point does Movitz contend that Home Depot\n\nrelied on Patterson's statement, or any other statement, in making\n\nany decision regarding his employment.       Thus, to the extent Movitz\n\nalleges fraud as having been the object of the conspiracy, he has\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffailed to state facts constituting the tort of fraud, and he has\n\nalso failed to indicate that any damages resulted either from the\n\npurported conspiracy or the alleged fraud.   Because his claim of\n\nfraud fails, his claim of conspiracy to commit fraud also fails.\n\nSee University Sys. of N.H., 756 F. Supp. at 652.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is summarily affirmed. See\n\n1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
